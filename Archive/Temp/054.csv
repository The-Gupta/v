Acquired non-amyloid related factor X deficiency (DNAA-FX) has been exceptionally reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: We report the first case of acquired, non-amyloid related factor X deficiency associated with atypical chronic lymphoid leukemia in a 66-year-old patient with spontaneous hematomas. After therapeutic failure with polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulins, specific lymphoid malignancy treatment allowed symptoms and coagulation disorder resolution. CONCLUSION: DNAA-FX should be considered in case of bleeding events or coagulation disorders during low-grade hematological malignancies. Its occurrence can be considered as a treatment indication to prevent potentially fatal bleeding complications.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Societe Nationale Francaise de Medecine Interne (SNFMI).', 'Published by Elsevier SAS.

Existing methods (e.g., intent-to-treat and per-protocol) are known to be biased. We proposed two new estimators to address these analytical challenges and evaluated their performance via a comprehensive simulation study. The new estimators were constructed by combining an enhanced rank-preserving structural failure time model and the inverse probability censoring weighting approach. In the simulation study, we assessed and compared the performance of the two new estimators with four estimators from existing methods. The simulation results show that the new estimators have much better performance in almost all considered settings compared with the existing estimators.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ATLL patients (n = 17) and HC subjects (as the control group, n = 17) were evaluated using real-time PCR to determine the levels of HTLV-1 proviral load and mRNA expression of ICAM, VCAM-1, and iNOS. ICAM-1 was significantly lower in ATLL patients than in control subjects. Although the expression of VCAM-1 was higher in ATLL individuals, there was no significant difference between the studied groups. In addition, no iNOS expression was found in ATLL patients, when compared to the HCs subjects, while ATLL patients demonstrated a higher level of proviral load when compared to the control group. Considering the importance of ICAM-1 in facilitating immune recognition of infected cells, it is posited that reduction of ICAM-1 expression is a unique strategy for circumventing appropriate immune responses that are mediated by different accessory proteins. Additionally, as the viral regulatory protein Tax and the NF-kappaB pathway play pivotal roles in expression of iNOS, lack of the latter in ATLL patients may be related to the level of Tax expression, disruption of the NF-kappaB pathway, or the occurrence of epigenetical mechanisms in the human iNOS promoter. Further studies are recommended to gain a better understanding of the interaction between host and viral factors in HTLV-1 pathogenesis and to identify a possible therapeutic target for ATLL.",,"['Jafarian, Mahdokht', 'Mozhgani, Sayed-Hamidreza', 'Patrad, Elham', 'Vaziri, Hamidreza', 'Rezaee, Seyed Abdolrahim', 'Akbarin, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Norouzi, Mehdi']","['Jafarian M', 'Mozhgani SH', 'Patrad E', 'Vaziri H', 'Rezaee SA', 'Akbarin MM', 'Norouzi M']","['Department of Genetics, University of Guilan, University Campus 2, Rasht, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, University of Guilan, Rasht, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Virology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. mnorouzi@tums.ac.ir.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170121,Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/01/23 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2017/01/23 06:00'],"['2016/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00705-016-3213-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00705-016-3213-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 2017 Apr;162(4):1009-1015. doi: 10.1007/s00705-016-3213-0.

To investigate the differences in metabolic pathways among patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and differential survival outcomes, we systematically conducted microarray data analysis of the metabolic gene expression profiles from 384 patients available from the Gene Expression Omnibus and Cancer Genome Atlas databases. Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the metabolic differences between low-risk and high-risk patients mainly existed in two pathways: biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and oxidative phosphorylation. Using the gene-pathway bipartite network, 62 metabolic genes were identified from 272 DEGs involved in 88 metabolic pathways. Based on the expression patterns of the 62 genes, patients with shorter overall survival (OS) durations in the training set (hazard ratio (HR)=1.58, p=0.038) and in two test sets (HR=1.69 and 1.56 and p=0.089 and 0.029, respectively) were well discriminated by hierarchical clustering analysis. Notably, the expression profiles of ALAS2, BCAT1, BLVRB, and HK3 showed distinct differences between the low-risk and high-risk patients. In addition, models for predicting the OS outcome of AML from the 62 gene signatures achieved improved performance compared with previous studies.

Previous experimental studies have successfully identified two important mutations (R487K and E571K) conferring 100 and 25 fold resistance to Amsacrine respectively. Although the reduction of the cleavage ligand-DNA-protein ternary complex has been well thought as the major cause of drug resistance, the detailed energetic, structural and dynamic mechanisms remain to be elusive. In this study, we constructed human topoisomerase II alpha (hTop2alpha) homology model docked with Amsacrine based on crystal structure of human Top2beta in complex with etoposide. This wild type complex was used to build the ternary complex with R487K and E571K mutants. Three 500ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed on complex systems of wild type and two mutants. The detailed energetic, structural and dynamic analysis were performed on the simulation data. Our binding data indicated a significant impairment of Amsacrine binding energy in the two mutants compared with the wild type. The order of weakening (R487K>E571K) was in agreement with the order of experimental drug resistance fold (R489K>E571K). Our binding energy decomposition further indicated that weakening of the ligand-protein interaction rather than the ligand-DNA interaction was the major contributor of the binding energy difference between R487K and E571K. In addition, key residues contributing to the binding energy (DeltaG) or the decrease of the binding energy (DeltaDeltaG) were identified through the energy decomposition analysis. The change in ligand binding pose, dynamics of protein, DNA and ligand upon the mutations were thoroughly analyzed and discussed. Deciphering the molecular basis of drug resistance is crucial to overcome drug resistance using rational drug design.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: 28 ALL patients (mean age: 40.71+/-8.58years, years since diagnosis: 7-38) and 20 age-matched control subjects (mean age: 42.95+/-6.39years) selected in this study with 3D T1 and diffusion tensor imaging acquired on a 3.0T Siemens MRI scanner. The ALL group had a history of chemotherapy treatment and off-therapy at least for 3years was enrolled. VBM and TBSS analysis were performed to detect regional grey matter (GM) volume changes and white matter (WM) alternation measured by fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). RESULTS: VBM revealed decreased GM volume in ALL patients in lingual gyrus, left occipital middle gyrus, left temporal middle gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, left parietal inferior gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left frontal superior gyrus and increased GM volume in right caudate and frontal lobe. WM integrity changes measured by TBSS which showed decreased FA and AD in several WM regions, and increased MD and RD in ALL patients with chemotherapy treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ALL patients had smaller GM volume and WM integrity changes in several regions.

DNA damage caused by antitumor therapies evokes different repair mechanisms responses, such as Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), whose components are being studied as prognosis biomarkers and target therapies. However, few reports have addressed DNA damages in pediatric Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL). Hence, we conducted an observational follow-up study with pediatric patients to assess DNA damage (by Comet Assay) and gene expression from NER pathway during chemotherapy induction. Bone marrow samples from diagnosis, 15th(D15) and 35th (D35) days of the treatment were collected from 28 patients with ALL. There was no increase in damage index. However, there was a reduction of cells with low damages on D35 compared with diagnosis. NER pathway expression remained the same, however, in a single patient, a significant decrease was observed, maybe due to silencing or downregulation of repair pathways. DNA damage levels and repair may influence the clinical outcome, being involved in drug resistance and risk of relapse.

In this study, combing Raman spectroscopic data and principle component analysis (PCA), the biochemical changes of MSCs or Human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cells during their co-culture were presented. The obtained results showed that some main Raman peaks of HL60 assigned to nucleic acids or proteins were greatly higher in intensity in the late stage of co-culture than those in the early stage of co-culture while they were still lower relative to the control group, implicating that the effect of MSCs inhibiting HL60 proliferation appeared in the early stage but gradually lost the inhibiting ability in the late stage of co-culture. Moreover, some other peaks of HL60 assigned to proteins were decreased in intensity in the early stage of co-culture relative to the control group but rebounded to the level similar to the control group in the late stage, showing that the content and structure changes of these proteins might be generated in the early stage but returned to the original state in the late stage of co-culture. As a result, in the early stage of MSCs-HL60 co-culture, along with the level of Akt phosphorylation of HL60 was lowered relative to its control group, the proliferation rate of HL60 cells was decreased. And in the late stage of co-culture, along with the level of Akt phosphorylation was rebounded, the reverse transfer of Raman peaks within 875-880cm(-1) appeared, thus MSCs lost the ability to inhibit HL60 growth and HL60 proliferation was increased. In addition, it was observed that the peak at 811cm(-1), which is a marker of RNA, was higher in intensity in the late stage than that in the control group, indicating that MSCs might be differentiated into myofibroblast-like MSCs. In addition, PCA results also exhibited that the physiological state of MSCs can be separated by the first two main components of PC1 or PC2 easily, and the effect of MSCs inhibiting HL60 growth was greatly associated with the time of co-culture.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Clinical characteristics and microbiology of 2083 patients with haematological malignancy who were treated for BSI from 2008 to 2013 at a medical centre in Taiwan were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphoma (38.1%) was the most common, followed by acute myeloid leukaemia (30.9%). Of the 2090 non-duplicate BSI isolates, 1310 (62.7%) were recovered from patients with neutropenia. Of the Gram-negatives (53.7%), Escherichia coli was predominant (13.8%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.5%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (ACB) complex (5.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%). Of the Gram-positives (40.2%), coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common (20.5%), followed by Enterococcus faecium (5.6%). Candida tropicalis (2.0%) was the most commonly encountered yeast (5.0%). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was identified in 21.8% of ACB complex isolates. Among the 57 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 24 (42.1%) were resistant to oxacillin (MRSA), and among the 118 E. faecium isolates, 55 (46.6%) were resistant to vancomycin (VRE). The overall 14-day mortality rate was 12.9% (n = 269). There was no significant difference in 14-day mortality among patients with (13.4%) and without (11.9%) neutropenia (P = 0.315). Multivariate analysis revealed that age >/=60 years, prior allogeneic transplantation, BSI due to VRE (E. faecium) and shock were independent predictors of 14-day mortality. Gram-negative organisms continued to be the most common cause of BSI in patients with haematological malignancies during the period 2008-2013. There was a significant increase in the prevalence of VRE (E. faecium) and MDR-ACB complex isolates.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

Most importantly, novel chemotherapy and targeted strategies have led to improved outcomes in selected genetic subsets. AML is a remarkably heterogeneous disease, and individualized therapies for disease-specific characteristics (considering patients' age, cytogenetics, and mutations) could yield better outcomes. Compared with the historical 5-to 10-year survival rate of 10%, the survival of patients who undergo modern treatment approaches reaches up to 40-50%, and for specific subsets, the improvements are even more dramatic; for example, in acute promyelocytic leukemia, the use of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide improved survival from 30 to 40% up to 80 to 90%. Similar progress has been documented in core-binding-factor-AML, with an increase in survival from 30% to 80% upon the use of high-dose cytarabine/fludarabine/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor combination regimens. AML treatment was also recently influenced by the discovery of the superiority of regimens with higher dose Ara-C and nucleoside analogues compared with the ""7+3""regimen, with about a 20% improvement in overall survival. Despite these significant differences, most centers continue to use the ""7+3"" regimen, and greater awareness will improve the outcome. The discovery of targetable molecular abnormalities and recent studies of targeted therapies (gemtuzumab ozagomycin, FLT3 inhibitors, isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and epigenetic therapies), future use of checkpoint inhibitors and other immune therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells, and maintenance strategies based on the minimal residual disease evaluation represent novel, exciting clinical leads aimed to improve AML outcomes in the near future.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Children with AML harboring this aberration have a poor outcome, regardless of the FAB subtype. This fusion gene drives a peculiar expression pattern and leads to overexpression of some of Hedgehog-related genes. GLI-similar protein 2 (GLIS2) is closely related to the GLI family, the final effectors of classic Hedgehog pathway. These observations lend compelling support to the application of GLI inhibitors in the treatment of AML with the aberration CBFA2T3-GLIS2. GANT61 is, nowadays, the most potent inhibitor of GLI family proteins. METHODS: We exposed to GANT61 AML cell lines and primary cells positive and negative for CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and analyzed the effect on cellular viability, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle, and expression profile. RESULTS: As compared to AML cells without GLIS2 fusion, GANT61 exposure resulted in higher sensitivity of both cell lines and primary AML cells carrying CBFA2T3-GLIS2 to undergo apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest. Remarkably, gene expression studies demonstrated downregulation of GLIS2-specific signature genes in both treated cell lines and primary cells, in comparison with untreated cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct regulation by GLIS2 chimeric protein of DNMT1 and DNMT3B, two genes implicated in important epigenetic functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the GLI inhibitor GANT61 may be used to specifically target the CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion gene in pediatric AML.",,"['Masetti, Riccardo', 'Bertuccio, Salvatore Nicola', 'Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Indio, Valentina', 'De Luca, Matilde', 'Bandini, Jessica', 'Serravalle, Salvatore', 'Franzoni, Monica', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Martelli, Alberto Maria', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pession, Andrea']","['Masetti R', 'Bertuccio SN', 'Astolfi A', 'Chiarini F', 'Lonetti A', 'Indio V', 'De Luca M', 'Bandini J', 'Serravalle S', 'Franzoni M', 'Pigazzi M', 'Martelli AM', 'Basso G', 'Locatelli F', 'Pession A']","['Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 11, 40137, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 11, 40137, Bologna, Italy. salvatore.bertuccio@studio.unibo.it.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 11, 40137, Bologna, Italy.', '""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council-IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', '""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 11, 40137, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 11, 40137, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 11, 40137, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, Hematology-Oncology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, Hematology-Oncology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, IRCCS Ospedale Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, ""Lalla Seragnoli"", Hematology-Oncology Unit, Sant\'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Via Massarenti 11, 40137, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170121,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Child', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Hedgehog Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*drug effects/genetics', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CBFA2T3-GLIS2', '*GANT61', '*Hedgehog pathway']",2017/01/23 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2017/01/23 06:00'],"['2016/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-017-0396-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-017-0396-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2017 Jan 21;10(1):26. doi: 10.1186/s13045-017-0396-0.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5428-6716'],"['0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (GANT 61)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (GLIS2 protein, human)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)']",,,,PMC5251306,,,,,,,,,

At the time of Marketing Authorisation (MA) these criteria are reassessed to ensure they are still met. The COMP has noted discordance between the prevalence of certain haematological malignancies at the time of Orphan Designation and at the time of Marketing Authorisation. Consequently, we conducted a retrospective assessment of Chronic Lymphocytic Lymphoma and Multiple Myeloma/Plasma cell Myeloma as well as several other haematological rare aetiologies frequently subject of orphan designation. These were: Diffuse large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Follicular Lymphoma (FL), Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) and Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML). The review used submissions as well as recent publications and results from external and EMA databases. As a first step in the analysis, an increase over time in the number of people affected was evident for four conditions in the COMP designation documents, whereas for DLBCL, FL, CTCL and MCL there had been no significant change, since the introduction of the Regulation in 2000. Specifically, the prevalence estimates increased from 1.2 to 3.6 per 10,000 for multiple myeloma, from 0.4 to 1.7 in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and from 2.7 to 4.85 for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic leukaemia and 1 to 2 in 10,000 for chronic myeloid leukaemia. The reasons for the changes in the prevalence of these four haematological conditions over the last 15 years were not assessed but recent publications have alluded to better outcomes due to new treatments being made available. In addition, many orphan diseases have a median age of onset over 60 years so that also the aging of the population may be a relevant contributing factor.",,"['Polsinelli, Benedetta', 'Tsigkos, Stelios', 'Naumann-Winter, Frauke', 'Mariz, Segundo', 'Sepodes, Bruno']","['Polsinelli B', 'Tsigkos S', 'Naumann-Winter F', 'Mariz S', 'Sepodes B']","['European Medicines Agency, 30 Churchill Place Canary Wharf, London, E14 5EU, UK.', 'European Medicines Agency, 30 Churchill Place Canary Wharf, London, E14 5EU, UK.', 'Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte, Kurt-Georg-Kiesinger-Allee 3, 53175, Bonn, Germany.', 'European Medicines Agency, 30 Churchill Place Canary Wharf, London, E14 5EU, UK.', 'Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmacia, Avenida Professor Gama Pinto, 1649-003, Lisboa, Portugal. bsepodes@ff.ulisboa.pt.']",['eng'],['Letter'],,20170121,England,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,101266602,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*European Union', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', '*Legislation, Drug', 'Orphan Drug Production/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Committee for orphan medicinal products', '*European orphan regulation', '*Haematological malignancies', '*Market exclusivity', '*Orphan designation', '*Prevalence']",2017/01/23 06:00,2017/12/02 06:00,['2017/01/23 06:00'],"['2016/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13023-017-0567-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13023-017-0567-7 [pii]']",epublish,Orphanet J Rare Dis. 2017 Jan 21;12(1):17. doi: 10.1186/s13023-017-0567-7.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2761-0955'],['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,PMC5251220,,,,,,,,,

However, this entity may be under-diagnosed because the two lymphomas are very similar in morphology and immunophenotype. Previous cases were mostly diagnosed with immunohistochemistry, but flow cytometry may play an important role in the detection of two tumors in the same specimen, thus achieving an accurate diagnosis. By definition, a composite lymphoma is two demarcated lymphomas occurring at the same anatomic site. Therefore, immunohistochemistry is still needed to identify the topographic relation of these two tumors. Our reported case illustrates the pitfalls in the diagnostic process and we recommend two standard panels with new markers for an accurate diagnosis of this composite lymphoma. METHOD: FACSCanto II is used with antibodies, including CD5, CD10, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD43, CD79b, CD200, kappa, and lambda. Immunohistochemical stains include PAX-5/CD5 dual stain, Cyclin D1, SOX11, and LEF-1. RESULTS: CLL/SLL is positive for CD5, CD19, CD23, CD43, and CD200, with dim expression of CD20, CD22, CD79b, and kappa. MCL is positive for CD5, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79b, kappa, and negative for CD23, CD43, and CD200. Immunohistochemical stains show that PAX-5/CD5 stains the entire tumor population. Cyclin D1 and SOX11 only stain the central portion that represents MCL and LEF-1 stains the periphery that represents CLL/SLL. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the use of the above panels for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, respectively. LEF-1 is specific for CLL/SLL; and CD200 is helpful to distinguish CLL/SLL from MCL.

An atom-based 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model showed good correlative and satisfactory predictive abilities (training set [Formula: see text]; test set: [Formula: see text]; whole data set: stability [Formula: see text]). Virtual screening experiments revealed that selective GSK-3 inhibitors are ranked preferentially by Hypo-1, but fail to retrieve nonselective compounds. The pharmacophore and 3D QSAR models can provide assistance to design novel, potential GSK-3 inhibitors with high potency and selectivity pattern, with potential application for the treatment of GSK-3-driven diseases. A class of purine nucleoside antileukemic drugs was identified as potential inhibitor of GSK-3, suggesting the reassessment of the target range of these drugs.",,"['Crisan, Luminita', 'Avram, Sorin', 'Pacureanu, Liliana']","['Crisan L', 'Avram S', 'Pacureanu L']","['Department of Computational Chemistry, The Institute of Chemistry Timisoara of Romanian Academy, 24 Mihai Viteazul Avenue, 300223, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Computational Chemistry, The Institute of Chemistry Timisoara of Romanian Academy, 24 Mihai Viteazul Avenue, 300223, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Computational Chemistry, The Institute of Chemistry Timisoara of Romanian Academy, 24 Mihai Viteazul Avenue, 300223, Timisoara, Romania. pacureanu@acad-icht.tm.edu.ro.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170121,Netherlands,Mol Divers,Molecular diversity,9516534,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', '*Drug Repositioning', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia/drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Atom-based 3D QSAR', 'Benchmarking validation data set', 'GSK-3 inhibitors', 'Pharmacophore', 'Repurposing']",2017/01/22 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/01/22 06:00'],"['2016/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11030-016-9724-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11030-016-9724-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Divers. 2017 May;21(2):385-405. doi: 10.1007/s11030-016-9724-5.

Epidemiological studies have shown that long term exposure to arsenic can increase the risk of cancers of lung, skin or bladder in man, which is probably associated with the arsenic metabolism. In fact, the enzymatic conversion of inorganic arsenic by Arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase (AS3MT) to mono- and dimethylated arsenic species has long been considered as a major route for detoxification. However, several studies have also indicated that biomethylation of inorganic arsenic, particularly the production of trivalent methylated metabolites, is a process that activates arsenic as a toxin and a carcinogen. On the other hand, arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has recently been recognized as one of the most effective drugs for the treatment of APL. However, elaboration of the cytotoxic mechanisms of arsenic and its methylated metabolites in eradicating cancer is sorely lacking. To provide a deeper understanding of the toxicity and carcinogenicity along with them use of arsenic in chemotherapy, caution is required considering the poor understanding of its various mechanisms of exerting toxicity.

However, the prognostic significance of CD135 expression in AML remains unclear. We therefore evaluated the association between FLT3 surface expression and disease characteristics and outcomes in pediatric patients with AML.Experimental Design: We analyzed FLT3 receptor expression on AML blasts by multi-dimensional flow cytometry and its association with disease characteristics, clinical outcomes, and FLT3 transcript level in 367 children with AML treated on the Children's Oncology Group trial AAML0531.Results: There was high variability in blast CD135 cell-surface expression across specimens. CD135 expression measured by flow cytometry was not correlated with FLT3 transcript expression determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Overall, CD135 expression was not significantly different for patients with FLT3/WT, FLT3/ITD, or FLT3/ALM (P = 0.25). High cell-surface CD135 expression was associated with FAB M5 subtype (P < 0.001), KMT2A rearrangements (P = 0.009), and inversely associated with inv(16)/t(16;16) (P < 0.001). Complete remission rate, overall survival, disease-free survival, and relapse rates were not significantly different between patients with low and high CD135 expression.Conclusions: FLT3 cell-surface expression did not vary by FLT3 mutational status, but high FLT3 expression was strongly associated with KMT2A rearrangements. Our study found that there was no prognostic significance of FLT3 cell surface expression in pediatric AML. Clin Cancer Res; 23(14); 3649-56.

Thus, targeting metabolic abnormalities in leukemia cells located in the bone marrow is a novel therapeutic approach. In this study, we investigated the metabolic role of bone marrow adipocytes in supporting the growth of leukemic blasts. Prevention of nutrient starvation-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells by bone marrow adipocytes, as well as the metabolic and molecular mechanisms involved in this process, was investigated using various analytic techniques. In acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) cells, the prevention of spontaneous apoptosis by bone marrow adipocytes was associated with an increase in fatty acid beta-oxidation (FAO) along with the upregulation of PPARgamma, FABP4, CD36, and BCL2 genes. In AMoL cells, bone marrow adipocyte coculture increased adiponectin receptor gene expression and its downstream target stress response kinase AMPK, p38 MAPK with autophagy activation, and upregulated antiapoptotic chaperone HSPs. Inhibition of FAO disrupted metabolic homeostasis, increased reactive oxygen species production, and induced the integrated stress response mediator ATF4 and apoptosis in AMoL cells cocultured with bone marrow adipocytes. Our results suggest that bone marrow adipocytes support AMoL cell survival by regulating their metabolic energy balance and that the disruption of FAO in bone marrow adipocytes may be an alternative, novel therapeutic strategy for AMoL therapy.

Here, we show that constitutive signaling driven by mutated FLT3 and JAK2 confers interchromosomal homologous recombination (iHR), a precedent for CN-LOH. Using a targeted recombination assay, we determined significant iHR activity in internal tandem duplication FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) and JAK2V617F-mutated cells. Sister chromatid exchanges, a surrogate measure of iHR, was significantly elevated in primary FLT3-ITD normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (NK-AML) compared with wild-type FLT3 NK-AML. HR was harmonized to S phase of the cell cycle to repair broken chromatids and prevent iHR. Increased HR activity in G0 arrested primary FLT3-ITD NK-AML in contrast to wild-type FLT3 NK-AML. Cells expressing mutated FLT3-ITD demonstrated a relative increase in mutation frequency as detected by thymidine kinase (TK) gene mutation assay. Moreover, resistance was associated with CN-LOH at the TK locus. Treatment of FLT3-ITD- and JAK2V617F-mutant cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine diminished reactive oxygen species (ROS), restoring iHR and HR levels. Our findings show that mutated FLT3-ITD and JAK2 augment ROS production and HR, shifting the cellular milieu toward illegitimate recombination events such as iHR and CN-LOH. Therapeutic reduction of ROS may thus prevent leukemic progression and relapse in myeloid malignancies. Cancer Res; 77(7); 1697-708.

However, a lack of information about the individual dynamics of marker-disease association hampers interpretation. In this study, we identified 170 individuals who had donated two prediagnostic blood samples before B-cell lymphoma diagnosis, along with 170 matched cancer-free controls from the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. Lymphoma risk associations were investigated by subtype and marker levels measured at baseline, at the time of the repeated sample, and with the rate of change in the marker level. Notably, we observed strong associations between CXCL13, sCD23, sCD27, and sCD30 and lymphoma risk in blood samples collected 15 to 25 years before diagnosis. B-cell activation marker levels increased among future lymphoma cases over time, while remaining stable among controls. Associations between slope and risk were strongest for indolent lymphoma subtypes. We noted a marked association of sCD23 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ORSlope = 28, Ptrend = 7.279 x 10(-10)). Among aggressive lymphomas, the association between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma risk and slope was restricted to CXCL13. B-cell activation seemed to play a role in B-cell lymphoma development at early stages across different subtypes. Furthermore, B-cell activation presented differential trajectories in future lymphoma patients, mainly driven by indolent subtypes. Our results suggest a utility of these markers in predicting the presence of early occult disease and/or the screening and monitoring of indolent lymphoma in individual patients.

Early recognition of relapse is critical for prompt intervention. In this study, we systematically reviewed morphologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic findings in paired diagnostic and relapsed APL cases and describe and quantify the changes in blast morphology at relapse. Methods: By electronic database search, we identified eight paired diagnostic and relapsed APL cases for which peripheral blood or bone marrow smears were available for review. For two cases, diagnostic material was available for relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation. Results: Neoplastic hypergranular or microgranular promyelocytes with indented or bivalve nuclei predominated at diagnosis in all patients. Most patients had undifferentiated blasts at relapse and/or hypergranular blast equivalents with round to oval nuclei. Classic acute promyelocytic leukemia cells with bivalve nuclei and bundles of cytoplasmic Auer rods were easily identifiable in fewer than half of cases at diagnosis and rare to absent in all relapsed cases. Conclusions: Morphologic features of relapsed APL overlap with other types of acute myeloid leukemia, creating diagnostic challenges, especially if no history is available when relapsing patients seek treatment for care.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Methods: Of 140 patients, evidence of residual leukemia (RL) was identified in 38 (27%) of pre-HCT samples, as defined by 5% or more aspirate blasts, increased blood blasts, clustered or necrotic blasts on biopsy specimens, and/or leukemia-associated karyotypic abnormalities. Results: Morphologic or karyotypic evidence of RL was significantly associated with shorter leukemia-free survival (LFS) compared with cases without identifiable RL (median, 7.1 vs 28.3 months; P < .0001). Upon multivariable analysis, RL, prior relapse, age, high-risk karyotype, and alternate donor source were each independently associated with shorter LFS. RL in pre-HCT samples was more strongly associated with shorter LFS in patients with intermediate or favorable-risk AML karyotype ( P = .001) than secondary or adverse karyotype-risk AML ( P = .04). Conclusions: Rigorous morphologic and karyotypic evaluation of pretransplant marrows is practical and important for posttransplant prognosis.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Therefore, targeting cancer metabolism, including lipid synthesis, has attracted much interest in recent years. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) plays a key role in the initial and rate-limiting step of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis, and inhibiting SPT activity prevents the proliferation of certain cancer cells. Here, we identified a novel and orally available SPT inhibitor, compound-2. Compound-2 showed an anti-proliferative effect in several cancer cell models, reducing the levels of the sphingolipids ceramide and sphingomyelin. In the presence of compound-2, exogenously added S1P partially compensated the intracellular sphingolipid levels through the salvage pathway by partially rescuing compound-2-induced cytotoxicity. This suggested that the mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effect of compound-2 involved the reduction of sphingolipid levels. Indeed, compound-2 promoted multinuclear formation with reduced endogenous sphingomyelin levels specifically in a compound-2-sensitive cell line, indicating that the effect was induced by sphingolipid reduction. Furthermore, compound-2 showed potent antitumor activity without causing significant body weight loss in the PL-21 acute myeloid leukemia mouse xenograft model. Therefore, SPT may be an attractive therapeutic anti-cancer drug target for which compound-2 may be a promising new drug.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE: This population based study examined whether prenatal and early life (<1year of age) exposures to ambient air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters </=2.5mum (PM2.5), were associated with selected common early childhood cancers in Canada. METHODS: 2,350,898 singleton live births occurring between 1988 and 2012 were identified in the province of Ontario, Canada. We assigned temporally varying satellite-derived estimates of PM2.5 and land-use regression model estimates of NO2 to maternal residences during pregnancy. Incident cases of 13 subtypes of pediatric cancers among children up to age 6 until 2013 were ascertained through administrative health data linkages. Associations of trimester-specific, overall pregnancy and first year of life exposures were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 2044 childhood cancers were identified. Exposure to PM2.5, per interquartile range increase, over the entire pregnancy, and during the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of astrocytoma (hazard ratio (HR) per 3.9mug/m3=1.38 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.88) and, HR per 4.0mug/m(3)=1.40 (95% CI: 1.05-1.86), respectively). We also found a positive association between first trimester NO2 and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (HR=1.20 (95% CI: 1.02-1.41) per IQR (13.3ppb)). CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study in the largest province of Canada, results suggest an association between exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester and an increased risk of astrocytoma and ALL. Further studies are required to replicate the findings of this study with adjustment for important individual-level confounders.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2017. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Although signaling events downstream of FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase have been studied in depth, molecular mechanisms of how FLT3 expression is regulated at the post-transcriptional level in particular remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the roles of an RNA binding protein MSI2 as a regulator of FLT3 expression. MSI2 and FLT3 are significantly co-regulated in human AML and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (BC-CML). Genetic loss of MSI2 leads to down-regulation of the FLT3 receptor in both AML and BC-CML cells and concomitant impairment of clonogenic growth potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MSI2 protein is physically bound to FLT3 mRNA transcripts, suggesting post-transcriptional control of FLT3 expression. Collectively, these results reveal a novel mode of FLT3 regulation essential for leukemia growth, which may aid in designing a targeted therapy to treat human myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study explored the novel biological function of IL-10 in regulation of expression of adhesion molecules in AML cells and found that exposing AML cells to IL-10 induced expression of E-cadherin, but not other adhesion molecules, including VLA4, CD29, and LFA1. Downregulation of E-cadherin with an siRNA suppressed the adhesion of leukemia cells to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and enhanced the anti-leukemia effect of cytarabine. A microRNA (miRNA) database search identified an miR-9 as a candidate miRNA binding onto the 3'-UTR of E-cadherin and regulating its expression. Notably, treatment of leukemia cells with IL-10 decreased miR-9 expression through hypermethylation of the miR-9 CpG islands. In addition, downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 3A by siRNAs decreased E-cadherin expression in parallel with an increase in levels of miR-9 in leukemia cells. Notably, short hairpin RNA-mediated IL-10 downregulation impaired engraftment of human AML cells and enhanced the anti-leukemia effect of cytarabine in conjunction with miR-9 upregulation and E-cadherin downregulation in a human AML xenograft model. Taken together, the IL-10/E-cadherin axis may be a promising therapeutic target for treating AML.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of malnutrition on apoptotic functions of phagocytic cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight ALL patients (13 with malnutrition) and thirty controls were enrolled. Neutrophil and mononuclear cell apoptosis of ALL patients and the control group were studied on admission before chemotherapy and repeated at a minimum of three months after induction of chemotherapy or when the nutritional status of leukemic children improved. RESULTS: The apoptotic functions of both ALL groups on admission were significantly lower than those of the control group. The apoptotic functions were lower in ALL patients with malnutrition than those in ALL patients without malnutrition, but this was not statistically significant. The repeated apoptotic functions of both ALL groups were increased to similar values with the control group. This increase was found to be statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The apoptotic functions in ALL patients were not found to be affected by malnutrition. However, after dietary intervention, increased apoptotic functions in both ALL patient groups deserve mentioning. Dietary intervention should always be recommended as malnutrition or cachexia leads to multiple complications. Enhanced apoptosis might originate also from remission state of cancer.",,"['Cakir, Fatma Betul', 'Berrak, Su Gulsun', 'Aydogan, Gonul', 'Tulunay, Aysin', 'Timur, Cetin', 'Canpolat, Cengiz', 'Eksioglu Demiralp, Emel']","['Cakir FB', 'Berrak SG', 'Aydogan G', 'Tulunay A', 'Timur C', 'Canpolat C', 'Eksioglu Demiralp E']","['a Bezmialem Vakif University , Pediatric Hematology-Oncology , Istanbul , Turkey.', ""b The Children's Hospital at Montefiore , The Pediatric Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Refuah Health Center , NewYork , NY , USA."", 'c Istanbul Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Government Education and Research Hospital, Pediatric Hematology-Oncology , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'd Marmara University Medical Center , Internal Medicine Hematology-Immunology Department , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'e Istanbul Medeniyet University , Pediatric Hematology-Oncology , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'f Acibadem University School of Medicine , Pediatric Hematology-Oncology , Istanbul , Turkey.', 'd Marmara University Medical Center , Internal Medicine Hematology-Immunology Department , Istanbul , Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170120,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diet', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Malnutrition/*complications', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prospective Studies']",,,2017/01/21 06:00,2018/01/03 06:00,['2017/01/21 06:00'],"['2017/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2017.1267778 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2017 Apr;69(3):402-407. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2017.1267778.

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was employed to explore the expression status of VIM 2p in 128 patients with de novo AML and 36 healthy controls. RESULTS: The expression level of VIM 2p was significantly decreased compared with healthy controls (P< 0.001). The patients with low VIM 2p expression were identified in 93 of 128 (73%) of AML patients. No significant differences could be observed in sex, age, blood parameters, FAB/WHO subtypes, karyotype risks and ten gene mutations (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3 A, C/EBPA, N/K-RAS and U2AF1) between VIM 2p low-expressed and high-expressed patients (P> 0.05). Patients with low VIM 2p expression had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those with high VIM 2p expression in whole AML cases (median 7 vs. 13 months, respectively, P= 0.032), besides cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) and non-M3 AML cohort (P= 0.042 and 0.045, respectively).

In this prospect we analyze the role of PI-PLCbeta1 nuclear isoform in relation to the cell cycle regulation, the cell differentiation, and different physiopathological pathways focusing on the importance of the nuclear localization from both molecular and clinical point of view. PI-PLCbeta1 is essential for G1/S transition through DAG and Cyclin D3 and plays also a central role in G2/M progression through Cyclin B1 and PKCalpha. In the differentiation process of C2C12 cells PI-PLCbeta1 increases in both myogenic differentiation and osteogenic differentiation. PI-PLCbeta1 and Cyclin D3 reduction has been observed in Myotonic Dystrophy (DM) suggesting a pivotal role of these enzymes in DM physiopathology. PI-PLCbeta1 is also involved in adipogenesis through a double phase mechanism. Moreover, PI-PLCbeta1 plays a key role in the normal hematopoietic differentiation where it seems to decrease in erythroid differentiation and increase in myeloid differentiation. In Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) PI-PLCbeta1 has a genetic and epigenetic relevance and it is related to MDS patients' risk of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) evolution. In MDS patients PI-PLCbeta1 seems to be also a therapeutic predictive outcome marker. In the central nervous system, PI-PLCbeta1 seems to be involved in different pathways in both brain cortex development and synaptic plasticity related to different diseases. Another PI-PLC isozyme that could be related to nuclear activities is PI-PLCzeta that is involved in infertility processes. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1969-1978, 2017.

The loss of APC function because of deletion of putative promoter 1A or 1B also results in the development of colorectal cancer. Since the regions of promoters 1A and 1B contain many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the aim of this study was to perform functional analysis of some of these SNPs by means of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: First, it was shown that both putative promoters of APC (1A and 1B) drive transcription in an in vitro reporter experiment. From eleven randomly selected SNPs of promoter 1A and four SNPs of promoter 1B, nine and two respectively showed differential patterns of binding of nuclear proteins to oligonucleotide probes corresponding to alternative alleles. The luciferase reporter assay showed that among the six SNPs tested, the rs75612255 C allele and rs113017087 C allele in promoter 1A as well as the rs138386816 T allele and rs115658307 T allele in promoter 1B significantly increased luciferase activity in the human erythromyeloblastoid leukaemia cell line K562. In human colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells, none of the substitutions under study had any effect, with the exception of minor allele G of rs79896135 in promoter 1B. This allele significantly decreased the luciferase reporter's activity CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that many SNPs in APC promoters 1A and 1B are functionally relevant and that allele G of rs79896135 may be associated with the predisposition to colorectal cancer.",,"['Matveeva, Marina Yu', 'Kashina, Elena V', 'Reshetnikov, Vasily V', 'Bryzgalov, Leonid O', 'Antontseva, Elena V', 'Bondar, Natalia P', 'Merkulova, Tatiana I']","['Matveeva MY', 'Kashina EV', 'Reshetnikov VV', 'Bryzgalov LO', 'Antontseva EV', 'Bondar NP', 'Merkulova TI']","['Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Lavrentieva avenue 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation. mroutman@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Lavrentieva avenue 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation.', 'Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Lavrentieva avenue 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation.', 'Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Lavrentieva avenue 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation.', 'Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Lavrentieva avenue 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation.', 'Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Lavrentieva avenue 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation.', 'Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, Lavrentieva avenue 10, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation.', 'Novosibirsk State University, Pirogova street 2, Novosibirsk, 630090, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161222,England,BMC Genet,BMC genetics,100966978,IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adenomatous Polyposis Coli/genetics', 'Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*APC', '*EMSA', '*Luciferase reporter', '*Oncopathology', '*Promoters', '*Regulatory SNPs']",2017/01/21 06:00,2017/09/09 06:00,['2017/01/21 06:00'],"['2017/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12863-016-0460-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12863-016-0460-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genet. 2016 Dec 22;17(Suppl 3):154. doi: 10.1186/s12863-016-0460-8.,,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (APC protein, human)', '0 (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",,,,PMC5249005,,,,,,,,,

These techniques return large, high dimensional data sets with visually complex structures, such as multi-modal peaks extended over large genomic regions. Current tools for visualisation and data exploration represent and leverage these complex features only to a limited extent. RESULTS: We present DGW, an open source software package for simultaneous alignment and clustering of multiple epigenomic marks. DGW uses Dynamic Time Warping to adaptively rescale and align genomic distances which allows to group regions of interest with similar shapes, thereby capturing the structure of epigenomic marks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a simulation study and on a real epigenomic data set from the ENCODE project.

The drug is indicated for the treatment of certain haematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), which are the focus of this review. In phase III CLL/SLL trials, ibrutinib monotherapy was more effective than chlorambucil in the first-line treatment of elderly patients (RESONATE-2) and more effective than ofatumumab in previously-treated adults (RESONATE). Likewise, a combination of ibrutinib, bendamustine and rituximab was more effective in previously-treated adults than bendamustine plus rituximab in a phase III placebo-controlled study (HELIOS). These ibrutinib regimens were associated with significantly better progression-free survival, overall response rates, and overall survival than the comparators (in protocol-specified or planned analyses), with ibrutinib therapy providing benefit regardless of adverse prognostic factors, such as del(17p)/TP53 mutation and del(11q). Ibrutinib has an acceptable tolerability profile, although certain adverse events (e.g. bleeding and atrial fibrillation) require consideration. Redistribution lymphocytosis can occur, but is not indicative of disease progression. Although longer-term data would be beneficial, ibrutinib is a welcome treatment option for patients with CLL, including those who have higher-risk disease or are less physically fit.

The curative potential of allo-HSCT for ALL is, in part, due to the graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect, in addition to the intensive conditioning chemo-radiotherapy. However, relapse remains the major cause of treatment failure following allo-HSCT for ALL. In the allo-HSCT setting, testing for genetic markers of hematopoietic chimerism has become a part of the routine diagnostic program. Routine chimerism analysis is usually performed in peripheral blood or bone marrow; in fact, little is known about the value of tissue chimerism in patients with extramedullary relapse (EMR) after the allo-HSCT setting. The present study reports on, a case of a patient with ALL who experienced isolated cutaneous EMR despite ongoing graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), and the results of peripheral blood and skin tissue chimerism studies using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of short tandem repeats (STR-PCR). The present case demonstrates that, although complete remission and/or chimerism may be achieved in the bone marrow, chimerism achieved at the tissue level, and the subsequent GVL effect, may be limited, despite concomitant severe GVHD following allo-HSCT. Our tissue chimerism analysis results provide a good example of how skin tissue may be a 'sanctuary' site for effector cells of GVL, despite active GVHD and complete hematopoetic chimerism.",,"['Kantarcioglu, Bulent', 'Bekoz, Huseyin Saffet', 'Ogret, Yeliz Duvarci', 'Cakir, Asli', 'Kivanc, Demet', 'Oguz, Fatma Savran', 'Sargin, Deniz']","['Kantarcioglu B', 'Bekoz HS', 'Ogret YD', 'Cakir A', 'Kivanc D', 'Oguz FS', 'Sargin D']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul 34214, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul 34214, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Biology, Istanbul University, Istanbul 34214, Turkey.', 'Department of Pathology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul 34214, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul 34214, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Medical Biology, Istanbul University, Istanbul 34214, Turkey.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul 34214, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161019,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'extramedullary relapse', 'tissue chimerism']",2017/01/21 06:00,2017/01/21 06:01,['2017/01/21 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2016.1052 [doi]', 'MCO-0-0-1052 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2016 Dec;5(6):745-749. doi: 10.3892/mco.2016.1052.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of xanthohumol on the cell proliferation of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma and to understand the mechanism of its action. The effects of xanthohumol on the cell viability and apoptosis rate of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma SCC4 cells were assessed by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide staining. In addition, the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) p53 and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), as well as anti-apoptotic markers, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), were analyzed by western blotting. The results revealed that treatment with 40 microM xanthohumol significantly inhibited the proliferation of SCC4 cells. Furthermore, xanthohumol treatment (40 microM) induced SCC4 cell apoptosis, as indicated by the significant increase in activity and expression of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, PARP, p53 and AIF. By contrast, the protein expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 was significantly decreased following treatment with 40 microM xanthohumol. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that xanthohumol mediates growth suppression and apoptosis induction, which was mediated via the suppression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 and activation of PARP, p53 and AIF signaling pathways.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of wogonin on autophagy in human pancreatic cancer cells (HPCCs), elucidate its mechanism, and identify strategies to increase its effectiveness as an anti-cancer treatment. HPCCs were treated with wogonin and autophagy was detected in the cells. The mechanism of wogonin-related autophagy was investigated, and the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was used to assess the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in wogonin-related autophagy. The results demonstrated that wogonin may induce autophagy by activating the Beclin-1/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ROS pathways in HPCCs, and may enhance ROS generation, followed by the activation of the AKT/ULK1/4E-BP1/CYLD pathway and inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway. The incubation of HPCCs with wogonin and the antioxidant NAC, revealed that the effects of wogonin-enhanced ROS generation on autophagy-related molecules were inhibited, contributing to the inhibition of autophagy and increasing the cell death ratio through apoptosis activation in HPCCs. These studies suggest that autophagy activation, via the ROS pathway, by the antitumor drug wogonin in HPCCs may partially reduce the antitumor effects of the drug, and that the antioxidant NAC may enhance the antitumor effectiveness of wogonin via the inhibition of ROS-enhanced autophagy and the subsequent promotion of apoptosis. Therefore, the present research suggests that wogonin combined with NAC may be a novel combination therapy for clinical pancreatic cancer therapy trials.",,"['Li, Shao-Jun', 'Sun, Shi-Jie', 'Gao, Jie', 'Sun, Fu-Bo']","['Li SJ', 'Sun SJ', 'Gao J', 'Sun FB']","['Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, Shandong 264000, P.R.

MicroRNAs have been demonstrated to be aberrantly expressed in leukemia, and the overall microRNA expression profile may differentiate normal blood cells vs. leukemia cells. MVs containing microRNAs may enable intercellular cross-talk in vivo. This prompted us to investigate specific variations of microRNA expression patterns in MVs derived from leukemia cells. The present study examined the microRNA expression profile of MVs from chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells and that of MVs from normal human volunteers' peripheral blood cells. The potential targets of the differentially expressed microRNAs were predicted using computational searches. Bioinformatic analyses of the predicted target genes were performed for further evaluation. The present study analyzed microRNAs of MVs derived from leukemia and normal cells, and characterized specific microRNAs expression. The results revealed that MVs derived from K562 cells expressed 181 microRNAs of the 888 microRNAs assessed. Further analysis revealed that 16 microRNAs were downregulated, while 7 were upregulated in these MVs. In addition, significant differences in microRNA expression profiles between MVs derived from K562 cells and K562 cells were identified. The present results revealed that 77 and 122 microRNAs were only expressed in MVs derived from K562 cells and in K562 cells, respectively. There were 104 microRNAs co-expressed in MVs derived from K562 cells and in K562 cells. Target gene-related pathway analyses demonstrated that the majority of the dysregulated microRNAs were involved in pathways associated with leukemia, particularly the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the p53 signaling pathways. By further conducting microRNA gene network analysis, the present study revealed that the miR-15a/b, miR-16, miR-17 and miR-30 families were likely to play a role in the regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Since K562 cells presented the t(9;22) translocation, the current study further examined the predicted function of 12 microRNAs located in chromosomes 9 [Homo sapiens (hsa)-let-7a, hsa-let-7f, miR-126, miR-126*, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-27b and miR-7] and 22 (hsa-let-7b, miR-1249, miR-130b and miR-185), which were expressed both in MVs derived from K562 cells and in K562 cells. The present study identified microRNAs of MVs from leukemia and normal cells, and characterized the expression of specific microRNAs. The current study is also the first to identify and characterize distinct microRNA expression between MVs derived from K562 cells and K562 cells. These findings highlight that a number of microRNAs from leukemia-derived MVs may contribute to the development of hematopoietic malignancies. Further investigation may reveal the function of these differentially expressed microRNAs and may provide potential targets for novel therapeutic strategies.",,"['Chen, Xiaomei', 'Xiong, Wei', 'Li, Huiyu']","['Chen X', 'Xiong W', 'Li H']","['Center for Biotherapy, Gansu Provincial Hospital, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

The present study evaluated the protective effect of curcumin on myocardial injury in rats as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects, and examined the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) following myocardial infarction. A rat model of myocardial infarction was successfully established. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed cellular atrophy and hyperchromatic cytoplasm in the myocardial infarction area. The myocardial cells displayed lysis and breakage of cardiac muscle fibers, karyopyknosis and karyorrhexis associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells and proliferation of fibrous tissue. Curcumin treatment at a dosage of 150 mg/kg/body weight resulted in an increase in surviving cells, fewer apoptotic cells, decreased proliferation of fibrous tissue and reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells, though necrosis was still present compared with the rats without curcumin treatment. The immunohistochemical assay demonstrated that curcumin treatment inhibited the expression of NF-kappaB, but increased the expression of PPAR-gamma. The results of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that curcumin treatment significantly increased the mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 (P<0.01). Therefore, curcumin antagonizes cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inhibits inflammatory cell infiltration following myocardial infarction, which may be associated with its inhibitory effects on the expression of NF-kappaB, and activating effects on the expression of PPAR-gamma and Bcl-2 in myocardial cells. Curcumin may be useful in clinical practice for saving more living heart muscle in the area of myocardial infarction and improving cardiac function following the elective opening of obstructed coronary arteries.",,"['Lv, Feng-Hua', 'Yin, Hong-Lei', 'He, Yi-Qun', 'Wu, Hui-Min', 'Kong, Juan', 'Chai, Xiao-Yan', 'Zhang, Su-Rong']","['Lv FH', 'Yin HL', 'He YQ', 'Wu HM', 'Kong J', 'Chai XY', 'Zhang SR']","['Department of Cardiology, The First Teaching Hospital of Xinxiang Medical College, Weihui, Henan 453100, P.R.

However, current flow-MRD has lower sensitivity than molecular methods and lacks standardization. Here we report on a novel next generation flow (NGF) approach for highly sensitive and standardized MRD detection in MM. An optimized 2-tube 8-color antibody panel was constructed in five cycles of design-evaluation-redesign. In addition, a bulk-lysis procedure was established for acquisition of 10(7) cells/sample, and novel software tools were constructed for automatic plasma cell gating. Multicenter evaluation of 110 follow-up BM from MM patients in very good partial response (VGPR) or CR showed a higher sensitivity for NGF-MRD vs conventional 8-color flow-MRD -MRD-positive rate of 47 vs 34% (P=0.003)-. Thus, 25% of patients classified as MRD-negative by conventional 8-color flow were MRD-positive by NGF, translating into a significantly longer progression-free survival for MRD-negative vs MRD-positive CR patients by NGF (75% progression-free survival not reached vs 7 months; P=0.02). This study establishes EuroFlow-based NGF as a highly sensitive, fully standardized approach for MRD detection in MM which overcomes the major limitations of conventional flow-MRD methods and is ready for implementation in routine diagnostics.",,"['Flores-Montero, J', 'Sanoja-Flores, L', 'Paiva, B', 'Puig, N', 'Garcia-Sanchez, O', 'Bottcher, S', 'van der Velden, V H J', 'Perez-Moran, J-J', 'Vidriales, M-B', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Jimenez, C', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Martinez-Lopez, J', 'Corral-Mateos, A', 'Grigore, G-E', 'Fluxa, R', 'Pontes, R', 'Caetano, J', 'Sedek, L', 'Del Canizo, M-C', 'Blade, J', 'Lahuerta, J-J', 'Aguilar, C', 'Barez, A', 'Garcia-Mateo, A', 'Labrador, J', 'Leoz, P', 'Aguilera-Sanz, C', 'San-Miguel, J', 'Mateos, M-V', 'Durie, B', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'Orfao, A']","['Flores-Montero J', 'Sanoja-Flores L', 'Paiva B', 'Puig N', 'Garcia-Sanchez O', 'Bottcher S', 'van der Velden VHJ', 'Perez-Moran JJ', 'Vidriales MB', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Jimenez C', 'Gonzalez M', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Corral-Mateos A', 'Grigore GE', 'Fluxa R', 'Pontes R', 'Caetano J', 'Sedek L', 'Del Canizo MC', 'Blade J', 'Lahuerta JJ', 'Aguilar C', 'Barez A', 'Garcia-Mateo A', 'Labrador J', 'Leoz P', 'Aguilera-Sanz C', 'San-Miguel J', 'Mateos MV', 'Durie B', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Orfao A']","['Cancer Research Center (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL-IBSAL);

The objective of this study was to compare the outcome of allo-SCT from T cell-replete haploidentical (Haplo) versus matched (MUD 10/10) or mismatched unrelated donor at a single HLA-locus (MMUD 9/10) for patients with acute leukemia in remission. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-five adult patients with de novo acute leukemia in first or second remission that received a Haplo-SCT between January 2007 and December 2013 were compared with 2490 patients receiving a MUD 10/10 and 813 receiving a MMUD 9/10. Propensity score weighted analysis was conducted in order to control for disease risk imbalances between the groups. RESULTS: The weighted 3-year non-relapse mortality and relapse incidence were 29 and 30% for Haplo, 21 and 29% for MUD 10/10, and 29 and 25% for MMUD 9/10, respectively. The weighted 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were 41 and 46% for Haplo, 50 and 56% for MUD 10/10, and 46 and 48% for MMUD 9/10, respectively. Using weighted Cox model, both LFS and OS were significantly higher in transplants from MUD 10/10 compared from those in Haplo but not different between transplants from MMUD 9/10 and Haplo. The type of donor was not significantly associated with neither acute nor chronic graft-versus-host disease. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute leukemia in remission have better outcomes if transplanted from a MUD 10/10.

Mechanisms that allow them to persist despite continued kinase inhibition remain unclear. We have previously shown that prolonged exposure to imatinib mesylate (IM) results in dysregulation of Akt/Erk 1/2 signaling, upregulation of miR-181a, enhanced adhesiveness, and resistance to high IM. To characterize the molecular basis and reversibility of those effects, we applied gene and protein expression analysis, quantitative phosphoproteomics, and direct miR-181a inhibition to our cellular model of CML cells subjected to prolonged exposure to IM. Those cells demonstrated upregulation of pluripotency markers (SOX2, SALL4) and adhesion receptors (CD44, VLA-4, CXCR4), as well as downregulation of Hippo signaling and upregulation of transcription coactivator YAP. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-181a using a microRNA sponge inhibitor resulted in decreased transcription of SOX2 and SALL4, decreased activation of YAP, and increased sensitivity to IM. Our findings indicate that long-term exposure to IM results in dysregulation of stem cell renewal-regulatory Hippo/YAP signaling, acquisition of expression of stem cell markers and that experimental interference with YAP activity may help to restore chemosensitivity to TKI.",,"['Chorzalska, Anna', 'Kim, Javier Flores', 'Roder, Karim', 'Tepper, Alexander', 'Ahsan, Nagib', 'Rao, R Shyama Prasad', 'Olszewski, Adam J', 'Yu, Xiaoqing', 'Terentyev, Dmitry', 'Morgan, John', 'Treaba, Diana O', 'Zhao, Ting C', 'Liang, Olin', 'Gruppuso, Philip A', 'Dubielecka, Patrycja M']","['Chorzalska A', 'Kim JF', 'Roder K', 'Tepper A', 'Ahsan N', 'Rao RSP', 'Olszewski AJ', 'Yu X', 'Terentyev D', 'Morgan J', 'Treaba DO', 'Zhao TC', 'Liang O', 'Gruppuso PA', 'Dubielecka PM']","['1 Signal Transduction Laboratory, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '1 Signal Transduction Laboratory, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '2 Division of Cardiology, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '1 Signal Transduction Laboratory, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '3 Division of Biology and Medicine, Brown University , Center for Cancer Research and Development Proteomics Core Facility, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island.', '4 Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Division, Yenepoya Research Center, Yenepoya University , Mangalore, India .', '5 Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '6 Department of Biostatistics, Yale School of Public Health , New Haven, Connecticut.', '2 Division of Cardiology, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '7 Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core Facility, Roger Williams Medical Center , Providence, Rhode Island.', '8 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '9 Cardiovascular Laboratory, Department of Surgery, Roger Williams Medical Center, Boston University School of Medicine , Providence, Rhode Island.', '5 Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '10 Department of Orthopedics, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.', '11 Department of Pediatrics, Brown University , Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, Rhode Island.', '1 Signal Transduction Laboratory, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Rhode Island Hospital, Warren Alpert Medical School, Brown University , Providence, Rhode Island.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170227,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hippo Signaling Pathway', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hippo pathway', '*YAP', '*chemoresistance', '*imatinib mesylate', '*leukemic stem cells', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2017/01/21 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2017/01/21 06:00'],"['2017/01/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2016.0262 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2017 May 1;26(9):656-677. doi: 10.1089/scd.2016.0262.

Results of a randomized Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) phase II trial.,359-366,10.1002/ajh.24654 [doi],"Intensive induction chemotherapy using anthracycline and cytarabine backbone is considered the most effective upfront therapy in physically fit older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, outcomes of the standard induction in elderly AML are inferior to those observed in younger patients, and they are still unsatisfactory. As addition of cladribine to the standard induction therapy is known to improve outcome in younger AML patients. The present randomized phase II study compares efficacy and toxicity of the DAC (daunorubicin plus cytarabine plus cladribine) regimen with the standard DA (daunorubicin plus cytarabine) regimen in the newly diagnosed AML patients over 60 years of age. A total of 171 patients were enrolled in the study (DA, 86; DAC, 85). A trend toward higher complete remission (CR) was observed in the DAC arm compared to the DA arm (44% vs. 34%; P = .19), which did not lead to improved median overall survival, which in the case of the DAC group was 8.6 months compared to in 9.1 months in the DA group (P = .64). However, DAC appeared to be superior in the group of patients aged 60-65 (CR rate: DAC 51% vs. DA 29%; P = .02). What is more, a subgroup of patients, with good and intermediate karyotypes, benefited from addition of cladribine also in terms of overall survival (P = .02). No differences in hematological and nonhematological toxicity between the DA and DAC regimens were observed.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Pluta, Agnieszka', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Wrzesien-Kus, Agata', 'Katarzyna Budziszewska, Bozena', 'Sulek, Kazimierz', 'Wawrzyniak, Ewa', 'Czemerska, Magdalena', 'Zwolinska, Malgorzata', 'Golos, Aleksandra', 'Holowiecka-Goral, Aleksandra', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Piszcz, Jaroslaw', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Mordak-Domagala, Monika', 'Lange, Andrzej', 'Razny, Malgorzata', 'Madry, Krzysztof', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, Wieslaw', 'Grosicki, Sebastian', 'Butrym, Aleksandra', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Holowiecki, Jerzy', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka']","['Pluta A', 'Robak T', 'Wrzesien-Kus A', 'Katarzyna Budziszewska B', 'Sulek K', 'Wawrzyniak E', 'Czemerska M', 'Zwolinska M', 'Golos A', 'Holowiecka-Goral A', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Piszcz J', 'Kloczko J', 'Mordak-Domagala M', 'Lange A', 'Razny M', 'Madry K', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W', 'Grosicki S', 'Butrym A', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Warzocha K', 'Holowiecki J', 'Giebel S', 'Szydlo R', 'Wierzbowska A']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Military Medical Academy, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Oncology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'University Department of Hematology and BMT, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Bialystok Medical Academy, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Bialystok Medical Academy, Bialystok, Poland.', 'L.

We conducted a phase II trial of imatinib-combined chemotherapy for newly diagnosed BCR-ABL-positive ALL in adults. Sixty-eight patients were included in the trial between October 2008 and December 2010. The median age was 49 years, with 28 patients >55 years of age. Sixty-five patients achieved CR (95.6%). The estimated 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 62.3% and 67.4%, respectively. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) at initial CR was performed in 43 patients. Thirty-five of 39 patients <55 years and 8 of 26 patients >55 years underwent allo-SCT at first CR. The 3-year OS in patients <55 years receiving allo-SCT at first CR, patients >55 years receiving allo-SCT at first CR, patients <55 years not receiving allo-SCT at first CR, and patients >55 years not receiving allo-SCT at first CR were 80.4%, 41.1%, 32.5%, and 52.0%, respectively (P = 0.058). The three-year EFS in each group was 76.7%, 53.6%, not reached, and 26.4%, respectively (P = 0.150).

The largest group of recipients are premature infants who derive very substantial benefits from it. Human milk protects premature infants from necrotizing enterocolitis and from sepsis, two devastating medical conditions. Milk banks collect, screen, store, process, and distribute human milk. Donating women usually nurse their own infants and have a milk supply that exceeds their own infants' needs. Donor women are carefully selected and are screened for HIV-1, HIV-2, human T-cell leukemia virus 1 and 2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis. In the milk bank, handling, storing, processing, pooling, and bacterial screening follow standardized algorithms. Heat treatment of human milk diminishes anti-infective properties, cellular components, growth factors, and nutrients. However, the beneficial effects of donor milk remain significant and donor milk is still highly preferable in comparison to formula.","['(c) 2017 S.

Am80 is a synthetic retinoid with a different structure from all-trans-retinoic acid: Am80 is now clinically utilized as a new drug for relapsed and intractable acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Our experiments showed that the combination of EGCG and Am80 synergistically induced both apoptosis in human lung cancer cell line PC-9 and up-regulated expressions of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153), death receptor 5, and p21(waf1) genes in the cells. To understand the mechanisms of synergistic anticancer activity of the combination, we gave special attention to the lysine acetylation of proteins. Proteomic analysis using nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS revealed that PC-9 cells treated with the combination contained 331 acetylated proteins, while nontreated cells contained 553 acetylated proteins, and 59 acetylated proteins were found in both groups. Among them, the combination increased acetylated-p53 and acetylated-alpha-tubulin through reduction of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in cytosol fraction, although the levels of acetylation in histones H3 or H4 did not change, and the combination reduced protein levels of HDAC4, -5 and -6 by 20% to 80%. Moreover, we found that a specific inhibitor of HDAC4 and -5 strongly induced p21(waf1) gene expression, and that of HDAC6 induced both GADD153 and p21(waf1) gene expression, which resulted in apoptosis. All results demonstrate that EGCG in combination with Am80 changes levels of acetylation in nonhistone proteins via down-regulation of HDAC4, -5 and -6 and stimulates apoptotic induction.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Among the multiple aberrant Tax-induced effects on cellular processes, persistent activation of transcription factor NF-kappaB, which is activated only transiently upon physiological stimulation, is essential for leukemogenesis. We and others have shown that Tax induces activation of the IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex, which is a critical step in NF-kappaB activation, by generating Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. However, the molecular mechanism underlying Tax-induced IKK activation is controversial and not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that Tax recruits linear (Met1-linked) ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) to the IKK complex and that Tax fails to induce IKK activation in cells that lack LUBAC activity. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that both Lys63-linked and Met1-linked polyubiquitin chains are associated with the IKK complex. Furthermore, treatment of the IKK-associated polyubiquitin chains with Met1-linked-chain-specific deubiquitinase (OTULIN) resulted in the reduction of high molecular weight polyubiquitin chains and the generation of short Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains, indicating that Tax can induce the generation of Lys63- and Met1-linked hybrid polyubiquitin chains. We also demonstrate that Tax induces formation of the active macromolecular IKK complex and that the blocking of Tax-induced polyubiquitin chain synthesis inhibited formation of the macromolecular complex. Taken together, these results lead us to propose a novel model in which the hybrid-chain-dependent oligomerization of the IKK complex triggered by Tax leads to trans-autophosphorylation-mediated IKK activation.",,"['Shibata, Yuri', 'Tokunaga, Fuminori', 'Goto, Eiji', 'Komatsu, Ginga', 'Gohda, Jin', 'Saeki, Yasushi', 'Tanaka, Keiji', 'Takahashi, Hirotaka', 'Sawasaki, Tatsuya', 'Inoue, Satoshi', 'Oshiumi, Hiroyuki', 'Seya, Tsukasa', 'Nakano, Hiroyasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Iwai, Kazuhiro', 'Inoue, Jun-Ichiro']","['Shibata Y', 'Tokunaga F', 'Goto E', 'Komatsu G', 'Gohda J', 'Saeki Y', 'Tanaka K', 'Takahashi H', 'Sawasaki T', 'Inoue S', 'Oshiumi H', 'Seya T', 'Nakano H', 'Tanaka Y', 'Iwai K', 'Inoue JI']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cancer Biology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathobiochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathobiochemistry, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cancer Biology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Research Center for Asian Infectious Diseases, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Protein Metabolism, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Protein Metabolism, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Proteo-Science Center, Ehime University, Ehime, Japan.', 'Proteo-Science Center, Ehime University, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Anti-Aging Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Toho University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cancer Biology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170119,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transfection']",,,2017/01/20 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2017/01/20 06:00'],"['2016/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1006162 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-16-01325 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2017 Jan 19;13(1):e1006162. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006162. eCollection 2017 Jan.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4625-5722', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9929-9879', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6389-7036']","['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",,,,PMC5283754,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,

Prognosis is mainly influenced by patient age at diagnosis and cytogenetic alterations, two of the main factors currently used in AML patient risk stratification. However, additional criteria are required to improve the current risk classification and better adapt patient care. In neoplastic cells, ribosome biogenesis is increased to sustain the high proliferation rate and ribosome composition is altered to modulate specific gene expression driving tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the usage of ribosome biogenesis factors as clinical markers in adult patients with AML. We showed that nucleoli, the nucleus compartments where ribosome production takes place, are modified in AML by analyzing a panel of AML and healthy donor cells using immunofluorescence staining. Using four AML series, including the TCGA dataset, altogether representing a total of about 270 samples, we showed that not all factors involved in ribosome biogenesis have clinical values although ribosome biogenesis is increased in AML. Interestingly, we identified the regulator of ribosome production nucleolin (NCL) as over-expressed in AML blasts. Moreover, we found in two series that high NCL mRNA expression level was associated with a poor overall survival, particular in elderly patients. Multivariate analyses taking into account age and cytogenetic risk indicated that NCL expression in blast cells is an independent marker of reduced survival. Our study identifies NCL as a potential novel prognostic factor in AML.

Expression of IL-6, Fli-1, TNF-alpha, DNMT1 and DNMT3B was significantly increased in the offspring of LPS-treated rats. Global DNA methylation level of renal cortex also increased dramatically in rat offspring of the LPS group. Prenatal PDTC administration reversed the increases in gene expression and global DNA methylation level. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to LPS may result in changes of intrarenal DNMTs through the IL-6/Fli-1 pathway and TNF-alpha, which probably involves hypertension in offspring due to maternal exposure to inflammation.",,"['Wang, Jing', 'Cui, Jinghong', 'Chen, Rui', 'Deng, Youcai', 'Liao, Xi', 'Wei, Yanling', 'Li, Xiaohui', 'Su, Min', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Yi, Ping']","['Wang J', 'Cui J', 'Chen R', 'Deng Y', 'Liao X', 'Wei Y', 'Li X', 'Su M', 'Yu J', 'Yi P']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Research Institute of Surgery, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Research Institute of Surgery, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Materia Medica, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Materia Medica, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Research Institute of Surgery, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Research Institute of Surgery, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Materia Medica, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Materia Medica, College of Pharmacy, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Research Institute of Surgery, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Research Institute of Surgery, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170119,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Female', 'Hypertension/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Inflammation/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'Kidney/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,2017/01/20 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/01/20 06:00'],"['2016/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0169206 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-24840 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 19;12(1):e0169206. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0169206. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (Dnmt1 protein, rat)']",,,,PMC5245821,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,

The major complication of allo-HSCT is graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), a progressive inflammatory illness characterized by donor immune cells attacking the organs of the recipient. Current GVHD prevention and treatment strategies use immune suppressive drugs and/or anti-T cell reagents these can lead to increased risk of infections and tumor relapse. Recent research demonstrated that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a component found in green tea leaves at a level of 25-35% at dry weight, may be useful in the inhibition of GVHD due to its immune modulatory, anti-oxidative and anti-angiogenic capacities. In murine allo-HSCT recipients treated with EGCG, we found significantly reduced GVHD scores, reduced target organ GVHD and improved survival. EGCG treated allo-HSCT recipients had significantly higher numbers of regulatory T cells in GVHD target organs and in the blood. Furthermore, EGCG treatment resulted in diminished oxidative stress indicated by significant changes of glutathione blood levels as well as glutathione peroxidase in the colon. In summary, our study provides novel evidence demonstrating that EGCG ameliorates lethal GVHD and reduces GVHD-related target organ damage.

Several toxicity, antitoxicity, genotoxicity, antigenotoxicity, and longevity endpoints were checked in the somatic mutation and recombination test in in vivo Drosophila animal model. Cytotoxicity in human leukemia-60 cell line (HL-60) promyelocytic and NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, proapoptotic DNA fragmentation, comet assay, methylation status, and macroautophagy (MA) activity were tested in in vitro assays. Choline is not only safe but it is also able to protect against the DNA damage caused by an oxidative genotoxin. Moreover, it improves the life extension in the animal model. The in vitro results show that it is able to exhibit genetic damage against leukemia HL-60 cells. Single-strand breaks in DNA are observed at the molecular level in treatments with choline, although only a significant hypermethylation on the long interspersed elements-1 and a hypomethylation on the satellite-alpha DNA repetitive DNA sequences of HL-60 cells at the lowest concentration (0.447 mM) were observed. Besides, choline decreased MA at the lower assayed concentration and the MA response to topoisomerase inhibitor (etoposide) is maintained in the presence of treatment with 0.22 mM choline.

The complex three-dimensional geometry of trabecular spongiosa, however, complicates schema for dose assessment in such a way that only a few reference skeletal models have been developed to date, and which are based upon microimaging of a limited number of cadaveric bone spongiosa cores. The question then arises as to what degree of accuracy is achievable from reference skeletal dose models when applied to individual patients or specific exposed populations? METHODS: Patient variability in marrow dosimetry were quantified for three skeletal sites - the ribs, lumbar vertebrae, and cranium - for the beta-emitters (45) Ca, (153) Sm, and (90) Y, and the alpha-particle emitters (223) Ra, (219) Rn, and (215) Po, the latter two being the immediate progeny of the former. For each radionuclide and bone site, three patient parameters were altered from their values in the reference model: (1) bone size as a surrogate for patient stature, (2) marrow cellularity as a surrogate for age- or disease-related changes in marrow adiposity, and (3) the trabecular bone volume fraction as a surrogate for bone mineral density. Marrow dose variability is expressed as percent differences in the radionuclide S value given by the reference model and the patient-parameterized model. The impact of radionuclide biokinetics on marrow dosimetry was not considered. RESULTS: Variations in overall bone size play a very minor role in active marrow dose variability. Marrow cellularity is a significant factor in dose variability for active marrow self-irradiation, but it plays no role for radionuclides localized to the trabecular bone matrix. Variations in trabecular bone volume fractions impact the active marrow dose variability for short-range particle emitters (45) Ca, (223) Ra, (219) Rn, and (215) Po in the vertebrae and ribs, skeletal sites with small spongiosa proportions of trabecular bone. In the cranium, with its relative high proportion of trabecular bone, significant differences in marrow dosimetry from the reference model were noted for all radionuclides. CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal models of active marrow dosimetry should be more fully parameterized to permit closer matching to patient bone density and marrow cellularity, particularly when considering short-range particle emitters localized to either the bone trabeculae or active marrow, respectively.",['(c) 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.'],"['Geyer, Amy M', 'Schwarz, Bryan C', 'Hobbs, Robert F', 'Sgouros, George', 'Bolch, Wesley E']","['Geyer AM', 'Schwarz BC', 'Hobbs RF', 'Sgouros G', 'Bolch WE']","['J Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6131, USA.', 'J Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6131, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21231, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21231, USA.', 'J Crayton Pruitt Family Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 32611-6131, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,IM,"['Absorption, Radiation', 'Bone Density/*radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*radiation effects', 'Bone and Bones/*anatomy & histology/*cytology/physiology/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Organ Size', 'Radiometry/*standards']",['NOTNLM'],"['bone mineral density', 'marrow cellularity', 'marrow dosimetry', 'patient stature']",2017/01/20 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2017/01/20 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mp.12002 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 2017 Jan;44(1):272-283. doi: 10.1002/mp.12002.,,,,,['R01 CA157542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC6385860,['NIHMS831169'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: We analyzed data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research to compare outcomes after autologous (n = 3786) or allogeneic (n = 7433) HCT for adult patients with hematologic malignancies with an existing diagnosis of pre-HCT depression requiring treatment versus those without pre-HCT depression. Using Cox regression models, we compared overall survival (OS) between patients with or without depression. We compared the number of days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days post-HCT using Poisson models. We also compared the incidence of grade 2-4 acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in allogeneic HCT. RESULTS: The study included 1116 (15%) patients with pre-transplant depression and 6317 (85%) without depression who underwent allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2012. Pre-transplant depression was associated with lower OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.23; P = 0.004) and a higher incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.14-1.37; P < 0.0001), but similar incidence of chronic GVHD. Pre-transplant depression was associated with fewer days-alive-and-out-of-the hospital (means ratio [MR] = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = 0.004). There were 512 (13.5%) patients with Pre-transplant depression and 3274 (86.5%) without depression who underwent autologous HCT. Pre-transplant depression in autologous HCT was not associated with OS (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98-1.34; P = 0.096) but was associated with fewer days alive and out of the hospital (MR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97-0.99; P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Pre-transplant depression was associated with lower OS and higher risk of acute GVHD among allogeneic HCT recipients and fewer days alive and out of the hospital during the first 100 days after autologous and allogeneic HCT. Patients with pre-transplant depression represent a population that is at risk for post-transplant complications. Cancer 2017;123:1828-1838.

Signalling via surface immunoglobulin, which constitutes the major part of the B cell receptor, and several genetic alterations play a part in CLL pathogenesis, in addition to interactions between CLL cells and other cell types, such as stromal cells, T cells and nurse-like cells in the lymph nodes. The clinical progression of CLL is heterogeneous and ranges from patients who require treatment soon after diagnosis to others who do not require therapy for many years, if at all. Several factors, including the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutational status, genomic changes, patient age and the presence of comorbidities, should be considered when defining the optimal management strategies, which include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy and/or drugs targeting B cell receptor signalling or inhibitors of apoptosis, such as BCL-2. Research on the biology of CLL has profoundly enhanced our ability to identify patients who are at higher risk for disease progression and our capacity to treat patients with drugs that selectively target distinctive phenotypic or physiological features of CLL.

We explored the clinical characteristics, drug resistances and prognostic factors in these patients. This multicentre, retrospective study was conducted at the department of haematology wards of 18 tertiary hospitals in China from January 2014 to June 2015. The total clinical isolates from every source were collected from patients with haematological malignancy. Haematological malignancy patients diagnosed with Ab bacteraemia were analysed. During the study period, 40 patients with Ab bacteraemia were identified, accounting for 2.9% (40/1358) of bacteraemia cases, of which 25 (62.5%) had acute leukaemia (AL) and 27 (67.5%) had neutropaenia. Compared with non-neutropaenic patients, neutropaenic patients showed higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores and 30-day mortality rates (p < 0.05). The in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of Ab to colistin was highest, at 100%, followed by that of tigecycline (91.30%) and amikacin (75.86%). Compared with the patients who had carbapenem-susceptible Ab infections, patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Ab (CRAB) had significantly longer hospital stays and were more likely to have had exposure to carbapenem before bacteraemia (p < 0.05). The 30-day mortality rate was 32.5%. CRAB, neutropaenia, higher APACHE score, Pitt bacteraemia score and inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy were significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Multivariable analysis showed that APACHE score and CRAB were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Haematologic patients with AL and febrile neutropaenia were at high risk of Ab bacteraemia. More attention should be paid to CRAB, which is an independent risk factor for mortality in haematological malignancy patients with Ab bacteraemia.",,"['Wang, X', 'Zhang, L', 'Sun, A', 'Yang, X', 'Sang, W', 'Jiang, Y', 'Cheng, J', 'Wang, J', 'Zhou, M', 'Chen, B', 'Ouyang, J']","['Wang X', 'Zhang L', 'Sun A', 'Yang X', 'Sang W', 'Jiang Y', 'Cheng J', 'Wang J', 'Zhou M', 'Chen B', 'Ouyang J']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, No. 454 Hospital of the PLA, Nanjing, 210000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Xuzhou First People's Hospital, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital affiliated to Southeast University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, People's Republic of China. ouyangy211@hotmail.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,20170118,Germany,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,8804297,IM,"['APACHE', 'Acinetobacter Infections/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'Acinetobacter baumannii/drug effects/*isolation & purification', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality/pathology', 'China', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tertiary Care Centers']",,,2017/01/20 06:00,2018/03/13 06:00,['2017/01/20 06:00'],"['2016/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10096-016-2895-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s10096-016-2895-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis. 2017 Jul;36(7):1073-1081. doi: 10.1007/s10096-016-2895-2.

However, late toxicities could be a concern. The aim of the present study was to analyze the long-term impact on survival, relapse and late toxicities of a trial of treatment with fludarabine, mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide (FCM regimen) for untreated patients with advanced stage FL. One hundred and twenty patients enrolled in a phase 2 trial of treatment with FCM regimen between 2000 and 2003 were evaluated. After a median follow-up of 12 years, 52 patients eventually relapsed/progressed with 10 year progression-free survival (PFS) of 46 %. Ten patients showed histological transformation to aggressive lymphoma with a risk of transformation of 2 and 9 % at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Three patients developed therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML) and seven solid neoplasms with an overall risk of 3 and 8 % at 5 and 10 years, respectively.

The molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of its gene expression has yet to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we performed large scale expression profiling of microRNA (miRNA) and transcription factor (TF) by Illumina deepsequencing and TF array technology, respectively, and identified 291 differentially expressed miRNAs and 201 differentially expressed TFs in adult BALL samples relative to their controls. After integrating expression profile data with computational prediction of miRNA and TF targets from different databases, we construct a comprehensive miRNATF regulatory network specifically for adult BALL. Network function analysis revealed 25 significantly enriched pathways, four pathways are wellknown to be involved in BALL, such as PI3KAkt signaling pathway, JakSTAT signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway and cell cycle pathway. By analyzing the network topology, we identified 28 hub miRNAs and 19 hub TFs in the network, and found nine potential BALL regulators among these hub nodes. We also constructed a JakSTAT signaling subnetwork for BALL. Based on the subnetwork analysis and literature survey, we proposed a cellular model to discuss MYC/miR15a5p/FLT3 feed-forward loop (FFL) with JakSTAT signaling pathway in BALL.

Then, cell differentiation was displayed by morphologic observation, NBT reduction activity and CD11b evaluation of cytometric flow. It showed that DADS induced differentiation, reduced the ability of NBT and increased CD11b expression. Likewise, DADS inhibited xenograft tumor growth and induced differentiation in vivo. In order to make sure how DADS induced differentiation, we compared the protein expression profile of DADS-treated cells with that of untreated control. Using high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified 18 differentially expressed proteins after treatment with DADS, including four upregulated and 14 downregulated proteins. RT-PCR and western blot assay showed that DJ-1, cofilin 1, RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (RhoGDI2), Calreticulin (CTR) and PCNA were decreased by DADS.

The Tudor domain-containing protein 3 (TDRD3) is one of the major methyl-arginine effector molecules that recognizes methylated arginine residues on histones and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, and activates transcription. However, majority of the cellular TDRD3 localizes to the cytoplasm and its functions there are still elusive. Here, we have identified ubiquitin-specific protease 9 X-linked (USP9X) as a TDRD3-interacting protein by GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation. Detailed characterization suggests that the interaction between TDRD3 and USP9X is mediated through the Tudor domain of TDRD3 and the arginine methylation of USP9X. This interaction plays a critical role in TDRD3 protein stability, as knockdown of USP9X expression leads to increased TDRD3 ubiquitination. We also found that USP9X co-localizes with TDRD3 in cytoplasmic stress granules and this localization is diminished in Tdrd3-null mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, suggesting that TDRD3 is essential for USP9X stress granule localization. Furthermore, we found that one of the USP9X de-ubiquitination targets, myeloid cell leukemia protein 1, is regulated by TDRD3, indicating that TDRD3 potentially regulates USP9X de-ubiquitinase activity. Finally, we show that knockdown of TDRD3 expression sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis, likely due to its regulation of USP9X.

These formulas predominantly consist of the extracts isolated from herbal plants, animal parts and medicinal minerals. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of 150 formulas, used as non-prescription drugs in China, on the treatment of cancer. A formula was identified, C54, commonly used to treat sore throats, which exhibited marked growth inhibition in vitro, associated with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cytotoxicity was, in part, due to the ability of C54 to inhibit the expression and function of the transcription factor, Fli-1, leading to marked inhibition of leukemic cell growth in tissue culture. However, when injected into a model of leukemia initiated by Fli-1 activation, C54 only exhibited a limited tumor inhibition. C54 also did not suppress xenograft growth of the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, orthopedically transplanted into the mammary fat pad of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Notably, splenomegaly and accumulation of inflammatory CD11b(+)/Gr1(+) monocytes were observed in the tumors and spleens of C54-treated mice. As inflammation is known to accelerate tumor progression, this immune response may counteract the cell-autonomous effect of C54, and account for its limited tumor inhibitory effect in vivo. Combining C54 with an anti-inflammatory drug may improve the potency of C54 for treatment of certain cancers.

Therefore, it has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to induce terminal differentiation of leukemic blast cells into a specific lineage, leading to prevention of high proliferation rates. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the potential of cell differentiation and death induced by bovine dialyzable leukocyte extract (bDLE) in the K562 cell line. For this purpose K562 and MOLT-3 human leukemic cell lines and primary human monocytes and murine peritoneal macrophages were exposed to bDLE, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and dimethyl sulfoxide for 96 h, and the viability, proliferation and cell cycle were evaluated. To determine the lineage that led to cell differentiation, Romanowsky staining was performed to observe the morphological changes following the treatments, and the expression of the surface markers cluster of differentiation (CD)14(+), CD68(+), CD163(+) and CD42a(+), as well as the phagocytic activity, and the production of nitric oxide (NO) (assessed by colorimetric assay), cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha] and chemokines [chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL)2, CCL5 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8] in cell supernatants was assessed by flow cytometry. The results of the present study reveal that high doses of bDLE increase the cell death in K562 and MOLT-3 lines, without affecting the viability of human monocytes and murine peritoneal macrophages. Furthermore, low doses of bDLE induce differentiation in K562 cells towards a monocyte/macrophage lineage with an M2 phenotype, and induced moderately upregulated expression of CD42(+), a megakaryocytic marker. Cell cycle arrest in the S and G2/M phases was observed in bDLE-treated K562 cells, which demonstrated similar phagocytic activity, NO levels and cytokine and chemokine production to that of PMA-treated cells.

Retinal is fundamental for vision and RA is used in clinical therapy of human acute promyelocytic leukemia. The actions of retinol and retinyl palmitate (RP) are not known well. Recently, we found that retinol is a potent anti-proliferative agent against human refractory cancers, including gallbladder cancer, being more effective than RA, while RP was inactive. In the current study, we determined serum retinol concentrations in xenograft mice bearing tumors derived from four refractory cancer cell lines. We also examined the effects of vitamin A on proliferation of human gallbladder cancer cells in vivo. Serum retinol concentrations were significantly lower in xenograft mice with tumors derived from various refractory cancer cell lines as compared with control mice. The growth of tumors was inhibited with increasing serum retinol concentrations obtained post-administration of RP. In addition, pre-administration of RP increased serum retinol concentrations and suppressed tumor growth. These results indicate that administration of RP can maintain retinol concentrations in the body and that this might suppress cancer cell growth and attachment.

TK activity was measured in patient sera at the time of diagnosis using the DiviTum method, with the mean value being 439 Du/L. A correlation was found between TK activity and risk of disease progression (p=0.045). The optimal discriminative value of TK activity in the prediction of CLL progression was found to be 600 Du/L. TK activity significantly differed between the patients who achieved complete remission and those who only partially responded to therapy. In 93% of patients without any response to treatment and 18 out of 20 patients with progressive disease, TK activity over 600 Du/L was noted.

DNMT3A is a recurrently mutated epigenetic modifier gene in AML. To date, the prognostic significance of DNMT3A mutations has not been studied in a Southeast Asian AML population. We sought to investigate the clinical implications of DNMT3A mutations in a Southeast Asian cohort of AML patients. METHODS: DNMT3A mutations were identified using a targeted next-generation sequencing panel in 157 AML patients. We studied the molecular and clinical features of patients with DNMT3A mutations and assessed the prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations. RESULTS: DNMT3A mutations were found in 33 of 157 (21.0%) AML patients. 114 patients were included for statistical analysis. Pretreatment data revealed that patients with DNMT3A mutations were older (>/=60 years old), had a higher white blood cell count at diagnosis, had more adverse cytogenetic risk profiles and were more often associated with NPM1 mutations compared with patients with wild-type DNMT3A. Survival analysis showed that DNMT3A mutations were associated with poorer clinical outcomes. This was especially when associated with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations (AML (NPM1/FLT3/DNMT3A) ), which are common. The AML (NPM1/FLT3/DNMT3A) subtype was an independent predictor for poorer overall survival (OS). Other independent risk factors for poorer OS include advanced age at diagnosis and adverse cytogenetic risk stratification.

It is an orally bioavailable small molecule that binds BCL2 very specifically. Acting as a pharmacologic mimic of the proteins that initiate apoptosis (a so-called BH3 mimetic), venetoclax rapidly induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, which express high levels of BCL2 and rely on it to maintain their survival. As a single agent, daily venetoclax treatment induced durable responses in 79% of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma in a phase I study, including complete remissions in 20% of patients. Its use was approved by the FDA in April 2016 for patients with previously treated del(17p) CLL on the basis of a single-arm phase II trial demonstrating a 79% response rate and an estimated 1-year progression-free survival of 72% with 400 mg/day continuous therapy. This review focuses on venetoclax, its mechanism of action, pharmacology, and clinical trial data and seeks to place it in the context of rapid advances in therapy for patients with relapsed CLL, especially those with del(17p) CLL.

METHODS: In this retrospective observational case-series study, AC paracentesis was performed on 301 eyes of 301 patients between September 2009 and August 2016 at the Department of Ophthalmology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine and the Baptist Eye Institute, Kyoto, Japan. AC paracentesis was performed with the patient placed in the supine position using a 30-gauge needle integrated with a disposable pipette with one hand, and the safety post procedure was then evaluated. RESULTS: The indications for AC paracentesis were virus detection (ie, corneal endotheliitis, anterior infectious uveitis, cytomegalovirus retinitis and acute retinal necrosis) in 264 eyes, bacterial detection (ie, endophthalmitis) in 8 eyes and malignancy (ie, primary intraocular lymphoma, leukaemia and retinoblastoma) in 29 eyes. No serious complications such as infection, hyphema, lens trauma or severe inflammation including hypopyon and AC fibrin formation were observed.

Unicentric CD (UCD) is localized to a single region of lymph nodes. Multicentric CD (MCD) manifests with systemic inflammatory symptoms and organ dysfunction due to cytokine dysregulation and involves multiple lymph node regions. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) causes MCD (HHV-8-associated MCD) in immunocompromised individuals, such as HIV-infected patients. However, >50% of MCD cases are HIV and HHV-8 negative (defined as idiopathic [iMCD]). The clinical and biological behavior of CD remains poorly elucidated. Here, we analyzed the clinicopathologic features of 74 patients (43 with UCD and 31 with iMCD) and therapeutic response of 96 patients (43 with UCD and 53 with iMCD) with HIV-/HHV-8-negative CD compared with 51 HIV-/HHV-8-positive patients. Systemic inflammatory symptoms and elevated inflammatory factors were more common in iMCD patients than UCD patients. Abnormal bone marrow features were more frequent in iMCD (77.0%) than UCD (45%); the most frequent was plasmacytosis, which was seen in 3% to 30.4% of marrow cells. In the lymph nodes, higher numbers of CD3(+) lymphocytes (median, 58.88 +/- 20.57) and lower frequency of CD19(+)/CD5(+) (median, 5.88 +/- 6.52) were observed in iMCD patients compared with UCD patients (median CD3(+) cells, 43.19 +/- 17.37; median CD19(+)/CD5(+) cells, 17.37 +/- 15.80). Complete surgical resection is a better option for patients with UCD. Siltuximab had a greater proportion of complete responses and longer progression-free survival (PFS) for iMCD than rituximab. Centricity, histopathological type, and anemia significantly impacted PFS.

METHODS: A total of 90 neonatal rats aged 3 days were divided into three groups: sham-operation, cortical injury model, and sodium butyrate (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) treatment. The rats in the model and the sodium butyrate treatment groups were intraperitoneally injected with lipopolysaccharide (0.05 mg/kg), and then right common carotid artery ligation was performed 2 hours later and the rats were put in a hypoxic chamber (oxygen concentration 6.5%) for 90 minutes. The rats in the sham-operation group were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline and the right common carotid artery was only separated and exposed without ligation or hypoxic treatment. The rats in the sodium butyrate treatment group were intraperitoneally injected with sodium butyrate (300 mg/kg) immediately after establishment of the cortical injury model once a day for 7 days. Those in the sham-operation and the model groups were injected with the same volume of normal saline. At 7 days after establishment of the model, Western blot was used to measure the protein expression of histone H3 (HH3), acetylated histone H3 (AH3), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Immunofluorescence assay was used to measure the expression of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as the cortex cell proliferation index. RESULTS: The sodium butyrate treatment group had a significantly lower HH3/AH3 ratio than the model group (P<0.05), which suggested that the sodium butyrate treatment group had increased acetylation of HH3. Compared with the model group, the sodium butyrate treatment group had a significant increase in Bcl-2/Bax ratio, a significant reduction in CC3 expression, and a significant increase in BDNF expression (P<0.05). The sodium butyrate treatment group had a significant increase in the number of BrdU-positive cells in the cortex compared with the model group (P<0.05), and BrdU was mainly expressed in the neurons. CONCLUSIONS: Increased histone acetylation may protect neonatal rats against cortical injury by reducing apoptosis and promoting regeneration of neurons.

METHODS: To address outcomes after allo-SCT in patients with abn(17p), we retrospectively analysed de novo or secondary AML undergoing SCT between 2000 and 2013 from the EBMT registry. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-nine patients with confirmed abn(17p) have been selected. At the time of transplant, one hundred twenty-five were in first remission (CR1). Median age was 54 years old. Abn(17p) was associated with a monosomal karyotype in 83% of patients, complex karyotype in 91%, monosomy 5 or 5q deletion (-5/5q-) in 55%, monosomy 7 (-7) in 39% and both -5/5q and -7 in 27%. Seventy-three patients (59%) had a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) were 28 and 24%, respectively. The 2-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 15%, and 2-year relapse incidence (RI) was 61%. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was 24% and that of chronic GvHD was 21%. In multivariate analysis, the presence of a -5/5q- in addition to abn(17p) was significantly and independently associated with worse OS, LFS and higher RI.

Patients have thrombocytopenia and increased risk of myeloid malignancies, in particular, acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Given the association of variants in the ANKRD26 5'UTR with myeloid neoplasms, we investigated whether, and to what extent, mutations in this region contribute to apparently sporadic AML. To this end, we studied 250 consecutive, non-familial, adult AML patients and screened the first exon of ANKRD26 including the 5'UTR. We found variants in four patients. One patient had the c.-125T>G substitution in the 5'UTR, while three patients carried two different variants in the 5' end of the ANKRD26 coding region (c.3G>A or c.105C>G). Review of medical history showed that the patient carrying the c.-125T>G was actually affected by typical but unrecognized THC2, highlighting that some apparently sporadic AML cases represent the evolution of a well-characterized familial predisposition disorder. As regards the c.3G>A and the c.105C>G, we found that both variants result in the synthesis of N-terminal truncated ANKRD26 isoforms, which are stable and functional in cells, in particular, have a strong ability to activate the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, investigation of one patient with the c.3G>A showed that mutation was associated with strong ANKRD26 overexpression in vivo, which is the proposed mechanism for predisposition to AML in THC2 patients. These data provide evidence that N-terminal ANKRD26 truncating mutations play a potential pathogenetic role in AML. Recognition of AML patients with germline ANKRD26 pathogenetic variants is mandatory for selection of donors for bone marrow transplantation.",,"['Marconi, Caterina', 'Canobbio, Ilaria', 'Bozzi, Valeria', 'Pippucci, Tommaso', 'Simonetti, Giorgia', 'Melazzini, Federica', 'Angori, Silvia', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Torti, Mauro', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Seri, Marco', 'Pecci, Alessandro']","['Marconi C', 'Canobbio I', 'Bozzi V', 'Pippucci T', 'Simonetti G', 'Melazzini F', 'Angori S', 'Martinelli G', 'Saglio G', 'Torti M', 'Pastan I', 'Seri M', 'Pecci A']","['Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Laboratories of Biochemistry, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation and University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

Minimal residual disease detected based on those markers is currently the most reliable prognosis factor in B-ALL. The aim of this study was to use clonal IGH/IGK-Kde gene rearrangements to confirm B-ALL diagnosis and to evaluate the treatment outcome of Tunisian leukemic patients by monitoring the minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction chemotherapy. Seventeen consecutive newly diagnosed B-ALL patients were investigated by multiplex PCR assay and real time quantitative PCR according to BIOMED 2 conditions. The vast majority of clonal VH-JH rearrangements included VH3 gene. For IGK deletion, clonal VK1f/6-Kde recombinations were mainly identified. These rearrangements were quantified to follow-up seven B-ALL after induction using patient-specific ASO. Four patients had an undetectable level of MRD with a sensitivity of up to 10-5. This molecular approach allowed identification of prognosis risk group and adequate therapeutic decision.

RECENT FINDINGS: Approximately half of patients with CML defined fairly narrowly by trial criteria - TKI sensitive, in deep molecular remission for a defined period - can successfully maintain protective levels of response after TKI cessation. Those who cannot appear at very low risk of disease control loss and can promptly regain remission with TKI resumption. Increasing numbers of patients followed longer term in trials have proven as well as a lack of additional late relapse in either group and that 'functional cure' of CML is feasible. Both the definition of remission sufficient to attempt treatment-free remission and the trigger to resume treatment have been relaxed somewhat while outcomes have remained the same. Based on repeated confirmatory data, economic pressures, and pragmatism, the question of feasibility and safety of TKI cessation outside of clinical trials is at hand. SUMMARY: TKI cessation outside of clinical trials, if performed under strict guidelines, utilizing optimal monitoring techniques, with counsel available from experts in the field, and after full disclosure of the risks and benefits with the patient, may be safe (see video, supplemental digital content 1, which summarizes the abstract and offers the author's perspective,http://links.lww.com/COH/A15).",,"['Mauro, Michael J']",['Mauro MJ'],"['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Remission, Spontaneous']",,,2017/01/19 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000321 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Mar;24(2):125-131. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000321.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These agents have improved both survival and quality of life, but results overall remain poor. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent developments in clinical research with HMA in MDS/acute myeloid leukemia over the last year. RECENT FINDINGS: Combination of HMA with B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, and a variety of other agents are underway, as are further studies with reformulated HMA that have more favorable pharmacokinetics (including oral bioavailability). HMA may also be promising in maintenance therapy after allogeneic transplantation. Generally speaking, testing new agents in randomized studies after 'HMA failure,' however, may be suboptimal for assessing efficacy. SUMMARY: No clear 'winner' as a combination partner with HMA or novel formulation of HMA has yet emerged. We concur with growing trends to test novel agents early in the drug development timeline, including the frontline treatment setting in combination with HMA, to bring new agents to Food and Drug Administration approval more quickly.

Patients with MPAL are considered to have poor outcomes. The difficulties in classifying this leukemia, the lack of prospectively collected data concerning therapeutic outcomes, and rare incidence result in much uncertainty as to the best approach for patients with MPAL. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies demonstrated that most MPALs are associated with cytogenetic abnormalities; genetic sequencing studies disclose a high frequency of somatic mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators, tumor suppressors, and transcription factors. The limited available data suggest that higher remission rates are achieved with acute lymphoblastic leukemia-like induction regimens compared with acute myeloid leukemia-type approaches. Allogeneic transplantation in first remission may be associated with improved survival compared with consolidation chemotherapy. SUMMARY: Advances in understanding the genetic landscape of MPAL may allow a more biologically driven classification of this heterogeneous group of leukemias in the future that will lead to optimized therapies for individual patients.

Despite all efforts, standard chemotherapy is still generally applied in fit patients, as already for decades, and for nearly all different subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia. Lack of more specifically targeted therapy and the often older age of the patients are complicating treatment, and in the subgroup of patients achieving a complete remission, the strikingly high frequency of relapse is a characteristic of this disease. This review aims to give an overview of current treatment approaches as well as emerging therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, the approach of a targeted therapy specific to the genetic and/or epigenetic aberrations detected in the individual patient is still not possible, and a 'one treatment fits all' course of action is still used, with allografting as curative consolidation. However, first immunotherapeutic approaches are emerging as treatment options and first phase 1 and 2 studies are described. SUMMARY: Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia with adverse karyotype is still not individualized, most treatment options currently not being curative.

In addition, the mRNA microarray dataset GSE32879 contained mRNA expression data from 16 ICC, 7 CHC, 2 hepatic adenoma, 5 FNH and 7 healthy liver tissue samples. The datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) in ICC samples compared with healthy liver tissues were identified via the limma package, following data preprocessing. Genes that exhibited alternative splicing (AS) in ICC samples were identified via AltAnalyze software. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Analysis. Target genes of DEMs were identified using the TargetScan database. The regulatory association between DEMs and any overlaps among DEGs, alternative splicing genes (ASGs) and target genes of DEMs were retrieved, and a network was visualized using the Cytoscape software. A total of 2,327 DEGs, 70 DEMs and 623 ASGs were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were primarily enriched in biological processes and pathways associated with cell activity or the immune system. A total of 63 overlaps were obtained among DEGs, ASGs and target genes of DEMs, and a regulation network that contained 243 miRNAgene regulation pairs was constructed between these overlaps and DEMs. The overlapped genes, including sproutyrelated EVH1 domain containing 1, protein phosphate 1 regulatory subunit 12A, chromosome 20 open reading frame 194, and DEMs, including hsamiR96, hsamiR1 and hsamiR25, may be potential therapeutic targets for the future treatment of ICC.",,"['Chen, Yaqing', 'Liu, Dan', 'Liu, Pengfei', 'Chen, Yajing', 'Yu, Huiling', 'Zhang, Quan']","['Chen Y', 'Liu D', 'Liu P', 'Chen Y', 'Yu H', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of VIP Ward, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei 071000, P.R.

We found that miR-194 expression was significantly reduced in glioma specimens and cell lines, as detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. The overexpression of miR-194 inhibited while the suppression of miR-194 promoted cell migration, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in glioma cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the B cell-specific moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (Bmi1) was a direct target of miR-194, which was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay, RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. The restoration of Bmi1 expression significantly abrogated the suppressive effect of miR-194 on glioma cell EMT.

ITR-284 has been shown to be a potent carboxamide-derived anticancer agent and to induce apoptosis in leukemia and colon cancer cells. However, little is known whether ITR-284 has anticancer activity in human lung adenocarcinoma cells through induction of apoptosis and suppression of migration in vitro. We showed that ITR-284 inhibited human lung cancer A549 cells using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and evoked apoptosis via the cell cycle distribution at S phase arrest. After treatment with 20 nM ITR-284 for 24 h, apoptotic cells were induced and detected by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was dose-dependently increased in A549 cells caused by ITR-284. The results from immunoblotting analysis showed an elevation of protein levels of p53 and phosphorylation of p53 in A549 cells prior to ITR-284 exposure. Additionally, apoptosis-associated proteins such as Bax, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP were upregulated after ITR-284 treatment. By wound healing assay, low concentrations (1-5 nM) of ITR-284 exerted a greater effect on inhibition of A549 cell migration. The protein levels of E-cadherin and vimentin, which are the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, were modulated in ITR-284-treated cells assessed by western blot analysis.

In order to improve the management of bladder cancer, it is crucial to identify strategies that may reverse MDR. The effects of three herbal medicines, ginsenoside Rh2, ()epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and resveratrol (RES) on bladder cancer were determined. The effect of these three herbal medicines against the drug resistance in adriamycin (ADM)resistant pumc91 cells (pumc91/ADM) was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit8 cell proliferation assay system. Cell cycle distribution analysis was performed using flow cytometry following treatment with RES. The mRNA and protein expression levels of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), lung resistance protein (LRP), glutathione Stransferase (GST), B cell leukemia/lymphoma2 (BCL2) and topoisomeraseII (TopoII) were evaluated using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence, respectively. RES enhanced the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents on pumc91/ADM cells; however, Rh2 and EGCG were unable to induce a similar effect. Additionally, RES treatment led to S phase cell cycle arrest accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells in the G1 phase. A significant decrease of MRP1, LRP, GST, BCL2 levels and an increase of TopoII levels were observed in RES groups compared with the control group. RES effectively reversed ADM resistance in pumc91/ADM cells and the underlying molecular mechanism may be associated with the alteration of MRP1, LRP, GST, BCL2 and TopoII expression levels.

We performed genome-wide RNA profiling using RNA-Seq to compare the RR group and the complete remission (CR) group (a total of 42 adult AML patients). The Hedgehog (Hh) and PI3K/AKT pathways were upregulated in the RR population, which was further confirmed by western blot and/or qPCR. Overexpression of GLI1 in AML cells led to increased AKT phosphorylation and decreased drug sensitivity, which was attenuated by GLI1 inhibition. By contrast, neither the expression of GLI1 nor apoptosis in response to Ara-C treatment of AML cells was significantly affected by PI3K inhibition. Furthermore, co-inhibition of GLI1 and PI3K induced apoptosis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), which raised serious concerns about the side effects of this treatment.

The sequential use of SUMO and ubiquitin remnant immunoaffinity purification facilitates the dynamic profiling of SUMOylated and ubiquitylated proteins in HEK293 cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Quantitative proteomic analyses reveals crosstalk between substrates that control protein degradation, and highlights co-regulation of SUMOylation and ubiquitylation levels on deubiquitinase enzymes and the SUMOylation of proteasome subunits. The SUMOylation of the proteasome affects its recruitment to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies, and PML lacking the SUMO interacting motif fails to colocalize with SUMOylated proteasome further demonstrating that this motif is required for PML catabolism.",,"['Lamoliatte, Frederic', 'McManus, Francis P', 'Maarifi, Ghizlane', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K', 'Thibault, Pierre']","['Lamoliatte F', 'McManus FP', 'Maarifi G', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Thibault P']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, P.O.

However, the significance of CD25 expression in elderly patients with AML has not yet been investigated. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 154 newly diagnosed AML patients aged 60 years or over by flow cytometry. RESULTS: CD25-positive AML was characterized by high white blood cell counts, secondary AML, rare favorable karyotypes, and positivity for CD34 and CD7 antigens, compared with CD25-negative AML. CD25 positivity was significantly correlated with an inferior complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival. Multivariate analysis showed CD25 positivity to be a significant prognostic predictor of CR and EFS. A regimen of low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin combined with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (CAG) led to higher CR rates in the CD25-positive AML patients than intensive chemotherapies. CD25 expression was increased at relapse and in the development of leukemic status from myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm. DISCUSSION: An effective treatment strategy for elderly patients with CD25-positive AML has not been established. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of a CAG regimen and allogenic stem cell transplantation in patients. CONCLUSION: CD25 is an independent prognostic factor in elderly AML patients.

However, in the cell, proteins with the same biochemical function can participate in different cellular pathways and cannot complement one another. Similarly, two proteins of very different biochemical functions are put in the same class of cellular function; for example, the classification of a gene as an oncogene or a tumour suppressor gene is not related to its biochemical function, but is related to its cellular function. We have taken an approach to identify peptide signatures for cellular function in proteins with known biochemical function. ATPases as a test case, we classified ATPases (2360 proteins) and kinases (517 proteins) from the human genome into different cellular function categories such as transcriptional, replicative, and chromatin remodelling proteins. Using publicly available tool, MEME, we identify peptide signatures shared among the members of a given category but not between cellular functional categories; for example, no motif sharing is seen between chromatin remodelling and transporter ATPases, similarly between receptor Serine/Threonine Kinase and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase. There are motifs shared within each category with significant E value and high occurrence. This concept of signature for cellular function was applied to developmental regulators, the polycomb and trithorax proteins which led to the prediction of the role of INO80, a chromatin remodelling protein, in development. This has been experimentally validated earlier for its role in homeotic gene regulation and its interaction with regulatory complexes like the Polycomb and Trithorax complex.

Prime examples of this are CLL subset 4 BCR IGs using IGHV4-34/IGHD5-18/IGHJ6 and IGKV2-30/IGKJ2 rearrangements. Conspicuously and unlike most CLL IGs, subset 4 IGs do not bind apoptotic cells. By testing the (auto)antigenic reactivities of subset 4 IGs toward viable lymphoid-lineage cells and specific autoantigens typically bound by IGHV4-34(+) IGs, we found IGs from both subset 4 and non-subset 4 IGHV4-34-expressing CLL cases bind naive B cells. However, only subset 4 IGs react with memory B cells. Furthermore, subset 4 IGs do not bind DNA nor i or I carbohydrate antigens, common targets of IGHV4-34-utilizing antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus and cold agglutinin disease, respectively. Notably, we found that subset 4 IG binding to memory B lymphocytes depends on an aspartic acid at position 66 of FR3 in the rearranged IGKV2-30 gene; this amino acid residue is acquired by somatic mutation. Our findings illustrate the importance of positive and negative selection criteria for structural elements in CLL IGs and suggest that autoantigens driving normal B cells to become subset 4 CLL cells differ from those driving IGHV4-34(+) B cells in other diseases.",,"['Catera, Rosa', 'Liu, Yun', 'Gao, Chao', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Magli, Amanda', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chu, Charles C', 'Feizi, Ten', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Catera R', 'Liu Y', 'Gao C', 'Yan XJ', 'Magli A', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Rai KR', 'Chu CC', 'Feizi T', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Glycosciences Laboratory, Imperial College London, Department of Medicine, Burlington Danes Building, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Glycosciences Laboratory, Imperial College London, Department of Medicine, Burlington Danes Building, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Karches Center for Oncology Research, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY, 11030, USA.', 'Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Hempstead, NY, 11549, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170112,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD10 antigen', 'VK mutation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'memory B cells', 'stereotyped B-cell receptor']",2017/01/18 06:00,2017/01/18 06:01,['2017/01/19 06:00'],"['2017/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/18 06:01 [medline]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['molmed.2017.00003 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2017.00003 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2017 Mar;23:1-12. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2017.00003.

It is a chromosomal abnormality caused by a duplication of chromosome 21. DS patients show the presence of a third copy (or a partial third copy) of chromosome 21 (trisomy), as result of meiotic errors. These patients suffer of many health problems, such as intellectual disability, congenital heart disease, duodenal stenosis, Alzheimer's disease, leukemia, immune system deficiencies, muscle hypotonia and motor disorders. About one in 1000 babies born each year are affected by DS. Alterations in the dosage of genes located on chromosome 21 (also called HSA21) are responsible for the DS phenotype. However, the molecular pathogenic mechanisms of DS triggering are still not understood; newest evidences suggest the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. For obvious ethical reasons, studies performed on DS patients, as well as on human trisomic tissues are limited. Some authors have proposed mouse models of this syndrome. However, not all the features of the syndrome are represented. Stem cells are considered the future of molecular and regenerative medicine. Several types of stem cells could provide a valid approach to offer a potential treatment for some untreatable human diseases. Stem cells also represent a valid system to develop new cell-based drugs and/or a model to study molecular disease pathways. Among stem cell types, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells offer some advantages for cell and tissue replacement, engineering and studying: self-renewal capacity, pluripotency and ease of accessibility to donor tissues. These cells can be reprogrammed into completely different cellular types. They are derived from adult somatic cells via reprogramming with ectopic expression of four transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4; or, Oct3/4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28). By reprogramming cells from DS patients, it is possible to obtain new tissue with the same genetic background, offering a valuable tool for studying this genetic disease and to design customized patient-specific stem cell therapies.",,"['Brigida, Anna Lisa', 'Siniscalco, Dario']","['Brigida AL', 'Siniscalco D']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, Second University of Naples, 80138 Napoli, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Second University of Naples, 80138 Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Review', 'Journal Article']",,20161129,India,J Stem Cells Regen Med,Journal of stem cells & regenerative medicine,101552911,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cell transplantation', 'Disease modeling', 'Down Syndrome', 'Induced pluripotent stem cells']",2017/01/18 06:00,2017/01/18 06:01,['2017/01/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/18 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,J Stem Cells Regen Med. 2016 Nov 29;12(2):54-60. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC5227104,,,,,,,,,

We identified 302 germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with relapse after adjusting for treatment and ancestry and 715 additional SNPs associated with relapse in an ancestry-specific manner. We tested for replication of these relapse-associated SNPs in external data sets of antileukemic drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and an independent clinical cohort. 224 SNPs were associated with rapid drug clearance or drug resistance, and 32 were replicated in the independent cohort. The adverse risk associated with black and Hispanic ancestries was attenuated by addition of the 4 SNPs most strongly associated with relapse in these populations (for blacks: model without SNPs hazard ratio (HR)=2.32, P=2.27 x 10(-4), model with SNPs HR=1.07, P=0.79; for Hispanics: model without SNPs HR=1.7, P=8.23 x 10(-)(5), model with SNPs HR=1.31, P=0.065).

In particular, CD33 is strongly expressed in MDSC isolated from patients with MDS where it has an important role in MDSC-mediated hematopoietic suppressive function through its activation by S100A9. Therefore, we tested whether blocking this interaction with a fully human, Fc-engineered monoclonal antibody against CD33 (BI 836858) suppresses CD33-mediated signal transduction and improves the bone marrow microenvironment in MDS. We observed that BI 836858 can reduce MDSC by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which correlated with increases in granule mobilization and cell death. BI 836858 can also block CD33 downstream signaling preventing immune-suppressive cytokine secretion, which correlates with a significant increase in the formation of CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies. Activation of the CD33 pathway can cause reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced genomic instability but BI 836858 reduced both ROS and the levels of double strand breaks and adducts (measured by comet assay and gammaH2AX).

The present study examined TNF-alpha stimulation or priming of exocytosis of the 4 neutrophil granule subsets. TNF-alpha stimulated exocytosis of secretory vesicles and gelatinase granules and primed specific and azurophilic granule exocytosis to fMLF stimulation. Both stimulation and priming of exocytosis by TNF-alpha were dependent on p38 MAPK activity. Bioinformatic analysis of 1115 neutrophil proteins identified by mass spectrometry as being phosphorylated by TNF-alpha exposure found that actin cytoskeleton regulation was a major biologic function. A role for p38 MAPK regulation of the actin cytoskeleton was confirmed experimentally. Thirteen phosphoproteins regulated secretory vesicle quantity, formation, or release, 4 of which-Raf1, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C (PKC) substrate (MARCKS), Abelson murine leukemia interactor 1 (ABI1), and myosin VI-were targets of the p38 MAPK pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of Raf1 reduced stimulated exocytosis of gelatinase granules and priming of specific granule exocytosis. We conclude that differential regulation of exocytosis by TNF-alpha involves the actin cytoskeleton and is a necessary component for priming of the 2 major neutrophil antimicrobial defense mechanisms: oxygen radical generation and release of toxic granule contents.",['(c) Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['McLeish, Kenneth R', 'Merchant, Michael L', 'Creed, T Michael', 'Tandon, Shweta', 'Barati, Michelle T', 'Uriarte, Silvia M', 'Ward, Richard A']","['McLeish KR', 'Merchant ML', 'Creed TM', 'Tandon S', 'Barati MT', 'Uriarte SM', 'Ward RA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; and k.mcleish@louisville.edu.', 'Robley Rex Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Louisville, Kentucky, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,20170117,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/immunology', 'Exocytosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'Gelatinases/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lipoylation/drug effects/immunology', '*Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/immunology', 'Secretory Vesicles/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*immunology/pharmacology', 'alpha-Defensins/immunology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*actin cytoskeleton', '*mass spectrometry', '*p38 MAPK', '*phosphorylation']",2017/01/18 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/01/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.3HI0716-293RR [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.3HI0716-293RR [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2017 Jul;102(1):19-29. doi: 10.1189/jlb.3HI0716-293RR.

We investigated the clinical relevance of CD34(+)CD123(+) LSC-containing cells and antileukemia potency of a novel antibody conjugate SL-101 in targeting CD123(+) LSCs.Experimental Methods and Results: In a retrospective study on 86 newly diagnosed AML patients, we demonstrated that a higher proportion of CD34(+)CD123(+) LSC-containing cells in remission was associated with persistent MRD and predicted shorter relapse-free survival in patients with poor-risk cytogenetics. Using flow cytometry, we explored the potential benefit of therapeutic targeting of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD123(+) cells by SL-101, a novel antibody conjugate comprising an anti-CD123 single-chain Fv fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin A The antileukemia potency of SL-101 was determined by the expression levels of CD123 antigen in a panel of AML cell lines. Colony-forming assay established that SL-101 strongly and selectively suppressed the function of leukemic progenitors while sparing normal counterparts. The internalization, protein synthesis inhibition, and flow cytometry assays revealed the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic activities of SL-101 involved rapid and efficient internalization of antibody, sustained inhibition of protein synthesis, induction of apoptosis, and blockade of IL3-induced p-STAT5 and p-AKT signaling pathways. In a patient-derived xenograft model using NSG mice, the repopulating capacity of LSCs pretreated with SL-101 in vitro was significantly impaired.Conclusions: Our data define the mechanisms by which SL-101 targets AML and warrant further investigation of the clinical application of SL-101 and other CD123-targeting strategies in AML.

In particular, the advent of next-generation-sequencing (NGS)-based technologies and its implementation for the large-scale comprehensive analyses of cancers have greatly advanced our understanding of cancer as a complex dynamic system wherein genetically distinct subclones interact and compete during tumor evolution. Aside from genetic evolution arising from interactions intrinsic to the cell subpopulations within tumors, it is increasingly appreciated that reciprocal interactions between the tumor cell and cellular constituents of the microenvironment further exert selective pressures on specific clones that can impact the balance between tumor immunity and immunologic evasion and escape. Herein, we review the evidence supporting these concepts, with a particular focus on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a disease that has been highly amenable to genomic interrogation and studies of clonal heterogeneity and evolution.

Disease risks scored according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) and presence of comorbidity graded according to the HCT Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) were recognized as relevant clinical variables for HSCT eligibility. Fit patients with higher-risk IPSS-R and those with lower-risk IPSS-R with poor-risk genetic features, profound cytopenias, and high transfusion burden are candidates for HSCT. Patients with a very high MDS transplantation risk score, based on combination of advanced age, high HCT-CI, very poor-risk cytogenetic and molecular features, and high IPSS-R score have a low chance of cure with standard HSCT and consideration should be given to treating these patients in investigational studies. Cytoreductive therapy prior to HSCT is advised for patients with >/=10% bone marrow myeloblasts. Evidence from prospective randomized clinical trials does not provide support for specific recommendations on the optimal high intensity conditioning regimen. For patients with contraindications to high-intensity preparative regimens, reduced intensity conditioning should be considered.

Most relapses occur as the result of acquired mutations in BTK and PLCG2, which may facilitate success with alternative targeted therapies. As outcomes after ibrutinib relapse have been reported to be poor, specific strategies are needed for this patient population. Here, I discuss the diagnosis and management of ibrutinib-refractory CLL. The focus will be on common clinical scenarios that can be mistaken for relapse and how to accurately determine which patients are relapsing. Because there is no established standard of care, I discuss currently available options for standard therapy and existing clinical data.

HBV counters this restriction by expressing HBV X protein (HBx), which targets Smc5/6 for degradation. However, the mechanism by which Smc5/6 suppresses HBV transcription and how HBx is initially expressed is not known. In this study we characterized viral kinetics and the host response during HBV infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) to address these unresolved questions. We determined that Smc5/6 localizes with Nuclear Domain 10 (ND10) in PHH. Co-localization has functional implications since depletion of ND10 structural components alters the nuclear distribution of Smc6 and induces HBV gene expression in the absence of HBx. We also found that HBV infection and replication does not induce a prominent global host transcriptional response in PHH, either shortly after infection when Smc5/6 is present, or at later times post-infection when Smc5/6 has been degraded. Notably, HBV and an HBx-negative virus establish high level infection in PHH without inducing expression of interferon-stimulated genes or production of interferons or other cytokines. Our study also revealed that Smc5/6 is degraded in the majority of infected PHH by the time cccDNA transcription could be detected and that HBx RNA is present in cell culture-derived virus preparations as well as HBV patient plasma. Collectively, these data indicate that Smc5/6 is an intrinsic antiviral restriction factor that suppresses HBV transcription when localized to ND10 without inducing a detectable innate immune response. Our data also suggest that HBx protein may be initially expressed by delivery of extracellular HBx RNA into HBV-infected cells.",,"['Niu, Congrong', 'Livingston, Christine M', 'Li, Li', 'Beran, Rudolf K', 'Daffis, Stephane', 'Ramakrishnan, Dhivya', 'Burdette, Dara', 'Peiser, Leanne', 'Salas, Eduardo', 'Ramos, Hilario', 'Yu, Mei', 'Cheng, Guofeng', 'Strubin, Michel', 'Delaney, William E IV', 'Fletcher, Simon P']","['Niu C', 'Livingston CM', 'Li L', 'Beran RK', 'Daffis S', 'Ramakrishnan D', 'Burdette D', 'Peiser L', 'Salas E', 'Ramos H', 'Yu M', 'Cheng G', 'Strubin M', 'Delaney WE IV', 'Fletcher SP']","['Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, University Medical Center (C.M.U.), Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.', 'Gilead Sciences, Foster City, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170117,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Hepatitis B/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Hepatitis B virus/*immunology', 'Hepatocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",,,2017/01/18 06:00,2017/08/09 06:00,['2017/01/18 06:00'],"['2016/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0169648 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-30975 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 17;12(1):e0169648. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0169648. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CALCOCO2 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SMC5 protein, human)', '0 (SMC6 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (hepatitis B virus X protein)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,PMC5240991,,,"['All authors except Dr. Michel Strubin are employees of Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Two important HTLV-1-encoded proteins, Tax-1 and HBZ, play crucial roles in the generation and maintenance of the oncogenic process. Less information is instead available on the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to HAM/TSP. More importantly, no single specific biomarker has been described that unambiguously define the status of HAM/TSP. Here we report for the first time the finding that HBZ, described until now as an exclusive nuclear protein both in chronically infected and in ATL cells, is instead exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients suffering of HAM/TSP. Interestingly, at the single cell level, HBZ and Tax-1 proteins are never found co-expressed in the same cell, suggesting the existence of mechanisms of expression uncoupling of these two important HTLV-1 viral products in HAM/TSP patients. Cells expressing cytoplasmic HBZ were almost exclusively found in the CD4+ T cell compartment that was not, at least in a representative HAM/TSP patient, expressing the CD25 marker. Less than 1 percent CD8+ T cells were fond positive for HBZ, while B cells and NK cells were found negative for HBZ in HAM/TSP patients. Our results identify the cytoplasmic localization of HBZ in HAM/TSP patient as a possible biomarker of this rather neglected tropical disease, and raise important hypotheses on the role of HBZ in the pathogenesis of the neuromyelopathy associated to HTLV-1 infection.",,"['Baratella, Marco', 'Forlani, Greta', 'Raval, Goutham U', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Gout, Olivier', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Tosi, Giovanna', 'Accolla, Roberto S']","['Baratella M', 'Forlani G', 'Raval GU', 'Tedeschi A', 'Gout O', 'Gessain A', 'Tosi G', 'Accolla RS']","['Department of Surgical and Morphological Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical and Morphological Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical and Morphological Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical and Morphological Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Service de Neurologie, Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild, Paris, France.', ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, France."", 'Department of Surgical and Morphological Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical and Morphological Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170117,United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cytoplasm/*virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic', 'Protein Transport', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spinal Cord Diseases']",,,2017/01/18 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/01/18 06:00'],"['2016/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0005285 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-16-01598 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2017 Jan 17;11(1):e0005285. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0005285. eCollection 2017 Jan.,,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",,,,PMC5271414,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist'],,,,,,

METHODS: We included children with cancer 18 years diagnosed and treated in Ontario who died between January 2003 and December 2012. Deaths were identified using a provincial registry, the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario Networked Information System. Probable causes of TRM were described. RESULTS: Among the 964 deaths identified, 821 were included. The median age at diagnosis was 6.6 years (range 0-18.8) and 51.8% had at least one relapse. Of the deaths examined, TRM occurred in 217/821 (26.4%) while 604/821 (73.6%) were due to progressive cancer. Deaths from TRM did not change over time. Using multiple regression, younger age, leukaemia diagnosis and absence of relapse were independently positively associated with TRM. The most common probable causes of TRM were respiratory, infection and haemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: TRM was responsible for 26.4% of deaths in paediatric cancer. Underlying diagnosis, younger age and absence of relapse were associated with TRM and causes of TRM differed by diagnosis group.

We report the final results of the Stop Imatinib (STIM1) study with a long follow-up. Patients and Methods IM was prospectively discontinued in 100 patients with CML with UMRD sustained for at least 2 years. Molecular recurrence (MR) was defined as positivity of BCR-ABL transcript in a quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay confirmed by a second analysis point that indicated an increase of one log in relation to the first analysis point at two successive assessments or loss of major molecular response at one point. Results The median molecular follow-up after treatment discontinuation was 77 months (range, 9 to 95 months). Sixty-one patients lost UMRD after a median of 2.5 months (range, 1 to 22 months), and one patient died with UMRD at 10 months. Molecular recurrence-free survival was 43% (95% CI, 33% to 52%) at 6 months and 38% (95% CI, 29% to 47%) at 60 months. Treatment was restarted in 57 of 61 patients with MR, and 55 patients achieved a second UMRD with a median time of 4 months (range, 1 to 16 months). None of the patients experienced a CML progression. Analyses of the characteristics of the study population identified that the Sokal risk score and duration of IM treatment were significantly associated with the probability of MR. Conclusion With a median follow-up of more than 6 years after treatment discontinuation, the STIM1 study demonstrates that IM can safely be discontinued in patients with a sustained deep molecular response with no late MR.",,"['Etienne, Gabriel', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Rigal-Huguet, Francoise', 'Nicolini, Franck', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Varet, Bruno', 'Gardembas, Martine', 'Dubruille, Viviane', 'Tulliez, Michel', 'Noel, Marie-Pierre', 'Ianotto, Jean-Christophe', 'Villemagne, Bruno', 'Carre, Martin', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Etienne G', 'Guilhot J', 'Rea D', 'Rigal-Huguet F', 'Nicolini F', 'Charbonnier A', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Legros L', 'Varet B', 'Gardembas M', 'Dubruille V', 'Tulliez M', 'Noel MP', 'Ianotto JC', 'Villemagne B', 'Carre M', 'Guilhot F', 'Rousselot P', 'Mahon FX']","[""Gabriel Etienne and Francois-Xavier Mahon, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux;

The high cost of TOAMs raises concerns about the financial aspect of treatment, especially for patients enrolled in Medicare Part D plans because of the coverage gap. METHODS: We identified patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who were new TOAM users from the SEER registry data linked with Medicare Part D data, from years 2007 to 2012. We followed these patients throughout the calendar year when they started taking the TOAMs and examined their out-of-pocket (OOP) payments and gross drug costs, taking into account their benefit phase, plan type, and cost share group. RESULTS: We found that 726 (81%) of the 898 patients with CML who received TOAMs had reached the catastrophic phase of their Medicare Part D benefit within the year of medication initiation, with a large majority of patients reaching this phase in less than a month. Patients without subsidies showed a clear pattern of a spike in OOP payments when they began treatment with TOAMs. The OOP payment for patients with subsidies was substantially lower. The monthly gross drug costs were similar between patients with and without subsidies. CONCLUSION: Patients experience quick entry and exit from the coverage gap (also called the donut hole) as a result of the high price of TOAMs. Closing the donut hole will provide financial relief during the initial month(s) of treatment but will not completely eliminate the financial burden.",,"['Shen, Chan', 'Zhao, Bo', 'Liu, Lei', 'Shih, Ya-Chen Tina']","['Shen C', 'Zhao B', 'Liu L', 'Shih YT']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,20170117,United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Cost Sharing', '*Drug Costs', 'Female', 'Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Medicare Part D/*economics', 'Middle Aged', 'SEER Program', 'United States']",,,2017/01/18 06:00,2018/05/22 06:00,['2017/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JOP.2016.014639 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2017 Feb;13(2):e152-e162. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2016.014639.

A phase I trial in patients with NHL was conducted to determine safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of venetoclax, a selective, potent, orally bioavailable BCL-2 inhibitor. Patients and Methods A total of 106 patients with relapsed or refractory NHL received venetoclax once daily until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity at target doses from 200 to 1,200 mg in dose-escalation and safety expansion cohorts. Treatment commenced with a 3-week dose ramp-up period for most patients in dose-escalation cohorts and for all patients in safety expansion. Results NHL subtypes included mantle cell lymphoma (MCL; n = 28), follicular lymphoma (FL; n = 29), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; n = 34), DLBCL arising from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Richter transformation; n = 7), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (n = 4), and marginal zone lymphoma (n = 3). Venetoclax was generally well tolerated. Clinical tumor lysis syndrome was not observed, whereas laboratory tumor lysis syndrome was documented in three patients. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 103 patients (97%), a majority of which were grade 1 to 2 in severity. Grade 3 to 4 events were reported in 59 patients (56%), and the most common were hematologic, including anemia (15%), neutropenia (11%), and thrombocytopenia (9%). Overall response rate was 44% (MCL, 75%; FL, 38%; DLBCL, 18%). Estimated median progression-free survival was 6 months (MCL, 14 months; FL, 11 months; DLBCL, 1 month). Conclusion Selective targeting of BCL-2 with venetoclax was well tolerated, and single-agent activity varied among NHL subtypes. We determined 1,200 mg to be the recommended single-agent dose for future studies in FL and DLBCL, with 800 mg being sufficient to consistently achieve durable response in MCL. Additional investigations including combination therapy to augment response rates and durability are ongoing.",,"['Davids, Matthew S', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Seymour, John F', 'Pagel, John M', 'Kahl, Brad S', 'Wierda, William G', 'Puvvada, Soham', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Anderson, Mary Ann', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Dunbar, Martin', 'Zhu, Ming', 'Peale, Franklin', 'Ross, Jeremy A', 'Gressick, Lori', 'Desai, Monali', 'Kim, Su Young', 'Verdugo, Maria', 'Humerickhouse, Rod A', 'Gordon, Gary B', 'Gerecitano, John F']","['Davids MS', 'Roberts AW', 'Seymour JF', 'Pagel JM', 'Kahl BS', 'Wierda WG', 'Puvvada S', 'Kipps TJ', 'Anderson MA', 'Salem AH', 'Dunbar M', 'Zhu M', 'Peale F', 'Ross JA', 'Gressick L', 'Desai M', 'Kim SY', 'Verdugo M', 'Humerickhouse RA', 'Gordon GB', 'Gerecitano JF']","['Matthew S.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors have demonstrated activity in patients with MDS and in vitro synergy with azacitidine. METHODS: A phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of azacitidine and pracinostat was conducted in patients who had International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2-risk or high-risk MDS. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) rate by cycle 6 of therapy. RESULTS: Of 102 randomized patients, there were 51 in the pracinostat group and 51 in the placebo group. The median age was 69 years. The CR rate by cycle 6 of therapy was 18% and 33% (P = .07) in the pracinostat and placebo groups, respectively. No significant differences in overall survival (median, 16 vs 19 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-2.23) or progression-free survival (11 vs 9 months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.546-1.46) were observed between groups. Grade >/=3 adverse events occurred more frequently in the pracinostat group (98% vs 74%), leading to more treatment discontinuations (20% vs 10%). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of azacitidine with pracinostat did not improve outcomes in patients with higher-risk MDS. Higher rates of treatment discontinuation may partially explain these results, suggesting alternative dosing and schedules to improve tolerability may be required to determine the potential of the combination.

Notably, 84% of these regions were also bound by transcription factors (TF) known to play roles in differentiation and B-cell development in a lymphoblastoid cell line. Further, an overall downregulation of eRNA transcripts was observed in pre-B ALL patients and these transcripts were associated with the downregulation of putative target genes involved in B-cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis.

In this study, we aim to quantitatively assess the association between fat consumption and the risk for NHL. METHODS: We reviewed 221 published cohort and case-control studies that reported relative risk (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of NHL and fat intake using PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases. A random-effects model computed summary risk estimates. RESULTS: Based on our literature search, 10 of 221 studies (two cohort and eight case-control studies) were relevant to this meta-analysis. There was a significant association between total fat consumption and increased risk of NHL (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.12-1.42); in addition, subgroup analysis showed a significant correlation with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (RR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.08-1.84) but not with follicular lymphoma (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.97-1.52), small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.68-1.23), nor with T cell lymphoma (RR = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.60-2.09). The funnel plot revealed no evidence for publication bias. CONCLUSION: Total fat consumption, particularly animal fat, increases the risk for NHL.",,"['Han, Tian-Jie', 'Li, Jun-Shan', 'Luan, Xiao-Tian', 'Wang, Ling', 'Xu, Hong-Zhi']","['Han TJ', 'Li JS', 'Luan XT', 'Wang L', 'Xu HZ']","[""a Department of Hematology , Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University , Tai'an , China."", ""b Department of Hematology , Tai'an Central Hospital , Tai'an , China."", ""c Department of Gastroenterology , Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University , Tai'an , China."", ""d Department of Pathology , Tai'an Central Hospital , Tai'an , China."", ""b Department of Hematology , Tai'an Central Hospital , Tai'an , China."", ""a Department of Hematology , Shandong Provincial Hospital, Shandong University , Tai'an , China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,20170117,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,IM,"['Animals', 'Dietary Fats/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*etiology/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Vegetables']",,,2017/01/18 06:00,2018/01/02 06:00,['2017/01/18 06:00'],"['2017/01/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01635581.2017.1263753 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2017 Feb-Mar;69(2):221-228. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2017.1263753.

The purpose of this case-control study was to estimate the association of age at introduction of solids and pediatric ALL. METHODS: 171 ALL cases aged 0-14 years were recruited at Texas Children's Cancer Center and matched on sex, age, and ethnicity to 342 population-based controls. Data were collected on infant feeding and known risk factors for ALL. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the odds ratio of ALL by quartile of age at introduction of solids with the first/earliest quartile (0-4 months) as the reference group. RESULTS: In adjusted models, the odds ratio of ALL among children in quartile 3 (7-9 months) was 4.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-11.71; for children in quartile 4 (>/=10 months) the odds ratio (OR) was 6.03, 95% CI 2.06-17.72. For each additional month of milk formula feeding, the OR of ALL was 1.16, 95% CI 1.08-1.25.

CDC25 phosphatases are key cell cycle regulators. However, how CDC25 activity is precisely controlled remains largely unknown. Here, we show that LIM domain-containing proteins, such as FHL1, increase inhibitory CDC25 phosphorylation by forming a complex with CHK2 and CDC25, and sequester CDC25 in the cytoplasm by forming another complex with 14-3-3 and CDC25, resulting in increased radioresistance in cancer cells. FHL1 expression, induced by ionizing irradiation in a SP1- and MLL1-dependent manner, positively correlates with radioresistance in cancer patients. We identify a cell-penetrating 11 amino-acid motif within LIM domains (eLIM) that is sufficient for binding CHK2 and CDC25, reducing the CHK2-CDC25 and CDC25-14-3-3 interaction and enhancing CDC25 activity and cancer radiosensitivity accompanied by mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis.

The treatment of ALL involves multimodality therapy, and methotrexate (MTX) remains a mainstay of treatment. A complication of MTX therapy includes acute, subacute, and chronic neurotoxocity. Signs and symptoms may range from headaches, dizziness, and mood disorders to seizures and stroke-like symptoms. CASE REPORT: An 18-year-old woman with a history of ALL presented to the emergency department with acute onset of right-sided facial paralysis, right upper extremity flaccid paralysis, and right lower extremity weakness after receiving MTX therapy 3 days earlier. Diagnostic studies were unremarkable and the patient was treated with oral dextromethorphan for presumed MTX-induced neurotoxicity. The patient's symptoms began to improve within hours and she was discharged home within 48 hours with no neurologic deficits. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Emergency physicians should be aware of this complication of MTX therapy given the sensitivity in regards to time with respect to cerebral vascular accidents. An awareness of this complication in the setting of the appropriate history and physical examination can lead to an accurate diagnosis and intervention and the avoidance of administering thrombolytics.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib have been proved to have absolute bioavailability and stable blood concentration in humans. TKIs pharmacokinetics has close relationships with the clinical response and clinical treatment of CML. METHOD: We conducted a systematic PubMed search to look for studies relating to TKIs pharmacokinetics with proper inclusion/exclusion criteria. After looking through a large number of references, we investigated that different generations of TKIs could be influenced by many factors. We chose some typical factors which were closely linked to the common treatment of CML. These factors contain daily dose, diet, individual variability, drug-drug interaction, drugs resistance and drug withdrawal. RESULTS: By summarizing up these influence factors, we hope it can make a contribution to clinical therapy. Above all, the relationship between influence factors and the clinical therapeutic effect is the key point that our research pays attention to.

Rapid and accurate detection of E2 enzymatic activities remains poor. Here, we described the detection of E2 activity on a signal accumulation ISFET biosensor (AMIS sensor) using an artificial RING finger (ARF). The use of ARF enables the simplified detection of E2 activity without a substrate. The high-sensitivity quantitative detection of E2 activities was demonstrated via real-time monitoring over a response range of femtomolar to micromolar concentrations. Furthermore, the monitoring of E2 activities was successfully achieved using human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells following treatment with the anticancer drug bortezomib, which allowed the assessment of the pathological conditions. This strategy is extremely simple and convenient, and the present detection could be widely applied to specific E2s for various types of cancers.

To date, the value of radiotherapy (RT) for the treatment of LC remains controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the effectiveness of various RT doses for LC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2000 and January 2016, 13 patients underwent RT at our institution after exhibiting progressive disease following other treatment modalities. RESULTS: A total of 36 radiation courses were administered to 13 patients (8 females, 5 males) with a median age of 41 years (range 2-76). Radiation modalities included 32 focal treatments, while total skin electron beam therapy was applied to four patients. The median RT dose was 27 Gy (range 8-34). A complete response rate (CRR) to RT was achieved for 32/36 (89%) lesions (100% for AML lesions versus 33% for the other leukemias; P < 0.001). The median duration of local control (DOLC) for the entire cohort was 38 months (range 0-98), while the median survival (MS) from the time of LC presentation was 13 months (range 2.5-106). The CRR for the LC lesions treated with high-dose regimens (>26 Gy) versus low-dose regimens (</=26 Gy) was 95 versus 83%, respectively (P = 0.26), and the median DOLC was 44 months versus 10 months, respectively (P = 0.019). AML patients had a better long-term outcome than the other patients according to median DOLC (40 months versus 2 months, respectively; P < 0.001) and MS (24 versus 6 months, P = 0.004). RT was well tolerated without significant adverse events. CONCLUSION: A radiation dose </=26 Gy confer a comparable CRR to high-dose regimens and appears to be an effective treatment for controlling LC progression. However, radiation doses >26 Gy were associated with a longer DOLC. LC patients with underlying AML are associated with better outcome compared with other types of leukemia.",,"['Elsayad, Khaled', 'Oertel, Michael', 'Haverkamp, Uwe', 'Eich, Hans Theodor']","['Elsayad K', 'Oertel M', 'Haverkamp U', 'Eich HT']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.

In accordance, ET-1 was already shown to contribute to the growth and progression of many different solid cancers. We recently demonstrated that ET-1 has a role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) where it is abnormally expressed. In the context of this malignancy, ET-1 is able to mediate survival, drug-resistance and growth signals in leukemic cells. Previous studies, not conducted in CLL, have shown that ET-1 regulatory mechanisms are numerous and cell specific. Here, we valued the expression of ET-1 in CLL, in relation to DNA methylation but also in response to stimulation of some important pathways for the dialogue between CLL and microenvironment. We found that a high methylation of ET-1 first intron affects the basal expression of ET-1 in CLL. Moreover, we showed that the activation of CD40 or Toll-like receptor (TLR) by extracellular stimuli produces an augment of ET-1 level in CLL cells. Finally, we demonstrated the fundamental role of NF-kB signalling pathway in promoting and maintaining ET-1 expression in CLL cells, both in basal conditions and after CD40 activation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, considerable between-patient heterogeneity in driver mutations complicates evidence-based personalization of cancer care. Here, by reanalyzing data from 1,540 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we explore how large knowledge banks of matched genomic-clinical data can support clinical decision-making. Inclusive, multistage statistical models accurately predicted likelihoods of remission, relapse and mortality, which were validated using data from independent patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Comparison of long-term survival probabilities under different treatments enables therapeutic decision support, which is available in exploratory form online. Personally tailored management decisions could reduce the number of hematopoietic cell transplants in patients with AML by 20-25% while maintaining overall survival rates. Power calculations show that databases require information from thousands of patients for accurate decision support.

Moreover, sophisticated biosensors engineered to contain single or multiple FPs, including Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors, spatiotemporally reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying a variety of pathophysiological processes. However, their usefulness for applied life sciences has yet to be fully explored. Recently, our research group has begun to expand the potential of FPs from basic biological research to the clinic. Here, we describe a method to evaluate the responsiveness of leukemia cells from patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors using a biosensor based on FP technology and the principle of FRET. Upon phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of the biosensor, binding of the SH2 domain to phosphotyrosine induces conformational change of the biosensor and brings the donor and acceptor FPs into close proximity. Therefore, kinase activity and response to kinase inhibitors can be monitored by an increase and a decrease in FRET efficiency, respectively. As in basic research, this biosensor resolves hitherto arduous tasks and may provide innovative technological advances in clinical laboratory examinations.

Here, we analyzed the clinical outcomes of 223 patients with acute leukemia who underwent allo-HSCT while not in complete remission (CR). The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and CR rate. CR was achieved in 79.8% of patients after allo-HSCT. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was significantly associated with CR (P = 0.045). During a median follow-up of 30.1 months, the median OS was 6.1 months. OS was significantly longer in patients with good or standard risk cytogenetic characteristics than in those with poor risk cytogenetic characteristics (P = 0.029, P = 0.030, respectively). Patients who received allo-HSCT from a matched sibling donor had better survival than those with unrelated donors (P = 0.015). Primary chemorefractoriness was not associated with poor survival (P = 0.071). The number of chemotherapies before allo-HSCT was significantly correlated with outcome (P = 0.006). Chronic GVHD was a strong predictor of a longer OS (P = 0.025). In conclusion, survival of patients with primary chemorefractory acute leukemia is not lower when treated upfront with allo-HSCT.

DATA SOURCES: All articles in PubMed with key words ""Coagulation factor XIII"", ""wound"", ""leukemia"", ""tumor"", ""bone,"" and ""pregnancy"" with published date from 2001 to 2016 were included in the study. Frequently cited publications before 2000 were also included. STUDY SELECTION: We reviewed the role of FXIII in biologic processes as documented in clinical, animal, and in vitro studies. RESULTS: FXIII, a member of the transglutaminase (TG) family, plays key roles in various biological processes. Besides its well-known function in coagulation, the cross-linking of small molecules catalyzed by FXIII has been found in studies to help promote wound healing, improve bone metabolism, and prevent miscarriages. The study has also shown that FXIII concentration level differs in the blood of patients with leukemia and solid tumors and offers promises as a diagnostic indicator. CONCLUSIONS: FXIII has many more biologic functions besides being known as coagulation factor. The TG activity of FXIII contributes to several processes, including wound healing, bone extracellular matrix stabilization, and the interaction between embryo and decidua of uterus.

Among all subtypes, a lack of consensus exists regarding the diagnosis and treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patient survival rates have remained modest for the past three decades in AML. Recently, targeted therapy has emerged as a promising treatment. DATA SOURCES: We searched the PubMed database for recently published research papers on diagnostic development, target therapy, and other novel therapies of AML. Clinical trial information was obtained from ClinicalTrials.gov. For the major purpose of this review that is to outline the latest therapeutic development of AML, we only listed the ongoing clinical trials for reference. However, the published results of complete clinical trials were also mentioned. STUDY SELECTION: This article reviewed the latest developments related to the diagnosis and treatment of AML. In the first portion, we provided some novel insights on the molecular basis of AML, as well as provided an update on the classification of AML. In the second portion, we summarized the results of research on potential molecular therapeutic agents including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase/Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors, epigenetic/demethylating agents, and cellular therapeutic agents. We will also highlight ongoing research and clinical trials in pediatric AML. RESULTS: We described clonal evolution and how it changes our view on leukemogenesis, treatment responses, and disease relapse. Pediatric-specific genomic mapping was discussed with a novel diagnostic method highlighted. In the later portion of this review, we summarized the researches on potential molecular therapeutic agents including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase/FLT3 inhibitors, epigenetic/demethylating agents, and cellular therapeutic agents. CONCLUSION: Gene sequencing techniques should set the basis for next-generation diagnostic methods of AML, and target therapy should be the focus of future clinical research in the exploration of therapeutic possibilities.",,"['Yu, Meng-Ge', 'Zheng, Hu-Yong']","['Yu MG', 'Zheng HY']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Beijing 100045; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100045; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100045; Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Beijing 100045; National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100045; Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Beijing 100045; Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2017/01/17 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2017_130_2_211_198004 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.198004 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2017 Jan 20;130(2):211-218. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.198004.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,PMC5282679,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,

In the past two decades, several prognostic factors have been identified to predict the outcome of patients with CLL, but only a few studies investigated more markers together. To predict the time to first treatment (TTFT) in patients of early stages, we evaluated the prognostic role of conventional markers as well as cytogenetic abnormalities and combined them together in a new prognostic scoring system, the CLL prognostic index (CLL-PI). METHODS: Taking advantage of a population of 406 untreated Chinese patients with CLL at early and advanced stage of disease, we identified the strongest prognostic markers of TTFT and, subsequently, in a cohort of 173 patients who had complete data for all 3 variables, we integrated the data of traditional staging system, cytogenetic aberrations, and mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) in CLL-PI. The median follow-up time was 45 months and the end point was TTFT. RESULTS: The median TTFT was 38 months and the 5-year overall survival was 80%. According to univariate analysis, patients of advanced Rai stages (P < 0.001) or with 11q- (P = 0.002), 17p- (P < 0.001), unmutated IGHV (P < 0.001), negative 13q- (P = 0.007) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (P = 0.001) tended to have a significantly shorter TTFT. And subsequently, based on multivariate Cox regression analysis, three independent factors for TTFT were identified: advanced clinical stage (P = 0.002), 17p- (P = 0.050) and unmutated IGHV (P = 0.049). Applying weighted grading of these independent factors, a CLL-PI was constructed based on regression parameters, which could categorize four different risk groups (low risk [score 0], intermediate low [score 1], intermediate high [score 2] and high risk [score 3-6]) with significantly different TTFT (median TTFT of not reached (NR), 65.0 months, 36.0 months and 19.0 months, respectively, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a weighted, integrated CLL-PI prognostic system of CLL patients which combines the critical genetic prognostic markers with traditional clinical stage. This novel modified PI system could be used to discriminate among groups and may help predict the TTFT and prognosis of patients with CLL.",,"['Li, Heng', 'Yi, Shu-Hua', 'Xiong, Wen-Jie', 'Liu, Hui-Min', 'Lyu, Rui', 'Wang, Ting-Yu', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zhong, Shi-Zhen', 'Yu, Zhen', 'Zou, De-Hui', 'Xu, Yan', 'An, Gang', 'Li, Zeng-Jun', 'Qiu, Lu-Gui']","['Li H', 'Yi SH', 'Xiong WJ', 'Liu HM', 'Lyu R', 'Wang TY', 'Liu W', 'Zhong SZ', 'Yu Z', 'Zou DH', 'Xu Y', 'An G', 'Li ZJ', 'Qiu LG']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300041, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'China', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",,,2017/01/17 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ChinMedJ_2017_130_2_135_197978 [pii]', '10.4103/0366-6999.197978 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2017 Jan 20;130(2):135-142. doi: 10.4103/0366-6999.197978.,,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],,,,PMC5282668,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,

In addition, c-Rel is a key regulator of apoptosis in that it influences the expression of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL; conversely, inhibition of c-Rel increases cell apoptosis. To better understand the relationship between c-Rel expression and effects on B- and T-cell expansion, the current study evaluated c-Rel expression in cord blood mononuclear cells. This particular source was selected as cord blood is an important source of cells used for transplantation and immunotherapy, primarily in treating leukemias. As stem cell factor (SCF) and FLT3 are important agents for hematopoietic stem cell expansion, and cytokines like interleukin (IL)-2, -7, and -15 are essential for T- and B- (and also NK) cell development and proliferation, the current study evaluated c-Rel expression in cord blood mononuclear cells and CD34(+ )cells, as well as effects on B-, T-, and NK cells associated with alterations in c-Rel expression, using flow cytometry and PCR. The results showed c-Rel expression increased among cells cultured in the presence of SCF and FLT3 but was reduced when IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15 were used all together. Further, inhibition of c-Rel expression by siRNA reduced cord blood-derived B-, T-, and NK cell differentiation and expansion. These results indicated that with cells isolated from cord blood, c-Rel has an important role in B-, T-, and NK cell differentiation and, further, that agents (select cytokines/growth factors) that could impact on its expression might not only affect immune cell profiles in a host but could potentially also limit apoptotic activities in (non-)immune cells in that host. In the context of cancer (immuno)therapy, in particular, when cord blood is used an important source in stem cell transplantation in leukemia patients, such down-regulating changes in c-Rel levels could be counter-productive.",,"['Fallahi, Shirin', 'Mohammadi, Seyede Momeneh', 'Tayefi Nasrabadi, Hamid', 'Alihemmati, Alireza', 'Samadi, Naser', 'Gholami, Sanaz', 'Shanehbandi, Dariush', 'Nozad Charoudeh, Hojjatollah']","['Fallahi S', 'Mohammadi SM', 'Tayefi Nasrabadi H', 'Alihemmati A', 'Samadi N', 'Gholami S', 'Shanehbandi D', 'Nozad Charoudeh H']","['a Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'b Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'b Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'c Tissue Engineering Research Group , Advanced Research School, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'c Tissue Engineering Research Group , Advanced Research School, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'd Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'b Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'e Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.', 'a Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences , Tabriz , Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170116,England,J Immunotoxicol,Journal of immunotoxicology,101201960,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD34+ cells', '*FLT3', '*NF-kappaB', '*c-Rel', '*cord blood', '*cytokines', '*siRNA', '*stem cell factor (SCF)']",2017/01/17 06:00,2017/10/14 06:00,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1547691X.2016.1250849 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunotoxicol. 2017 Dec;14(1):15-22. doi: 10.1080/1547691X.2016.1250849.

METHODS: The medical records of children diagnosed with varicella or herpes zoster virus, who had underlying hematologic malignancies, were retrospectively reviewed, and the clinical characteristics and outcomes of VZV infection were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-six episodes of VZV infection (herpes zoster in 57 and varicella in 19) were identified in 73 children. The median age of children with VZV infection was 11 years (range, 1-17), and 35 (46.1%) episodes occurred in boys. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common underlying malignancy (57.9%), and 90.8% of the episodes occurred during complete remission of the underlying malignancy. Acyclovir was administered for a median of 10 days (range, 4-97). Severe VZV infection occurred in 16 (21.1%) episodes. Although the finding was not statistically significant, a previous history of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) appeared to be associated with the development of more severe episodes of herpes zoster (P=0.075). CONCLUSION: Clinical characteristics of VZV infection in immunocompromised children were not significantly different from those without it, and clinical outcomes improved after the introduction of acyclovir therapy.

METHODS: The medical records of 16 patients under 21 years of age at the time of t-MN diagnosis were reviewed. RESULTS: The median patient age was 11.5 years (range, 1.6-20.4 yr). Twelve patients had therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, 3 patients had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 patient had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The median latency period was 29 months (range, 11-68 mo). Fourteen patients had cytogenetic aberrations, 8 of whom had an 11q23 abnormality. Of the 13 patients treated with curative intent, 12 patients received myeloid-type induction therapy that led to complete remission (CR) in 8 patients. Nine patients underwent allogeneic transplantation; 4 patients did not undergo transplantation due to chemotherapy-related toxic death (N=3) or parental refusal (N=1). The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival of the 13 patients treated with a curative intent were 46.2% and 30.8%, respectively. For the 9 patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation, the 5-year event-free survival was 66.7%.

Better outcomes have been reported when using acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-type chemotherapy in the treatment of MPAL. METHODS: We compared the outcome of 4 groups of patients with MPAL. Group 1 included patients diagnosed using the 2008/2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification; group 2 included patients diagnosed using the European Group for the Immunological Characterization of Leukemias (EGIL) criteria; group 3 included patients diagnosed using either the EGIL or the 2008/2016 WHO criteria; and group 4 was comprised of patients diagnosed with MPAL using the EGIL classification only. RESULTS: We found a significantly worse disease-free survival (groups 1-4) and overall survival (OS) (groups 2 and 3) when comparing MPAL patients to other acute leukemia (AL) patients. A significantly better OS was obtained in patients (groups 2-4) treated with ALL-type chemotherapy compared to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-type regimens. CONCLUSION: In light of these results, and because a trend (P=0.06) was found with regard to a better OS in group 4 when compared to other AL patients, an argument can be made that the 2008/2016 WHO classification is underpowered to diagnose all MPAL cases, potentially resulting in the suboptimal treatment of some individuals with AL.",,"['Pomerantz, Alan', 'Rodriguez-Rodriguez, Sergio', 'Demichelis-Gomez, Roberta', 'Barrera-Lumbreras, Georgina', 'Barrales-Benitez, Olga', 'Lopez-Karpovitch, Xavier', 'Aguayo-Gonzalez, Alvaro']","['Pomerantz A', 'Rodriguez-Rodriguez S', 'Demichelis-Gomez R', 'Barrera-Lumbreras G', 'Barrales-Benitez O', 'Lopez-Karpovitch X', 'Aguayo-Gonzalez A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico City, Mexico.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Anahuac Mexico Norte, Huixquilucan, State of Mexico, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico City, Mexico.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Anahuac Mexico Norte, Huixquilucan, State of Mexico, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Tlalpan, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161223,Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EGIL classification', 'Mixed-phenotype acute leukemia', 'Suboptimal treatment', 'WHO classification']",2017/01/17 06:00,2017/01/17 06:01,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2016.51.4.233 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2016 Dec;51(4):233-241. doi: 10.5045/br.2016.51.4.233.

As MDS and AML are considered to originate from genetic and molecular defects of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), the main focus of research in this field has focused on the characterization of these cells. Recently, the contribution of BM microenvironment to the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies, in particular MDS and AML has gained more interest. This is based on a better understanding of its physiological role in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Additionally, it was demonstrated as a 'proof of principle' that genetic disruption of cells of the mesenchymal or osteoblastic lineage can induce MDS, MPS or AML in mice. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about the contribution of the BM microenvironment, in particular mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) to the pathogenesis of AML and MDS. Furthermore, potential models integrating the BM microenvironment into the pathophysiology of these myeloid disorders are discussed.

Bosutinib joins the armamentarium of approved TKIs for the treatment of chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive CML resistant to or intolerant of prior therapy. Bosutinib has an adverse-event (AE) profile distinct from that of other TKIs. Diarrhea is the predominant toxicity associated with bosutinib treatment; other commonly reported nonhematologic AEs include rash and liver enzyme elevations. Cardiac events, fluid retention, and electrolyte abnormalities are infrequent. Optimal response to bosutinib requires adherence, which depends, in part, upon optimal management of associated toxicities. The oncology clinician can facilitate this process by providing patient education, timely patient follow-up, and close monitoring to promptly identify and manage AEs. Thus, optimal patient management requires a thorough and current understanding of toxicity profiles and AE management paradigms. This review provides an overview of bosutinib safety data derived from ongoing clinical trials and offers practical clinical strategies currently used to manage toxicities associated with bosutinib treatment in patients with Ph-positive CP, AP, and BP CML.",,"['Ault, Patricia S', 'Rose PharmD, John', 'Nodzon PhD, Lisa A', 'Kaled, Elizabeth S']","['Ault PS', 'Rose PharmD J', 'Nodzon PhD LA', 'Kaled ES']","['MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Pfizer Inc, Collegeville, Pennsylvania.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Review', 'Journal Article']",,20160301,United States,J Adv Pract Oncol,Journal of the advanced practitioner in oncology,101550346,,,,,2017/01/17 06:00,2017/01/17 06:01,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.6004/jadpro.2016.7.2.3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adv Pract Oncol. 2016 Mar;7(2):160-175. doi: 10.6004/jadpro.2016.7.2.3.

To employ anti-CD38-CAR against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts not expressing CD38, it is necessary to induce or increase the intensity of CD38 expression. A lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-releasing assay and flow cytometry showed that anti-CD38-CAR T cells were cytotoxic against AML lines (THP-1 and CMK) expressing high CD38 levels (>99%), in time- and number of effector-dependent manners. In other AML lines (KG1, U937 and HL60) partially expressing CD38, CD38(+) AML cells were killed by CD38-specific T cells, but CD38(-) AML cells remained survived. Intriguingly, 10 nM all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) augmented CD38 expression in KG1, U937 and HL60 cells and primary leukemic cells from AML patients. Moreover, the withdrawal of ATRA from the medium decreased CD38 expression in AML cells. Killing effects of anti-CD38-CAR T cells against AML lines and AML cells were limited without ATRA, whereas CD38-specific T cells enhanced cytotoxicity on AML cells by ATRA in association with enhanced CD38 expression.

In this study, we profiled somatic mutations and their dynamics using next generation sequencing on serial samples from a total of 124 patients, consisting of a 31 patient discovery cohort and 93 patients from two validation cohorts. Whole-exome analysis on the discovery cohort revealed that 29 of 31 patients carry mutations related to at least one of eight commonly mutated pathways in AML. Mutations in genes related to DNA methylation and splicing machinery were found in T-cell samples, which expand at the initial diagnosis of the myelodysplasia, suggesting their importance as early disease events. On the other hand, somatic variants associated with signaling pathways arise or their allelic burdens expand significantly during progression.

In various myeloid neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, basophilia is frequently seen. Acute and chronic basophilic leukemias, albeit rare, have also been described. However, no generally accepted criteria and classification of basophilic leukemias have been presented to date. To address this unmet need, a series of Working Conferences and other meetings were organized between March 2015 and March 2016. The current article provides a summary of consensus statements from these meetings, together with proposed criteria to delineate acute basophilic leukemia (ABL) from chronic basophilic leukemia (CBL) and primary forms of the disease where no preceding myeloid malignancy is detected, from the more common 'secondary' variants. Moreover, the term hyperbasophilia (HB) is proposed for cases with a persistent peripheral basophil count 1000 per mul of blood. This condition, HB, is highly indicative of the presence of an underlying myeloid neoplasm. Therefore, HB is an important checkpoint in the diagnostic algorithm and requires a detailed hematologic investigation. In these patients, an underlying myeloid malignancy is often found and is then labeled with the appendix -baso, whereas primary cases of ABL or CBL are very rare. The criteria and classification proposed in this article should facilitate the diagnosis and management of patients with unexplained basophilia and basophil neoplasms in routine practice, and in clinical studies.",,"['Valent, P', 'Sotlar, K', 'Blatt, K', 'Hartmann, K', 'Reiter, A', 'Sadovnik, I', 'Sperr, W R', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Akin, C', 'Bauer, K', 'George, T I', 'Hadzijusufovic, E', 'Wolf, D', 'Gotlib, J', 'Mahon, F-X', 'Metcalfe, D D', 'Horny, H-P', 'Arock, M']","['Valent P', 'Sotlar K', 'Blatt K', 'Hartmann K', 'Reiter A', 'Sadovnik I', 'Sperr WR', 'Bettelheim P', 'Akin C', 'Bauer K', 'George TI', 'Hadzijusufovic E', 'Wolf D', 'Gotlib J', 'Mahon FX', 'Metcalfe DD', 'Horny HP', 'Arock M']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pathology, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Elisabethinen Hospital Linz, Linz, Austria.', ""Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology and Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical Clinic III for Oncology, Haematology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU de Bordeaux, France."", 'Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany.', 'LBPA CNRS UMR8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,20170116,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Basophils/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocyte Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism/therapy', 'Phenotype']",,,2017/01/17 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201715 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.15 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Apr;31(4):788-797. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.15.

Allo-HSCT patients with drug-refractory CMV infection and lacking virus-specific T cells were treated with a single dose of ex vivo major histocompatibility complex-Streptamer-isolated CMV epitope-specific donor T cells. Forty-four allo-HSCT patients receiving a T-cell-replete (D(+) repl; n=28) or T-cell-depleted (D(+) depl; n=16) graft from a CMV-seropositive donor were screened for CMV-specific T-cell immunity. Eight D(+) depl recipients received adoptive T-cell therapy from their stem cell donor. CMV epitope-specific T cells were well supported and became detectable in all treated patients. Complete and partial virological response rates were 62.5% and 25%, respectively. Owing to longsome third-party donor (TPD) identification, only 8 of the 57 CMV patients transplanted from CMV-seronegative donors (D(-)) received antigen-specific T cells from partially human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched TPDs. In all but one, TPD-derived CMV-specific T cells remained undetectable. In summary, adoptive transfer correlated with functional virus-specific T-cell reconstitution in D(+) depl patients. Suboptimal HLA match may counteract expansion of TPD-derived virus-specific T cells in D(-) patients.",,"['Neuenhahn, M', 'Albrecht, J', 'Odendahl, M', 'Schlott, F', 'Dossinger, G', 'Schiemann, M', 'Lakshmipathi, S', 'Martin, K', 'Bunjes, D', 'Harsdorf, S', 'Weissinger, E M', 'Menzel, H', 'Verbeek, M', 'Uharek, L', 'Kroger, N', 'Wagner, E', 'Kobbe, G', 'Schroeder, T', 'Schmitt, M', 'Held, G', 'Herr, W', 'Germeroth, L', 'Bonig, H', 'Tonn, T', 'Einsele, H', 'Busch, D H', 'Grigoleit, G U']","['Neuenhahn M', 'Albrecht J', 'Odendahl M', 'Schlott F', 'Dossinger G', 'Schiemann M', 'Lakshmipathi S', 'Martin K', 'Bunjes D', 'Harsdorf S', 'Weissinger EM', 'Menzel H', 'Verbeek M', 'Uharek L', 'Kroger N', 'Wagner E', 'Kobbe G', 'Schroeder T', 'Schmitt M', 'Held G', 'Herr W', 'Germeroth L', 'Bonig H', 'Tonn T', 'Einsele H', 'Busch DH', 'Grigoleit GU']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', ""Clinical Cooperation Group 'Immune Monitoring', Helmholtz Center Munich (Neuherberg) and Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany."", ""Clinical Cooperation Group ''Antigen-specific Immunotherapy'', Helmholtz Center Munich (Neuherberg) and Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany."", 'DZIF - National Centre for Infection Research, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', ""Clinical Cooperation Group 'Immune Monitoring', Helmholtz Center Munich (Neuherberg) and Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany."", 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service North-East, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', ""Clinical Cooperation Group ''Antigen-specific Immunotherapy'', Helmholtz Center Munich (Neuherberg) and Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany."", 'Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Anaesthesiology, Deutsches Herzzentrum Munchen, Klinik an der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, St Franziskus-Hospital, Flensburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany.', 'Medical Clinic Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit UKE, Hamburg, Germany.', 'III.

(P)RR has multiple biological actions: prorenin activation, stimulation of the intracellular signaling including extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and functional complex formation with vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (v-ATPase). However, the functional implication of (P)RR in erythroblast cells has not been clarified. The aim of the present study was to clarify changes of (P)RR expression during erythropoiesis and a role of (P)RR in the heme synthesis. (P)RR expression was studied during rapamycin-induced erythropoiesis in a human erythroleukemia cell line, K562. Treatment with rapamycin (100 nM) for 48 hours significantly increased %number of hemoglobin-producing cells, gamma-globin mRNA levels, erythroid specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2) mRNA levels, and heme content in K562 cells. Both (P)RR protein and mRNA levels increased about 1.4-fold during rapamycin-induced erythropoiesis. Suppression of (P)RR expression by (P)RR-specific small interference RNA increased ALAS2 mRNA levels about 1.6-fold in K562 cells, compared to control using scramble RNA, suggesting that (P)RR may down-regulate ALAS2 expression. By contrast, treatment with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of v-ATPase, decreased greatly % number of hemoglobin-producing cells and heme content in K562 cells, indicating that the v-ATPase function is essential for hemoglobinization and erythropoiesis. Treatment with bafilomycin A1 increased (P)RR protein and mRNA levels. In conclusion, we propose that (P)RR has dual actions on erythropoiesis: the promotion of erythropoiesis via v-ATPase function and the down-regulation of ALAS2 mRNA expression. Thus, (P)RR may contribute to the homeostatic control of erythropoiesis.",,"['Kaneko, Kiriko', 'Ohba, Koji', 'Hirose, Takuo', 'Totsune, Kazuhito', 'Furuyama, Kazumichi', 'Takahashi, Kazuhiro']","['Kaneko K', 'Ohba K', 'Hirose T', 'Totsune K', 'Furuyama K', 'Takahashi K']","['Department of Endocrinology and Applied Medical Science, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrolides/pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,,2017/01/17 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.241.35 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2017 Jan;241(1):35-43. doi: 10.1620/tjem.241.35.,,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (prorenin receptor)', '88899-55-2 (bafilomycin A1)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (ALAS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, the use of next-generation sequencers has facilitated intensive exploration of gene mutations resulting in the discovery of many AML-related gene mutations, and in clarifying the clonal evolution process of relapse. Epigenetic regulatory gene mutations have occurred in pre-leukemic cells with normal differentiation potential, and the acquisition of numerous genetic mutations was found to be strongly associated with AML onset, with further co-mutations contributing to clonal diversity and leading to the generation of treatment-resistant clones. As a result of these fruitful findings, the gene mutations of AML are becoming useful as not only prognostic factors but also the targets of molecular medicines such as FLT3 and IDH inhibitors. Most notably, several guidelines have proposed a prognostic classification that groups FLT3ITD, NPM1 mutation, and CEBPA mutation together under conventional chromosomal aberrations.

In comparison with CM solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (CM-DMSO), CM kinetic degradation in both formulations followed a pseudo-first-order reaction, but the half-life of CM in CM-P407 was approx. 200 times longer than in CM-DMSO. Regarding the activity against FLT3 overexpressing EoL-1 leukemic cells, CM-P407 showed higher cytotoxicity than CM-DMSO. Moreover, intracellular uptake to leukemic cells of CM-P407 was 2-3 times greater than that of CM-DMSO. These promising results for CM-P407 will be further investigated in rodents and in clinical studies for leukemia treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

These polymers became one of the most promising drug nanocarriers, providing improved solubility of therapeutics, high loading capacity and controllable biodistribution pattern. In addition, the use of dendrimers as drug delivery devices in cancer therapies may help to overcome the resistance mechanisms by transporting activated drug molecules directly to cancer cells. In the recent years, dendrimers were intensively studied for delivery of nucleoside analogues (NAs), essential elements of antiviral therapies, as well as treatments of leukemia, lymphoma and various types of solid tumors. These agents act as antimetabolites, competing with physiological nucleosides, and interacting with intracellular enzymes and nuclear acids to induce cytotoxicity. However, efficiency of NAs-based therapies is often limited by factors like fast metabolism, disadvantageous biodistribution, low solubility and various side effects. In case of treatment of leukemia, target cells usually develop drug resistance, which reduces the activity of nucleoside analogues even further. Thus, drug carrier systems are studied to improve the efficacy and specificity of action of these compounds. In this review, we summarize available data concerning the possibility of application of dendrimers as delivery devices for nucleoside analogues and their active, triphosphate forms.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AML-iPSCs lacked leukemic potential, but when differentiated into hematopoietic cells, they reacquired the ability to give rise to leukemia in vivo and reestablished leukemic DNA methylation/gene expression patterns, including an aberrant MLL signature. Epigenetic reprogramming was therefore not sufficient to eliminate leukemic behavior. This approach also allowed us to study the properties of distinct AML subclones, including differential drug susceptibilities of KRAS mutant and wild-type cells, and predict relapse based on increased cytarabine resistance of a KRAS wild-type subclone.

We retrospectively analyzed 240 patients treated with auto-HCT in first remission. All patients were treated with standard induction chemotherapy, and CD34(+) stem cells were collected at each cycle of consolidation. Stem cells were infused after total body irradiation (1200 cGy), cytarabine (9 g/m(2)), and melphalan (100 mg/m(2)). Estimated 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and nonrelapse mortality were 58.4%, 55.3%, 38.8%, and 5.9%, respectively. We identified that poor-risk karyotype showed very poor outcome after auto-HCT, and then analyzed 85 patients with good to intermediate-risk molecular cytogenetics with available molecular study results and markers for minimal residual disease (MRD) such as WT1 and core-binding factor (CBF) associated MRD (ie, AML1/ETO and CBFbeta/MYH11). Our data identified that old age, pre-HCT markers for MRD, and high post-HCT WT1, high dose of CD34(+) stem cell (>/=4.5 x 10(6)/kg) infusion, and c-kit or FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with higher relapse rate and poor DFS. Using pre-HCT parameters, except for post-HCT WT1, multivariate analysis revealed that patients with young age (<40 years old), no adverse mutations, and limited dose of CD34(+) stem cells might be good candidate for auto-HCT (3-year DFS and CIR were 83.4% and 16.6%, respectively). Young patients with good- to intermediate-risk molecular cytogenetics may benefit from auto-HCT if stem cell dose is limited.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To understand current patterns of care, we collected axillary data from 2 NST trials: HER2-positive (Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 40601) and triple-negative (CALGB 40603). STUDY DESIGN: Axillary evaluation pre- and post-NST was per the treating surgeon and could include sentinel node biopsy. Post-NST, node-positive patients were recommended to undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We report pre-NST histopathologic nodal evaluation and post-NST axillary surgical procedures with correlation to clinical and pathologic nodal status. RESULTS: Seven hundred and forty-two patients were treated, 704 had complete nodal data pre-NST and post-NST. Pre-NST, 422 (60%) of 704 patients underwent at least 1 procedure for axillary node evaluation (total of 468 procedures): fine needle aspiration (n = 234; 74% positive), core needle biopsy (n = 138; 72% positive), and sentinel node biopsy (n = 96; 33% positive). Pre-NST, 304 patients were considered node-positive. Post-NST, 304 of 704 patients (43%) underwent sentinel node biopsy; 44 were positive and 259 were negative (29 and 36 patients, respectively, had subsequent ALND). Three hundred and ninety-one (56%) patients went directly to post-NST ALND and 9 (1%) pre-NST node-positive patients had no post-NST axillary procedure. Post-NST, 170 (24%) of the 704 patients had residual axillary disease. Agreement between post-NST clinical and radiologic staging and post-NST histologic staging was strongest for node-negative (81%) and weaker for node-positive (N1 31%, N2 29%), with more than half of the clinically node-positive patients found to be pathologic negative (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest there is no widely accepted standard for axillary nodal evaluation pre-NST. Post-NST staging was highly concordant in patients with N0 disease, but poorly so in node-positive disease. Accurate methods are needed to identify post-NST patients without residual axillary disease to potentially spare ALND.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American College of Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrated that cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) express PDGFRalpha heterogeneously, fluctuating between a PDGFRalpha+ (PrE-primed) and a platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM1)-positive state (epiblast-primed). The two surface markers can be co-detected on a third subpopulation, expressing epiblast and PrE determinants (double-positive). In vitro, these subpopulations differ in their self-renewal and differentiation capability, transcriptional and epigenetic states. In vivo, double-positive cells contributed to epiblast and PrE, while PrE-primed cells exclusively contributed to PrE derivatives. The transcriptome of PDGFRalpha(+) subpopulations differs from previously described subpopulations and shows similarities with early/mid blastocyst cells. The heterogeneity did not depend on PDGFRalpha but on leukemia inhibitory factor and fibroblast growth factor signaling and DNA methylation. Thus, PDGFRalpha(+) cells represent the in vitro counterpart of in vivo PrE precursors, and their selection from cultured mESCs yields pure PrE precursors.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

Combination therapy with rituximab enhanced activity in preclinical models. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and activity of venetoclax in combination with rituximab. METHODS: Adult patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (according to the 2008 Modified International Workshop on CLL guidelines) or small lymphocytic lymphoma were eligible for this phase 1b, dose-escalation trial. The primary outcomes were to assess the safety profile, to determine the maximum tolerated dose, and to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax when given in combination with rituximab. Secondary outcomes were to assess the pharmacokinetic profile and analyse efficacy, including overall response, duration of response, and time to tumour progression. Minimal residual disease was a protocol-specified exploratory objective. Central review of the endpoints was not done. Venetoclax was dosed daily using a stepwise escalation to target doses (200-600 mg) and then monthly rituximab commenced (375 mg/m(2) in month 1 and 500 mg/m(2) in months 2-6). Adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for adverse events version 4.0. Protocol-guided drug cessation was allowed for patients who achieved complete response (including complete response with incomplete marrow recovery) or negative bone marrow minimal residual disease. Analyses were done per protocol for all patients who commenced drug and included all patients who received at least one dose of venetoclax. Data were pooled across dose cohorts. Patients are still receiving therapy and follow-up is ongoing. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01682616. FINDINGS: Between Aug 6, 2012, and May 28, 2014, we enrolled 49 patients. Common grade 1-2 toxicities included upper respiratory tract infections (in 28 [57%] of 49 patients), diarrhoea (27 [55%]), and nausea (25 [51%]). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 37 (76%) of 49 patients; most common were neutropenia (26 [53%]), thrombocytopenia (eight [16%]), anaemia (seven [14%]), febrile neutropenia (six [12%]), and leucopenia (six [12%]). The most common serious adverse events were pyrexia (six [12%]), febrile neutropenia (five [10%]), lower respiratory tract infection, and pneumonia (each three [6%]). Clinical tumour lysis syndrome occurred in two patients (resulting in one death) who initiated venetoclax at 50 mg. After enhancing tumour lysis syndrome prophylaxis measures and commencing venetoclax at 20 mg, clinical tumour lysis syndrome did not occur. The maximum tolerated dose was not identified; the recommended phase 2 dose of venetoclax in combination with rituximab was 400 mg. Overall, 42 (86%) of 49 patients achieved a response, including a complete response in 25 (51%) of 49 patients. 2 year estimates for progression-free survival and ongoing response were 82% (95% CI 66-91) and 89% (95% CI 72-96), respectively. Negative marrow minimal residual disease was attained in 20 (80%) of 25 complete responders and 28 (57%) of 49 patients overall. 13 responders ceased all therapy; among these all 11 minimal residual disease-negative responders remain progression-free off therapy. Two with minimal residual disease-positive complete response progressed after 24 months off therapy and re-attained response after re-initiation of venetoclax. INTERPRETATION: A substantial proportion of patients achieved an overall response with the combination of venetoclax and rituximab including 25 (51%) of 49 patients who achieved a complete response and 28 (57%) of 49 patients who achieved negative marrow minimal residual disease with acceptable safety. The depth and durability of responses observed with the combination offers an attractive potential treatment option for patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and could allow some patients to maintain response after discontinuing therapy, a strategy that warrants further investigation in randomised studies.

Available therapies are not specifically aimed at symptom control. Because stimulation of the B-cell receptor activates JAK2 in CLL cells and the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib improves symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis, we postulated that ruxolitinib would improve disease-related symptoms in patients with CLL. We did a phase 2 trial of ruxolitinib to test this hypothesis. METHODS: Symptomatic patients with CLL who did not require systemic therapy were enrolled at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) between Sept 15, 2014, and Sept 20, 2015. Participants were given 10 mg ruxolitinib orally twice a day. Scores on the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), CLL module of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) and symptom-associated interference in daily activities, were assessed before treatment and after 3 months. This trial is ongoing and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02131584). FINDINGS: 41 patients (25 previously untreated for CLL and 16 previously treated) were enrolled. At 3 months, the mean percentage change from baseline in BFI score was 44.3% (SD 35.0, p<0.0001), in symptom interference score was 43.4% (51.5, p<0.0001), and in MDASI score was 42.1% (37.4, p<0.0001). 32 (78%) of the patients experienced 20% or greater reduction in the mean BFI, and 24 (59%) had a reduction of two units or more in worst fatigue score in past 24 hours as assessed by the BFI. The most comment grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (n=2 [5%]), hypertension (n=2 [5%]), insomnia (n=1 [2%]), tinnitus and dizziness (n=1 [2%]), and thrombocytopenia (n=1 [2%]). INTERPRETATION: In patients with CLL, ruxolitinib was associated with significant improvements in disease-related symptoms as measured by BFI, MDASI, and symptom interference scores. Further studies to test the therapeutic efficacy of ruxolitinib in CLL are warranted. FUNDING: Incyte, National Cancer Institute.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and outcome of IFIs in pediatric AML patients in a medical center in Taiwan. METHODS: We performed retrospective chart reviews. We enrolled pediatric AML patients who were admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2005 and December 2014. IFI was defined according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group 2008 consensus criteria. RESULTS: In total, 78 patients were included for analysis. Twenty two episodes of IFIs were identified in 16 patients. The incidence for IFIs was 20.5% (16/78), and no specific trend of increase or decrease was observed through the study period (p=0.374). Candida species caused the majority (59.1%) of IFIs. Prolonged neutropenia and elevated alanine aminotransferase and creatinine values were factors associated with IFIs (p<0.001, p<0.001, and p=0.001, respectively). Patients with endotracheal intubation or inotropes usage had a higher probability of developing IFIs (p<0.001 and p=0.001, respectively). The overall mortality of IFIs was 53% (8/15) over 10 years, and patients with pulmonary aspergillosis had the highest mortality (80%). CONCLUSION: IFIs continue to pose significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric AML patients, and patients with other hematology-oncology cancers. Recognition of factors associated with IFIs may help us early identify IFIs and promptly initiate antifungal therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Recent genomic studies of blood DNA from tens of thousands of people have revealed the presence of remarkably common, age-associated somatic mutations in genes associated with hematologic malignancies. These somatic mutations drive the expansion from a single founding cell to a detectable hematopoietic clone. Owing to the admixed nature of blood that provides a sampling of blood cell production throughout the body, clonal hematopoiesis is a rare view into the biology of pre-malignancy and the direct effects of pre-cancerous lesions on organ dysfunction. Indeed, clonal hematopoiesis is associated not only with increased risk of hematologic malignancy, but also with cardiovascular disease and overall mortality.

This review will focus primarily on the effect of aging on the human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. With age, even though human HSCs increase in number, they have decreased self-renewal capacity and reconstitution potential upon transplantation. As a population, human HSCs become more myeloid-biased in their differentiation potential. This is likely due to the human HSC population becoming more clonal with age, selecting for myeloid-biased HSC clones. The HSC clones that come to predominate with age may also contain disease-causing genetic and epigenetic changes that confer an increased risk of developing into an age-associated clonal hematopoietic disease, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative disorders, or leukemia. The selection of these aged human HSC clones may be in part due to changes in the aging bone marrow microenvironment. While there have been significant advances in the understanding of the effect of aging on mouse hematopoiesis and mouse HSCs, we have comparatively less detailed analyses of the effect of aging on human HSCs. Continued evaluation of human HSCs in the context of aging will be important to determine how applicable the findings in mice and other model organisms are to the human clinical setting.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: The mRNA expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in leukemic cell lines SHI-1, HL-60 and U937 were detected by quantitative RT-PCR. The MMP inhibitor GM6001 was used to inhibit the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knock down the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. Zymography was used to analyze the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the supernatant of different leukemia cell lines treated or untreated with drugs, as well as the RNAi-treated cells. An in vitro BBB model composed of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) was developed on a Matrigel-based insert. Cell invasion through a barrier of Matrigel-based human basement membrane and the BMVECs-based human BBB barrier was assayed to measure the invasive capacity and the capacity to breakdown the BBB of different leukemia cell lines treated or untreated with drugs, as well as the RNAi-treated cells. The morphologic changes of BMVECs after co-culture with different leukemia cell lines treated or untreated with drugs, as well as the RNAi-treated cells in vitro BBB models were observed by invert microscopy and tight junction proteins in these BMVECs were analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope. Results: 1 in circleThe mRNA expression in different leukemic cell lines shown a pronounced transcription of MMP-2 and - 9, and the transcriptional level in SHI-1 cells was the highest among all leukemic cell lines tested (P<0.01). The data of activities of MMP-2 and -9 were consistent with the results of mRNA expression and SHI-1 displayed higher capacity of invasion (P<0.01). 2 in circleAfter incubation 24h with different leukemic cells, the BMVECs disrupted to loss cell-cell contacts and grew in single cell. Confocal imaging showed down-regulations of ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding accompanied by the disruption of BBB in vitro models. SHI-1 cells had stronger alterations to BMVECs, tight junction proteins and the permeability of the BBB than HL-60 and U937 cells. However, GM6001 and the knock-down of MMP-2 and MMP-9 altered the responses of BBB. They reduced the degradation of three tight junction proteins with a decreased permeability of BBB. Conclusion: MMP-2 and MMP-9 secreted by leukemic cells could disrupt the BBB by degrading the tight junction proteins ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding, which contributed the infiltration of leukemic cell into CNS.",,"['Feng, S R', 'Chen, Z X', 'Cen, J N', 'Shen, H J', 'Wang, Y Y', 'Yao, L']","['Feng SR', 'Chen ZX', 'Cen JN', 'Shen HJ', 'Wang YY', 'Yao L']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Animals', '*Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'U937 Cells']",,,2017/01/17 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2017/01/17 06:00'],"['2017/01/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.12.012 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Dec 14;37(12):1070-1076. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.12.012.,,"['EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,PMC7348488,,,,,,,,,

Management of relapsed patients includes standardized intensive risk-adapted regimens based on conventional drugs, and hematopoietic stem cells transplantation for patients with unfavourable features. Biological drugs, in particular the monoclonal antibody epratuzumab and the bi-functional recombinant single chain peptide blinatumomab, have been recently recognized as novel potential agents to be integrated in salvage ALL therapy to further improve rescue outcome. METHODS: A systematic search of peer-reviewed scientific literature and clinical trials in public databases has been carried out. Both clinical and pre-clinical studies have been included to summarize recent evidence on epratuzumab and blinatumomab for salvage ALL therapy. RESULTS: Sixty-two papers and 25 clinical trials were included. Although not all patients responded properly to these agents, their use in relapsed and refractory pediatric ALL seems promising. CONCLUSION: Phase 3 studies have recently begun and more consistent results about epratuzumab and blinatumomab safety and efficacy in comparison to conventional therapies are expected in the next years. Epratuzumab seems safe in the dosing scheme proposed in ALL, but its efficacy over the conventional chemotherapy is still questionable. Blinatumomab has shown promising results in high risk cases such as elder adult patients and conclusive studies on pediatric ALL are needed. Patient inter-individual variability to these agents has not been investigated in depth, but this issue needs to be addressed, in particular for blinatumomab.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Franca, Raffaella', 'Favretto, Diego', 'Granzotto, Marilena', 'Decorti, Giuliana', 'Rabusin, Marco', 'Stocco, Gabriele']","['Franca R', 'Favretto D', 'Granzotto M', 'Decorti G', 'Rabusin M', 'Stocco G']","['Institute for Maternal and Child Health I.R.C.C.S.

However, the drug, to a large extent, does not cause cell death directly and does not eradicate CLL malignant clones. Inability to eradicate CLL has fostered resistance generation. Once patients become resistant, they do poorly with a median survival of 3-4 months. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to prevent resistance, improve treatment outcome and ultimately cure the disease. Herein, we explore dual targeting of the BCR and JAK-STAT pathways with a novel single agent, cerdulatinib, which selectively inhibits both SYK (a BCR component) and JAK kinases. We demonstrated that cerdulatinib delivered potent tumor inhibition in 60 primary CLL patient samples, especially in those with poor prognostic indicators. Importantly, cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib, is able to overcome the support of microenvironment and induces CLL cell death at clinically achievable concentrations. Notably, cerdulatinib blocked proliferation of ibrutinib-resistant primary CLL cells and of BTKC481S-transfected/ibrutinib-resistant lymphoma cells. These anti-tumor effects are well correlated with the inhibition of BCR and JAK-STAT signaling and downstream inhibition of the functions of AKT, ERK and NFkappaB. Collectively, our results show that simultaneous targeting of BCR and JAK-STAT pathways is a more effective strategy relative to single BTK inhibition.",,"['Guo, Ailin', 'Lu, Pin', 'Coffey, Greg', 'Conley, Pamela', 'Pandey, Anjali', 'Wang, Y Lynn']","['Guo A', 'Lu P', 'Coffey G', 'Conley P', 'Pandey A', 'Wang YL']","['Department of Pathology, Lymphoma Translational Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma Translational Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Lymphoma Translational Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'JAK-STAT', 'SYK', 'cerdulatinib', 'molecularly targeted therapy']",2017/01/16 06:00,2017/10/03 06:00,['2017/01/16 06:00'],"['2016/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['14588 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14588 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 21;8(8):12953-12967. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14588.,,"['0', '(4-(cyclopropylamino)-2-((4-(4-(ethylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)amino)pyrimid', 'ine-5-carboxamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfones)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,PMC5355069,,,,,,,,,

They, to certain extent, induce local immune stimulation. Impact of immune stimulation of this period on incidence of GvHD has not been evaluated. We retrospectively studied 238 AML patients transplanted at first remission from 21 French centers in the ALFA-0702 protocol and found that cutaneous and digestive immune stimulation during induction increases the incidence of skin and gut aGVHD, respectively. Furthermore, prolonged febrile duration correlates with elevated incidence of grade II-IV aGvHD. Thus, we identified a group of patients with higher risk of aGvHD. The benefit of personalized GvHD prophylaxis should be explored in a prospective cohort to decrease incidence of aGvHD in these patients and improve their QoLs.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report that P12-20 LIF infusion inhibits somatic maturation of pyramidal neurons and of all interneuron types in vivo. Likewise, DIV 12-20 LIF treatment in organotypic cultures prevents somatic growth GABA-ergic neurons. Further, while NPY expression is increased in the LIF-infused hemispheres, the expression of parvalbumin mRNA and protein, Kv3.1 mRNA, calbindin D-28k protein, and GAD-65 mRNA, but not of GAD-67 mRNA or calretinin protein is substantially reduced. Also, LIF treatment decreases parvalbumin, Kv3.1, Kv3.2 and GAD-65, but not GAD-67 mRNA expression in OTC. Developing cortical neurons are known to depend on neurotrophins. Indeed, LIF alters neurotrophin mRNA expression, and prevents the growth promoting action of neurotophin-4 in GABA-ergic neurons. The results imply that LIF, by altering neurotrophin expression and/or signaling, could counteract neurotrophin-dependent growth and neurochemical differentiation of cortical neurons.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The consequences of SUMOylation are widely variable, depending on the physiological state of the cell and the attached SUMO isoform. Accumulating recent findings have revealed a prominent role of SUMOylation in molecular pathways that govern senescence and ageing.

First the evidence regarding fetal survival is addressed, and afterward we review the evidence regarding morbidity in children with older fathers. The adverse conditions most consistently associated with increased paternal age are stillbirths, musculo-skeletal syndromes, cleft palate, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and retinoblastoma, and neurodevelopmental disorders in the autism spectrum and schizophrenia. Finally, we consider the public health impact of the increasing paternal age. We conclude that the adverse health effects in children that might be caused by the present increase in paternal age are severe but quantitatively of minor importance. However, identification of morbidities that are more frequent in offspring of older fathers, after having taken any maternal age effects and other confounding into account, may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis behind such conditions.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been shown to induce long-term survival in AML patients with active disease. HCT is largely performed with HLA-matched unrelated or HLA-matched related donors. Recently, HCT with HLA-haploidentical related donors has been identified as a feasible option when HLA-matched donors are not immediately available. However, there are little data comparing outcomes for AML patients with active disease who receive haploidentical versus traditionally matched HCT. We retrospectively analyzed data from 99 AML patients with active disease undergoing allogeneic HCT at a single institution. Forty-three patients received unrelated donor HCT, 32 patients received matched related donor HCT, and 24 patients received peripheral blood haploidentical HCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. We found no significant differences between treatment groups in terms of overall survival (OS), event-free survival, transplantation-related mortality, cumulative incidence of relapse, and cumulative incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We performed univariate regression analysis of variables that modified OS in all patients and found only younger age at transplantation and development of chronic GVHD significantly improved outcome. Although limited by our relatively small sample size, these results indicate that haploidentical HCT in active AML patients have comparable outcomes to HCT with traditionally matched donors. Haploidentical HCT can be considered in this population of high-risk patients when matched donors are unavailable or when wait times for transplantation are unacceptably long.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Intensification of chemotherapy and/or total body irradiation (TBI) is not feasible because of excessive toxicity. Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) allows for precise delivery and increased intensity treatment via sculpting radiation to sites with high disease burden or high risk for disease involvement, while sparing normal tissue. We conducted a phase I trial in 51 patients (age range, 16 to 57 years) with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia undergoing HSCT (matched related, matched unrelated, or 1-allele mismatched unrelated) with active disease, combining escalating doses of TMLI (range, 1200 to 2000 cGy) with cyclophosphamide (CY) and etoposide (VP16). The maximum tolerated dose was declared at 2000 cGy, as TMLI simulation studies indicated that >2000 cGy might deliver doses toxic for normal organs at or exceeding those delivered by standard TBI. The post-transplantation nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rate was only 3.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], .7 to 12.0) at day +100 and 8.1% (95% CI, 2.5 to 18.0) at 1 year. The cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 43.1% (95% CI, 29.2 to 56.3) and for grade III and IV, it was 13.7% (95% CI, 6.9 to 27.3).

The TMLI/CY/VP16 conditioning regimen is well tolerated at TMLI doses up to 2000 cGy with a low 100-day and 1-year NRM rate and no increased risk of GVHD with higher doses of radiation.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this analysis, myeloid leukemia factor-1 (MLF1) was found to be significantly downregulated during the course of stretch. We found that MLF1 is highly expressed in the heart, however, its cardiac function is unknown yet. In line with microarray data, MLF1 was profoundly downregulated in in vivo mouse models of cardiomyopathy, and also significantly reduced in the hearts of human patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Our data indicates that the overexpression of MLF1 in NRVCMs inhibited cell proliferation while augmenting apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of MLF1 protected NRVCMs from apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation. Moreover, we found that knockdown of MLF1 protected NRVCMs from hypoxia-induced cell death. The observed accelerated apoptosis is attributed to the activation of caspase-3/-7/PARP-dependent apoptotic signaling and upregulation of p53. Most interestingly, MLF1 knockdown significantly upregulated the expression of D cyclins suggesting its possible role in cyclin-dependent cell proliferation. Taken together, we, for the first time, identified an important role for MLF1 in NRVCM proliferation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We found that unlike other RITs, deletion of domain II from LMB-2 severely compromised its activity. Rather than deletion, we identified T cell epitopes in domain II and used alanine substitutions to identify point mutations that diminished those epitopes. The novel RIT, LMB-142 contains a 38kDa toxin and nine point mutations that diminished T cell response to the corresponding peptides by an average of 75%.

Here, we present an observational study on 65 PV patients aged 65 years or younger, who received either peg-IFN (30) or HU (35) according to the physician choice. Median follow-up was 75 months. The two cohorts were comparable for patient and disease characteristics. Eighty-seven percent of the patients treated with peg-INF responded, with a CR rate of 70% as compared to 100 and 49% with HU, respectively. Discontinuation rate was similar in the two groups (20% in peg-IFN vs 17% in HU). JAK2 allele burden was monitored in peg-INF arm only, and a reduction was observed in 88% of the patients. No thrombotic events were observed during peg-IFN treatment compared to three on HU. Disease progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia occurred to a patient only in peg-INF, compared to three in HU. Overall, three second malignancies were observed during the study, two in patients who received HU only, and one in a patient largely treated HU who received also peg-IFN for 3 months. Overall survival was significantly better for peg-IFN patients compared to HU, p = 0.027. Our study, albeit limited by small patient and event number and lack of randomization, confirms the efficacy of peg-INF in PV and shows a significant survival advantage for peg-INF-treated patients.

Inhibition of mutated FLT3 in combination with chemotherapy has displayed promising results in clinical trials. However, one of the major obstacles in targeting FLT3 is the development of resistant disease due to secondary mutations in FLT3 that lead to relapse. FLT3 and its oncogenic mutants signal through associating proteins that activate downstream signaling. Thus, targeting proteins that interact with FLT3 and their downstream signaling cascades can be an alternative approach to treat FLT3-dependent AML. We used an SH2 domain array screen to identify novel FLT3 interacting proteins and identified ABL2 as a potent interacting partner of FLT3. To understand the role of ABL2 in FLT3-mediated biological and cellular events, we used the murine pro-B cell line Ba/F3 as a model system. Overexpression of ABL2 in Ba/F3 cells expressing an oncogenic mutant of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) resulted in partial inhibition of FLT3-ITD-dependent cell proliferation and colony formation. ABL2 expression did not alter the kinase activity of FLT3, its ubiquitination or its stability. However, it partially blocked FLT3-induced AKT phosphorylation without affecting ERK1/2 and p38 activation.

Loss of Gadd45a was observed to accelerate BCR-ABL driven CML resulting in the development of a more aggressive disease, a significantly shortened median mice survival time, and increased BCR-ABL expressing leukemic stem/progenitor cells (GFP+Lin- cKit+Sca+). GADD45A deficient progenitors expressing BCR-ABL exhibited increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis relative to WT counterparts, which was associated with enhanced PI3K-AKT-mTOR-4E-BP1 signaling, upregulation of p30C/EBPalpha expression, and hyper-activation of p38 and Stat5. Furthermore, Gadd45a expression in samples obtained from CML patients was upregulated in more indolent chronic phase CML samples and down regulated in aggressive accelerated phase CML and blast crisis CML. These results provide novel evidence that Gadd45a functions as a suppressor of BCR/ABL driven leukemia and may provide a unique prognostic marker of CML progression.",,"['Mukherjee, Kaushiki', 'Sha, Xiaojin', 'Magimaidas, Andrew', 'Maifrede, Silvia', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Hoffman, Barbara', 'Liebermann, Dan A']","['Mukherjee K', 'Sha X', 'Magimaidas A', 'Maifrede S', 'Skorski T', 'Bhatia R', 'Hoffman B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Pharmacology and Translational Therapeutics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Genetics and Molecular Biochemistry, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['Gadd45a', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'stress response protein', 'tumor suppressor']",2017/01/14 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2017/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['14580 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14580 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 14;8(7):10809-10821. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14580.,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (Gadd45a protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,"['R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA162403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5355225,,,,,,,,,

Targeting UPS has been validated as a novel strategy for treating human cancer, as inhibitors of the 20S proteasome catalytic activity are currently in clinical use for treatment of multiple myeloma and other cancers, and the deubiquitinase activity associated with the proteasome is also a valid target for anticancer agents. Recent studies suggested that zinc pyrithione, an FDA-approved antidandruff agent, may have antitumor activity, but the detailed molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here we report that zinc pyrithione (ZnPT) targets the proteasome-associated DUBs (USP14 and UCHL5) and inhibits their activities, resulting in a rapid accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, but without inhibiting the proteolytic activities of 20S proteasomes. Furthermore, ZnPT exhibits cytotoxic effects against various cancer cell lines in vitro, selectively kills bone marrow cells from leukemia patients ex vivo, and efficiently inhibits the growth of lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell xenografts in nude mice.

We used a multivariate logistic regression to calculate the association between elevated scores on 3 composite BRIEF indices (Behavioral Regulation Index, Metacognition Index, Global Executive Composite [GEC]) and special education and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) outcomes. All BRIEF index scores were significantly associated with receipt of special education services or ADHD. The BRI was most strongly associated with ADHD (odds ratios=4.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.72-10.9). The GEC was most strongly associated with ADHD (odds ratios=4.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.77-11.22). Elevated scores on the BRIEF GEC were associated with low sensitivity (24.1 to 39.1) for detecting the outcomes but better specificity (range, 87.7 to 89.3).

The present study aimed to investigate whether AKT inhibition and glucose deprivation could synergistically kill HCC cells and the molecular mechanisms involved. HCC cells were starved in glucose deprivation, and then the resultant cell death was determined by flow cytometry and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates using a Seahorse XF-24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Glucose deprivation reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates for ATP production, enhanced mitochondrial proton leaks, reduced Mcl-1 expression, and subsequently caused significant cell death in the sensitive HepG2 and HCC-M cells. In the resistant Hep3B and Huh7 cells that survived, glucose starvation induced time-dependent AKT activation. However, blockage of AKT activation using chemical inhibitors (ZSTK474 and LY290042) or specific AKT1-targeting siRNAs could not markedly sensitize glucose deprivation-induced cell death. In contrast, AKT inhibitors or AKT1-targeting siRNAs significantly protected the sensitive HepG2 cells from glucose deprivation-induced cell death.

Multiple lines of evidence indicated that deregulation of miRNAs could be associated with pathological events which are present in the CLL. These molecules have an effect on a variety of targets such as Bcl2, c-fos, c-Myc, TP53, TCL1, and STAT3 which play critical roles in the CLL pathogenesis. It has been shown that expression of miRNAs could lead to the activation of B cells and B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Moreover, exosomes containing miRNAs are one of the other molecules which could contribute to BCR stimulation and progression of CLL cells. Hence, miRNAs and exosomes released from CLL cells could be used as potential diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for CLL. This critical review focuses on a very important aspect of CLL based on biomarker discovery covers the pros and cons of using miRNAs as important diagnostics and therapeutics biomarkers for this deadly disease.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mirzaei, Hamed', 'Fathullahzadeh, Sima', 'Khanmohammadi, Razieh', 'Darijani, Mansoreh', 'Momeni, Fatemeh', 'Masoudifar, Aria', 'Goodarzi, Mohammad', 'Mardanshah, Omid', 'Stenvang, Jan', 'Jaafari, Mahmoud Reza', 'Mirzaei, Hamid Reza']","['Mirzaei H', 'Fathullahzadeh S', 'Khanmohammadi R', 'Darijani M', 'Momeni F', 'Masoudifar A', 'Goodarzi M', 'Mardanshah O', 'Stenvang J', 'Jaafari MR', 'Mirzaei HR']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Medical Biotechnology Research Center, Ashkezar Branch, Islamic Azad University, Ashkezar, Yazd, Iran.', 'Department of pediatric dentistry, School of dentistry, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, School of Dentistry, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Applied Physiology Research Center, Isfahan Cardiovascular Research Institute, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Biotechnology, ACECR, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Department of Biosystems, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven - KULeuven, Heverlee, Belgium.', 'Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Section for Molecular Disease Biology, Department of Veterinary Disease Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Nanotechnology Research Center, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,20170609,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['MicroRNA', 'biomarker', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'diagnosis', 'therapy']",2017/01/14 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/01/14 06:00'],"['2017/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.25799 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Feb;233(2):888-900. doi: 10.1002/jcp.25799.

We, herein, characterized the changes in cytokine expression and the function of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) in patients with MDS, AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (MRC), a well-recognized clinical subtype of secondary AML, and de novo AML. We observed a significant inhibitory effect of MDS-MSC on T lymphocyte proliferation and no significant differences in any of the cytokines tested. AML-MSC inhibited T-cell proliferation only at a very low MSC/T cell ratio. When compared to the control, AML-MRCderived MSC presented a significant increase in IL6 expression, whereas de novo AML MSC presented a significant increase in the expression levels of VEGFA, CXCL12, RPGE2, IDO, IL1beta, IL6 and IL32, followed by a decrease in IL10 expression. Furthermore, data indicate that IL-32 regulates stromal cell proliferation, has a chemotactic potential and participates in stromal cell crosstalk with leukemia cells, which could result in chemoresistance. Our results suggest that the differences between AML-MRC and de novo AML also extend into the leukemic stem cell niche and that IL-32 can participate in the regulation of the bone marrow cytokine milieu.",,"['Lopes, Matheus Rodrigues', 'Pereira, Joao Kleber Novais', 'de Melo Campos, Paula', 'Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Saad, Sara T Olalla', 'Favaro, Patricia']","['Lopes MR', 'Pereira JK', 'de Melo Campos P', 'Machado-Neto JA', 'Traina F', 'Saad ST', 'Favaro P']","['Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center - University of Campinas/Hemocentro - Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center - University of Campinas/Hemocentro - Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center - University of Campinas/Hemocentro - Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center - University of Campinas/Hemocentro - Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center - University of Campinas/Hemocentro - Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Sao Paulo at Ribeirao Preto Medical School, Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center - University of Campinas/Hemocentro - Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Center - University of Campinas/Hemocentro - Unicamp, Instituto Nacional de Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sangue, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Diadema, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170113,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cellular Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics/immunology', 'Chemotaxis/genetics/immunology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/genetics/immunology']",,,2017/01/14 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2017/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['srep40707 [pii]', '10.1038/srep40707 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jan 13;7:40707. doi: 10.1038/srep40707.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,PMC5234038,,,,,,,,,

Defining the compositions of immune cell populations in various tissues from experimental mouse models is critical to understanding the involvement of immune responses in various physiological and patho-physiological conditions. However, non-lymphoid tissues are normally composed of vast and diverse cellular components, which make it difficult to quantify the relative proportions of immune cell types. Here we report the development of a computational algorithm, ImmuCC, to infer the relative compositions of 25 immune cell types in mouse tissues using microarray-based mRNA expression data. The ImmuCC algorithm showed good performance and robustness in many simulated datasets. Remarkable concordances were observed when ImmuCC was used on three public datasets, one including enriched immune cells, one with normal single positive T cells, and one with leukemia cell samples. To validate the performance of ImmuCC objectively, thorough cross-comparison of ImmuCC predicted compositions and flow cytometry results was done with in-house generated datasets collected from four distinct mouse lymphoid tissues and three different types of tumor tissues. The good correlation and biologically meaningful results demonstrate the broad utility of ImmuCC for assessing immune cell composition in diverse mouse tissues under various conditions.",,"['Chen, Ziyi', 'Huang, Anfei', 'Sun, Jiya', 'Jiang, Taijiao', 'Qin, F Xiao-Feng', 'Wu, Aiping']","['Chen Z', 'Huang A', 'Sun J', 'Jiang T', 'Qin FX', 'Wu A']","['Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.', 'Center for Systems Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100005, Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215123, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170113,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Immunological', 'Organ Specificity/*genetics']",,,2017/01/14 06:00,2018/10/20 06:00,['2017/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['srep40508 [pii]', '10.1038/srep40508 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Jan 13;7:40508. doi: 10.1038/srep40508.,,,['Sci Rep. 2017 Mar 24;7:45416.

We fine-mapped the regulatory region located in SMIM1 intron 2 in Swedish blood donors, and observed a strong correlation between expression and rs1175550 as well as with a previously unreported tri-nucleotide insertion (rs143702418; C > CGCA).

PROCEDURE: The clinical courses of 19 patients with relapse (n = 13) or induction failure (n = 6) in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group Ph+ ALL04 study were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Fifteen male and four female patients had a median age of 8 (range 4-15) years at relapse or induction failure. Patients received imatinib in combination with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD) and methotrexate and cytarabine (MTX/Ara-C) (n = 9), imatinib in combination with other chemotherapy (n = 5), chemotherapy without imatinib (n = 2), imatinib alone (n = 2), or no additional chemotherapy (n = 1). Two patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) without achieving complete remission (CR) and died of leukemia. The remaining 17 patients achieved CR with salvage therapies and underwent HSCT whilst in CR: 10 patients remain alive in CR, five died of transplantation-related complications, and two died of relapse. In six of seven patients with available data on minimal residual disease (MRD), imatinib in combination with the first course of hyper-CVAD was more effective in achieving a favorable MRD response compared with the Ph+ ALL04 induction regimen. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that cross-resistance to imatinib failed to develop after conventional chemotherapy. Imatinib in combination with chemotherapy including hyper-CVAD+MTX/Ara-C was effective and safe for relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL patients who received frontline therapy without imatinib.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kodama, Yuichi', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Kawasaki, Hirohide', 'Kato, Itaru', 'Kato, Keisuke', 'Sato, Atsushi', 'Matsumoto, Kimikazu', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Hiramatsu, Hidefumi', 'Sano, Hideki', 'Kaneko, Takashi', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Saito, Akiko M', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Ishii, Eiichi', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki']","['Kodama Y', 'Manabe A', 'Kawasaki H', 'Kato I', 'Kato K', 'Sato A', 'Matsumoto K', 'Kato M', 'Hiramatsu H', 'Sano H', 'Kaneko T', 'Oda M', 'Saito AM', 'Adachi S', 'Horibe K', 'Mizutani S', 'Ishii E', 'Shimada H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kansai Medical University Hirakata Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Ibaraki Children's Hospital, Mito, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Miyagi, Japan."", ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Human Health Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170113,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/therapy', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'hyper-CVAD', 'refractory', 'relapse']",2017/01/14 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26423 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Aug;64(8). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26423.

Adoptive immunotransfer of virus-specific T cells from the donor is a promising therapeutic approach, although production of these cells is challenging, particularly when dealing with low-frequency T cells such as BKV-specific T cells. CASE REPORT: Here, we present a patient who, following haploidentical HCT, developed severe BKV haemorrhagic cystitis, resistant to standard therapy. He responded well to adoptive transfer of donor cells enriched in BKV-specific T cells using the new second-generation CliniMACS Prodigy and the Cytokine Capture System from Miltenyi Biotec. Treatment led to full resolution of both the symptoms and viraemia without unwanted complications.

Proteomic analysis of purified MVs released from islet cells detected the presence of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) antigens, including Env and Gag sequences similar to the well-characterized murine leukemia retroviruses. This raises the possibility that ERV antigens may be expressed in the pancreatic islets via MV secretion. Using virus-like particles produced by co-expressing ERV Env and Gag antigens, and a recombinant gp70 Env protein, we demonstrated that NOD but not diabetes-resistant mice developed anti-Env autoantibodies that increase in titer as disease progresses. A lentiviral-based RNA interference knockdown of Gag revealed that Gag contributes to the MV-induced T-cell response, whose diabetogenic function can be demonstrated via cell-transfer into immune-deficient mice. Finally, we observed that Gag and Env are expressed in NOD islet-derived primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). However, MSCs derived from the islets of diabetes-resistant mice do not express the antigens. Taken together, abnormal ERV activation and secretion of MVs may induce anti-retroviral responses to trigger autoimmunity.","['(c) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Favorable survival probabilities of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in combination with too small patient samples may yet have obstructed the observation of differences in overall survival of patients according to transcript type. To overcome potential power problems, overall survival (OS) probabilities and probabilities of CML-related death were analyzed in 1494 patients randomized to first-line imatinib treatment. METHODS: OS probabilities and probabilities of dying of CML were compared using the log-rank or Gray test whichever was appropriate. Both tests were stratified for the EUTOS long-term survival score. RESULTS: Between the groups with a single transcript, neither OS probabilities (stratified log-rank test: p = 0.106) nor probabilities of CML-related death were significantly different (stratified Gray test: p = 0.256). Regarding OS, the Cox hazard ratio (HR) of transcript type e13a2 (n = 565) to type e14a2 (n = 738) was 1.332 (95% CI 0.940-1.887). Considering probabilities of leukemia-related death, the corresponding subdistribution HR resulted in 1.284 (95% CI 0.758-2.176). Outcome did not change if patients with both transcripts (n = 191) were added to the 738 with type e14a2 only. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic association of transcript type and long-term survival outcome was weak and without clinical relevance. However, earlier reported differences in the rate and the depth of molecular response could be relevant for the chance of successfully discontinuing TKI treatment.

Sixty patients with newly diagnosed B-CLL were evaluated. The healthy control group included 20 age-matched individuals. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, the mRNA expression of genes TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 was measured. TLR4 gene expression was lower in B-CLL patients as compared to the control group and TLR2 gene expression was higher in B-CLL patients than in healthy individuals. TLR9 gene expression was higher in the control group than in patients with B-CLL. TLR4 mRNA expression was lower in patients with advanced-stage CLL (Rai stages III and IV) than in patients with early stage disease (Rai stages 0-II).

It has been shown that CLL B-cells can differentiate into plasma cells in vitro and in vivo. CLL is the most frequent adult leukemia in the western world. It is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by clonal proliferation and the accumulation of mature CD5+ B lymphocytes (1). MM is a clonal plasma cell malignancy that accounts for more than 10% of all hematologic cancers (2). Although secondary cancers [particularly solid tumors (3-5)] can occur with CLL and MM, the concomitant occurrence of these two disorders in the same patient is rare [for a review of the few reported cases, see Ref. (6)]. The clonal relationship between these diseases has not always been clarified but is important in terms of understanding the pathogenesis and optimizing treatment. The clonal relationship between CLL and MM can be evaluated by (i) analyzing immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain and light chain (Ig kappa light chain and Ig lambda light chain) gene rearrangement, (ii) identifying and comparing somatic mutations, and (iii) studying chromosomic aberrations. Nevertheless, Ig rearrangements must always be interpreted in the light of specific phenomena such as allelic exclusion, B-cell receptor (BCR) revision (VH and DH gene replacement), BCR editing, and somatic mutations-events that were not considered in previous studies. These issues can be addressed by sequencing the rearranged Ig genes from sorted populations and interpreting the generated data. In the present study, we evaluated the putative clonal relationship between the two diseases by combining DNA copy number analysis with an assessment of Ig gene rearrangements [clonality assessment, V(D)J sequencing, and somatic hypermutation analysis] in highly enriched CD19+ CD5+ (CLL) and CD38+ CD138+ (MM) cell populations.

Here, we first define a gain-of-function attribute of the most common leukemia-associated CBL mutant, Y371H, by demonstrating its ability to increase proliferation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from CBL-null and CBL/CBL-B-null mice. Next, we express second-site point/deletion mutants of CBL-Y371H in CBL/CBL-B-null HSPCs or the cytokine-dependent human leukemic cell line TF-1 to show that individual or combined Tyr --> Phe mutations of established phosphotyrosine residues (Tyr-700, Tyr-731, and Tyr-774) had little impact on the activity of the CBL-Y371H mutant in HSPCs, and the triple Tyr --> Phe mutant was only modestly impaired in TF-1 cells. In contrast, intact tyrosine kinase-binding (TKB) domain and proline-rich region (PRR) were critical in both cell models. PRR deletion reduced the stem cell factor (SCF)-induced hyper-phosphorylation of the CBL-Y371H mutant and the c-KIT receptor and eliminated the sustained p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT induction by SCF. GST fusion protein pulldowns followed by phospho-specific antibody array analysis identified distinct CBL TKB domains or PRR-binding proteins that are phosphorylated in CBL-Y371H-expressing TF-1 cells. Our results support a model of mutant CBL gain-of-function in which mutant CBL proteins effectively compete with the remaining wild type CBL-B and juxtapose TKB domain-associated PTKs with PRR-associated signaling proteins to hyper-activate signaling downstream of hematopoietic growth factor receptors. Elucidation of mutant CBL domains required for leukemogenesis should facilitate targeted therapy approaches for patients with mutant CBL-driven leukemias.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Nadeau, Scott A', 'An, Wei', 'Mohapatra, Bhopal C', 'Mushtaq, Insha', 'Bielecki, Timothy A', 'Luan, Haitao', 'Zutshi, Neha', 'Ahmad, Gulzar', 'Storck, Matthew D', 'Sanada, Masashi', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Band, Vimla', 'Band, Hamid']","['Nadeau SA', 'An W', 'Mohapatra BC', 'Mushtaq I', 'Bielecki TA', 'Luan H', 'Zutshi N', 'Ahmad G', 'Storck MD', 'Sanada M', 'Ogawa S', 'Band V', 'Band H']","['From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'the Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'the Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'Pathology and Microbiology, College of Medicine, and.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'the Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'Pathology and Microbiology, College of Medicine, and.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'the Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Konoe-Cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'the Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Konoe-Cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases.', 'the Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'the Fred and Pamela Buffet Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198 and.', 'From the Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, hband@unmc.edu.', 'the Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology and Anatomy.', 'Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.', 'Pathology and Microbiology, College of Medicine, and.', 'the Fred and Pamela Buffet Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198 and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,20170112,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', '*Mutation', '*Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylalanine/chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proline/chemistry', 'Protein Domains', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*chemistry/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CBL', '*E3 ubiquitin ligase', '*leukemia', '*mutagenesis', '*oncogene', '*proline-Rich region', '*receptor tyrosine kinase', '*tyrosine kinase binding domain']",2017/01/14 06:00,2017/07/05 06:00,['2017/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)34877-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.772723 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2017 Mar 3;292(9):3666-3682. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.772723.

The median time of relapse is equal to 1 year, after the occurrence of complete remission (range 0.2-5.9 years) (Uyttebroeck et al., 2008). It can be assumed that patients may be treated longer than necessary with undue toxicity.The aim of our model was to investigate whether the duration of the maintenance therapy could be reduced without increasing the risk of relapses and to determine the minimum treatment duration that could be tested in a future clinical trial.We developed a mathematical model of virtual patients with T-LBL in order to obtain a proportion of virtual relapses close to the one observed in the real population of patients from the EuroLB database.

Uncertainty remains as to which markers of bleeding risk are independent predictors. Drawing from 5 large clinical trials that included all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) as part of induction, we assessed known determinants of bleeding at baseline and evaluated them as potential predictors of hemorrhagic death (HD) in the first 30 days of treatment. The studies included were ALLG APML3 (single arm of ATRA + idarubicin +/- prednisone), ALLG APML4 (single arm of ATRA + idarubicin + arsenic trioxide + prednisone), CALGB C9710 (single arm of ATRA + cytarabine + daunorubicin), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ECOG-ACRIN) E2491 (intergroup I0129, consisting of daunorubicin + cytarabine vs ATRA), and SWOG S0521 (single-arm induction of ATRA + cytarabine + daunorubicin). A total of 1009 patients were included in the original trials, of which 995 had sufficient data to be included in our multivariate analysis. In this final cohort, there were 37 HD cases during the first 30 days following induction, for an estimated cumulative incidence of 3.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6% to 5.0%).

The PI3K pathway is commonly dysregulated in human cancer, and drives tumorigenesis by promoting aberrant cell growth and transformation. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 facilitates the activation of many pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins including the serine/threonine kinase AKT. There are three AKT isoforms that are frequently hyperactivated in cancer through mutation, amplification or dysregulation of upstream regulatory proteins. AKT isoforms have converging and opposing functions in tumorigenesis. PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signalling is degraded and terminated by phosphoinositide phosphatases such as phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), proline-rich inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIPP) (INPP5J) and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is rapidly hydrolysed by PIPP to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2), which is further hydrolysed by INPP4B to form phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns3P are also important signalling molecules; PtdIns(3,4)P2 together with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are required for maximal AKT activation and PtdIns3P activates PI3K-dependent serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK3) signalling. Loss of Pten, Pipp or Inpp4b expression or function promotes tumour growth in murine cancer models through enhanced AKT isoform-specific signalling. INPP4B inhibits PtdIns(3,4)P2-mediated AKT activation in breast and prostate cancer; however, INPP4B expression is increased in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), melanoma and colon cancer where it paradoxically promotes cell proliferation, transformation and/or drug resistance. This review will discuss how PTEN, PIPP and INPP4B distinctly regulate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signalling downstream of PI3K and how dysregulation of these phosphatases affects cancer outcomes.",['(c) 2017 The Author(s).'],"['Rodgers, Samuel J', 'Ferguson, Daniel T', 'Mitchell, Christina A', 'Ooms, Lisa M']","['Rodgers SJ', 'Ferguson DT', 'Mitchell CA', 'Ooms LM']","['Cancer Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Victoria 3800, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Victoria 3800, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Victoria 3800, Australia.', 'Cancer Program, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Victoria 3800, Australia lisa.ooms@monash.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170210,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT', '*SGK3', '*cancer', '*phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate', '*phosphoinositide 3-kinase', '*phosphoinositide phosphatases']",2017/01/14 06:00,2017/12/20 06:00,['2017/01/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/28 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20160432 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20160432 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2017 Feb 10;37(1). pii: BSR20160432. doi: 10.1042/BSR20160432.

Here we revealed that PFKFB3, but not PFKFB1, PFKFB2 nor PFKFB4 was a novel downstream substrate of mTOR signaling pathway as PFKFB3 level was augmented after knocking down TSC2 in THP1 and OCI-AML3 cells. Importantly, PFKFB3 silencing suppressed glycolysis and cell proliferation of TSC2 silencing OCI-AML3 cells and activated apoptosis pathway. These results suggested that mTOR up-regulation of PFKFB3 was essential for AML cells survival. Mechanistically, Rapamycin treatment or Raptor knockdown reduced the expression of PFKFB3 in TSC2 knockdown cells, while Rictor silencing did not have such effect. Furthermore, we also revealed that mTORC1 up-regulated PFKFB3 was dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha), a positive regulator of glycolysis. Moreover, PFKFB3 inhibitor PFK15 and rapamycin synergistically blunted the AML cell proliferation.

However, the effect on outcomes of obtaining molecular response itself and the depth of it is not clear. In this study we aimed to determine the frequency of complete molecular response (CMR) during long-term follow-up and the clinical significance of CMR on patient outcomes and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the files of 178 chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients using imatinib therapy. Forty-seven patients with missing data were excluded from the study and the assessment was done in 131 patients. CMR was defined as undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction with a sensitivity level of >/= 10(4) in 2 consecutive analyses at least 3 months apart. Cytogenetic and molecular monitoring during treatment was performed according to the European LeukemiaNet recommendations criteria. Our primary objective was to analyze the association of deeper molecular response with differences in progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients (67%) achieved CMR at any time in a median of 65 months of follow-up. The rate of CMR was higher in patients who achieved CCyR at 12 months and major molecular response (MMR) at 18 months. Fewer events occurred in the CMR group than the MMR group (26.1% vs. 50.0%). Overall survival was not different in both groups. CMR was associated with longer PFS with borderline significance. CONCLUSION: Prolonged imatinib therapy helps to achieve a deeper molecular response in the long-term. Achieving deeper molecular response at any time positively affects maintaining the cytogenetic and molecular responses, and decreases the transformation to accelerated and/or blastic phase. The slight prolongation in PFS did not reach statistical significance.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Drug-induced liver injury is difficult to predict at the pre-clinical stage. This study aimed to clarify the roles of caspase-8 and -9 in CYP2E1 metabolite-induced liver injury in both rats and cell cultures in vitro treated with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), halothane or sevoflurane. The human hepatocarcinoma functional liver cell line was maintained in 3-dimensional culture alone or in co-culture with human acute monocytic leukemia cells. 2. In vivo, laboratory indices of liver dysfunction and histology were normal after administration of sevoflurane. CCl4 treatment increased blood AST/ALT levels, liver caspase-3 and -9 activities and liver malondialdehyde, accompanied by centrilobular hepatocyte necrosis. Halothane increased AST/ALT levels, caspase-3 and -8 activities (but not malondialdehyde) concomitant with widespread hepatotoxicity. In vitro, CCl4 treatment increased caspase-9 activity and decreased both mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell viability. In co-culture, halothane increased caspase-8 activity and decreased MMP and cellular viability. There were no toxic responses in CYP2E1 knockdown in monoculture and co-culture. 3. CYP2E1-inducing compounds play a pivotal role in halogenated hydrocarbon toxicity. 4.

It is unclear whether learning problems manifest already during adolescence. METHODS: We analysed nationwide Danish registries on school grades for Danish children during 2001-2014. Applying a matched design we compared grades of childhood cancer survivors to children without cancer at ninth grade. We estimated grade differences by subject and its correlation to cancer site and age at diagnosis. The available statistical precision allowed for an analysis of more rare cancer sites. RESULTS: The total study population was 793 332 children (mean age 15.24 years and 49.7% girls), of whom 1320 were childhood cancer survivors. Lower rank grades were seen in children with cancer in all school subjects but differed substantially according to cancer site. Most affected were survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumours, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, other malignant neoplasm and germ-cell tumours. Survivors from other cancer types did not obtain lower grades. Lower rank grades were associated with young age at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of childhood cancer differed substantially between cancer sites. The largest effect was among survivors of CNS tumours and leukaemia diagnosed at a young age, suggesting an association with radiation therapy. However, the majority of cancer survivors fare well.

A range of new targeted agents, ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax, have demonstrated such a balance in a second-line setting, offering CLL patients durable remissions and a modest toxicity profile.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the variability of peripheral FLT-3 ligand during the clinical course of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled in this study in order to assess alterations in the circulating levels of FLT-3 ligand during the clinical course of AML. RESULTS: We studied the association in the diagnostic period between the FLT-3 ligand and peripheral blood cells together with serum electrolytes. FLT-3 ligand levels (pg/mL) during the aplastic period due to remission induction and consolidation were higher than the levels at initial diagnosis. On the other hand, the diagnostic and remission induction values of leukocytes and FLT-3 ligand showed an inverse association. These results indicate to us that higher white cell counts are associated with lower FLT-3 ligand levels. We also found a reversed association between FLT-3 ligand and serum lactate dehydrogenase level. However, there was no association between FLT-3 ligand and other serum electrolyte levels. We also found higher FLT-3 ligand levels in male patients. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the inverse proliferative action of FLT-3 ligand on the early myeloid lineage.

However, most solid tumours depend on MCL-1 for survival, which is highly amplified in multiple cancers and a major factor determining chemoresistance. Most MCL-1 inhibitors that have been generated so far, while demonstrating early promise in vitro, fail to exhibit specificity and potency in a cellular context. To address the lack of standardised assays for benchmarking the in vitro binding of putative inhibitors before analysis of their cellular effects, we developed a rapid differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)-based assay, and used it to screen a panel of BH3 mimetics. We next contrasted their binding signatures with their ability to induce apoptosis in a MCL-1 dependent cell line. Of all the MCL-1 inhibitors tested, only A-1210477 induced rapid, concentration-dependent apoptosis, which strongly correlated with a thermal protective effect on MCL-1 in the DSF assay. In cells that depend on both MCL-1 and BCL-XL, A-1210477 exhibited marked synergy with A-1331852, a BCL-XL specific inhibitor, to induce cell death. Despite this selectivity and potency, A-1210477 induced profound structural changes in the mitochondrial network in several cell lines that were not phenocopied following MCL-1 RNA interference or transcriptional repression, suggesting that A-1210477 induces mitochondrial fragmentation in an MCL-1-independent manner. However, A-1210477-induced mitochondrial fragmentation was dependent upon DRP-1, and silencing expression levels of DRP-1 diminished not just mitochondrial fragmentation but also BH3 mimetic-mediated apoptosis. These findings provide new insights into MCL-1 ligands, and the interplay between DRP-1 and the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in the regulation of apoptosis.",,"['Milani, Mateus', 'Byrne, Dominic P', 'Greaves, Georgia', 'Butterworth, Michael', 'Cohen, Gerald M', 'Eyers, Patrick A', 'Varadarajan, Shankar']","['Milani M', 'Byrne DP', 'Greaves G', 'Butterworth M', 'Cohen GM', 'Eyers PA', 'Varadarajan S']","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Crown Street, Liverpool L69 7ZB, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Integrative Biology, University of Liverpool, Crown Street, Liverpool L69 7ZB, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Ashton Street, Liverpool L69 3GE, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170112,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzothiazoles/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Isoquinolines/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Peptide Fragments/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/chemistry']",,,2017/01/13 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/01/13 06:00'],"['2016/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016485 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.485 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Jan 12;8(1):e2552. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.485.,,"['0 (A-1210477)', '0 (A-1331852)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",,,['G120/1030/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],PMC5386385,,,,,,,,,

The molecular regulators of lineage choices in the context of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance remain poorly understood in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To find a potential molecular regulator contributing to lineage distribution and TKI resistance, we undertook an RNA-sequencing approach for identifying microRNAs (miRNAs). Following an unbiased screen, elevated miRNA182-5p levels were detected in Bcr-Abl-inhibited K562 cells (CML blast crisis cell line) and in a panel of CML patients. Earlier, miRNA182-5p upregulation was reported in several solid tumours and haematological malignancies. We undertook a strategy involving transient modulation and CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats)-mediated knockout of the MIR182 locus in CML cells. The lineage contribution was assessed by methylcellulose colony formation assay. The transient modulation of miRNA182-5p revealed a biased phenotype. Strikingly, Delta182 cells (homozygous deletion of MIR182 locus) produced a marked shift in lineage distribution. The phenotype was rescued by ectopic expression of miRNA182-5p in Delta182 cells. A bioinformatic analysis and Hes1 modulation data suggested that Hes1 could be a putative target of miRNA182-5p. A reciprocal relationship between miRNA182-5p and Hes1 was seen in the context of TK inhibition. In conclusion, we reveal a key role for miRNA182-5p in restricting the myeloid development of leukemic cells. We propose that the Delta182 cell line will be valuable in designing experiments for next-generation pharmacological interventions.",,"['Arya, Deepak', 'Sachithanandan, Sasikala P', 'Ross, Cecil', 'Palakodeti, Dasaradhi', 'Li, Shang', 'Krishna, Sudhir']","['Arya D', 'Sachithanandan SP', 'Ross C', 'Palakodeti D', 'Li S', 'Krishna S']","['Cellular Organization and Signalling Group, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore, India.', 'Manipal University, Manipal, India.', 'Cellular Organization and Signalling Group, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore, India.', 'Department of Medicine, St Johns Medical College and Hospitals, Bangalore, India.', 'Stem Cells and Regeneration Group, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Bangalore, India.', 'Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cellular Organization and Signalling Group, National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bangalore, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170112,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Erythroid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factor HES-1/biosynthesis/*genetics']",,,2017/01/13 06:00,2017/10/27 06:00,['2017/01/13 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016471 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.471 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Jan 12;8(1):e2547. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.471.,,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn182 microRNA, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,PMC5386378,,,,,,,,,

Methemoglobinemia is a serious rare adverse effect of rasburicase, more common in patients with G6PD deficiency. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management of this condition can make the difference between successful recovery and significant morbidity. Here we discuss the link of rasburicase with methemoglobinemia and the pathophysiology behind increased incidence of this side effect in G6PD deficient patients. METHODS: We report the case of a 73-year-old African American man who developed methemoglobinemia on rasburicase treatment, who was later confirmed to be G6PD deficient. We reviewed the literature using Pubmed and Google Scholar using the following key words: ""methemoglobinemia"", ""rasburicase"", ""urate oxidase"", tumor lysis syndrome"", G6PD deficiency"", ""hemolytic anemia"" and ""hyperuricemia"". RESULTS: Rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia is more common in patients with G6PD deficiency, and rasburicase is therefore contraindicated in these patients. Clinical presentation includes cyanosis, pallor, methemoglobin levels of 8-12%, and oxygen saturation gap which is evident from ABG analysis, though pulse oximetry is normal. Treatment consists of oxygen supplementation, ascorbic acid and blood transfusion. Importantly, methylene blue is avoided as therapy in G6PD deficiency as it can worsen the methemoglobinemia. CONCLUSION: Rasburicase-induced methemoglobinemia is a serious concern, especially in African- American patients. It should be considered when clinical signs and symptoms are present. Knowledge of this side effect is important in early diagnosis and successful management of the condition.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Khan, Maliha', 'Paul, Shilpa', 'Farooq, Saad', 'Oo, Thein Hlaing', 'Ramshesh, Priya', 'Jain, Nitin']","['Khan M', 'Paul S', 'Farooq S', 'Oo TH', 'Ramshesh P', 'Jain N']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030,.

Because exogenous growth factors have had little success in enhancing chronic wound healing, we investigated whether hyperglycemia-induced AGEs interfere with cellular responses to extracellular signals. We used stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), an angiogenic chemokine also known to promote stem cell recruitment in skin wounds. Approach: Human leukemia-60 (HL-60) cells and mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which express the SDF-1 receptor CXCR-4, were incubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with 25 mM d-glucose. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) was used to block RAGE activation. Response to SDF-1 was measured in cellular migration and ROS assays. A diabetic murine excisional wound model measured SDF-1 liposome and sRAGE activity in vivo. Results: Hyperglycemia led to significant accumulation of AGEs, decreased SDF-1-directed migration, and elevated baseline ROS levels; it suppressed the ROS spike normally triggered by SDF-1. sRAGE decreased the ROS baseline and restored both the SDF-1-mediated spike and cell migration. Topically applied sRAGE alone promoted healing and enhanced the effect of exogenous SDF-1 on diabetic murine wounds. Innovation: While there is interest in using growth factors to improve wound healing, this strategy is largely ineffective in diabetic wounds. We show that sRAGE may restore signaling, thus potentiating the effect of exogenously applied growth factors. Conclusion: Blocking RAGE with sRAGE restores SDF-1-mediated cellular responses in hyperglycemic environments and may potentiate the effectiveness of SDF-1 applied in vivo.",,"['Olekson, Melissa Przyborowski', 'Faulknor, Renea A', 'Hsia, Henry C', 'Schmidt, Ann Marie', 'Berthiaume, Francois']","['Olekson MP', 'Faulknor RA', 'Hsia HC', 'Schmidt AM', 'Berthiaume F']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University , Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University , Piscataway, New Jersey.', 'Department of Surgery, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University , New Brunswick, New Jersey.', 'Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology, and Pathology, New York University Medical Center , New York.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University , Piscataway, New Jersey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Adv Wound Care (New Rochelle),Advances in wound care,101590593,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HL60 cells', 'advanced glycation end-products', 'cell migration', 'hyperglycemia', 'intracellular calcium', 'peripheral mononuclear white blood cells']",2017/01/13 06:00,2017/01/13 06:01,['2017/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/wound.2015.0674 [doi]', '10.1089/wound.2015.0674 [pii]']",ppublish,Adv Wound Care (New Rochelle). 2016 Dec 1;5(12):527-538. doi: 10.1089/wound.2015.0674.,,,,,['T32 GM008339/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC5165672,,,"['Author Disclosure and Ghostwriting No competing financial interests exist.

Enterococci have been recognized as a clinically important pathogen in hospitalized patients. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections cause significant morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To identify epidemiology of VRE colonization and related risk factors among patients with hematological malignancies after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed on 42 patients who underwent bone-marrow transplantation between July 2013 and March 2014. A stool sample was taken from each patient 3-5 days after transplantation and cultured on appropriate media. Suspected colonies of enterococci were detected to species level by their culture characteristics, biochemical reactions and molecular features. VRE were confirmed via phenotypic and genotypic methods. RESULTS: VRE were detected in 14 (33%) of studied samples. 10 (71%) of the detected VRE isolates were identified as high level vancomycin-resistant E. faecium with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of >/=256 mug/mL of vancomycin; 3 isolates were E. galinarum and 1 was E. casseliflavus with an MIC of 8-16 mug/mL. VanA was dominant phenotype and all VRE isolates with high-level of vancomycin resistance had vanA gene. VRE isolation was mostly observed in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) than other diseases. Moreover, antibiotic prophylaxis and hospitalization were independent risk factors for acquisition of VRE after transplantation. CONCLUSION: We found high level of vancomycin-resistance in E. faecium isolates obtained from HSCT patients. The vancomycin-resistant isolates of E.faecium had vanA and/or simultaneously vanB genes.",,"['Kaveh, M', 'Bazargani, A', 'Ramzi, M', 'Sedigh Ebrahim-Saraie, H', 'Heidari, H']","['Kaveh M', 'Bazargani A', 'Ramzi M', 'Sedigh Ebrahim-Saraie H', 'Heidari H']","['Department of Bacteriology and Virology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Bacteriology and Virology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Department of Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Bacteriology and Virology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Bacteriology and Virology, School of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161101,Iran,Int J Organ Transplant Med,International journal of organ transplantation medicine,101535773,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Colonization', 'Enterococcus', 'Risk factors', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Vancomycin']",2017/01/13 06:00,2017/01/13 06:01,['2017/01/13 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/13 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Organ Transplant Med. 2016;7(4):197-205.

This naturally occurring peptide is also present in brain, is elevated in Alzheimer's disease, and is antagonised by a cyclized variant (NBP-14). Here we investigated the effects of NBP-14 in six different cancer cell lines, primary leukemia B-cells and normal B-cells. All cells tested expressed alpha7 nAChR, intracellular and extracellular T14. However, NBP-14 showed low toxicity and weak anti-proliferative effects in the majority of the cell lines and was even less toxic in normal B-cells when compared to primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (P < 0.001). Given the potential role of T14 peptide in metastasis, we next investigated the effects of NBP-14 on tumor cell migration, where it caused a dose-dependent reduction. The extent of NBP-14 inhibition positively correlated with the migration of the cells (r2 = 0.45; P = 0.06). Furthermore, NBP-14 preferentially inhibited the migration of primary leukemia cells when compared with normal B-cells (P = 0.0002); when the normal B-cell data was excluded, this correlation was strengthened (r2 = 0.80; P = 0.006). Importantly, the constitutive alpha7 nAChR expression positively correlated with intracellular T14 levels (r2 = 0.91; P = 0.0003) and inversely correlated with extracellular T14 levels in the cell culture supernatants (r2 = -0.79; P = 0.034).

Constitutively activating mutations of FLT3 map predominately to the juxtamembrane domain (internal tandem duplications; ITD) or the activation loop (AL) of the kinase domain and are detected in about 1/3 of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) effectively target FLT3/ITD mutations, but some activating mutations, particularly those on the AL, are relatively resistant to many FLT3 TKI. We reproduced many of the AL or other non-ITD activating mutations and tested 13 FLT3 TKI for their activity against these and wild-type FLT3. All 13 TKI tested inhibited BaF3/ITD cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner as reported, but most TKI exhibited a wide range of differential activity against AL and other point mutants. Western blotting results examining inhibition of FLT3 autophosphorylation and signaling pathways indicate that many AL mutations reduce TKI binding. Most FLT3 TKI effectively target wild-type FLT3 signaling. As a demonstration of this differential activity, treatment of BaF3 D835Y cells transplanted in BALB/c mice with sorafenib showed no effect in vivo against this mutant whereas lestaurtinib proved effective at reducing disease burden.

T cell costimulation by CD28 contributes to GVHD, but prevention is incomplete when targeting CD28, downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), or Aurora A. Likewise, interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) signaling promotes alloreactivity, yet JAK2 inhibition does not eliminate GVHD. We provide evidence that blocking Aurora A and JAK2 in human T cells is synergistic in vitro, prevents xenogeneic GVHD, and maintains antitumor responses by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Aurora A/JAK2 inhibition is immunosuppressive but permits the differentiation of inducible regulatory T cells (iTregs) that are hyperfunctional and CD39 bright and efficiently scavenge adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Increased iTreg potency is primarily a function of Aurora A blockade, whereas JAK2 inhibition suppresses T helper 17 (TH17) differentiation. Inhibiting either Aurora A or JAK2 significantly suppresses TH1 T cells. However, CTL generated in vivo retains tumor-specific killing despite Aurora A/JAK2 blockade. Thus, inhibiting CD28 and IL-6 signal transduction pathways in donor T cells can increase the Treg/Tconv ratio, prevent GVHD, and preserve antitumor CTL.","['Copyright (c) 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Betts, Brian C', 'Veerapathran, Anandharaman', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Yang, Hua', 'Horna, Pedro', 'Walton, Kelly', 'Cubitt, Christopher L', 'Gunawan, Steven', 'Lawrence, Harshani R', 'Lawrence, Nicholas J', 'Sebti, Said M', 'Anasetti, Claudio']","['Betts BC', 'Veerapathran A', 'Pidala J', 'Yang H', 'Horna P', 'Walton K', 'Cubitt CL', 'Gunawan S', 'Lawrence HR', 'Lawrence NJ', 'Sebti SM', 'Anasetti C']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA. brian.betts@moffitt.org.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Laboratory Medicine, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Translational Research Core, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.', 'Department of Oncologic Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Aurora Kinase A/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/prevention & control', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology', 'Th17 Cells/cytology']",,,2017/01/13 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2017/01/13 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['9/372/eaai8269 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.aai8269 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2017 Jan 11;9(372). pii: 9/372/eaai8269. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aai8269.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (MLN 8237)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '6L1XP550I6 (Fedratinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinase A)']",,,"['K08 HL116547/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA076292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL133823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6368389,['NIHMS852063'],,,,,,,,

The effects of ibrutinib treatment on the T cell compartment, which is clonally expanded and thought to support the growth of malignant B cells in CLL, are not fully characterized. Using next-generation sequencing technology, we characterized the diversity of TCRbeta-chains in peripheral blood T cells from 15 CLL patients before and after 1 y of ibrutinib therapy. We noted elevated CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell numbers and a restricted TCRbeta repertoire in all pretreatment samples. After 1 y of ibrutinib therapy, elevated peripheral blood T cell numbers and T cell-related cytokine levels had normalized, and T cell repertoire diversity increased significantly. Dominant TCRbeta clones in pretreatment samples declined or became undetectable, and the number of productive unique clones increased significantly during ibrutinib therapy, with the emergence of large numbers of low-frequency TCRbeta clones. Importantly, broader TCR repertoire diversity was associated with clinical efficacy and lower rates of infections during ibrutinib therapy. These data demonstrate that ibrutinib therapy increases diversification of the T cell compartment in CLL patients, which contributes to cellular immune reconstitution.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Yin, Qingsong', 'Sivina, Mariela', 'Robins, Harlan', 'Yusko, Erik', 'Vignali, Marissa', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Keating, Michael J', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Wierda, William G', 'Burger, Jan A']","['Yin Q', 'Sivina M', 'Robins H', 'Yusko E', 'Vignali M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating MJ', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Estrov Z', 'Jain N', 'Wierda WG', 'Burger JA']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Leukemia, Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Henan Institute of Hematology, Zhengzhou, Henan 450009, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA 98102; and.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA 98102; and.', 'Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle, WA 98102; and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230; jaburger@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170111,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use']",,,2017/01/13 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/01/13 06:00'],"['2016/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1601190 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1601190 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Feb 15;198(4):1740-1747. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1601190.

Glial activation and the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines are related to the induction of tolerance. We investigated the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on morphine analgesia and tolerance. METHODS: LIF concentrations in rat spinal cords were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after morphine administration. LIF distribution was examined using confocal microscopy. To evaluate the effects of LIF on morphine analgesia and tolerance, LIF was intrathecally administered 30 min before morphine injection. The analgesic effect of morphine was evaluated by measuring tail-flick latency. Human LIF concentrations from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of opioid tolerant patients were also determined by specific ELISA. RESULTS: Chronic morphine administration upregulated LIF concentrations in rat spinal cords. Intrathecal injection of LIF potentiated the analgesic action of morphine. Patch clamp recording of spinal cord slices showed that LIF enhanced DAMGO ([D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin)-induced outward potassium current. The development of tolerance was markedly suppressed by exogenous LIF, whereas neutralizing the endogenously released LIF with anti-LIF antibodies accelerated the tolerance induction. Moreover, LIF concentrations in the CSF of opioid-tolerant patients were higher than those in the opioid-naive controls. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal administration of LIF potentiated morphine antinociceptive activity and attenuated the development of morphine tolerance. Upregulation of endogenously released LIF by long-term use of opioids might counterbalance the tolerance induction effects of other proinflammatory cytokines. LIF might be a novel drug candidate for inhibiting opioid tolerance induction.","['(c) The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'British Journal of Anaesthesia.

Genetic alterations of TET2 occur in myeloid malignancies, and hematopoietic-specific loss of Tet2 induces aberrant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal/differentiation, implicating TET2 as a master regulator of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Despite the functional link between AID and TET in epigenetic gene regulation, the role of AID loss in hematopoiesis and myeloid transformation remains to be investigated. Here, we show that Aid loss in mice leads to expansion of myeloid cells and reduced erythroid progenitors resulting in anemia, with dysregulated expression of Cebpa and Gata1, myeloid/erythroid lineage-specific transcription factors. Consistent with data in the murine context, silencing of AID in human bone marrow cells skews differentiation toward myelomonocytic lineage.

Infertility in male cancer survivors is thought to primarily result from killing of the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) responsible for producing spermatozoa since SSCs turn over slowly and are thereby sensitive to antineoplastic therapies. We previously demonstrated that the cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can preserve spermatogenesis after alkylating chemotherapy (busulfan). METHODS: Male mice were treated with G-CSF or controls before and/or after sterilizing busulfan treatment and evaluated immediately or 10-19 weeks later for effects on spermatogenesis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the protective effect of G-CSF on spermatogenesis was stable for at least 19 weeks after chemotherapy, nearly twice as long as previously shown. Further, G-CSF treatment enhanced spermatogenic measures 10 weeks after treatment in the absence of a cytotoxic insult, suggesting G-CSF acts as a mitogen in steady-state spermatogenesis. In agreement with this conclusion, G-CSF treatment for 3 days before busulfan treatment exacerbated the loss of spermatogenesis observed with G-CSF alone. Reciprocally, spermatogenic recovery was modestly enhanced in mice treated with G-CSF for 4 days after busulfan. These results suggested that G-CSF promoted spermatogonial proliferation, leading to enhanced spermatogenic regeneration from surviving SSCs. Similarly, there was a significant increase in proportion of PLZF+ undifferentiated spermatogonia that were Ki67+ (proliferating) 1 day after G-CSF treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results clarify that G-CSF protects spermatogenesis after alkylating chemotherapy by stimulating proliferation of surviving spermatogonia, and indicate it may be useful as a retrospective fertility-restoring treatment.",,"['Kotzur, Travis', 'Benavides-Garcia, Roberto', 'Mecklenburg, Jennifer', 'Sanchez, Jamila R', 'Reilly, Matthew', 'Hermann, Brian P']","['Kotzur T', 'Benavides-Garcia R', 'Mecklenburg J', 'Sanchez JR', 'Reilly M', 'Hermann BP']","['Department of Biology, The University of Texas at San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA.', 'Department of Biology, The University of Texas at San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA.', 'Department of Biology, The University of Texas at San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA.', 'Department of Biology, The University of Texas at San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA.', 'Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Ophthalmology, The Ohio State University, 1080 Carmack Road, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.', 'Department of Biology, The University of Texas at San Antonio, One UTSA Circle, San Antonio, TX, 78249, USA. brian.hermann@utsa.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170111,England,Reprod Biol Endocrinol,Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&E,101153627,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/toxicity', 'Busulfan/*toxicity', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology', 'Regeneration/drug effects', 'Spermatogenesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Spermatogonia/cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Testis/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adjuvant', 'Cancer', 'Fertility preservation', 'Infertility', 'Late effects', 'Spermatogonial stem cells']",2017/01/13 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2017/01/13 06:00'],"['2016/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12958-016-0226-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12958-016-0226-1 [pii]']",epublish,Reprod Biol Endocrinol. 2017 Jan 11;15(1):7. doi: 10.1186/s12958-016-0226-1.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,,"['R25 GM060655/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 HD062687/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM092334/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HD078916/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T34 GM007717/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5225630,,,,,,,,,

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize outcomes resulting from an institution-specific guideline emphasizing supportive care, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and lower doses of rasburicase. Methods In this retrospective chart review, we compared conservative rasburicase dosing, in accordance with newly developed UMHS tumor lysis syndrome guidelines, with aggressive rasburicase in adult patients (>/= 18 years of age) with hematological or solid tumor malignancies, and a uric acid level between 8 and 15 mg/dL. The primary efficacy outcome assessed the difference in the proportion of patients achieving a uric acid level <8 mg/dL within 48 h using a one-sided noninferiority test. The principle safety outcomes analyzed included incidence of acute kidney injury and hemodialysis requirement. Results One hundred sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Within 48 h of an elevated uric acid level, treatment was successful in 97.03% of patients in the conservative group, as compared with 98.33% in the aggressive group (difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.33 to 5.93). Furthermore, there was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring hemodialysis (2.97% vs. 10.0%, p-value 0.079), or incidence of acute kidney injury (4.0% vs. 12.5%, p-value 1.00) between the treatment group and control group, respectively.

Median follow-up was 17 months. Using IWG criteria, best responses were complete response (CR) in 79 patients (37%), partial response (PR) in 4 (2%), and hematologic improvement (HI) in 10 (5%). Cytogenetic response (CyR) was achieved in 78 patients (36%): complete (CCyR) in 62 (29%) and partial in 16 (7%). CyR was achieved in 48 of 79 patients (61%) with CR, 1 of 14 (7%) with PR/HI, and in 29 of the 123 (24%) with no morphologic response. Median overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) for patients with and without CCyR were 21 and 13 months (P = .007), and 16 and 9 months (P = .001), respectively. By multivariate analysis, the achievement of CCyR was predictive for better OS (HR = 2.1; P < .001). In conclusion, CyR occurs at a rate of 36% (complete in 29%) in patients with MDS treated with HMA and is not always associated with morphological response. The achievement of CCyR is associated with survival improvement and constitutes a major predictive factor for outcome particularly in patients without morphologic response. Therefore, the achievement of CCyR should be considered a milestone in the management of patients with MDS.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Jabbour, Elias', 'Strati, Paolo', 'Cabrero, Monica', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Wei, Qiao', 'Hu, Jianhua', 'Abi Aad, Simon', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Dinardo, Courtney', 'Daver, Naval', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Wierda, William', 'Wei, Yue', 'Colla, Simona', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Jabbour E', 'Strati P', 'Cabrero M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ravandi F', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Wei Q', 'Hu J', 'Abi Aad S', 'Short NJ', 'Dinardo C', 'Daver N', 'Kadia T', 'Wierda W', 'Wei Y', 'Colla S', 'Borthakur G', 'Cortes J', 'Estrov Z', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170213,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/01/12 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24650 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Apr;92(4):351-358. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24650.

However, little is known about the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LIS1 and the susceptibility to myeloid leukemia. In the present study, we systematically screened 5 potentially functional polymorphisms in LIS1, and conducted a case-control study including 660 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and 1034 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population, to assess the association between these SNPs and AML risk. We found that the variant alleles of rs4790348, rs4790353, and rs7209748 could significantly increase the AML risk (rs4790348: adjusted OR=1.31, 95%CI=1.13-1.53 in additive model; rs4790353: adjusted OR=4.97, 95%CI=1.59-15.50 in recessive model; rs7209748: adjusted OR=2.34, 95%CI=1.11-4.94 in recessive model).

Translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene produce fusion proteins such as MLL-AF4 that disrupt epigenetic pathways and cause poor-prognosis leukemias. Here, we find that at a subset of gene targets, MLL-AF4 binding spreads into the gene body and is associated with the spreading of Menin binding, increased transcription, increased H3K79 methylation (H3K79me2/3), a disruption of normal H3K36me3 patterns, and unmethylated CpG regions in the gene body. Compared to other H3K79me2/3 marked genes, MLL-AF4 spreading gene expression is downregulated by inhibitors of the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L.

Here, we describe the essential role of CA9 in the tumorigenicity of cells derived from human adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). We previously established the highly tumorigenic ST1-N6 subline from the ATL-derived ST1 cell line by serial xenotransplantation in NOG mice. In the present study, we first show that CA9 expression is strongly enhanced in ST1-N6 cells. We then sorted ST1 cells by high or low CA9 expression and established ST1-CA9(high) and ST1-CA9(low) sublines. ST1-CA9(high) cells, like ST1-N6 cells, were more strongly tumorigenic than ST1-CA9(low) or parental ST1 cells when injected into NOG mice. Knockdown of CA9 with shRNAs suppressed the ability of ST1-CA9(high) cells to initiate tumors, and the tumorigenicity of ST1 cells was significantly enhanced by introducing wild-type CA9 or a CA9 mutant with deletion of an intracytoplasmic domain. However, a CA9 with point mutations in the catalytic site did not increase the tumorigenicity of ST1 cells. Furthermore, we detected a small population of CA9(+) CD25(+) cells in lymph nodes of ATL patients. These findings suggest that CA9, and particularly its carbonic anhydrase activity, promotes the tumorigenicity of ATL-derived cells and may be involved in malignant development of lymphoma-type ATL.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

PML-RARalpha is cleaved by neutrophil elastase, an early myeloid-specific serine protease, leading to translocation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the PML protein to the N-terminal of RARalpha, and the mutational product PML(NLS-). The present study was designed to analyze the role of the NLS in mediating PML transport into the nucleus and to evaluate the value of measuring NLS translocation in the early diagnosis of APL. PML and PML(NLS-) localization was examined by immunofluorescence (IF). The interaction between PML/PML(NLS-) and importin alpha was detected by an in vivo binding assay using co-immunoprecipitation and double IF labeling. Twenty-seven untreated APL patients with PML-RARalpha and 22 non-APL controls were evaluated. PML(NLS-) was detected in primary APL, but not non-APL cells. IF showed that PML was localized to the nucleus, interacted with importin alpha in vivo, and co-localized in the PML nuclear bodies. PML(NLS-) was primarily localized in the cytoplasm and the interaction with importin alpha was lost. IF had a sensitivity and specificity of 92.6 and 77.3%, respectively, for diagnosing APL.

Activating mutations of NOTCH1 have been implicated to be associated with adverse prognosis in CLL. The objective of the present study was to develop an effective high-resolution melting (HRM) assay for detecting NOTCH1 mutations. Genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from 133 CLL patients was screened by HRM assay, and the results were compared with the data obtained using direct sequencing. The relative sensitivity of the HRM assay and direct sequencing was evaluated using diluted gDNA with different NOTCH1 mutational frequencies. The HRM assay was able to detect and discriminate samples with NOTCH1 mutations from the wild-type template in CLL. Eight of the 133 CLL patients (6.02%) were scored positively for NOTCH1 mutations in the HRM assay. The results of the NOTCH1 mutations detected by HRM analysis achieved 100% concordance with those determined from direct sequencing. HRM had a higher sensitivity (1%) and shorter turn-around time (TAT), compared to direct sequencing. In conclusion, the HRM assay developed by us was confirmed to be a rapid, sensitive, and promising approach for high-throughput prognostic NOTCH1 screening in CLL.

However, the role of HPIP in lung cancer is unclear. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the role of HPIP in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1-induced EMT in A549 lung cancer cells in vitro. Our data demonstrated that HPIP was overexpressed in the lung cancer cell lines. TGF-beta1 increased the expression of HPIP in the A549 cells. In addition, HPIP silencing significantly attenuated TGF-beta1-induced EMT and migration/invasion in the A549 cells. Furthermore, knockdown of HPIP greatly inhibited TGF-beta1-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 in the A549 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that HPIP silencing suppressed TGF-beta1-induced EMT in lung cancer cells by inhibiting Smad2 activation.

Despite being relatively frequent, there are no randomized trials or high-quality cohort studies addressing important aspects of the diagnosis and management of the disease. Areas covered: In this review we discuss the gaps in the literature, acknowledging that the evidences for recommendations regarding the management of typhlitis are mostly expert opinion. We performed a computerized search of the MEDLINE database (PubMed version) for appropriate articles published from 1963 through July, 2016 in English language. Thereafter the reference lists of all identified studies were screened, reviewing the abstracts of all potentially pertinent articles for inclusion. Expert commentary: The diagnosis of typhlitis still relies on clinical and radiologic features consisting of fever, abdominal pain and thickness of a segment of the bowel wall, as seen by ultrasonography or CT scan. The treatment consists in antimicrobial therapy with a regimen that covers the most frequent pathogens, taking into consideration the local epidemiology.

Researchers continuously look for novel therapeutic strategies, and an exciting new one is on the horizon: virotherapy. Viruses' ability to infect and kill human cells makes them promising cancer treatments. The greatest success has been seen in acute lymphocytic leukemia. To date, four genetically engineered oncolytic viruses have been approved globally by several countries' health regulatory agencies, but several challenges remain.

Of 106 patients included in our analysis, one patient tested positive for Pneumocystis DNA. Adverse events were reported in 18% of IVP courses, and main reason for initiation was cytopenia (59%). We found IVP to be effective and safe, and recommend the use of IVP in pediatric patients in whom first-line prophylaxis is contraindicated.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kruizinga, Matthijs D', 'Bresters, Dorine', 'Smiers, Frans J', 'Lankester, Arjan C', 'Bredius, Robbert G M']","['Kruizinga MD', 'Bresters D', 'Smiers FJ', 'Lankester AC', 'Bredius RGM']","['Department of Pediatric Immunology-Infections and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Immunology-Infections and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Immunology-Infections and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Immunology-Infections and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Immunology-Infections and Stem Cell Transplantation, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170111,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Pentamidine/*therapeutic use', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",['NOTNLM'],"['PCP', 'Pneumocystis', 'Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia', 'pentamidine', 'prophylaxis', 'stem cell transplantation']",2017/01/12 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26453 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Aug;64(8). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26453.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A 59-year-old man with diffuse cutaneous reticulohistiocytosis experienced bone marrow localization of the disease, with associated systemic mastocytosis and acute myeloid leukaemia. Cytogenetic analyses of the bone marrow aspirate revealed the presence of a derivative chromosome giving rise to a partial trisomy of chromosome 1q and a partial monosomy of chromosome 9q. Therefore, we characterized the cutaneous lesions before and after chemotherapy by using an integrative approach combining histopathology, electron microscopy, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. Histologically, the skin lesions belonged to the spectrum of diffuse cutaneous reticulohistiocytoses, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural analyses. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization in the skin nodules confirmed the presence of the genetic alterations previously detected in the bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide circumstantial evidence to suggest that at least a subset of cutaneous reticulohistiocytoses harbour clonal molecular alterations. Furthermore, we confirm that these lesions have the potential to arise in the setting of concurrent haematological disorders. In this hypothesis-generating study, two possible tumorigenesis models are proposed.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Fusco, Nicola', 'Bonometti, Arturo', 'Augello, Claudia', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Boiocchi, Leonardo', 'Fiori, Stefano', 'Morotti, Denise', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola', 'Berti, Emilio', 'Gianelli, Umberto']","['Fusco N', 'Bonometti A', 'Augello C', 'Fabris S', 'Boiocchi L', 'Fiori S', 'Morotti D', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Berti E', 'Gianelli U']","[""Division of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Milan, Italy.', ""Division of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'School of Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Division of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Pathophysiology and Organ Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Oncohaematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Division of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Division of Anatomical and Molecular Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'School of Pathology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Oncohaematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Division of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedical, Surgical and Dental Sciences, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Dermatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Division of Pathology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Pathophysiology and Organ Transplantation, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""Haematopathology Service, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,20170228,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Histiocytic Disorders, Malignant/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*complications/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/*complications/genetics/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukaemia', 'fluorescence in-situ hybridization', 'reticulohistiocytosis', 'systemic mastocytosis', 't(1;9)']",2017/01/12 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13166 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2017 May;70(6):1000-1008. doi: 10.1111/his.13166.

Recent studies suggest that the procoagulant activity (PCA) of extracellular vesicles (EV) may play a major role in venous thromboembolism and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in acute leukaemia. To study the impact of EVs from leukaemic patients on thrombin generation and to assess EV-PCA as a potential biomarker for thrombotic complications in patients with acute leukaemia. Blood samples from a cohort of patients with newly diagnosed acute leukaemia were obtained before treatment (D-0), 3 and 7 days after treatment (D-3 and D-7). Extracellular vesicles were isolated and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. EV-PCA was assessed by thrombin generation assay, and EV-associated tissue factor activity was measured using a commercial bio-immunoassay (Zymuphen MP-TF(R)). Of the 53 patients, 6 had increased EV-PCA at D-0 and 4 had a thrombotic event. Patients without thrombotic events (n = 47) had no elevated EV-PCA. One patient had increased EVs with procoagulant activity at D-3 and developed a DIC at D-5. This patient had no increased EVs-related tissue factor activity from D-0 to D-7 (<2 pg/ml). Eight patients had increased EVs with tissue factor activity (>2 pg/ml), of these, four had a thrombosis and two had haemorrhages. Procoagulant activity of extracellular vesicles could have a predictive value in excluding the risk of thrombotic events.

In a previous study, the beta-hexosaminidase release of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells stimulated by IgE cross-linking was specifically inhibited by ethanol extract of olive milled waste (OMW). OMW is a potential source of triterpenes, which show several biological activities. However, little is known about the effect of triterpenes in OMW on beta-hexosaminidase release. Here we investigated anti-allergic triterpenes from the ethanol extract of OMW, and we discuss the structure-activity relationship. We subjected ethanol extract of OMW to activity-guided fractionation; this led to the isolation of five known triterpenes, i.e., maslinic acid (1), oleanolic acid (2), punicanolic acid (3), 2-O-acetylmaslinic acid (4), and epimaslinic acid (5) as well as one new triterpene, 11-oxo-maslinic acid (6). An anti-allergic assay revealed that 2-O-acetylmaslinic acid (4) and 11-oxo-maslinic acid (6) showed anti-allergic activity. Considering the structure-activity relationship of these triterpenes, it appears that the existence of a ketone group at C-11 or an acetyl group at C-2 would influence the anti-allergic activity.",,"['Kishikawa, Asuka', 'Amen, Yhiya', 'Shimizu, Kuniyoshi']","['Kishikawa A', 'Amen Y', 'Shimizu K']","['Division of Systematic Forest and Forest Products Sciences, Department of Agro-Environmental Sciences, Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Science, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8581, Japan.', 'Division of Systematic Forest and Forest Products Sciences, Department of Agro-Environmental Sciences, Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Science, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8581, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Division of Systematic Forest and Forest Products Sciences, Department of Agro-Environmental Sciences, Graduate School of Bioresource and Bioenvironmental Science, Kyushu University, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, 812-8581, Japan. shimizu@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170110,United States,Cytotechnology,Cytotechnology,8807027,,,['NOTNLM'],"['11-oxo-maslinic acid', '2-O-acetylmaslinic acid', 'Olive milled waste', 'RBL-2H3', 'Triterpene', 'beta-Hexosaminidase release']",2017/01/12 06:00,2017/01/12 06:01,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/12 06:01 [medline]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10616-016-0058-z [doi]', '10.1007/s10616-016-0058-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotechnology. 2017 Apr;69(2):307-315. doi: 10.1007/s10616-016-0058-z.

METHODS: Thirty-tree children aged 6.7-19.9 years have been studied. The control group consisted of 12 children newly diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We assessed subcortical gray matter volume using automatic MRI segmentation and cognitive performance to identify differences between two therapeutic schemes and patients prior to treatment. RESULTS: Patients treated with chemotherapy and CNS radiotherapy had smaller hippocampi than two other subgroups and lower IQ score than patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Both treated groups, whether with chemotherapy only or in combination with CNS radiotherapy, had significantly lower volumes of caudate nucleus and performed significantly worse on measures of verbal fluency in comparison with patients prior to treatment. There were no differences in the mean volumes of total white matter, total gray matter, thalamus, putamen, and amygdala between the studied groups.

The myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) comprises a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by cytopenia, dysplasia in one or more of the major myeloid lineages, ineffective hematopoiesis, and increased risk of development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Macrophages are innate immune cells that ingest and degrade abnormal cells, debris, and foreign material and orchestrate inflammatory processes. We analyzed the role of macrophages from MDS patients in vitro. Methods. Macrophages were induced from peripheral blood of patients with MDS via granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Phagocytic capacity of macrophages was measured with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester and fluorescent microspheres. CD206 and signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) on macrophages were detected by flow cytometry. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was measured by ELISA method. Results. Compared with normal control group, the number of monocytes increased in MDS patients. However, the monocytes showed impaired ability to induce macrophages and the number of macrophages induced from MDS samples was lower. Further, we demonstrated that the ex vivo phagocytic function of macrophages from MDS patients was impaired and levels of reorganization receptors CD206 and SIRPalpha were lower. Levels of iNOS secreted by macrophages in MDS were increased. Conclusions.

To develop a fast and robust DNA-based assay to detect insertions and deletions mutations in exon 34 that encodes the PEST domain of NOTCH1 in order to evaluate patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Methods. We designed a multiplexed allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with a fragment analysis assay to detect specifically the mutation c.7544_7545delCT and possibly other insertions and deletions in exon 34 of NOTCH1. Results. We evaluated our assay in peripheral blood samples from two cohorts of patients with CLL. The frequency of NOTCH1 mutations was 8.4% in the first cohort of 71 unselected CLL patients. We then evaluated a second cohort of 26 CLL patients with known cytogenetic abnormalities that were enriched for patients with trisomy 12. NOTCH1 mutations were detected in 43.7% of the patients with trisomy 12. Conclusions. We have developed a fast and robust assay combining allele-specific PCR and fragment analysis able to detect NOTCH1 PEST domain insertions and deletions.,,"['Campregher, Paulo Vidal', 'Petroni, Roberta Cardoso', 'Muto, Nair Hideko', 'Sitnik, Roberta', 'de Carvalho, Flavia Pereira', 'Bacal, Nydia Strachman', 'Velloso, Elvira Deolinda Rodrigues Pereira', 'Oliveira, Gislaine Borba', 'Pinho, Joao Renato Rebello', 'Torres, Davi Coe', 'Mansur, Marcela Braga', 'Hassan, Rocio', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene Gyongyver Heidemarie', 'Chiattone, Carlos Sergio', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'Mangueira, Cristovao Luis Pitangueira']","['Campregher PV', 'Petroni RC', 'Muto NH', 'Sitnik R', 'de Carvalho FP', 'Bacal NS', 'Velloso ED', 'Oliveira GB', 'Pinho JR', 'Torres DC', 'Mansur MB', 'Hassan R', 'Lorand-Metze IG', 'Chiattone CS', 'Hamerschlak N', 'Mangueira CL']","['Departments of Hematology and Clinical Pathology, and Research Institute, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Department of Hematology, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Hemocentro-Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Sao Paulo Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; Cytogenetics Laboratories, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Hemocentro, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Hemocentro-Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Hemocentro, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Hemocentro-Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculdade de Medicina da Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161215,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['*Alleles', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*INDEL Mutation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Protein Domains', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",,,2017/01/12 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2016/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/4247908 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2016;2016:4247908. doi: 10.1155/2016/4247908.

Here, we used T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) as a model system to identify novel synergistic drug combinations with the BH3 mimetic venetoclax (ABT-199). In vitro drug screening in primary leukemia specimens that were derived from patients with high risk of relapse or relapse and cell lines revealed synergistic activity between venetoclax and the BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1. Notably, this drug synergism was confirmed in vivo using T-ALL cell line and patient-derived xenograft models. Moreover, the therapeutic benefit of this drug combination might, at least in part, be mediated by an acute induction of the pro-apoptotic factor BCL2L11 and concomitant reduction of BCL-2 upon BET bromodomain inhibition, ultimately resulting in an enhanced binding of BIM (encoded by BCL2L11) to BCL-2.

In 96 AML cases including 65 pilot samples selected for cured/not-cured, we found higher CpG island (CGI) promoter methylation in cured patients. Expanded genome-wide digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation data revealed a CGI methylator phenotype independent of IDH1/2 mutations we term AML-CGI methylator phenotype (CIMP) (A-CIMP(+)). A-CIMP was associated with longer overall survival (OS) in this data set (median OS, years: A-CIMP(+)=not reached, CIMP(-)=1.17; P=0.08). For validation we used 194 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas interrogated with Illumina 450k methylation arrays where we confirmed longer OS in A-CIMP (median OS, years: A-CIMP(+)=2.34, A-CIMP(-)=1.00; P=0.01). Hypermethylation in A-CIMP(+) favored CGIs (OR: CGI/non-CGI=5.21), and while A-CIMP(+) was enriched in CEBPA (P=0.002) and WT1 mutations (P=0.02), 70% of cases lacked either mutation.

Here we studied, whether expression of the T-cell inhibitory receptor (CTLA-4)-ligand CD86 (B7.2) on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) affects relapse risk after TKI cessation. CML patients in MR displayed significantly higher CD86(+)pDC frequencies than normal donors (P<0.0024), whereas TFR patients had consistently low CD86(+)pDC (n=12). This suggested that low CD86(+)pDC might be predictive of TFR. Indeed, in a prospective analysis of 122 patients discontinuing their TKI within the EURO-SKI trial, the one-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 30.1% (95% CI 15.6-47.9) for patients with >95 CD86(+)pDC per 10(5) lymphocytes, but 70.0% (95% CI 59.3-78.3) for patients with <95 CD86(+)pDC (hazard ratio (HR) 3.4, 95%(-)CI: 1.9-6.0; P<0.0001). Moreover, only patients with <95 CD86(+)pDC derived a significant benefit from longer (>8 years) TKI exposure before discontinuation (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.8; P=0.0263). High CD86(+)pDC counts significantly correlated with leukemia-specific CD8(+) T(-)cell exhaustion (Spearman correlation: 0.74, 95%-CI: 0.21-0.92; P=0.0098).

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immunotherapy has recently shown promise in clinical trials for B-cell malignancies, however, designing CARs for T-cell based disease remain a challenge due to the shared surface antigen pool between normal and malignant T-cells. Normal T-cells express CD5 but NK (natural killer) cells do not, positioning NK cells as attractive cytotoxicity cells for CD5CAR design. Additionally, CD5 is highly expressed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs). Here, we report a robust anti-CD5 CAR (CD5CAR) transduced into a human NK cell line NK-92 that can undergo stable expansion ex vivo. We found that CD5CAR NK-92 cells possessed consistent, specific, and potent anti-tumor activity against a variety of T-cell leukemia and lymphoma cell lines as well as primary tumor cells. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate significant inhibition and control of disease progression in xenograft mouse models of T-ALL.

Post-translational modifications might contribute to enhanced STAT5 activation in the context of transformation, but the strength and duration of pYSTAT5 are incompletely understood. We found that O-GlcNAcylation and tyrosine phosphorylation act together to trigger pYSTAT5 levels and oncogenic transcription in neoplastic cells. The expression of a mutated hyperactive gain-of-function (GOF) STAT5 without O-GlcNAcylation resulted in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation, oligomerization and transactivation potential and complete loss of oncogenic transformation capacity. The lack of O-GlcNAcylation diminished phospho-ERK and phospho-AKT levels.

Although the majority of CLL cells are in a resting state, small populations of proliferating cells exist; however, the anatomical site of active cell proliferation remains to be definitively determined. Based on findings that CLL cells in LNs have increased expression of B-cell activation genes, we tested the hypothesis that the fraction of 'newly born' cells would be highest in the LNs. Using a deuterium oxide ((2)H) in vivo labeling method in which patients consumed deuterated (heavy) water ((2)H2O), we determined CLL cell kinetics in concurrently obtained samples from LN, PB and BM.

These structures recruit multiple interactors and modulate their abundance or their posttranslational modifications, notably by the SUMO ubiquitin-like modifiers. The involvement of PML in antiviral responses is well established. In contrast, the role of PML in bacterial infection remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that PML restricts infection by the pathogenic bacterium Listeria monocytogenes but not by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. During infection, PML undergoes oxidation-mediated multimerization, associates with the nuclear matrix, and becomes de-SUMOylated due to the pore-forming activity of the Listeria toxin listeriolysin O (LLO). These events trigger an antibacterial response that is not observed during in vitro infection by an LLO-defective Listeria mutant, but which can be phenocopied by specific induction of PML de-SUMOylation. Using transcriptomic and proteomic microarrays, we also characterized a network of immunity genes and cytokines, which are regulated by PML in response to Listeria infection but independently from the listeriolysin O toxin. Our study thus highlights two mechanistically distinct complementary roles of PML in host responses against bacterial infection. IMPORTANCE: The promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) is a eukaryotic protein that can polymerize in discrete nuclear assemblies known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs) and plays essential roles in many different cellular processes. Key to its function, PML can be posttranslationally modified by SUMO, a ubiquitin-like modifier. Identification of the role of PML in antiviral defenses has been deeply documented. In contrast, the role of PML in antibacterial defenses remains elusive. Here, we identify two mechanistically distinct complementary roles of PML in antibacterial responses against pathogens such as Listeria: (i) we show that PML regulates the expression of immunity genes in response to bacterial infection, and (ii) we unveil the fact that modification of PML SUMOylation by bacterial pore-forming toxins is sensed as a danger signal, leading to a restriction of bacterial intracellular multiplication. Taken together, our data reinforce the concept that intranuclear bodies can dynamically regulate important processes, such as defense against invaders.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Ribet et al.'],"['Ribet, David', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie', 'Ferhi, Omar', 'Nahori, Marie-Anne', 'Varet, Hugo', 'de The, Hugues', 'Cossart, Pascale']","['Ribet D', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V', 'Ferhi O', 'Nahori MA', 'Varet H', 'de The H', 'Cossart P']","['Institut Pasteur, Unite des Interactions Bacteries-Cellules, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, U604, Paris, France.', 'INRA, USC2020, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Universite Paris Diderot, Institut Universitaire Hematologie, U944/UMR7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'PSL, College de France, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Universite Paris Diderot, Institut Universitaire Hematologie, U944/UMR7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.', 'PSL, College de France, Paris, France.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite des Interactions Bacteries-Cellules, Paris, France.', 'Inserm, U604, Paris, France.', 'INRA, USC2020, Paris, France.', ""Institut Pasteur, Plate-forme Transcriptome et Epigenome, Biomics, Centre d'Innovation et Recherche Technologique (Citech), Paris, France."", 'Institut Pasteur, Hub Bioinformatique et Biostatistique, Centre de Bioinformatique, Biostatistique et Biologie Integrative (C3BI, USR 3756 IP CNRS), Paris, France.', 'Inserm, CNRS, Universite Paris Diderot, Institut Universitaire Hematologie, U944/UMR7212, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France hugues.dethe@inserm.fr pascale.cossart@pasteur.fr.', 'PSL, College de France, Paris, France.', 'Institut Pasteur, Unite des Interactions Bacteries-Cellules, Paris, France hugues.dethe@inserm.fr pascale.cossart@pasteur.fr.', 'Inserm, U604, Paris, France.', 'INRA, USC2020, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170110,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Toxins/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Hemolysin Proteins/metabolism', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Listeria monocytogenes/*growth & development/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Multimerization', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteome/analysis', 'Salmonella typhimurium/growth & development/immunology', 'Sumoylation']",,,2017/01/12 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.02179-16 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.02179-16 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2017 Jan 10;8(1). pii: mBio.02179-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02179-16.,,"['0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteome)', 'R06ZRQ1YX9 (hlyA protein, Listeria monocytogenes)']",,,['233348/European Research Council/International'],PMC5225316,,,,,,,,,

The secretion of Wnt ligands requires Evi (also known as Wls). Genetically ablating Evi provides an experimental approach to studying the consequence of depleting all redundant Wnt proteins, and overexpressing Evi enables a nonspecific means of increasing Wnt signaling. We generated Evi-deficient and Evi-overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to analyze the role of autocrine Wnt production in self-renewal and differentiation. Self-renewal was reduced in Evi-deficient ESCs and increased in Evi-overexpressing ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, which supports the self-renewal of ESCs. The differentiation of ESCs into cardiomyocytes was enhanced when Evi was overexpressed and teratoma formation and growth of Evi-deficient ESCs in vivo were impaired, indicating that autocrine Wnt ligands were necessary for ESC differentiation and survival. ESCs lacking autocrine Wnt signaling had mitotic defects and showed genomic instability. Together, our study demonstrates that autocrine Wnt secretion is important for the survival, chromosomal stability, differentiation, and tumorigenic potential of ESCs.","['Copyright (c) 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Augustin, Iris', 'Dewi, Dyah L', 'Hundshammer, Jennifer', 'Erdmann, Gerrit', 'Kerr, Grainne', 'Boutros, Michael']","['Augustin I', 'Dewi DL', 'Hundshammer J', 'Erdmann G', 'Kerr G', 'Boutros M']","['German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Division of Signaling and Functional Genomics, and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg 69120, Germany. m.boutros@dkfz.de i.augustin@dkfz.de.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Division of Signaling and Functional Genomics, and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Division of Signaling and Functional Genomics, and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'NMI TT Naturwissenschaftliches und Medizinisches Institut Technologie Transfer GmbH Pharmaservices, Berlin 13353, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Division of Signaling and Functional Genomics, and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg 69120, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Division of Signaling and Functional Genomics, and Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg 69120, Germany. m.boutros@dkfz.de i.augustin@dkfz.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170110,United States,Sci Signal,Science signaling,101465400,IM,"['Animals', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genomic Instability', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway']",,,2017/01/12 06:00,2017/11/07 06:00,['2017/01/12 06:00'],"['2017/01/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10/461/eaah6829 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.aah6829 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Signal. 2017 Jan 10;10(461). pii: 10/461/eaah6829. doi: 10.1126/scisignal.aah6829.,,"['0 (Gpr177 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The NE mutants have been shown to activate unfolded protein response and induce premature apoptosis in myeloid cells. Patients with SCN are predisposed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and progression from SCN to AML is accompanied by mutations in CSF3R encoding the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR) in approximately 80% of patients. The mutations result in the expression of C-terminally truncated G-CSFRs that promote strong cell proliferation and survival. It is unknown why the CSF3R mutations, which are rare in de novo AML, are so prevalent in SCN/AML. We show here that a G-CSFR mutant, d715, derived from an SCN patient inhibited G-CSF-induced expression of NE in a dominant negative manner. Furthermore, G-CSFR d715 suppressed unfolded protein response and apoptosis induced by an SCN-derived NE mutant, which was associated with sustained activation of AKT and STAT5, and augmented expression of BCL-XL. Thus, the truncated G-CSFRs associated with SCN/AML may protect myeloid precursor cells from apoptosis induced by the NE mutants. We propose that acquisition of CSF3R mutations may represent a mechanism by which myeloid precursor cells carrying the ELANE mutations evade the proapoptotic activity of the NE mutants in SCN patients.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Qiu, Yaling', 'Zhang, Yangyang', 'Hu, Nan', 'Dong, Fan']","['Qiu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu N', 'Dong F']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio 43606.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio 43606.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio 43606.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio 43606.

Ibrutinib has demonstrated single-agent efficacy and acceptable tolerability at doses of 420 and 840 mg in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who were treatment-naive (TN) or had relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL after >/=1 prior therapy in a phase Ib/II study (PCYC-1102). Subsequently, the ibrutinib 420 mg dose was approved in CLL.Experimental Design: We report data with 44 months of follow-up on 94 patients with TN and R/R CLL/SLL receiving ibrutinib 420 mg once-daily in PCYC-1102 and the long-term extension study PCYC-1103.Results: Ninety-four CLL/SLL patients (27 TN, 67 R/R) were treated with ibrutinib (420 mg/day). Patients with R/R disease had received a median of four prior therapies (range, 1-12). Responses were rapid and durable and median duration of response was not reached. Best overall response was 91% [85% TN (complete response, CR 26%) and 94% R/R (9% CR)]. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached in either group. The 30-month PFS rate was 96% and 76% for TN and R/R patients, respectively. Ibrutinib was well tolerated with extended follow-up; rates of grade >/=3 cytopenias and fatigue, as well as discontinuations due to toxicities decreased over time.Conclusions: Single-agent ibrutinib at 420 mg once-daily resulted in durable responses and was well tolerated with up to 44 months follow-up in patients with TN and R/R CLL/SLL.

Here, we investigated whether dasatinib could induce beneficial immunomodulatory effects in solid tumor models. The effects on tumor growth and on the immune system were studied in four different syngeneic mouse models (B16.OVA melanoma, 1956 sarcoma, MC38 colon, and 4T1 breast carcinoma). Both peripheral blood (PB) and tumor samples were immunophenotyped during treatment. Although in vitro dasatinib displayed no direct cytotoxicity to B16 melanoma cells, a significant decrease in tumor growth was observed in dasatinib-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated group. Further, dasatinib-treated melanoma-bearing mice had an increased proportion of CD8(+) T cells in PB, together with a higher amount of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells. Dasatinib-mediated antitumor efficacy was abolished when CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were depleted with antibodies. Results were confirmed in sarcoma, colon, and breast cancer models, and in all cases mice treated daily with dasatinib had a significant decrease in tumor growth. Detailed immunophenotyping of tumor tissues with CyTOF indicated that dasatinib had reduced the number of intratumoral regulatory T cells in all tumor types. To conclude, dasatinib is able to slow down the tumor growth of various solid tumor models, which is associated with the favorable blood/tumor T-cell immunomodulation. The assessment of synergistic combinatorial therapies with other immunomodulatory drugs or targeted small-molecule oncokinase inhibitors is warranted in future clinical trials.

We set out to characterize the expression of CD43 by FC in B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and to determine its possible role in the differential diagnosis of these malignancies. METHODS: We analyzed the expression of CD43 in clonal B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders with exclusive peripheral blood and/or bone marrow involvement based on their Moreau chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) score with particular emphasis on Moreau CLL score 3 (MS3) cases, which often present a diagnostic challenge. The cohort included 433 CLL (score 4-5), 34 MS3 and 166 lymphoproliferative disorders with lower scores. RESULTS: Generally, the higher the Moreau CLL score, the higher CD43-positivity (425/443 [96%] for CLL, 23/34 [67%] for MS3 and 18/166 [11%] for cases with lower scores). MS3 cases constituted 5.4% of all cases and were more frequently CD5, CD200, CD43-positive and had del(q13) than score 0-2 cases. Among MS3 cases, del(13q) cases were predominantly CD43-positive (12/13). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of CD43-positivity increases sharply with the Moreau score. MS3 cases seem to include both CLL and non-CLL lymphoproliferative disorders and CD43 could aid in the differential diagnosis between the two. However, studies analyzing the correlation between CD43 expression and the underlying biologic changes of these cases are warranted.

Trabectedin is a DNA minor groove binder acting as a modulator of transcription and interfering with DNA repair mechanisms; it causes selective depletion of cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. We hypothesised that trabectedin might have an antitumour effect on MDS/MPN. METHODS: Malignant CD14+ monocytes and CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells were isolated from peripheral blood/bone marrow mononuclear cells. The inhibition of CFU-GM colonies and the apoptotic effect on CD14+ and CD34+ induced by trabectedin were evaluated. Trabectedin's effects were also investigated in vitro on THP-1, and in vitro and in vivo on MV-4-11 cell lines. RESULTS: On CMML/JMML cells, obtained from 20 patients with CMML and 13 patients with JMML, trabectedin - at concentration pharmacologically reasonable, 1-5 nM - strongly induced apoptosis and inhibition of growth of haematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM). In these leukaemic cells, trabectedin downregulated the expression of genes belonging to the Rho GTPases pathway (RAS superfamily) having a critical role in cell growth and cytoskeletal dynamics. Its selective activity on myelomonocytic malignant cells was confirmed also on in vitro THP-1 cell line and on in vitro and in vivo MV-4-11 cell line models.

Although not implicated as an oncogenic driver itself, AXL, a member of the TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in several haematologic and solid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukaemia, non-small cell lung cancer, gastric and colorectal adenocarcinomas, and breast and prostate cancers. In the context of malignancy, evidence suggests that AXL overexpression drives wide-ranging processes, including epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tumour angiogenesis, resistance to chemotherapeutic and targeted agents, and decreased antitumor immune response.

As the major component of red orpiment, tetra-arsenic tetra-sulfide (As4S4) has been recently used in treating leukemia, but with unclear mechanism targeting CML. MicroRNA (miR) is a group of endogenous non-coding RNAs regulating pathogenesis. MiR181 has been shown to exert important roles in tumor progression. The relationship between miR181 and As4S4 in inducing K562 cell apoptosis, however, is still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS CML cell line K562 was cultured in vitro in a control group and in groups receiving various dosages (20 muM and 40 muM) of As4S4. MTT assay was employed to detect the effect on K562 cell survival. MiR181 expression was quantified by real-time PCR. MTT assay and assay kit were used to determine K562 cell survival and caspase 3 expression. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Bcl-2 expression was determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS As4S4 significantly suppressed proliferation of K562 cells (p<0.05) and decreased miR181 expression, and increased caspase3 activity compared to the control group. It can induce K562 cell apoptosis via remarkably down-regulating mRNA and protein expressions of Bcl-2 (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS As4S4 can facilitate K562 cell apoptosis via down-regulating miR181, inhibiting Bcl02 expression, and enhancing apoptotic protein caspase3 activity.",,"['Gong, Jiangjiang', 'Zheng, Shunli', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Wang, Yi', 'Meng, Jiali']","['Gong J', 'Zheng S', 'Zhang L', 'Wang Y', 'Meng J']","['Department of Intensive Care, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'First Class Ward, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'First Class Ward, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'Out-Patient Department, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).', 'First Class Ward, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170110,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology']",,,2017/01/11 06:00,2017/06/28 06:00,['2017/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['899214 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.899214 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2017 Jan 10;23:144-150. doi: 10.12659/msm.899214.,,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (MIRN-181 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'ZIK02R2PSD (tetraarsenic tetrasulfide)']",,,,PMC5242199,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Myelofibrosis is a Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm with constitutive JAK/STAT activation. The JAK-inhibitor ruxolitinib is the only approved drug for this disease in the United States and Europe based on two randomized phase III studies that demonstrated clinically meaningful reduction in spleen size, improvement in symptoms, quality of life, and an overall survival advantage with prolonged follow-up. Emerging data have revealed the complex molecular architecture of myelofibrosis with clonal evolution playing a central role in disease progression or transformation. These molecular pathways may explain the heterogeneous benefits obtained by JAK-inhibitors in patients with myelofibrosis. In addition, the genetic and epigenetic mutations appear to work in concert with overactive JAK/STAT signaling and contribute to myelofibrosis pathogenesis and prognosis, suggesting a potential to exploit them as potential therapeutic targets. SUMMARY: Combining JAK-inhibitors with agents that target parallel prosurvival pathways or agents that enhance hematopoiesis may enhance efficacy and/or mitigate on-target myelosuppression, thereby extending the therapeutic benefits observed with JAK-inhibitors alone.",,"['Assi, Rita', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Daver, Naval']","['Assi R', 'Verstovsek S', 'Daver N']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Discovery', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/01/11 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/01/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000320 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Mar;24(2):115-124. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000320.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: GERSHWIN was an open-label, single-arm intervention study. Patients aged >18 years with CD20+ relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL) were enrolled from four centres in China. The treatment period was 24 weeks; patients received obinutuzumab 1000 mg i.v. on Days (D)1, 8 and 15 of Cycle (C)1 (CLL patients: first infusion split over 2 days) and on D1 of C2-8 (all cycles: 21 days). PK parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis (NCA), and a population PK analysis was used to determine whether observed GERSHWIN PK data were in accordance with previous obinutuzumab PK studies in non-Chinese patients. RESULTS: The PK analysis population included 48 patients: 28 patients completed all treatment cycles. NCA showed a similar PK profile in Chinese patients with FL, DLBCL and CLL. Steady-state concentrations of obinutuzumab appeared to be reached at the start of C2 irrespective of histology. There was no apparent relationship between body weight and systemic exposure. Most PK profiles observed in GERSHWIN lay within the 90% prediction interval of simulated profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Obinutuzumab exposure was comparable in CLL, DLBCL and FL patients. NCA and population PK analysis indicate that PK characteristics of Chinese patients with B-cell lymphomas are similar to those in non-Chinese patients.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

It was postulated that PM in vitro induces release of long pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and that endotoxin and organic compounds present in the PM regulate this release. A contact coculture of THP-1 human leukemia monocytes and A549 human adenocarcinoma alveolar pneumocytes was exposed to PM from Traffic, Wood, Diesel, and Quartz (10-40 microg/cm(2)) for 12-64 h to determine release of PTX3 and VEGF. The role of endotoxin and the organic fraction in the mediator release was assessed using polymyxin B sulfate and organic extracts, respectively. Finally, antagonists were used to investigate whether the early proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha affected the PTX3 and VEGF release. All PM samples induced a time-dependent release of both PTX3 and VEGF. Traffic mediated the greatest release of PTX3, whereas Wood and Diesel were more potent inducers of VEGF. The endotoxin content did not markedly affect release of either mediator, while the organic fraction exerted no significant effect on VEGF release and limited influence on PTX3 release. In addition, the IL-1 and TNF-alpha agonists affected PTX3 release more strongly than VEGF release. In conclusion, the current data show a limited impact of endotoxin and organic compounds on PTX3 and VEGF release. Further, the observed differences in response patterns may point toward differential regulation of PM-mediated release of PTX3 and VEGF.",,"['Herseth, J I', 'Volden, V', 'Bolling, A K']","['Herseth JI', 'Volden V', 'Bolling AK']","['a Faculty of Health Sciences , Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences , Oslo , Norway.', 'a Faculty of Health Sciences , Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences , Oslo , Norway.', 'b Department of Air Pollution and Noise , Norwegian Institute of Public Health , Oslo , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170110,England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

However, molecular mechanisms in different cancer cells are various. In the present study, we demonstrated that curcumin induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by increasing the expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP and decreasing the expression of BCL(-)2 in U937 human leukemic cells but not in K562 cells. We found some interferon induced genes, especially interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2), were significantly upregulated when treated with curcumin in U937 cells by gene expression chip array, and further confirmed that the expression of IFIT2 was obviously higher in U937 than that in K562 cells by Western blot assay. In addition, inhibiting the expression of IFIT2 by shRNA in U937 rescued curcumin-induced apoptosis and exogenous overexpression of IFIT2 by lentiviral transduction or treating with IFNgamma in K562 cells enhanced anti-cancer activity of curcumin. These results indicated for the first time that curcumin induced leukemic cell apoptosis via an IFIT2-dependent signaling pathways.

Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) is a transcription factor that can be activated by low-temperature far-infrared (FIR) irradiation to exert beneficial effects on the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we investigated the influence of FIR-induced PLZF activation on AGE-induced endothelial injury both in vitro and in vivo. FIR irradiation inhibited AGE-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). PLZF activation increased the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K), which are important kinases in the autophagic signaling pathway. FIR-induced PLZF activation led to autophagy in HUVEC, which was mediated through the upregulation of PI3K. Immunofluorescence staining showed that AGEs were engulfed by HUVECs and localized to lysosomes. FIR-induced autophagy promoted AGEs degradation in HUVECs. In nicotinamide/streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, FIR therapy reduced serum AGEs and AGEs deposition at the vascular endothelium. FIR therapy also reduced diabetes-induced inflammatory markers in the vascular endothelium and improved vascular endothelial function.

Because molecular profiling can assist with AML prognosis and next-generation sequencing allows simultaneous sequencing of many target genes, we analyzed 260 genes in 112 patients with de novo AML who received standard treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that karyotypes and mutation status of TET2, PHF6, KIT, and NPM1(mutation) /FLT3- internal tandem duplication (ITD)(negative) were independent prognostic factors for the entire cohort. Among patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, patients with mutations in CEBPA(double mutation) , IDH2, and NPM1 in the absence of FLT3-ITD were associated with improved Overall survival (OS), similar to those with favorable-risk cytogenetics; patients with mutations in TET2, RUNX1, ASXL1, and DNMT3A were associated with reduced OS, similar to those with unfavorable-risk cytogenetics. We concluded that integration of cytogenetic and molecular profiling improves prognostic stratification of patients into three groups with more distinct prognoses (P < 0.001) and significantly reduces the number of patients classified as intermediate risk.

A possible explanation for this may be the repeated infection of this defective provirus to a cell. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether a defective provirus could transmit during the co-culture of HTLV-1 uninfected human T-cell line, Jurkat, with MT-2 cells treated with mitomycin C. As a result, we established not only a cell line with the integration of one complete provirus, but also a cell line with the integration of one defective provirus. The rearrangement of the T-cell receptor -gamma gene of these cell lines showed them to be derived from Jurkat cells. Both HTLV-1 Tax/Rex and HBZ RNA were detected in the cell line, which harbors a complete provirus. On the other hand, HBZ RNA and transcriptional product specific for the defective provirus were detected in the cell line, which harbors a defective HTLV-1 provirus only. These results suggested that a defective HTLV-1 provirus with large depletion of internal sequence could transmit to other cells. Moreover, the defective provirus can be transcriptionally active. This suggested the possibility that the defective HTLV-1 provirus found in the lymphocytes of HTLV-1 carriers and patients with adult T-cell leukemia may transmit to other T-cells in vivo. The results also suggested that defective provirus in HTLV-1 carriers could be functional and may play a role in leukemogenesis.",,"['Hashikura, Yuuki', 'Umeki, Kazumi', 'Umekita, Kunihiko', 'Nomura, Hajime', 'Yamada, Akiteru', 'Yamamoto, Ikuo', 'Hasegawa, Hiroo', 'Yanagihara, Katsunori', 'Okayama, Akihiko']","['Hashikura Y', 'Umeki K', 'Umekita K', 'Nomura H', 'Yamada A', 'Yamamoto I', 'Hasegawa H', 'Yanagihara K', 'Okayama A']","['Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8102, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8102, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan. okayama@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170109,Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics', '*Virus Integration']",['NOTNLM'],"['Defective virus', 'HTLV-1', 'MT-2 cell line']",2017/01/11 06:00,2017/04/21 06:00,['2017/01/11 06:00'],"['2016/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13577-016-0156-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s13577-016-0156-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 2017 Apr;30(2):117-123. doi: 10.1007/s13577-016-0156-4.

METHODS: An RT-LAMP primer set was designed to detect three types of PML-RARalpha mRNA in a single reaction. Serial dilutions of plasmid DNA containing bcr1, bcr2, or bcr3 PML-RARalpha sequences and RNA extracted from bone marrow aspirates of 6 patients with APL were used to compare the results of RT-LAMP and nested PCR assays. RESULTS: Plasmid DNA was amplified by RT-LAMP, for which the reaction time was > 4 h shorter and the lower detection limit was higher than for nested RT-PCR.

Here, we report that Aurora A is essential for Thr9 phosphorylation of the TRAF-interacting protein TIFA, triggering activation of the NF-kappaB survival pathway in AML. TIFA protein was overexpressed concurrently with Aurora A and NF-kappaB signaling factors in patients with de novo AML relative to healthy individuals and also correlated with poor prognosis. Silencing TIFA in AML lines and primary patient cells decreased leukemic cell growth and chemoresistance via downregulation of prosurvival factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL that support NF-kappaB-dependent antiapoptotic events. Inhibiting TIFA perturbed leukemic cytokine secretion and reduced the IC50 of chemotherapeutic drug treatments in AML cells.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy in a large cohort of patients with MIg-associated C3G. Fifty adult patients with MIg and biopsy-proven C3G were extracted from the French national database of C3G. We retrospectively compared renal outcomes in patients who either received or did not receive chemotherapy targeting the underlying B-cell clone. At diagnosis, renal disease was severe, with nephrotic-range proteinuria in 20/46 (43%) patients and chronic kidney disease stage 3 or above in 42/49 (86%) patients. Monoclonal gammopathy was of IgG type in 47 (94%) patients. Hematological diagnosis was monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance in 30 (60%), multiple myeloma in 17 (34%), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 3 (6%) patients. Complement studies showed low C3 level in 22/50 (43%) and elevated soluble C5b-9 level in 27/34 (79%) patients. Twenty-nine patients received chemotherapy (including bortezomib in 22), whereas 8 and 13 patients received various immunosuppressive drugs or symptomatic measures alone, respectively. Patients who achieved hematological response after chemotherapy had higher renal response rates (P = .0001) and median renal survival (hazard ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.92; P = .009) than those receiving conservative/immunosuppressive therapy. In conclusion, our results suggest that chemotherapy adapted to the B-cell clone may constitute an efficient strategy for C3G in the setting of MIg, as rapid achievement of hematological response appears to result in improved renal survival.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chauvet, Sophie', 'Fremeaux-Bacchi, Veronique', 'Petitprez, Florent', 'Karras, Alexandre', 'Daniel, Laurent', 'Burtey, Stephane', 'Choukroun, Gabriel', 'Delmas, Yahsou', 'Guerrot, Dominique', 'Francois, Arnaud', 'Le Quintrec, Moglie', 'Javaugue, Vincent', 'Ribes, David', 'Vrigneaud, Laurence', 'Arnulf, Bertrand', 'Goujon, Jean Michel', 'Ronco, Pierre', 'Touchard, Guy', 'Bridoux, Frank']","['Chauvet S', 'Fremeaux-Bacchi V', 'Petitprez F', 'Karras A', 'Daniel L', 'Burtey S', 'Choukroun G', 'Delmas Y', 'Guerrot D', 'Francois A', 'Le Quintrec M', 'Javaugue V', 'Ribes D', 'Vrigneaud L', 'Arnulf B', 'Goujon JM', 'Ronco P', 'Touchard G', 'Bridoux F']","['Department of Nephrology, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1138, ""Complement et Maladies,"" Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes Sorbonne Paris-Cite, Paris, France.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1138, ""Complement et Maladies,"" Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Department of Immunology, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche 1138, ""Cancer, Immune Control and Escape,"" Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris, France.', 'Department of Nephrology, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Department of Pathology, and.', 'Department of Nephrology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire La Conception, Marseille, France.', ""Department of Nephrology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Amiens, Amiens, France."", 'Department of Nephrology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Nephrology, and.', 'Department of Pathology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rouen, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Nephrology Hopital de Foch, Surennes, France.', 'Department of Nephrology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Centre National de Reference maladies rares: amylose AL et autres maladies a depots d'immunoglobulines monoclonales, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'Department of Nephrology Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Nephrology Hopital de Valenciennes, Valenciennes, France.', 'Department of Immunology and Hematology, Hopital Saint Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France.', ""Centre National de Reference maladies rares: amylose AL et autres maladies a depots d'immunoglobulines monoclonales, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'Department of Pathology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Poitiers, France; and.', 'Department of Nephrology, Hopital Tenon, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Department of Nephrology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Centre National de Reference maladies rares: amylose AL et autres maladies a depots d'immunoglobulines monoclonales, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France."", 'Department of Nephrology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', ""Centre National de Reference maladies rares: amylose AL et autres maladies a depots d'immunoglobulines monoclonales, Universite de Poitiers, Poitiers, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170109,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement C3/*analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'France', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Kidney Glomerulus/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/01/11 06:00,2017/08/24 06:00,['2017/01/11 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33589-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-08-737163 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Mar 16;129(11):1437-1447. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-08-737163.

Here, we identified the lysine-specific demethylase KDM1A as a novel interaction partner of ZEB2 and demonstrated that mouse and human T-ALLs with increased ZEB2 levels critically depend on KDM1A activity for survival.

Moreover, the knockdown of HULC significantly inhibited CML cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by repressing c-Myc and Bcl-2. Furthermore, inhibition of HULC enhanced imatinib-induced apoptosis of CML cells. Further experiments demonstrated that HULC silencing markedly suppressed the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT, indicating that enhancement of imatinib-induced apoptosis by HULC inhibition is related with the reduction of c-Myc expression and inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway activity. Furthermore, HULC could modulate c-Myc and Bcl-2 by miR-200a as an endogenous sponge. Taken together, these results reveal that HULC promotes oncogenesis in CML and suggest a potential strategy for the CML treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Masitinib inhibits KIT and LYN kinases that are involved in indolent systemic mastocytosis pathogenesis. We aimed to assess safety and efficacy of masitinib versus placebo in severely symptomatic patients who were unresponsive to optimal symptomatic treatments. METHODS: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we enrolled adults (aged 18-75 years) with indolent or smouldering systemic mastocytosis, according to WHO classification or documented mastocytosis based on histological criteria, at 50 centres in 15 countries. We excluded patients with cutaneous or non-severe systemic mastocytosis after a protocol amendment. Patients were centrally randomised (1:1) to receive either oral masitinib (6 mg/kg per day over 24 weeks with possible extension) or matched placebo with minimisation according to severe symptoms. The primary endpoint was cumulative response (>/=75% improvement from baseline within weeks 8-24) in at least one severe baseline symptom from the following: pruritus score of 9 or more, eight or more flushes per week, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression of 19 or more, or Fatigue Impact Scale of 75 or more. We assessed treatment effect using repeated measures methodology for rare diseases via the generalised estimating equation model in a modified intention-to-treat population, including all participants assigned to treatment minus those who withdrew due to a non-treatment-related cause. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00814073. FINDINGS: Between Feb 19, 2009, and July 15, 2015, 135 patients were randomly assigned to masitinib (n=71) or placebo (n=64). By 24 weeks, masitinib was associated with a cumulative response of 18.7% in the primary endpoint (122.6 responses of 656.5 possible responses [weighted generalised estimating equation]) compared with 7.4% for placebo (48.9 of 656.5; difference 11.3%; odds ratio 3.6; 95% CI 1.2-10.8; p=0.0076). Frequent severe adverse events (>4% difference from placebo) were diarrhoea (eight [11%] of 70 in the masitinib group vs one [2%] of 63 in the placebo group), rash (four [6%] vs none), and asthenia (four [6%] vs one [2%]). The most frequent serious adverse events were diarrhoea (three patients [4%] vs one [2%]) and urticaria (two [3%] vs none), and no life-threatening toxicities occurred. One patient in the placebo group died (unrelated to study treatment). INTERPRETATION: These study findings indicate that masitinib is an effective and well tolerated agent for the treatment of severely symptomatic indolent or smouldering systemic mastocytosis.

Many childhood cancer survivors suffer from late complications due to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Survivors of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL), treated with cranial radiotherapy, are at a particularly high risk of having endocrine complications. PURPOSE: To illuminate childhood ALL survivors' experiences of a long-term follow-up in an endocrine clinic. METHOD: Data collection carried out using semi-structured focus-group interviews. Fifteen ALL survivors were included in the study, divided into 4 groups. Data was analysed with conventional qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: The survivors' experiences were captured in the theme: ""The need for understanding and support in order to manage daily life"". An understanding of their situation, as well as support for managing daily life was fundamental. Lack of understanding and support from the community was connected with a fear for the future. The follow-up at the endocrine clinic was shown to be crucial for increasing the survivors' understanding of late complications. The past feeling of being out of control was replaced with an increased self-confidence. CONCLUSION: Many leukaemia survivors experienced their daily lives as a struggle and as a complicated issue to cope with. The theme ""understanding and support to manage daily life"" mirrors how the survivors are in need of knowledge and support in order to handle and understand their complex situation after surviving leukaemia. Offering understanding and support with a holistic approach, may be a way in which to strengthen the survivors' health.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The concomitant occurrence of these two events is exceptionally disastrous and lethal. We report a case of a Moroccan woman who was successfully managed for synchronous recurrent breast carcinoma and chronic myelogenous leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old Moroccan woman was diagnosed with localized breast carcinoma in 2008. She received six cycles of an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, radiation therapy and hormonal therapy by tamoxifen. After completion of 5 years of tamoxifen our patient reported asthenia; a physical examination found hepatomegaly, massive splenomegaly measuring 21 cm and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The staging showed lung and liver metastases. Morphology and immunohistochemical profile of this metastasis identified an adenocarcinoma of mammary origin. In parallel, the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia was suspected because of the presence of a leukocytosis at 355 x 10(9)/L, with circulating blasts of 4%. Chronic myeloid leukemia was confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy with the presence of Ph chromosome on cytogenetical analysis. Daily imatinib was ordered concurrently with chemotherapy-type docetaxel. The metastases were stable after nine courses of chemotherapy. Due to breast cancer progression 4 months later, bevacizumab and capecitabine were introduced. A major molecular response was achieved after 12 and 18 months. She has now completed 2 years of follow-up, still on a major molecular response, and is undergoing imatinib and capecitabine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Leukocytosis in breast cancer patients can reveal chronic myeloid leukemia. It may warrant a workup to find the underlying etiology, which could include a secondary hematological malignancy.",,"[""Elm'hadi, Choukri"", 'Khmamouche, Mohamed Reda', 'Tanz, Rachid', 'Toreis, Mehdi', 'Mahtat, ElMehdi', 'Allaoui, Mohammed', 'Oukabli, Mohammed', 'Messaoudi, Nezha', 'Errihani, Hassan', 'Ichou, Mohammed']","[""Elm'hadi C"", 'Khmamouche MR', 'Tanz R', 'Toreis M', 'Mahtat E', 'Allaoui M', 'Oukabli M', 'Messaoudi N', 'Errihani H', 'Ichou M']","['Medical Oncology Department, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco. dr.choukrielmhadi@hotmail.com.', 'School of Medicine and Pharmacy, University Mohamed V, Souissi, Rabat, Morocco. dr.choukrielmhadi@hotmail.com.', 'Medical Oncology Department, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Medical Oncology Department, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Medical Oncology Department, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Clinical Hematology Department, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Department of Pathology, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Department of Pathology, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Medical Oncology Department, National Institute of Oncology Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah, Rabat, Morocco.', 'Medical Oncology Department, Mohammed V Military Teaching Hospital of Rabat, Rabat, Morocco.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,20170110,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Breast Neoplasms/*complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Capecitabine/administration & dosage', '*Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['Breast cancer', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Management', 'Relapse']",2017/01/11 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2017/01/11 06:00'],"['2015/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-016-1180-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-016-1180-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2017 Jan 10;11(1):10. doi: 10.1186/s13256-016-1180-4.,,"['0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,PMC5223539,,,,,,,,,

However, complete remission has not been achieved and the molecular basis of HCC resistance to sorafenib remains largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) expression correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis of HCC. Here, we demonstrate the novel role of FGF19 in HCC resistance to sorafenib therapy. METHODS: FGF19 Knockdown cells were achieved by lentiviral-mediated interference, and FGFR4 knockout cells were achieved by CRISPR-Cas9. Protein levels of FGF19, FGFR4 and c-PARP in various HCC cell lines were measured by Western blotting analysis. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay, apoptosis was determined by DAPI nuclear staining and Western blot of c-PRAP, and ROS generation was determined by DCFH-DA staining and electrochemical biosensor. RESULTS: We showed that FGF19, when overexpressed, inhibited the effect of sorafenib on ROS generation and apoptosis in HCC. In contrast, loss of FGF19 or its receptor FGFR4 led to a remarkable increase in sorafenib-induced ROS generation and apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of FGF19 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells significantly enhanced the sensitivity to sorafenib. Importantly, targeting FGF19/FGFR4 axis by ponatinib, a third-generation inhibitor of chronic myeloid leukemia, overcomes HCC resistance of sorafenib by enhancing ROS-associated apoptosis in sorafenib-treated HCC. CONCLUSION: Our results provide the first evidence that inhibition of FGF19/FGFR4 signaling significantly overcomes sorafenib resistance in HCC.

Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the prevalence of onconeural antibodies, which are highly predictive for a paraneoplastic etiology, and the prevalence of malignancies in NMOSD patients. METHODS: We retrospectively screened 23 consecutive patients from our clinic with NMOSD (13 were anti-aquaporin-4 [AQP4] antibody positive, 10 were AQP4 negative) for onconeural antibodies using an immunoblot. RESULTS: All patients were negative for a broad spectrum of antibodies targeting intracellular onconeural antigens (Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2/CRMP5, Ma1, Ma2, Zic4, SOX1, Tr, and amphiphysin). Notably, only two patients had a malignancy. However, neoplastic entities (astrocytic brain tumor and acute myeloid leukemia) were not typical for PNS. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that there is no need to routinely screen anti-AQP4 antibody positive NMOSD patients with a typical presentation for onconeural antibodies. Furthermore, absence of these antibodies in NMOSD, which is typically non-paraneoplastic, confirms their high specificity for PNS.",,"['Berger, Benjamin', 'Hottenrott, Tilman', 'Rauer, Sebastian', 'Stich, Oliver']","['Berger B', 'Hottenrott T', 'Rauer S', 'Stich O']","['Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, Breisacher Strasse 64, D-79106, Freiburg, Germany. benjamin.berger@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, Breisacher Strasse 64, D-79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, Breisacher Strasse 64, D-79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurology and Neurophysiology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, Breisacher Strasse 64, D-79106, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170110,England,BMC Neurol,BMC neurology,100968555,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aquaporin 4/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/immunology', 'Neuromyelitis Optica/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Aquaporin-4', '*NMOSD', '*Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders', '*Onconeural antibodies', '*Paraneoplastic']",2017/01/11 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2017/01/11 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12883-016-0779-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12883-016-0779-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Neurol. 2017 Jan 10;17(1):5. doi: 10.1186/s12883-016-0779-9.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7680-8880'],"['0 (Aquaporin 4)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '147954-52-7 (amphiphysin)']",,,,PMC5223419,,,,,,,,,

Among genetic alterations concerning the transformation, the frequent one is TP53 mutation. Here we show that retroviral overexpression of Jak2 V617F mutant into wild-type p53 murine bone marrow cells induced polycythemia vera (PV) in the recipient mice, whereas Jak2 V617F-transduced p53-null mice developed lethal leukemia after the preceding PV phase. The leukemic mice had severe anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary hemorrhage and expansion of dysplastic erythroid progenitors. Primitive leukemia cells (c-kit(+)Sca1(+)Lin(-) (KSL) and CD34(-)CD16/32(-)c-kit(+)Sca1(-)Lin(-) (megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor; MEP)) and erythroid progenitors (CD71(+)) from Jak2 V617F-transduced p53-null leukemic mice had leukemia-initiating capacity, however, myeloid differentiated populations (Mac-1(+)) could not recapitulate the disease. Interestingly, recipients transplanted with CD71(+) cells rapidly developed erythroid leukemia, which was in sharp contrast to leukemic KSL cells to cause lethal leukemia after the polycythemic state. The leukemic CD71(+) cells were more sensitive to INCB18424, a potent JAK inhibitor, than KSL cells. p53 restoration could ameliorate Jak2 V617F-transduced p53-null erythroleukemia.

Despite an association with ALL in humans, murine MLL fusion models are persistently restricted to AML. We here explored this issue using an inducible mixed lineage leukemia-eleven nineteen leukemia (MLL-ENL) mouse model. Although multiple progenitor cell types with myeloid potential are potent AML leukemia-initiating cells, also the earliest lymphoid progenitors were capable of initiating AML. This ability to evoke a latent myeloid potential in the earliest lymphoid progenitors was lost upon further lymphoid commitment. At the same time, more downstream/committed lymphoid precursors also failed to initiate lymphoid leukemia. Co-expression of MLL-ENL with a constitutively active RAS allele, the most common co-mutation in MLL fusion leukemias, could influence on both disease latency and lineage assignment of developing leukemia in what appears to be a mutation-order-dependent manner. Finally, CEBPB-mediated transdifferentation of committed and otherwise leukemia-incompetent B-cell progenitors imbued these cells with leukemic competence for AML.

We hypothesized that in patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) for lymphoma, CHIP at the time of ASCT would be associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, collectively termed therapy-related myeloid neoplasm (TMN), and other adverse outcomes. Methods We performed whole-exome sequencing on pre- and post-ASCT samples from 12 patients who developed TMN after autologous transplantation for Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma and targeted sequencing on cryopreserved aliquots of autologous stem-cell products from 401 patients who underwent ASCT for non-Hodgkin lymphoma between 2003 and 2010. We assessed the effect of CHIP at the time of ASCT on subsequent outcomes, including TMN, cause-specific mortality, and overall survival. Results For six of 12 patients in the exome sequencing cohort, mutations found in the TMN specimen were also detectable in the pre-ASCT specimen. In the targeted sequencing cohort, 120 patients (29.9%) had CHIP at the time of ASCT, which was associated with an increased rate of TMN (10-year cumulative incidence, 14.1% v 4.3% for those with and without CHIP, respectively; P = .002). Patients with CHIP had significantly inferior overall survival compared with those without CHIP (10-year overall survival, 30.4% v 60.9%, respectively; P < .001), including increased risk of death from TMN and cardiovascular disease. Conclusion In patients undergoing ASCT for lymphoma, CHIP at the time of transplantation is associated with inferior survival and increased risk of TMN.",,"['Gibson, Christopher J', 'Lindsley, R Coleman', 'Tchekmedyian, Vatche', 'Mar, Brenton G', 'Shi, Jiantao', 'Jaiswal, Siddhartha', 'Bosworth, Alysia', 'Francisco, Liton', 'He, Jianbo', 'Bansal, Anita', 'Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Lacasce, Ann S', 'Freedman, Arnold S', 'Fisher, David C', 'Jacobsen, Eric', 'Armand, Philippe', 'Alyea, Edwin P', 'Koreth, John', 'Ho, Vincent', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Nikiforow, Sarah', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Michor, Franziska', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Bhatia, Smita', 'Ebert, Benjamin L']","['Gibson CJ', 'Lindsley RC', 'Tchekmedyian V', 'Mar BG', 'Shi J', 'Jaiswal S', 'Bosworth A', 'Francisco L', 'He J', 'Bansal A', 'Morgan EA', 'Lacasce AS', 'Freedman AS', 'Fisher DC', 'Jacobsen E', 'Armand P', 'Alyea EP', 'Koreth J', 'Ho V', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Antin JH', 'Ritz J', 'Nikiforow S', 'Forman SJ', 'Michor F', 'Neuberg D', 'Bhatia R', 'Bhatia S', 'Ebert BL']","[""Christopher J.

In this study, a series of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing bifendate derivatives (7a-n) were synthesized. Biological evaluation indicated that the most active compound (7a) produced relatively high levels of NO and significantly inhibited the proliferation of drug-resistant K562/A02 cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, 7a induced the mitochondrial tyrosine nitration and the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 by inhibiting P-gp activity in K562/A02 cells. Furthermore, 7a remarkably down-regulated AKT, NF-kappaB, and ERK activation and HIF-1alpha expression in K562/A02 cells, which are associated with the tumor cell proliferation and drug resistance. Notably, the antitumor effects were dramatically attenuated by an NO scavenger or elimination of the NO-releasing capability of 7a, indicating that NO produced by 7a contributed to, at least partly, its cytotoxicity against drug-resistant K562/A02 cells.

Together with anthracyclines, ara-C forms the backbone of AML treatment for children and adults. In AML, both the cytotoxicity of ara-C in vitro and the clinical response to ara-C therapy are correlated with the ability of AML blasts to accumulate the active metabolite ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP), which causes DNA damage through perturbation of DNA synthesis. Differences in expression levels of known transporters or metabolic enzymes relevant to ara-C only partially account for patient-specific differential ara-CTP accumulation in AML blasts and response to ara-C treatment. Here we demonstrate that the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase SAM domain and HD domain 1 (SAMHD1) promotes the detoxification of intracellular ara-CTP pools. Recombinant SAMHD1 exhibited ara-CTPase activity in vitro, and cells in which SAMHD1 expression was transiently reduced by treatment with the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) protein Vpx were dramatically more sensitive to ara-C-induced cytotoxicity. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated disruption of the gene encoding SAMHD1 sensitized cells to ara-C, and this sensitivity could be abrogated by ectopic expression of wild-type (WT), but not dNTPase-deficient, SAMHD1. Mouse models of AML lacking SAMHD1 were hypersensitive to ara-C, and treatment ex vivo with Vpx sensitized primary patient-derived AML blasts to ara-C. Finally, we identified SAMHD1 as a risk factor in cohorts of both pediatric and adult patients with de novo AML who received ara-C treatment. Thus, SAMHD1 expression levels dictate patient sensitivity to ara-C, providing proof-of-concept that the targeting of SAMHD1 by Vpx could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for potentiating ara-C efficacy in hematological malignancies.",,"['Herold, Nikolas', 'Rudd, Sean G', 'Ljungblad, Linda', 'Sanjiv, Kumar', 'Myrberg, Ida Hed', 'Paulin, Cynthia B J', 'Heshmati, Yaser', 'Hagenkort, Anna',

To investigate the prognostic value of MRD(WT1) in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for AML, MRD(WT1) was monitored 3 months after transplantation in 139 patients. MRD(WT1) positivity did not lead to any therapeutic intervention. Median follow-up was 39.3 (6.4-99.8) months. Patients with positive MRD(WT1) at 3 months experienced more often post-transplant relapse (27/30, 90%) than those with negative MRD(WT1) (16/109, 14.7%) (P<0.0001). Similarly, a shorter 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was observed in MRD(WT1)-positive patients (10% vs 72.3% in MRD(WT1)-negative patients, P<0.0001). The correlation between relapse and MRD(WT1) was stronger in blood than in bone marrow samples. Multivariate analysis confirmed the detrimental role of 3-month positive MRD(WT1) for relapse (hazard ratio (HR): 15.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 7.53-31.59; P<0.0001) and EFS (HR: 10.71; 95% CI: 5.41-21.21; P<0.0001). Interestingly, 3-month chimerism was less predictive of relapse than positive MRD(WT1).

Here, we have provided a 3D model that is tunable in different BM niche components and useful, both in vitro and in vivo, for studying the maintenance of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Using scaffolds, we tested the capacity of different stromal cell types to support human HSCs. Scaffolds coated with human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) proved to be superior in terms of HSC engraftment and long-term maintenance when implanted in vivo. Moreover, we found that hMSC-coated scaffolds can be modulated to form humanized bone tissue, which was also able to support human HSC engraftment. Importantly, hMSC-coated humanized scaffolds were able to support the growth of leukemia patient cells in vivo, including the growth of samples that would not engraft the BM of immunodeficient mice. These results demonstrate that an s.c. implantation approach in a 3D carrier scaffold seeded with stromal cells is an effective in vivo niche model for studying human hematopoiesis.

Here, we have investigated the magnitude, diversity, and specificity of alloreactive CD8 T cells in patients who developed GVL reactivity after DLI in the absence or presence of GVHD. We observed a lower magnitude and diversity of CD8 T cells for minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs) in patients with selective GVL reactivity without GVHD. Furthermore, we demonstrated that MiHA-specific T cell clones from patients with selective GVL reactivity showed lower reactivity against nonhematopoietic cells, even when pretreated with inflammatory cytokines. Expression analysis of MiHA-encoding genes showed that similar types of antigens were recognized in both patient groups, but in patients who developed GVHD, T cell reactivity was skewed to target broadly expressed MiHAs. As an inflammatory environment can render nonhematopoietic cells susceptible to T cell recognition, prevention of such circumstances favors induction of selective GVL reactivity without development of GVHD.",,"['van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'de Wreede, Liesbeth C', 'Eefting, Matthijs', 'von dem Borne, Peter A', 'van Balen, Peter', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'Mulder, Arend', 'Claas, Fransiscus H J', 'Navarrete, Marcelo A', 'Honders, Wilhelmina M', 'Rutten, Caroline E', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Jedema, Inge', 'Halkes, Constantijn J M', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['van Bergen CA', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SA', 'de Wreede LC', 'Eefting M', 'von dem Borne PA', 'van Balen P', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Mulder A', 'Claas FH', 'Navarrete MA', 'Honders WM', 'Rutten CE', 'Veelken H', 'Jedema I', 'Halkes CJ', 'Griffioen M', 'Falkenburg JH']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170109,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*immunology']",,,2017/01/10 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2017/01/10 06:00'],"['2016/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['86175 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI86175 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2017 Feb 1;127(2):517-529. doi: 10.1172/JCI86175.

We hypothesize that cells harbouring spliceosome gene mutations have increased sensitivity to pharmacological perturbation of the spliceosome. We focus on mutant U2AF1 and utilize sudemycin compounds that modulate pre-mRNA splicing. We find that haematopoietic cells expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F), including primary patient cells, have an increased sensitivity to in vitro sudemycin treatment relative to controls. In vivo sudemycin treatment of U2AF1(S34F) transgenic mice alters splicing and reverts haematopoietic progenitor cell expansion induced by mutant U2AF1 expression. The splicing effects of sudemycin and U2AF1(S34F) can be cumulative in cells exposed to both perturbations-drug and mutation-compared with cells exposed to either alone. These cumulative effects may result in downstream phenotypic consequences in sudemycin-treated mutant cells.

Targeting the CD20-positive B-cells with therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) has been an effectual strategy in the treatment of hematologic malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Initial success with Rituximab (RTX) has encouraged the creation and development of more effective CD20 based therapeutics. However, treatment with conventional MAbs has not been adequate to overcome the problems such as refractory/ relapsed disease. In this regard, new generations of MAbs with enhanced affinity or improved anti-tumor properties have been developed. OBJECTIVE: CD20 directed therapeutics have heterogeneous features and mechanisms of action. Hence, having sufficient knowledge on the immunological and molecular aspects of CD20 based cancer therapy is necessary for predicting the clinical outcomes and taking the necessary measures. METHOD: An extensive search was performed in PubMed and similar databases for peer-reviewed articles concerning the biology, function and characteristics of CD20 molecule as well as the mechanisms of action and evolutionary process of CD20 targeting agents. RESULTS: This review provides information about the current situation of CD20 targeting immunotherapeutics including MAbs, bispecific antibodies (which exert multiple functions or involve Tcells in tumor elimination) and CAR T-cells (engineered T-cells armed with chimeric antigen receptors). Moreover, limitations, challenges and available solutions regarding the application of CD20 targeting treatments are addressed. CONCLUSION: Utilization of CD20-targeted therapeutics, due to their diverse properties, requires special considerations.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Shanehbandi, Dariush', 'Majidi, Jafar', 'Kazemi, Tohid', 'Baradaran, Behzad', 'Aghebati-Maleki, Leili']","['Shanehbandi D', 'Majidi J', 'Kazemi T', 'Baradaran B', 'Aghebati-Maleki L']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz.

Gene therapy by infusion of FA-corrected autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) may offer a potential cure since it is a monogenetic disease with mutations in the FANC genes, coding for DNA repair enzymes [1]. However, the collection of hCD34+-cells in FA patients implies particular challenges because of the reduced numbers of progenitor cells present in their bone marrow (BM) [2] or mobilized peripheral blood [3-5]. In addition, the FA genetic defect fragilizes the HSCs [6]. These particular features might explain why the first clinical trials using murine leukemia virus derived retroviral vectors conducted for FA failed to show engraftment of corrected cells. The gene therapy field is now moving towards the use of lentiviral vectors (LVs) evidenced by recent succesful clinical trials for the treatment of patients suffering from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) [7], beta-thalassemia [8], metachromatic leukodystrophy [9] and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome [10]. LV trials for X-linked severe combined immunodificiency and Fanconi anemia (FA) defects were recently initiated [11, 12]. Fifteen years of preclinical studies using different FA mouse models and in vitro research allowed us to find the weak points in the in vitro culture and transduction conditions, which most probably led to the initial failure of FA HSC gene therapy. In this review, we will focus on the different obstacles, unique to FA gene therapy, and how they have been overcome through the development of optimized protocols for FA HSC culture and transduction and the engineering of new gene transfer tools for FA HSCs. These combined advances in the field hopefully will allow the correction of the FA hematological defect in the near future.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Verhoeyen, Els', 'Roman-Rodriguez, Francisco Jose', 'Cosset, Francois-Loic', 'Levy, Camille', 'Rio, Paula']","['Verhoeyen E', 'Roman-Rodriguez FJ', 'Cosset FL', 'Levy C', 'Rio P']","[""CIRI/EVIR.

All IN proteins have three general domains, the N-terminal domain (NTD), the catalytic core domain, and the C-terminal domain. The NTD includes an HHCC zinc finger-like motif, which is conserved in all retroviral IN proteins. Two crystal structures of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) IN N-terminal region (NTR) constructs that both include an N-terminal extension domain (NED, residues 1-44) and an HHCC zinc-finger NTD (residues 45-105), in two crystal forms are reported. The structures of IN NTR constructs encoding residues 1-105 (NTR1-105 ) and 8-105 (NTR8-105 ) were determined at 2.7 and 2.15 A resolution, respectively and belong to different space groups. While both crystal forms have similar protomer structures, NTR1-105 packs as a dimer and NTR8-105 packs as a tetramer in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the NED consists of three anti-parallel beta-strands and an alpha-helix, similar to the NED of prototype foamy virus (PFV) IN. These three beta-strands form an extended beta-sheet with another beta-strand in the HHCC Zn(2+) binding domain, which is a unique structural feature for the M-MuLV IN. The HHCC Zn(2+) binding domain structure is similar to that in HIV and PFV INs, with variations within the loop regions. Differences between the PFV and MLV IN NEDs localize at regions identified to interact with the PFV LTR and are compared with established biochemical and virological data for M-MuLV.

Eradication of cancer stem cells is crucial for curing the malignant disease. Previous studies in hematopoietic malignancies showed that leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) chronic phase are originated from a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), while LSCs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can either be derived from HSCs or be transformed from myeloid progenitors. But in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), the origin of leukemia stem cells is not clear. In this study, we tested whether BCR/ABL could transform B-lineage committed CD19(+) cells to LSCs. METHODS: The B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia mouse model was generated by transplanting BCR/ABL-containing retrovirus infected bone marrow (BM) cells or CD19(+) cells into recipient mice. In the secondary or tertiary transplantation experiment, the GFP(+) cells (leukemic cells) were isolated from primary or secondary B-ALL mice. In addition, the frequency of leukemia stem cells was determined by limited dilution assay. RESULTS: We found that transducing BCR/ABL in CD19(+) cells can promote their colony formation in vitro and induce B-ALL like disease in vivo. However, only BCR/ABL transduced whole BM cells can be transplanted multiple times in recipient mice, and the frequency of long-term LSCs from the latter ranges from 1/135 to 1/629. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that BCR/ABL is unable to confer the long-term stemness to committed B-lymphoid progenitors and imply that CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cell therapy may not be effective in eradicating LSCs in BCR/ABL(+) B-ALL.",,"['Li, Donghe', 'Zhao, Xuemei', 'Zhang, Ruihong', 'Jiao, Bo', 'Liu, Ping', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Li D', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang R', 'Jiao B', 'Liu P', 'Ren R']","['State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of System Biology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of System Biology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of System Biology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of System Biology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of System Biology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Collaborative Innovation Center of System Biology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China; ; Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161130,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)', 'BCR/ABL', 'leukemia stem cell (LSC)']",2017/01/10 06:00,2017/01/10 06:01,['2017/01/10 06:00'],"['2016/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/sci.2016.11.06 [doi]', 'sci-03-2016.11.06 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2016 Nov 30;3:85. doi: 10.21037/sci.2016.11.06. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC5182205,,,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,

So far, therapeutic options for patients with AML or MDS who relapse after allo-SCT generally consisted of palliative care, low-dose or intensive chemotherapy as well as cellular therapies such as donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and second transplantation in selected cases. Nevertheless, the prognosis of patients with myeloid malignancies relapsing after allo-SCT remains dismal therefore asking for novel treatment strategies. Considering their well-balanced profile of good efficacy and moderate toxicity in the non-transplant setting, the hypomethylating agents (HMA) azacitidine (Aza) and decitabine (DAC) have also been tested either alone or in combination with DLI in the post-transplant period. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the use of these two HMA as pre-emptive, salvage or consolidation therapy mostly retrieved from retrospective studies but also from a few prospective trials. Within this review, we also comment on some practical issues such as optimal dose and schedule, the choice of HMA candidates and the role of additional cellular interventions.

Here, in this study, we investigate the association between the incidence and severity of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and the early reconstitution of NK cell subsets following allo-SCT. We analyzed 342 samples from 107 patients using flow cytometry, with a focus on immature CD56(high) and mature cytotoxic CD56(dim) NK cells. Longitudinal analysis of immune reconstitution after allo-SCT showed that the incidence of aGVHD was associated with a delayed expansion of the entire NK cell population, in particular the CD56(high) subset.

Increasing evidences showed several signal pathways involved in ALV-J infection. However, what signaling pathway involved in growth retardation is largely unknown. To explore the possible signaling pathway, we tested the cell proliferation and associated miRNAs in ALV-J infected CEF cells by CCK-8 and Hiseq, respectively. The results showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by ALV-J and three associated miRNAs were identified to target Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. To verify the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway involved in cell growth retardation, we analyzed the key molecules of Wnt pathway in ALV-J infected CEF cells. Our data demonstrated that protein expression of beta-catenin was decreased significantly post ALV-J infection compared with the normal (P < 0.05). The impact of this down-regulation caused low expression of known target genes (Axin2, CyclinD1, Tcf4 and Lef1). Further, to obtain in vivo evidence, we set up an ALV-J infection model. Post 7 weeks infection, ALV-J infected chickens showed significant growth retardation. Subsequent tests showed that the expression of beta-catenin, Tcf1, Tcf4, Lef1, Axin2 and CyclinD1 were down-regulated in muscles of growth retardation chickens. Taken together, all data demonstrated that chicken growth retardation caused by ALV-J associated with down-regulated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Defects in hematopoiesis have also been reported in Cdx mutant murine embryonic stem cell models, however, to date no mouse model reflecting the zebrafish Cdx mutant hematopoietic phenotype has been described. This is likely due, in part, to functional redundancy among Cdx members and the early lethality of Cdx2 null mutants. To circumvent these limitations, we used Cre-mediated conditional deletion to assess the impact of concomitant loss of Cdx1 and Cdx2 on murine primitive hematopoiesis. We found that Cdx1/Cdx2 double mutants exhibited defects in primitive hematopoiesis and yolk sac vasculature concomitant with reduced expression of several genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors including Scl/Tal1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Scl was occupied by Cdx2 in vivo, and Cdx mutant hematopoietic yolk sac differentiation defects could be rescued by expression of exogenous Scl.

METHODS: We collected information on remodeling activities carried out between birth and diagnosis in homes of 609 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, 89 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases, and 893 matched controls participating in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (1995-2008). We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of ALL and AML associated with six remodeling activities: construction, painting, recarpeting, reflooring, roofing, and weatherproofing. Models were adjusted for age, sex, Hispanic ethnicity, race, household annual income, and residential mobility. RESULTS: Construction in the home between birth and diagnosis was associated with a significant increase in ALL risk (odds ratio [OR]: 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-2.02) and a nonsignificant increase in AML risk (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 0.98-3.15). No other remodeling activities were associated with ALL or AML risk in the main analysis.

Despite similar expression at the mRNA level from the wild-type and chimeric MLL alleles, the chimeric protein is more stable. We report that UBE2O functions in regulating the stability of wild-type MLL in response to interleukin-1 signaling. Targeting wild-type MLL degradation impedes MLL leukemia cell proliferation, and it downregulates a specific group of target genes of the MLL chimeras and their oncogenic cofactor, the super elongation complex. Pharmacologically inhibiting this pathway substantially delays progression, and it improves survival of murine leukemia through stabilizing wild-type MLL protein, which displaces the MLL chimera from some of its target genes and, therefore, relieves the cellular oncogenic addiction to MLL chimeras.

MLL rearrangements are important markers in diagnosis and treatment choice. To identify the partner gene is of primary importance for prognosis and minimal residual disease monitoring. The structure of the fusion gene, including localization of the MLL breakpoints, is also informative. A method was developed to examine the fusion transcripts in order to identify the partner gene among the six most common ones and to establish the exon structure of the rearranged MLL. The method includes a multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify and to fluorescently label a fusion transcript fragment and subsequent hybridization of the product on a biological microchip with immobilized oligonucleotides complementary to exons of MLL and its partner genes AFF1, MLLT1, MLLT3, MLLT4, MLLT10, and ELL. Hybridization results were verified by sequencing the RT-PCR products and, in some cases, performing long-distance inverse PCR (LDI-PCR). The study involved 38 bone marrow samples from ALL patients (including 33 children younger than 1 year of age) and 15 samples from AML patients (including 10 from children younger than 1 year of age).

We recently identified an essential role for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in T-cell activation and effector function, but the contribution of Cdk5 activity to the development of GVHD has not been explored. Using an established, preclinical, murine, GVHD model, we reveal that Cdk5 activity is increased in key target organs early after allo-HCT. We then generated chimeric mice (Cdk5(+/+C) or Cdk5(-/-C)) using hematopoietic progenitors from either embryonic day 16.5 Cdk5(+/+) or Cdk5(-/-) embryos to enable analyses of the role of Cdk5 in GVHD, as germ line Cdk5 gene deletion is embryonically lethal. The immunophenotype of adult Cdk5(-/-C) mice is identical to control Cdk5(+/+C) mice. However, transplantation of donor Cdk5(-/-C) bone marrow and T cells dramatically reduced the severity of systemic and target organ GVHD. This phenotype is attributed to decreased T-cell migration to secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), reduced in vivo proliferation within these organs, and fewer cytokine-producing donor T cells during GVHD development. Moreover, these defects in Cdk5(-/-) T-cell function are associated with altered CCR7 signaling following ligation by CCL19, a receptor:ligand interaction critical for T-cell migration into SLOs. Although Cdk5 activity in donor T cells contributed to graft-versus-tumor effects, pharmacologic inhibition of Cdk5 preserved leukemia-free survival. Collectively, our data implicate Cdk5 in allogeneic T-cell responses after HCT and as an important new target for therapeutic intervention.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Askew, David', 'Pareek, Tej K', 'Eid, Saada', 'Ganguly, Sudipto', 'Tyler, Megan', 'Huang, Alex Y', 'Letterio, John J', 'Cooke, Kenneth R']","['Askew D', 'Pareek TK', 'Eid S', 'Ganguly S', 'Tyler M', 'Huang AY', 'Letterio JJ', 'Cooke KR']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'The Angie Fowler Adolescent & Young Adult Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'The Angie Fowler Adolescent & Young Adult Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'The Angie Fowler Adolescent & Young Adult Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'The Angie Fowler Adolescent & Young Adult Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH; and.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine and.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'The Angie Fowler Adolescent & Young Adult Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161114,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Allografts', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/immunology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2017/01/09 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/01/09 06:00'],"['2016/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33806-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-05-702738 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jan 12;129(2):246-256. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-05-702738.

In addition to the identification of multiple mutations and chromosomal aberrations driving the progression of myeloid malignancies, alterations in the niche compartment recently gained attention for contributing to disease progression. Leukemic cells can remodel the niche into a permissive environment favoring leukemic stem cell expansion over normal HSC maintenance, and evidence is accumulating that certain niche alterations can even induce leukemic transformation. Relapse after chemotherapy is still a major challenge during treatment of myeloid malignancies, and cure is only rarely achieved.

Methods and results: Eighty-six patients with Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or acute leukaemia and receiving anthracyclines were prospectively included. Patients underwent complete echocardiography on four occasions: baseline (V1); after reaching a cumulative dose of 150 mg/m2 (V2); end of treatment (V3); and 1 year follow-up (V4). Six patients developed cardiotoxicity, defined as a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction of >10 percentage points, to a value <53%, at V4. GLS measured at V1 and V2 was significantly lower in the cardiotoxicity group vs. the controls (P = 0.042 and P = 0.01, respectively). Compared with GLS at V1, GLS obtained at V2 provided incremental predictive information and appeared to be the strongest predictor of cardiotoxicity (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, 0.82). At a threshold of -17.45% for GLS measured at V2, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting cardiotoxicity were 67% (95% confidence interval 33-100) and 97% (95% confidence interval 94-100), respectively. Conclusion: GLS greater than -17.45%, obtained after 150 mg/m2 of anthracycline therapy, is an independent predictor of future anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. These findings should encourage physicians to perform echocardiography earlier during treatment with anthracyclines.","['Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

In the present study, we examined the level of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a pleiotropic cytokine in interleukin (IL)-6 family, in T2DM patients and investigated the regulation by HG on the induction of LIF/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Then we determined the regulation of HG and LIF on the osteoblast differentiation via measuring the ALP activity, matrix mineralization, and the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Osteocalcin (OCN) and osteopontin (OPN) in human osteoblast MG-63 cells. In addition, we evaluated the dependence of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3)/STAT3 signaling in the progress. Results indicated significantly higher serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), IL-1beta, IL-6 and LIF in T2DM patients. HG induced markedly higher levels of these cytokines in vitro. Furthermore, either HG or LIF reduced the expression of ALP, OCN and RUNX2 in both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, LIF markedly promoted the expression of SOCS3, significantly upregulated the phosphorylation of STAT3 in MG-63 cells; and the downregulation of the four osteogenic differentiation-associated markers were restored by 50 or 100nM STAT3 inhibitor, JSI-124. In summary, this study has shown that LIF is implicated in the HG-mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation, via promoting STAT3/SOCS3 signaling.

To examine the current practice concerning relapse surveillance in this population, we conducted a national survey of pediatric bone marrow transplant physicians. Sixty-two of 152 potential participants (41%) completed the survey. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, 41 physicians (66%) reported performing routine BM analysis in all such patients, 15 (24%) in some patients and 6 (10%) in no patients. Data were similar for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Among those who do such screening in the ALL population, 11 physicians (24%) reported performing 1 BM analysis in the first year, 11 (24%) performed 2, 6 (13%) performed 3, 12 (27%) performed 4, and 5 (12%) performed 5 to 10. Data were similar for AML. The most common time point for screening in both diseases was day 100, followed closely by day 365. With respect to central nervous system (CNS) screening in ALL, 11 physicians (18%) screened all patients, 28 (45%) screened no patients, and 23 (37%) screened only patients with prior CNS disease. Use of intrathecal chemotherapy in these patients also varied, with 7 (12%) doing so in all patients, 17 (29%) only in previously CNS-positive patients, and 35 (59%) in no patients. To assess the utility of surveillance procedures, we performed a retrospective review of 108 childhood leukemia patients after alloHCT at our center. Forty-one relapses (38%) occurred with a median time to relapse of 171 days. Five (12%) occurred after day 365. Of the 36 relapses within the first year, 20 (56%) were identified by clinical suspicion, whereas 16 (44%) were identified by routine screening procedures. The percentages of patients in whom routine screening detected relapse at days 100, 180, 270, and 365, respectively, was 6.7%, 11.1%, 11.9%, and 0%. That is, by day 365, no patient (of 38) who had routine BM surveillance had evidence of relapse on analysis of the BM. Our survey confirms a lack of standardization regarding routine BM and CSF relapse surveillance after alloHCT in children with leukemia. We have demonstrated that while day 365 post-alloHCT is a very commonly utilized time point for routine screening, the yield of such screening at this time is very low, such that the performance of these procedures may not be justified at that time. Prospective collaboration among pediatric alloHCT centers may help to provide more robust evidence-based guidelines designed to maximize utility and minimize risk.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

They play important roles in RNA dimerization and encapsidation through two identical tetra-loops (5'GACG3') forming a loop-to-loop kissing complex, the smallest RNA kissing complex ever found in nature. We examined the effects of a loop-closing base pair as well as a stem sequence on the conformational stability of the kissing complex. UV melting analysis and gel electrophoresis were performed on eight RNA sequences mimicking the H2 and H3 hairpin tetra-loops with variation in loop-closing base pairs. Our results show that changing the loop-closing base pair from the wildtype (5'A.U3' for H3, 5'U.A3' for H2) to 5'G.C3'/5'C.G3' has significant effect on the stability of the kissing complexes: the substitution to 5'C.G3' significantly decreases both thermal and mechanical stability, while switching to the 5'G.C3' significantly increases the mechanical stability only. The kissing complexes with the wildtype loop-closing base pairs (5'A.U3' for H3 and 5'U.A3' for H2) show different stability when attached to a different stem sequence (H2 stem vs. H3 stem). This suggests that not only the loop-closing base pair itself, but also the stem sequence, affects the conformational stability of the RNA kissing complex.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: Mononucleated cells from 108 bone marrow samples collected from 55 B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (30 with t(12;21)/ETV6-RUNX1, 16 with t(9;22)/BCR-ABL1 and nine with t(1;19)/TCF3-PBX1) were examined in tandem by RQ-PCR and six-color flow cytometry. RESULTS: MRD results were concordant in 91 of the 108 paired samples (84.2%; K=0.690); 49 samples were MRD-negative while 42 were MRD-positive by both methods, with < 1 log difference in positive MRD estimates in 39 samples (92.9%). Of the 17 discordant samples, 16 were MRD-positive by RQ-PCR but MRD-negative by flow cytometry; the opposite was true in one sample. Kappa value/concordance was 0.690/85.0% (n = 60) for ETV6-RUNX1, 0.842/93.3% (n = 15) for TCF3-PBX1, and 0.535/78.8% (n = 33) for BCR-ABL1. Specific immunophenotypic abnormalities were more prevalent in each genetic subgroup, such as CD38 underexpression, CD58 overexpression, and CD34 overexpression in ETV6-RUNX1, TCF3-PBX1, and BCR-ABL1, respectively.

Apart from being a known carcinogen for humans (group 1 according to IARC), there is scientific evidence suggesting a relationship between benzene exposure and respiratory problems in children. But results are still inconclusive and inconsistent. This study aims to assess the determinants of exposure to indoor and outdoor residential benzene levels and its relationship with respiratory health in infants. Participants were 1-year-old infants (N = 352) from the INMA cohort from Valencia (Spain). Residential benzene exposure levels were measured inside and outside dwellings by means of passive samplers in a 15-day campaign. Persistent cough, low respiratory tract infections and wheezing during the first year of life, and covariates (dwelling traits, lifestyle factors and sociodemographic data) were obtained from parental questionnaires. Multiple Tobit regression and logistic regression models were performed to assess factors associated to residential exposure levels and health associations, respectively. Indoor levels were higher than outdoor ones (1.46 and 0.77 mug/m(3), respectively; p < 0.01). A considerable percentage of dwellings, 42% and 21% indoors and outdoors respectively, surpassed the WHO guideline of 1.7 mug/m(3) derived from a lifetime risk of leukemia above 1/100 000. Monitoring season, maternal country of birth and parental tobacco consumption were associated with residential benzene exposure (indoor and outdoors). Additionally, indoor levels were associated with mother's age and type of heating, and outdoor levels were linked with zone of residence and distance from industrial areas. After adjustment for confounding factors, no significant associations were found between residential benzene exposure levels and respiratory health in infants. Hence, our study did not support the hypothesis for the benzene exposure effect on respiratory health in children. Even so, it highlights a public health concern related to the personal exposure levels, since a considerable number of children surpassed the abovementioned WHO guideline for benzene exposure.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed 158 children with precursor B-cell type ALL who were followed up for >2 years. The patients were assigned to the groups musculoskeletal manifestations (n = 24) or nonmusculoskeletal manifestations (n = 134) based on initial presenting symptom. The symptom duration (regarding any initial presenting symptom) and the leukemic symptom duration (regarding symptoms of systemic manifestation, such as fever, bleeding, or pallor) were assessed, along with other clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The musculoskeletal manifestations group exhibited a longer symptom duration than the nonmusculoskeletal manifestations group (43 days vs 22 days, P = .006), but overall survival did not significantly differ between the groups. Multivariate analysis indicated that a longer symptom duration did not affect prognosis but that a longer leukemic symptom duration was associated with a poorer prognosis (hazard ratio, 7.720; P = .048). CONCLUSION: Musculoskeletal manifestations are associated significantly with diagnostic delay, but this delay does not affect the prognosis. Diagnostic delay after the onset of leukemic symptoms, however, does appear to affect the prognosis. Intensive evaluations for hematologic malignancies may be unnecessary in children who complain of limb pain without any definite cause, unless they also present with accompanying leukemic symptoms.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The gene expression levels of prosurvival signals Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, survivin and XIAP were down-regulated upon CREB suppression.

While expression of PTP4A1 and PTP4A2 remained relatively unchanged across diseases, PTP4A3 showed marked overexpression in ETV6-RUNX1 and BCR-ABL1 subtypes of precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We show that PTP4A3 is regulated by the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion, but noticed no marked impact on cell viability either after PTP4A3 silencing or treatment with a PTP4A3 inhibitor.

The purpose of the current article is to review the literature on SI for hematologic malignancies and disorders, including: (1) patient selection and optimal technique; (2) efficacy of SI; and (3) toxicities of SI. PICOS/PRISMA methods are used to select 27 articles including 766 courses of SI for 486 patients from 1960 to 2016. The most common cancers treated included chronic lymphocytic leukemia and myeloproliferative disorders; the most common regimen was 10Gy in 1Gy fractions over two weeks, and 27% of patients received retreatment. A partial or complete response (for symptoms, lab abnormalities) was obtained in 85-90% of treated patients, and 30% were retreated within 6-12months. There was no correlation between biologically equivalent dose of radiation therapy and response duration, pain relief, spleen reduction, or cytopenia improvement (r(2) all <0.4); therefore, lower doses (e.g. 5Gy in 5 fractions) may be as effective as higher doses. Grade 3-4 toxicity (typically leukopenia, infection) was noted in 22% of courses, with grade 5 toxicity in 0.7% of courses. All grade 5 toxicities were due to either thrombocytopenia with hemorrhage or leukopenia with sepsis (or a combination of both); they were sequelae of cancer and not directly caused by SI. In summary, SI is generally a safe and efficacious method for treating patients with symptomatic splenomegaly.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical features of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with ASXL2 mutations remain unclear. Thus, we investigated frequencies of ASXL1 and ASXL2 mutations, clinical features of patients with these mutations, correlations of these mutations with other genetic alterations including BCOR/BCORL1 and cohesin complex component genes, and prognostic impact of these mutations in 369 pediatric patients with de novo AML (0-17 years). We identified 9 (2.4%) ASXL1 and 17 (4.6%) ASXL2 mutations in 25 patients. These mutations were more common in patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (ASXL1, 6/9, 67%, P = 0.02; ASXL2, 10/17, 59%, P = 0.01). Among these 25 patients, 4 (27%) of 15 patients with t(8;21) and 6 (60%) of 10 patients without t(8;21) relapsed. However, most patients with relapse were rescued using stem cell transplantation irrespective of t(8;21). The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates showed no differences among pediatric AML patients with t(8;21) and ASXL1 or ASXL2 mutations and ASXL wild-type (5-year OS, 75% vs. 100% vs. 91% and 5-year EFS, 67% vs. 80% vs. 67%). In 106 patients with t(8;21) AML, the coexistence of mutations in tyrosine kinase pathways and chromatin modifiers and/or cohesin complex component genes had no effect on prognosis. These results suggest that ASXL1 and ASXL2 mutations play key roles as cooperating mutations that induce leukemogenesis, particularly in pediatric AML patients with t(8;21), and these mutations might be associated with a better prognosis than that reported previously.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yamato, Genki', 'Shiba, Norio', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Hara, Yusuke',

Novel CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and NUP98-KDM5A fusions recurrently found in AMKL were recently reported as poor prognostic factors. However, their detailed clinical and molecular characteristics in patients treated with recent improved therapies remain uncertain. We analyzed molecular features of 44 AMKL patients treated on two recent Japanese AML protocols, the AML99 and AML-05 trials. We identified CBFA2T3-GLIS2, NUP98-KDM5A, RBM15-MKL1, and KMT2A rearrangements in 12 (27%), 4 (9%), 2 (5%), and 3 (7%) patients, respectively. Among 459 other AML patients, NUP98-KDM5A was identified in 3 patients, whereas CBFA2T3-GLIS2 and RBM15-MKL1 were only present in AMKL. GATA1 mutations were found in 5 patients (11%). Four-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients in AMKL were 41.7% and 16.7%, respectively. Three-year cumulative incidence of relapse in CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients was significantly higher than that of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-negative patients (75.0% vs. 35.7%, P = 0.024). In multivariate analyses, CBFA2T3-GLIS2 was an independent poor prognostic factor for OS (HR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.31-14.38) and EFS (HR, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.20-7.23). Furthermore, seven (54%) of 13 infant AMKL patients were CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive. Notably, out of 7 CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive infants, six (86%) relapsed and five (71%) died. Moreover, all of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive patients who experienced induction failure (n = 3) were infants, indicating worse prognosis of CBFA2T3-GLIS2-positive infants. These findings indicated the significance of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 as a poor prognostic factor in AMKL patients, particularly in infants.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hara, Yusuke', 'Shiba, Norio', 'Ohki, Kentaro', 'Tabuchi, Ken', 'Yamato, Genki', 'Park, Myoung-Ja', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Kinoshita, Akitoshi', 'Shimada, Akira', 'Arakawa, Hirokazu', 'Saito, Akiko M', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Tawa, Akio', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Taga, Takashi', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Taki, Tomohiko', 'Hayashi, Yasuhide']","['Hara Y', 'Shiba N', 'Ohki K', 'Tabuchi K', 'Yamato G', 'Park MJ', 'Tomizawa D', 'Kinoshita A', 'Shimada A', 'Arakawa H', 'Saito AM', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Tawa A', 'Horibe K', 'Taga T', 'Adachi S', 'Taki T', 'Hayashi Y']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", ""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, St Marianna University School of Medicine, Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Hospital Organization Osaka National Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Japan."", 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Gunma Red Cross Blood Center, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170214,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,,2017/01/08 06:00,2017/07/22 06:00,['2017/01/08 06:00'],"['2016/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22444 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2017 May;56(5):394-404. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22444.

This study aimed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of S100A9 and its function involvement in APL. We used real-time quantitative PCR to determine whether PML/RARalpha affects the expression of S100A9 in NB4 and PR9 cells upon ATRA treatment. ChIP-based PCR and dual-luciferase reporter assay system were used to detect how PML/RARalpha and PU.1 regulate S100A9 promoter activity. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were employed to observe the viability and apoptosis of NB4 cells when S100A9 was overexpressed. Results showed that S100A9 was an ATRA-responsive gene, and PML/RARalpha was necessary for the ATRA-induced expression of S100A9 in APL cells. In addition, PU.1 could bind to the promoter of S100A9, especially when treated with ATRA in NB4 cells, and promote its activity. More importantly, overexpression of S100A9 induced the apoptosis of NB4 cells and inhibited cell growth. Collectively, our data indicated that PML/RARalpha and PU.1 were necessary for the ATRA-induced expression of S100A9 in APL cells.

While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative therapeutic approach to many MyMs, the associated morbidity and mortality have necessitated the development of non-HSCT therapeutics for symptom management and disease course modification. Immune checkpoint inhibition, in particular along the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/B7-H1 (PD-L1) axis, is an established strategy in solid tumors with potential as an adjunctive therapy in hematologic malignancies. Seminal studies suggest that the pro-inflammatory microenvironment of MyMs can suppress T lymphocyte-mediated immunity via PD-1 signaling and that response to mainstay epigenetic therapies for MyMs may be governed by PD-1 gene regulation. Although the role of PD-1 signaling in MPN pathogenesis and progression is as yet unclear, research in MPN patients has revealed expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which may effect host immune tolerance of tumor via temporally and spatially specific activation of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling.

The present study focused on cancer incidence among rubber workers first employed after 1975 in Sweden and the UK. METHODS: Two cohorts of rubber workers employed for at least 1 year were analysed. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs), based on country-specific and period-specific incidence rates, were analysed for all cancers combined (except non-melanoma skin), bladder, lung, stomach cancer, leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Exploratory analyses were conducted for other cancers with a minimum of 10 cases in both genders combined. RESULTS: 16 026 individuals (12 441 men; 3585 women) contributed to 397 975 person-years of observation, with 846 cancers observed overall (437 in the UK, 409 in Sweden). No statistically significant increased risk was observed for any site of cancer. A reduced risk was evident for all cancers combined (SIR=0.83, 95% CI (0.74 to 0.92)), lung cancer (SIR=0.74, 95% CI (0.59 to 0.93)), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR=0.67, 95% CI (0.45 to 1.00)) and prostate cancer (SIR=0.77, 95% CI (0.64 to 0.92)). For stomach cancer and multiple myeloma, SIRs were 0.93 (95% CI (0.61 to 1.43)) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.44 to 1.91), respectively. No increased risk of bladder cancer was observed (SIR=0.88, 95% CI (0.61 to 1.28)). CONCLUSIONS: No significantly increased risk of cancer incidence was observed in the combined cohort of rubber workers first employed since 1975. Continued surveillance of the present cohorts is required to confirm absence of long-term risk and confirmatory findings from other cohorts would be important.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are examples of contrasting B-cell cancers; BL is a highly aggressive lymphoid tumor, frequently affecting children, whereas CLL typically presents as an indolent, slow-progressing leukemia affecting the elderly. The B-cell-specific overexpression of the myc and TCL1 oncogenes in mice induce spontaneous malignancies modeling BL and CLL, respectively. Quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics and isobaric labeling were employed to examine the biology underpinning contrasting Emu-myc and Emu-TCL1 B-cell tumors. Additionally, the plasma proteome was evaluated using subproteome enrichment to interrogate biomarker emergence and the systemic effects of tumor burden. Over 10,000 proteins were identified (q<0.01) of which 8270 cellular and 2095 plasma proteins were quantitatively profiled. A common B-cell tumor signature of 695 overexpressed proteins highlighted ribosome biogenesis, cell-cycle promotion and chromosome segregation. Emu-myc tumors overexpressed several methylating enzymes and underexpressed many cytoskeletal components. Emu-TCL1 tumors specifically overexpressed ER stress response proteins and signaling components in addition to both subunits of the interleukin-5 (IL5) receptor. IL5 treatment promoted Emu-TCL1 tumor proliferation, suggesting an amplification of IL5-induced AKT signaling by TCL1. Tumor plasma contained a substantial tumor lysis signature, most prominent in Emu-myc plasma, whereas Emu-TCL1 plasma contained signatures of immune-response, inflammation and microenvironment interactions, with putative biomarkers in early-stage cancer. These findings provide a detailed characterization of contrasting B-cell tumor models, identifying common and specific tumor mechanisms. Integrated plasma proteomics allowed the dissection of a systemic response and a tumor lysis signature present in early- and late-stage cancers, respectively. Overall, this study suggests common B-cell cancer signatures exist and illustrates the potential of the further evaluation of B-cell cancer subtypes by integrative proteomics.","['(c) 2017 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Johnston, Harvey E', 'Carter, Matthew J', 'Cox, Kerry L', 'Dunscombe, Melanie', 'Manousopoulou, Antigoni', 'Townsend, Paul A', 'Garbis, Spiros D', 'Cragg, Mark S']","['Johnston HE', 'Carter MJ', 'Cox KL', 'Dunscombe M', 'Manousopoulou A', 'Townsend PA', 'Garbis SD', 'Cragg MS']","['From the double daggerAntibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'section signCentre for Proteomic Research, Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield Campus, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'From the double daggerAntibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'From the double daggerAntibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'From the double daggerAntibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'section signCentre for Proteomic Research, Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield Campus, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'paragraph signClinical and Experimental Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', '||Molecular and Clinical Cancer Sciences, Paterson Building, Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4BX.', 'section signCentre for Proteomic Research, Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Highfield Campus, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.', 'paragraph signClinical and Experimental Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'From the double daggerAntibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, General Hospital, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK; msc@soton.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170104,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/blood/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics']",,,2017/01/08 06:00,2017/07/20 06:00,['2017/01/08 06:00'],"['2016/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)32420-8 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M116.063511 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2017 Mar;16(3):386-406. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M116.063511.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis was done on 75 BM specimens; Jamshidi needle (n=44) and OnControl (n=31). Biopsy length after fixation, evaluable marrow length and total area, and fragmentation, aspiration and marrow dropout artefacts were compared. RESULTS: Biopsies were sufficient for diagnosis in 38/44 cases (86%) in the M-group and in 26/31 cases (83%) in the P-group. The most common reason for suboptimal/inadequate biopsies was subcortical specimens (4/6) in the M-group and aspiration artefact (5/5) in the P-group. Average length after fixation, evaluable marrow length, evaluable marrow area was comparable. Aspiration artefact was minimal (<10%) in the majority of BM samples in the M-group (31/44), while 25/31 BM in the P-group showed >10% aspiration artefact, p<0.0001. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that quality of biopsy cylinder and adequacy rate of the biopsy is comparable between both devices. OnControl device showed more aspiration artefact.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Relapse of ALL occurs in 15%-20% of patients, with 2%-6% occurring exclusively in extramedullary sites. Relapse of ALL in gynecologic organs is extremely rare. CASE: We present a case of a 12-year-old girl with a history of ALL who was referred to the pediatric gynecology clinic with abnormal uterine bleeding. She was determined to have an extramedullary uterine relapse of her ALL. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: Abnormal uterine bleeding in the setting of childhood malignancy is a frequent reason for consultation to pediatric and adolescent gynecology services. This bleeding is commonly attributed to thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow suppressive chemotherapeutic agents. However, as shown in this report, abnormal uterine bleeding might be a manifestation of an extramedullary relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2017 North American Society for Pediatric and Adolescent', 'Gynecology.

No study has previously evaluated the risk for developing donor-derived malignancy (DDM) in patients who receive PTCy. Giving chemotherapy in the immediate post-transplantation period carries with it a theoretic risk of disturbing the graft at a time of increased hematopoietic stress and causing or accelerating the development of malignancy. From 2000 to 2011, 789 patients underwent allogeneic transplantation and received PTCy at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. There were 4 cases of DDM identified among this large population, which is similar to or below the rate of DDM published in the literature. We found that the estimated cumulative incidence by competing risk analysis of DDM is 1.4% (SE, 1.02%).

The sequencing results were compared with multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) data in 66 specimens (25 patients) analyzed by both methods. There was a strong concordance (82%) between the methods in the qualitative determination of the presence of disease. However, in 17% of cases, leukemia was detected by sequencing but not by MFC. In 54 bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) paired specimens, the burden of leukemia detected by NGS was lower in PB than in BM, although it was still detectable in 68% of the 28 paired specimens with positive BM. Lastly, patients without disease detected by NGS or MFC had a 5-year relapse free survival of > 80%.

Until recently, few effective treatment options existed, and even with the advent of new agents, studies evaluating comparative efficacy are scarce. In the Ibrutinib Versus Ofatumumab in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (RESONATE) Phase III study, ibrutinib, an oral, once-a-day, first-in-class covalent Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with ofatumumab (PFS hazard ratio [HR] = 0.106 and OS HR = 0.369 [adjusted for crossover] at a median of 16 months' follow-up). We sought to establish the relative efficacy of ibrutinib versus other treatment options for patients with R/R CLL using indirect comparison methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify clinical trials sharing a common treatment arm with the RESONATE Phase III trial such that a network meta-analysis or indirect treatment comparisons (ITCs) could be conducted. Two trials were identified, each using the same comparator (ofatumumab) as the RESONATE study. Two pairwise ITCs were conducted using the Bucher method to establish the relative treatment efficacy of ibrutinib versus (1) idelalisib plus ofatumumab in the first study and (2) physician's choice, defined as a mix of therapies commonly used in R/R CLL, in the second study. Odds ratios for these ITCs were calculated for overall response rate (ORR) and HRs for PFS and OS. FINDINGS: A strong and consistent trend of superiority for ibrutinib was observed via these ITC models with idelalisib plus ofatumumab and physician's choice for ORR, PFS, and OS. Ibrutinib revealed prolonged PFS and OS versus comparators (PFS HR = 0.06; 95% CI, 0.04-0.11; and OS HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.54), physician's choice (PFS HR = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.25-0.66; and OS HR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.23-1.08), and idelalisib plus ofatumumab. These findings were robust and continued to favor ibrutinib when adjusting (where appropriate) for underlying differences in patient population between the trials. Some trial differences were not accounted for in the models and thus some limitations remain; however, consistency of results supports the overall findings. IMPLICATIONS: In a randomized Phase III study, ibrutinib significantly improved ORR, PFS, and OS in patients with R/R CLL versus ofatumumab. In ITC models that used ofatumumab as the common comparator, ibrutinib appears to have higher ORR and longer PFS and OS versus both idelalisib plus ofatumumab and physician's choice. In the absence of head-to-head studies and taking into consideration inherent limitations of ITCs, these models provide useful estimates of comparative efficacy.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

MM is associated with significant morbidity due to its end-organ destruction. It is a disease of the older population and its incidence in the African American population is twice that of the European American population. Improvements in the treatment of MM in the past couple of decades, beginning with the use of autologous stem cell transplantation followed by availability of novel treatments such as immunomodulatory drugs (ImIDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) has transformed the natural history of the disease leading to longer survival times. Advancements in the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of MM are of the utmost importance as the general population lives longer due to other improvements in health care. The recent introduction of novel therapies has been paralleled by advancements in the monitoring of MM, namely, by the availability exquisitely sensitive techniques in detecting minimal residual disease. As drug development and technology continues to improve, it will be important to design rationale clinical trials enrolling patient populations that represent the overall population, including racial minorities and the elderly, so that trial results can be appropriately extrapolated.

Recent studies have shown that blocking the CD47-SIRPalpha axis with CD47-directed antibodies or antibody-derivatives enhances phagocytosis and increases antitumor immune effects. However, CD47 expression on healthy cells creates an antigen sink and potential sites of toxicity, limiting the efficacy of CD47-directed therapies. In this study, we first characterized CD47 expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients (n = 213) and found that CD47 is highly expressed on both AML bulk and stem cells irrespective of the disease state. Furthermore, to inhibit the CD47-SIRPalpha signaling pathway at the tumor site, we developed a so-called local inhibitory checkpoint monoclonal antibody (licMAB) by grafting the endogenous SIRPalpha domain to the N-terminus of the light chain of an antibody targeting CD33, a surface antigen expressed in AML. LicMABs selectively bind CD33-expressing cells even in the presence of a large CD33-negative CD47-positive antigen sink, stimulate phagocytosis of AML cells and eliminate AML cell lines and primary, patient-derived AML cells.

Therapies targeting receptors and pathways active specifically in malignant B cells might provide better treatment options. For instance, in B cell lymphoma, our group has previously shown that scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1), the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoproteins (HDL), is a therapeutic target. As evidence suggests that targeting cholesterol metabolism in CLL cells may have therapeutic benefit, we examined SR-B1 expression in primary CLL cells from patients. Unlike normal B cells that do not express SR-B1, CLL cells express the receptor.

Human cytokine magnetic bead panel assay values of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, TNF-alpha in CSF at diagnosis, end of induction to remission, and 6months after diagnosis were determined. IL-6 and MCP-1 values showed a significant increment at the end of induction. From the whole group 4 (10.0%), patients relapsed to the CNS at a median of 11.48months. A significantly higher value of TNF-alpha at third determination in these CNS-relapsed patients was documented, 7.48 vs. 2.86pg/mL in 36 children without relapse (p=0.024). TNF-alpha concentration increased at a median 5.48months before CNS relapse. By receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, the best cut-off point of TNF-alpha concentration that better predicted CNS relapse was >/=1.79pg/mL. In conclusion an increase in TNF-alpha concentration on CSF preceded CNS relapse in children with ALL. An increase in MCP-1 and IL-6 was not associated to CNS relapse and appears to result from an inflammatory response after IT injection of chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The image processing phase performs operations such as refining image rotation, gridding (locating genes) and extracting raw data from images the data mining includes normalizing the extracted data and selecting the more effective genes. Finally, via the extracted data, cancerous cell is recognized. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, microarray database is employed which includes Breast cancer, Myeloid Leukemia and Lymphomas from the Stanford Microarray Database.

Myeloablative conditioning (MA) increases transplant related mortality and reduces survival in older patients. Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is a good option for these patients. AIM: To report our experience with HSCT in patients of different ages with acute leukemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 115 allogeneic HSCT performed in patients with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: We analyzed the cohort of patients in groups according to age at transplantation: younger than 40 years (n = 74), 41 to 50 years (n = 25) and older than 51 years of age (n = 16). Overall survival (OS), Disease free survival (DFS) and relapse at five years were similar in both groups of patients younger than 50 years (OS 40 and 44% respectively, DFS 38 and 42% respectively and relapse 40% and 34% respectively, p = NS). Patients over 51 years had a five years OS of 12%. However when we analyzed those patients by date and conditioning we found that patients who were treated with MA regimens in the first decade of the transplant program (before 2000) had lower OS compared to those treated after 2000 with RIC (five years OS 49% and 12% respectively, p < 0.01). No significant differences in terms of OS, recurrence or incidence of graft-versus-host disease were found when comparing groups under 40 years, between 41 and 50 years and older than 51 years treated only with RIC. CONCLUSIONS: RIC provides the possibility of HSCT in older patients with rates comparable to those obtained in younger patients successfully treated with MA conditioning.",,"['Sarmiento M, Mauricio', 'Bertin C, Pablo', 'Jara, Veronica', 'Ocqueteau T, Mauricio', 'Ramirez V, Pablo']","['Sarmiento M M', 'Bertin C P', 'Jara V', 'Ocqueteau T M', 'Ramirez V P']","['Escuela de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Escuela de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Escuela de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Escuela de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.', 'Escuela de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],Ajuste de intensidad para el trasplante hematopoyetico alogenico en leucemia aguda.,,Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/mortality', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/01/07 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0034-98872016000900003 [pii]', '10.4067/S0034-98872016000900003 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2016 Sep;144(9):1112-1118. doi: 10.4067/S0034-98872016000900003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcomes for patients with AML remain poor, highlighting the need for novel treatment options. Aberrant epigenetic regulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AML, and inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase or histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes have exhibited activity in preclinical AML models. Combination studies with HDAC inhibitors plus DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have potential beneficial clinical activity in AML, however the toxicity profiles of non-selective HDAC inhibitors in the combination setting limit their clinical utility. In this work, we describe the preclinical development of selective inhibitors of HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are hypothesized to have improved safety profiles, for combination therapy in AML. We demonstrate that selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 is sufficient to achieve efficacy both as a single agent and in combination with azacitidine in preclinical models of AML, including established AML cell lines, primary leukemia cells from AML patient bone marrow samples and in vivo xenograft models of human AML. Gene expression profiling of AML cells treated with either an HDAC1/2 inhibitor, azacitidine, or the combination of both have identified a list of genes involved in transcription and cell cycle regulation as potential mediators of the combinatorial effects of HDAC1/2 inhibition with azacitidine. Together, these findings support the clinical evaluation of selective HDAC1/2 inhibitors in combination with azacitidine in AML patients.",,"['Min, Chengyin', 'Moore, Nathan', 'Shearstone, Jeffrey R', 'Quayle, Steven N', 'Huang, Pengyu', 'van Duzer, John H', 'Jarpe, Matthew B', 'Jones, Simon S', 'Yang, Min']","['Min C', 'Moore N', 'Shearstone JR', 'Quayle SN', 'Huang P', 'van Duzer JH', 'Jarpe MB', 'Jones SS', 'Yang M']","['Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Acetylon Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170106,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2017/01/07 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2016/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0169128 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-30220 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Jan 6;12(1):e0169128. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0169128. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,PMC5218480,,,"['All authors are employed by Acetylon Pharmaceuticals.

We also discuss how TSCM cell stemness could be leveraged therapeutically to enhance the efficacy of vaccines and adoptive T cell therapies for cancer and infectious diseases or, conversely, how it could be disrupted to treat TSCM cell driven and sustained diseases, such as autoimmunity, adult T cell leukemia and HIV-1.",,"['Gattinoni, Luca', 'Speiser, Daniel E', 'Lichterfeld, Mathias', 'Bonini, Chiara']","['Gattinoni L', 'Speiser DE', 'Lichterfeld M', 'Bonini C']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Ludwig Cancer Research, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', ""Division of Infectious Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Experimental Hematology Unit, Division of Immunology Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, Leukemia Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Department, Vita Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,,United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/therapy', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Self Renewal/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/therapy', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/transplantation']",,,2017/01/07 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2016/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['nm.4241 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.4241 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2017 Jan 6;23(1):18-27. doi: 10.1038/nm.4241.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2239-3282'],,,,"['R21 AI106468/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI098487/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI130005/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI117841/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI124776/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI120008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA BC011480/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI114235/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC6354775,['NIHMS1003141'],,,,,,,,

Hyponatremia is an ominous laboratory sign in the setting of neoplasia. We analyzed the incidence, risk factors, associations, specific interventions and outcomes of severe hyponatremia in a single-center series of children with ALL. The incidence of severe hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium levels below 130 mmol/L on at least 2 of 3 consecutive days, was 11.9%. History of hyponatremia episode is associated with neurologic complications (P=0.023) and the presence of overt central nervous system leukemia (CNS3) at diagnosis (P=0.005). Most observed hyponatremia episodes resolved relatively quickly, rarely requiring specific treatment. All but 1 hyponatremia episodes occurred in the induction or reinduction phases, but none before the administration of cytotoxic drugs, pointing to the role of therapy complications rather than leukemia per se. Most patients received vincristine shortly before hyponatremia onset, and vincristine has been previously strongly implicated in hyponatremia. We also suggest a role for imatinib. Although every patient with severe hyponatremia requires swift and thorough diagnostics a serious sequelae in the setting of pediatric ALL is rare. Hyponatremia association with neurotoxicity likely points to vincristine hypersensitivity in the subgroup of patients with both complications.",,"['Janczar, Szymon', 'Zalewska-Szewczyk, Beata', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech']","['Janczar S', 'Zalewska-Szewczyk B', 'Mlynarski W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Hyponatremia/chemically induced/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Inappropriate ADH Syndrome/blood/etiology', 'Infant', 'Infections/complications', 'Kidney Diseases/complications', 'Leukemic Infiltration/blood', 'Lung Diseases/complications', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sodium/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,2017/01/07 06:00,2017/09/13 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000758 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2017 Mar;39(2):e54-e58. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000758.,,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Management started by following the Total XV protocol without a window phase. Left adrenalectomy was conducted after the consolidation phase. Recurrence of a mass at the tumor bed was discovered at week 33 of the continuation phase. Reexcision was conducted, followed by the administration of an ACC protocol including cisplatin, etoposide, and doxirubicin. Mitotane was added when a pulmonary metastasis was discovered and then stopped after the patient suffered from an arachnoid cyst and speech difficulties. The ALL protocol was resumed from week 34 of the continuation phase. Progression of pulmonary nodules was noted after week 45. A pulmonary metastectomy was performed. The ALL protocol was resumed up to week 51 with a good response as proven by assessment of minimal residual disease.

In total, 47 patients suffered a relapse, no difference in mALAT levels were found in these compared with nonrelapse patients (median, 107 vs. 98 IU/L; P=0.39). mALAT levels in patients classified as TPMT high activity (TPMT) were higher than in TPMT low-activity patients (median, 103 vs. 82 IU/L; P=0.03). In a Cox regression model risk of relapse was not associated with ALAT levels (P=0.56). ALAT levels increased 2.7%/month during the last year of maintenance therapy (P<0.001).

However, the task is laborious and demands skill. Associated high cost and low throughput drew considerable interest in automating the testing process. Several neural network architectures were designed to provide human expertise to machines. In this paper, we explore and propose the feasibility of using deep-learning networks for cytopathologic analysis by performing the classification of three important unlabeled, unstained leukemia cell lines (K562, MOLT, and HL60). The cell images used in the classification are captured using a low-cost, high-throughput cell imaging technique: microfluidics-based imaging flow cytometry. We demonstrate that without any conventional fine segmentation followed by explicit feature extraction, the proposed deep-learning algorithms effectively classify the coarsely localized cell lines. We show that the designed deep belief network as well as the deeply pretrained convolutional neural network outperform the conventionally used decision systems and are important in the medical domain, where the availability of labeled data is limited for training.

In these cases, the morphologic distinction between disease at baseline and at progression is challenging. This report analyzes clinicopathologic features of congenital thrombocytopenia with long-term follow-up at one referral center. Records from the last 20 years were searched for cases of congenital thrombocytopenia with bone marrow biopsies and peripheral blood smears. The clinical, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular features were analyzed. Six adult and two pediatric patients were identified (six male, two female). Age range at first biopsy was 1-47 (median, 31) years. Underlying diseases included thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome, congenital thrombocytopenia with radial-ulnar synostosis, MYH9-related disorder, shortened telomere syndrome, congenital thrombocytopenia with ANKRD26 mutation, and familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia. Four patients had myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like marrow changes such as hypercellularity, increased myeloid to erythroid ratio, numerous micromegakaryocytes (highlighted by CD42b), and marrow fibrosis. Two patients had marrow hypoplasia and two had unremarkable marrow morphology. Three patients-all in the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like group-developed disease progression characterized by erythroid and myeloid dysplasia, elevated bone marrow blasts, and new cytogenetic abnormalities. Unlike non-familial myeloid neoplasms, congenital thrombocytopenia patients in the myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like group had a long and indolent clinical course (average age at disease progression, 47 years). In summary, three distinct morphologic types of congenital thrombocytopenia were identified: a hyperplastic myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm-like group, a hypoplastic bone marrow failure-like group, and a group with relatively normal marrow morphology.

Dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that MTHFD2 was a direct target of miR-92a. Gain- and loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that MTHFD2 knockdown or miR-92a overexpression notably inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of AML cell lines. Restoration of MTHFD2 expression reversed proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction of AML cells triggered by miR-92a. Moreover, an implanted tumor model in mice indicated that miR-92a overexpression dramatically decreased tumor growth and MTHFD2 expression in vivo.

Practitioners often claim that such methods are highly effective and less invasive than analgesic drugs, but available empirical evidence is largely inconclusive. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that, postacupressure intervention, the amount of pain experienced by sampled leukemia patients, who received acupressure in addition to standard care, will reduce substantially compared to patients who received only routine treatment. This controlled trial was undertaken with hospitalized leukemia patients between February and June 2015. Our primary sample consisted of 100 participants who were randomly allocated to 2 groups. One (intervention) group underwent 12 acupressure sessions in addition to standard treatment while the control group received no intervention apart from being given the standard treatment for leukemia. The visual analogue scale was used to measure the levels of pain experienced. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups across 12 interventions. However, each group reported significantly different pain level changes before and after each intervention, suggested that the acupressure method was effective in reducing pain in the short term. Nurses are able to apply this complementary therapy alongside other procedures to manage these patients' pain. It is recommended that further studies be conducted to better understand the specific conditions under which acupressure can provide effective pain relief.","['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Sharif Nia, Hamid', 'Pahlevan Sharif, Saeed', 'Yaghoobzadeh, Ameneh', 'Yeoh, Ken Kyid', 'Goudarzian, Amir Hossein', 'Soleimani, Mohammad Ali', 'Jamali, Saman']","['Sharif Nia H', 'Pahlevan Sharif S', 'Yaghoobzadeh A', 'Yeoh KK', 'Goudarzian AH', 'Soleimani MA', 'Jamali S']","['School of Nursing and Midwifery Amol, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', ""Taylor's Business School, Subang Jaya, Malaysia."", 'Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Nottingham University Business School, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus, Semenyih, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.', 'Student Research Committee, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.', 'Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Qazvin University of Medical Sciences, Qazvin, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,20170106,Australia,Int J Nurs Pract,International journal of nursing practice,9613615,,"['*Acupressure', 'Adult', 'Cancer Pain/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain Measurement', 'Single-Blind Method']",['NOTNLM'],"['Iran', 'acupressure', 'cancer', 'leukemia', 'nursing', 'pain']",2017/01/07 06:00,2018/04/11 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijn.12513 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Nurs Pract. 2017 Apr;23(2). doi: 10.1111/ijn.12513.

Three major proteins, ribosomal protein L1 and L9 along with alkyl hydroperoxides reductase, were upregulated by 1.5-, 1.7-, and 2.0-fold, respectively, after ZnO NP exposure. The results indicated oxidative stress as the leading cause of toxic effect in bacteria.

It has been demonstrated that MCM7 participates in mRNA transcription and DNA damage regulation as well. MCM7 gene is found to be over-expressed in multiple cancers, but there are few reports about its effect in leukemia. Recent studies have proven that MCM7 expression has a relationship with diagnosis and prognosis, which has led to their potential clinical application as a marker for cancer screening. RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression, typically by causing the destruction of specific mRNA molecules. It is a valuable research tool, which is widely used in cell culture and living organisms as well as in medicine recent years. It is indicated that RNAi application for targeting functional carcinogenic molecules, tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is required in cancer treatment. Gene products knockdown by RNAi technology exerts anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects upon cell culture systems, animal models and in clinical trials in the most studies.

Mean glucoses for days 1-4 and maximum glucose were calculated and the total daily steroid dose was converted to equivalent dose of dexamethasone. Hyperglycemia was defined as any glucose >9.917 mmol/l during days 1-4. We examined associations between variables using Spearman's correlations and multivariable linear regression RESULTS: 168 patients were included in the analysis. Mean age was 57.1 +/- 14.4 years with 59% males and 90% Caucasians. The prevalence of hyperglycemia was 39%. Eight patients received intravenous insulin. In patients without diabetes, steroid dose equivalent to >12 mg dexamethasone and longer acting steroids caused greater degree of hyperglycemia compared to a dose <12 mg. Maximum glucose was a predictor of hospital length of stay among patients without diabetes (but not those with diabetes), and with acute leukemia or stem cell transplant (but not other hematologic malignancies). There were no significant differences in in mortality or other outcomes between the groups with and without hyperglycemia CONCLUSIONS: Hyperglycemia is common in patients with hematologic malignancies, which require frequent corticosteroids.

However, there still exists a lack of prognostic and predictive molecular biomarkers that enable selection of patients who are likely to benefit from epigenetic therapy. Here, we investigated distinct genetic (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, DNMT3A) and epigenetic (estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), C/EBPalpha, and OLIG2) aberrations in 87 AML patients from the recently published phase II decitabine trial (AML00331) to identify potential biomarkers for patients receiving hypomethylating therapy. While FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutational status were not associated with survival or response to therapy, patients harboring DNMT3A R882 mutations showed a non-significant association towards shorter overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-5.12, p = 0.08). Promoter DNA methylation analyses using pyrosequencing also revealed a non-significant association towards shorter overall survival of patients with higher levels of methylation of ERalpha (HR 1.50, CI 0.97-2.32, p = 0.07) and OLIG2 CpG4 (HR 1.52, CI 0.96-2.41, p = 0.08), while DNA methylation of C/EBPalpha showed no association with outcome. Importantly, in multivariate analyses adjusted for clinical baseline parameters, the impact of ERalpha and OLIG2 CpG4 methylation was conserved (HR 1.76, CI 1.01-3.06, p = 0.05 and HR 1.67, CI 0.91-3.08, p = 0.10, respectively). In contrast, none of the investigated genetic and epigenetic markers was associated with response to treatment. Additional to the previously reported adverse prognostic clinical parameters such as patients' age, reduced performance status, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, DNMT3A R882 mutation status, as well as ERalpha and OLIG2 CpG4 DNA methylation status, may prove to be molecular markers in older AML patients prior to hypomethylating therapy.",,"['Hiller, Jan K', 'Schmoor, Claudia', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Schmidt-Salzmann, Charlotte', 'Yalcin, Arzu', 'Abdelkarim, Mahmoud', 'Blagitko-Dorfs, Nadja', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Hackanson, Bjorn']","['Hiller JK', 'Schmoor C', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Schmidt-Salzmann C', 'Yalcin A', 'Abdelkarim M', 'Blagitko-Dorfs N', 'Dohner K', 'Bullinger L', 'Duyster J', 'Lubbert M', 'Hackanson B']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Center for Clinical Trials and Biostatistics, University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Hugstetterstr. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany. bjoern.hackanson@klinikum-augsburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,20170105,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Biomarker', '*Decitabine', '*Epigenetics']",2017/01/07 06:00,2017/03/17 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2016/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2912-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2912-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Apr;96(4):559-565. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2912-7.

In infants, this can result in respiratory distress, feeding and swallowing difficulties, and hyperthermic episodes. Individuals may sweat excessively when body temperature is not elevated. Additionally, individuals have reduced ability to feel pain and may lose reflexes such as the corneal reflex that normally causes one to blink, and the patellar reflex resulting in the knee-jerk. STWS usually results in infant mortality, yet some STWS patients survive into early adulthood. STWS is caused by a mutation in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene, which is inherited in an autosomal-recessive pattern. Most LIFR mutations resulting in STWS cause instability of the mRNA due to frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons, which prevent the formation of LIFR protein.

Daily practice in CML management is complicated by the recently observed treatment-emergent vascular and pulmonary adverse events in second- or later-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the lack of guidance with respect to the best TKI for initial treatment, as well as the optimal TKI sequence because no prospective randomized comparative data for second- and third-generation TKIs are available. Physicians have to balance the efficacy issues and safety aspects of the respective TKI and consider patient-specific factors such as comorbidities. Patients with any cardiovascular or pulmonary disease or treatment-requiring cardiovascular risk factor should receive nilotinib or ponatinib only if risk factors and comorbidities are treated accordingly and are further monitored. If these comorbidities are insufficiently controlled, other TKIs might be preferred. Dasatinib treatment should be critically evaluated in patients with pulmonary disease and other TKIs might be preferred in this setting. For as long as CML treatment is considered to be maintained lifelong, and no survival benefit for later-generation TKIs has been demonstrated, safety issues dominate the choice of treatment options.

The molecular basis of lineage specificity is unclear. Here, we show that three activating JAK2 mutants with similar kinase activities in vitro elicit distinctive MPN phenotypes in mice by differentially expanding erythroid vs granulocytic precursors. Molecularly, this reflects the differential binding of JAK2 mutants to cytokine receptors EpoR and GCSFR in the erythroid vs granulocytic lineage and the creation of unique receptor/JAK2 complexes that generate qualitatively distinct downstream signals. Our results demonstrate that activating JAK2 mutants can differentially couple to selective cytokine receptors and change the signaling repertoire, revealing the molecular basis for phenotypic differences elicited by JAK2 (V617F) or mutations in exon 12.

However, the direct inhibition of several well-established oncoproteins in some of these cancers is not possible or produces only transient benefits. Functional genomics represents a powerful approach for the identification of vulnerabilities linked to specific genetic alterations and has provided substantial insights into cancer signaling networks.

Two processes serve as obstacles to the successful treatment of carcinomas. First, a majority of deaths from these types of cancers occurs as a result of distant metastases and not the primary tumors themselves. Second, subsets of cells that are able to survive conventional therapy drive the aggressive relapse of the tumors, often in forms that are resistant to treatment. A frequently observed feature of malignant carcinomas is the loss of epithelial traits and the gain of certain mesenchymal ones that are programmed by the cell-biological program termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT program can confer (i) an ability to disseminate, (ii) an ability to become stem-like tumor-initiating cells, (iii) an ability to found new tumor colonies at distant anatomical sites, and (iv) an elevated resistance to therapy. These multiple powers of the EMT program explain why it has become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Recent work has revealed the variable nature of the EMT, with multiple versions of the program being observed depending on the tissue context and the stage of tumor progression. In this review, we attempt to crystallize emerging concepts in the research on EMT and stemness and discuss the benefits of using a differentiation-based therapeutic strategy for the eradication of stem-like populations that have adopted various versions of the EMT program.","['(c) 2016 Pattabiraman and Weinberg; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory', 'Press.']","['Pattabiraman, Diwakar R', 'Weinberg, Robert A']","['Pattabiraman DR', 'Weinberg RA']","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142.', 'Ludwig/MIT Center for Molecular Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,20170105,United States,Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol,Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology,1256107,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology']",,,2017/01/07 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['sqb.2016.81.030957 [pii]', '10.1101/sqb.2016.81.030957 [doi]']",ppublish,Cold Spring Harb Symp Quant Biol. 2016;81:11-19. doi: 10.1101/sqb.2016.81.030957.

Using an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutagenesis screen in mice, we identified a strain with an NK cell deficiency caused by a hypomorphic mutation in the Bcl2 (B cell lymphoma 2) gene. Analysis of these mice and the conditional deletion of Bcl2 in NK cells revealed a nonredundant intrinsic requirement for BCL2 in NK cell survival. In these mice, NK cells in cycle were protected against apoptosis, and NK cell counts were restored in inflammatory conditions, suggesting a redundant role for BCL2 in proliferating NK cells. Consistent with this, cycling NK cells expressed higher MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) levels in both control and BCL2-null mice. Finally, we showed that deletion of BIM restored survival in BCL2-deficient but not MCL1-deficient NK cells. Overall, these data demonstrate an essential role for the binding of BCL2 to BIM in the survival of noncycling NK cells.

DATA SOURCES: A literature search was performed of PubMed and MEDLINE databases (2005 to September 2016), abstracts from the American Society of Hematology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and ongoing studies from clinicaltrials.gov. Searches were performed utilizing the following key terms: venetoclax, ABT-199, GDC-199, obatoclax, GX15-070, BCL-2 inhibitor, navitoclax, ABT-263, and Venclexta. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Studies of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy, and safety of venetoclax in lymphoid malignancies were identified. DATA SYNTHESIS: Recently, treatment of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders has shifted from conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy to novel small-molecule inhibitors. The advent of recently Food and Drug Administration-approved oral agents ibrutinib and idelalisib has shifted the paradigm of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treatment; however, complete remission is uncommon, and the outcome for patients progressing on these treatments remains poor. Attention has been focused on a novel target, the B-cell lymphoma-2 protein (BCL-2), which serves an essential role in regulation of apoptosis. Venetoclax has demonstrated efficacy in multiple subtypes of lymphoid malignancies, including patients with relapsed/refractory CLL harboring deletion 17p, with an overall response rate of nearly 80%. Venetoclax is generally well tolerated, with the significant adverse effect being tumor lysis syndrome, for which there are formal management recommendations. CONCLUSION: Venetoclax has demonstrated promising results in relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies, with an acceptable adverse effect profile. As the role of BCL-2 inhibition in various malignancies becomes further elucidated, venetoclax may offer benefit to a myriad other patient populations.",,"['King, Amber C', 'Peterson, Tim J', 'Horvat, Troy Z', 'Rodriguez, Mabel', 'Tang, Laura A']","['King AC', 'Peterson TJ', 'Horvat TZ', 'Rodriguez M', 'Tang LA']","['1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,20170106,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Remission Induction', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/drug therapy/etiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['basic pharmacology', 'hematology', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'oncology']",2017/01/07 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/01/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1060028016685803 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2017 May;51(5):410-416. doi: 10.1177/1060028016685803.

Results from a multicenter survey.,74-81,S0145-2126(16)30266-1 [pii] 10.1016/j.leukres.2016.12.003 [doi],"INTRODUCTION: Myeloid Sarcoma (MS) is a rare hematologic myeloid neoplasm that can involve any site of the body. It can occur as an exclusively extramedullary form or it can be associated with an acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at onset or at relapse. The rarity of MS does not enable prospective clinical trials and therefore a specific multicenter register can be useful for the clinical and biological studies of this rare disease. PATIENTS AND RESULTS: we report the clinical characteristics and outcome of 48 histologically confirmed MS, diagnosed and treated in 9 Italian Hematological Centers in the last 10 years. The patient's median age was 46 years. There were 9/48 de novo extramedullary MS, 24/48 de novo AML-related MS and 15/48 were secondary AML-related MS. The most common extramedullary anatomic sites of disease were: skin, lymph nodes and soft tissues. Forty-three patients (90%) underwent a program of intensive chemotherapy including FLAI, HDAC-IDA, HyperCVAD and MEC schemes, with a DDI of 5% and a CR Rate of 45%. Twenty-two (46%) patients underwent Allogeneic SCT, 13 from a MUD, 8 from an HLA-identical sibling donor and 1 from an haploidentical donor. The median OS of the whole population (48 pts) was 16.7 months. The OS probability at 1, 2 and 5 years was 64%, 39% and 33%, respectively. The OS was better in patients that underwent an intensive therapeutic program (median OS: 18 months vs 5 months). Among the intensively treated patients, in univariate analysis, the OS was better in young patients (P=0,008), in patients that underwent Allo-SCT (P=0,009) and in patients that achieved a CR during treatment (P=0,001), and was worse in pts with secondary AML-related MS (P=0,007). Age, response to intensive chemotherapy and Allo-SCT were the only three variables that significantly influenced DFS (P=0,02, P=0,01 and P=0,04, respectively). In multivariable analysis, Allo-SCT and response to intensive chemotherapy remained significant in predicting a better OS (P=0,04 and P=0,001, respectively), and response to intensive chemotherapy was the only significant variable in predicting DFS (P=0,01). After Allo-SCT we observe a survival advantage in patients who achieved a pre-transplant CR (P=0,008) and in those who developed a chronic GvHD (P=0,05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MS, both with de novo and secondary forms, still have a very unfavorable outcome and require an intensive therapeutic program, that includes Allo-SCT whenever possible. The outcome after Allo-SCT is positively influenced by the development of chronic GvHD suggesting a Graft versus MS effect.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Using immunohistochemical EnVision method, CXCL12, CXCR4 and Ki-67 expression were evaluated in 72 cases of T-LBL/ALL and 30 selected cases of lymph node reactive hyperplasia (LH) as control. In addition, CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA expression levels were examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) method. Results: Immunohistochemical results showed that the expression rates of CXCL12 and CXCR4 in T-LBL/ALL were 84.7%(61/72) and 91.6%(66/72), respectively, and these were not different from the expression in the LH control group. The expression indexes of Ki-67 <80% and >/=80% were 25 cases (34.7%, 25/72) and 47 cases (65.3%, 47/72), respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated that CXCL12 and CXCR4 mRNA expression in T-LBL/ALL was 62.4% and 71.5%, respectively, and was statistically different (P<0.05) from that of the control group. Single factor analysis found that CXCL12 mRNA expression in T-LBL/ALL was positively correlated with Ann Arbor staging and KPS score (P<0.05); CXCL12 protein expression was positively correlated with splenomegaly (P<0.05); CXCR4 mRNA expression was positively correlated with the IPI score, clinical symptoms, mediastinal widening and bone marrow involvement (P<0.05); CXCR4 protein expression was positively correlated with mediastinal widening (P<0.05); CXCL12 mRNA expression was positively correlated with CXCL12 protein and CXCR4 protein expression (P<0.05), but not the CXCR4 mRNA and protein levels. There was no correlation between CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression and CXCR4 mRNA expression. Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that high expression of CXCR4 protein, hepatosplenomegaly and bone marrow involvement were risk factors for T-LBL/ALL outcome. Conclusions: CXCL12/CXCR4 expression is associated with disease progress, mediastinal widening, bone marrow involvement and adverse outcome in T-LBL/ALL. CXCL12/CXCR4 axis plays an essential role in the occurrence and development of T-LBL/ALL. However, CXCL12 and CXCR4 protein expression are not entirely reflected by mRNA transcription levels, and there may be other molecules involved in CXCL12/CXCR4 expression and regulation. With CXCR4 antagonists undergoing clinical trials, targeting the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis may be a promising treatment strategy for T-LBL/ALL.",,"['Yu, Z Z', 'Xi, Y F', 'Li, J', 'Bai, W Q', 'Gao, N', 'Bu, P']","['Yu ZZ', 'Xi YF', 'Li J', 'Bai WQ', 'Gao N', 'Bu P']","['Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030013, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,IM,"['Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism']",,,2017/01/06 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.12.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Dec 8;45(12):838-843. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.12.005.,,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the meaning of EBV+ LPD used is not the same, which triggered confusion of the understanding and obstacles of the communication. In order to solve this problem. Literature was reviewed with combination of our cases to clarify the concept of EBV+ LPD and to expound our understanding about it. In general, it is currently accepted that EBV+ LPD refers to a spectrum of lymphoid tissue diseases with EBV infection, including hyperplasia, borderline lesions, and neoplastic diseases. According to this concept, EBV+ LPD should not include infectious mononucleosis (IM) and severe acute EBV infection (EBV+ hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, fatal IM, fulminant IM, fulminant T-cell LPD), and should not include the explicitly named EBV+ lymphomas (such as extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, aggressive NK cell leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma, etc.) either. EBV+ LPD should currently include: (1) EBV+ B cell-LPD: lymphomatoid granulomatosis, EBV + immunodeficiency related LPD, chronic active EBV infection-B cell type, senile EBV+ LPD, etc. (2) EBV+ T/NK cell-LPD: CAEBV-T/NK cell type, hydroa vacciniforme, hypersensitivity of mosquito bite, etc. In addition, EBV+ LPD is classified, based on the disease process, pathological and molecular data, as 3 grades: grade1, hyperplasia (polymorphic lesions with polyclonal cells); grade 2, borderline (polymorphic lesions with clonality); grade 3, neoplasm (monomorphic lesions with clonality). There are overlaps between EBV+ LPD and typical hyperplasia, as well as EBV+ LPD and typical lymphomas. However, the most important tasks are clinical vigilance, early identification of potential severe complications, and treating the patients in a timely manner to avoid serious complications, as well as the active treatment to save lives when the complications happened.",,"['Zhou, X G', 'Zhang, Y L', 'Xie, J L', 'Huang, Y H', 'Zheng, Y Y', 'Li, W S', 'Chen, H', 'Liu, F', 'Pan, H X', 'Wei, P', 'Wang, Z', 'Hu, Y C', 'Yang, K Y', 'Xiao, H L', 'Wu, M J', 'Yin, W H', 'Mei, K Y', 'Chen, G', 'Yan, X C', 'Meng, G', 'Xu, G', 'Li, J', 'Tian, S F', 'Zhu, J', 'Song, Y Q', 'Zhang, W J']","['Zhou XG', 'Zhang YL', 'Xie JL', 'Huang YH', 'Zheng YY', 'Li WS', 'Chen H', 'Liu F', 'Pan HX', 'Wei P', 'Wang Z', 'Hu YC', 'Yang KY', 'Xiao HL', 'Wu MJ', 'Yin WH', 'Mei KY', 'Chen G', 'Yan XC', 'Meng G', 'Xu G', 'Li J', 'Tian SF', 'Zhu J', 'Song YQ', 'Zhang WJ']","['Department of Pathology, Beijing Friendship Hospital Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Hodgkin Disease/classification', 'Humans', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/classification', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/classification', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/classification', 'Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis/classification', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*classification/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes', '*Terminology as Topic']",,,2017/01/06 06:00,2017/07/14 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.12.001 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Dec 8;45(12):817-821. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2016.12.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods Among 229 patients with NPM1m who were treated in the Acute Leukemia French Association 0702 (ALFA-0702) trial, MRD evaluation was available in 152 patients in first remission. Patients with nonfavorable AML according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification were eligible for ASCT in first remission. Results After induction therapy, patients who did not achieve a 4-log reduction in NPM1m peripheral blood-MRD (PB-MRD) had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (subhazard ratio [SHR], 5.83; P < .001) and a shorter overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 10.99; P < .001). In multivariable analysis, an abnormal karyotype, the presence of FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), and a < 4-log reduction in PB-MRD were significantly associated with a higher relapse incidence and shorter OS. In the subset of patients with FLT3-ITD, only age, white blood cell count, and < 4-log reduction in PB-MRD, but not FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, remained of significant prognostic value. In these patients with nonfavorable AML according to European LeukemiaNet, disease-free survival and OS were significantly improved by ASCT in those with a < 4-log reduction in PB-MRD. This benefit was not observed in those with a > 4-log reduction in PB-MRD, with a significant interaction between ASCT effect and PB-MRD response ( P = .024 and .027 for disease-free survival and OS, respectively). Conclusion Our study supports the strong prognostic significance of early NPM1m PB-MRD, independent of the cytogenetic and molecular context. Moreover, NPM1m PB-MRD may be used as a predictive factor for ASCT indication.",,"['Balsat, Marie', 'Renneville, Aline', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Caillot, Denis', 'Marceau, Alice', 'Lemasle, Emilie', 'Marolleau, Jean-Pierre', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Berthon, Celine', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Rodriguez, Celine', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Coude, Marie Magdeleine', 'Terre, Christine', 'Celli-Lebras, Karine', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Preudhomme, Claude', 'Boissel, Nicolas']","['Balsat M', 'Renneville A', 'Thomas X', 'de Botton S', 'Caillot D', 'Marceau A', 'Lemasle E', 'Marolleau JP', 'Nibourel O', 'Berthon C', 'Raffoux E', 'Pigneux A', 'Rodriguez C', 'Vey N', 'Cayuela JM', 'Hayette S', 'Braun T', 'Coude MM', 'Terre C', 'Celli-Lebras K', 'Dombret H', 'Preudhomme C', 'Boissel N']","['Marie Balsat, Xavier Thomas, and Sandrine Hayette, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre Benite;

Little is known about immune-modulatory effects of nilotinib in vivo, potentially predicting response to therapy. Patients and Methods A prospective and comprehensive flow cytometry-based immunomonitoring program paralleled the ENEST1st clinical study, investigating 52 nilotinib-naive patients with chronic-phase CML. Data were verified in independent validation cohorts. Results T cells of patients with CML at diagnosis expressed low l-selectin (CD62L) levels, which was not a result of proportional aberrations of T-cell subsets. Low numbers of CD62L-expressing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells correlated with higher Sokal score, increased spleen size, and high leukocyte and peripheral-blood blast counts. At month 6 during nilotinib therapy, CD62L expression returned to levels of healthy individuals. The level of CD62L loss on T cells directly correlated with the extent of soluble CD62L (sCD62L) elevation. In parallel, the proteolytic activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha-converting enzyme (TACE; ADAM17, CD156b), the metalloproteinase shedding CD62L, was increased at diagnosis and significantly decreased during nilotinib treatment. High CD62L(+) expression on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and, vice versa, low sCD62L levels at CML diagnosis were linked to superior molecular responses. These findings were corroborated in independent validation cohorts. Conclusion We demonstrate the prognostic impact of CD62L shedding from T cells and increased sCD62L plasma levels at CML diagnosis on molecular response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in early chronic-phase CML. Functionally, decreased CD62L may be a consequence of increased TACE-mediated CD62L cleavage and potentially impairs immune-cell function. Larger prospective studies are ongoing to confirm the prognostic relevance of this finding.",,"['Sopper, Sieghart', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'White, Deborah', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Valent, Peter', 'Burchert, Andreas', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn T', 'Gastl, Gunther', 'Baldauf, Matthias', 'Trajanoski, Zlatko', 'Giles, Frank', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Schenk, Thomas', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Wolf, Dominik']","['Sopper S', 'Mustjoki S', 'White D', 'Hughes T', 'Valent P', 'Burchert A', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Gastl G', 'Baldauf M', 'Trajanoski Z', 'Giles F', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T', 'Schenk T', 'Janssen JJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Porkka K', 'Wolf D']","['Sieghart Sopper, Gunther Gastl, Matthias Baldauf, Zlatko Trajanoski, and Dominik Wolf, Medical University Innsbruck; Sieghart Sopper and Dominik Wolf, Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute; Matthias Baldauf, Oncotyrol, Innsbruck; Peter Valent, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Satu Mustjoki and Kimmo Porkka, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland; Deborah White and Timothy Hughes, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute and University of Adelaide School of Medicine, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia; Andreas Burchert, Universitatsklinikum Giessen und Marburg and Philipps Universitat Marburg, Marburg; Andreas Hochhaus, Thomas Ernst, and Thomas Schenk, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena; Dominik Wolf, University Hospital of Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Bjorn T.

Shwachman-Diamond Bodian Syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disease caused, in most patients, by mutations of the SBDS gene. SBDS is a protein required for the maturation of 60S ribosomes. SDS patients present exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, neutropenia, chronic infections, and skeletal abnormalities. Later in life, patients are prone to myelodisplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). It is unknown why patients develop AML and which cellular alterations are directly due to the loss of the SBDS protein. Here we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast lines from an SbdsR126T/R126T mouse model. After their immortalization, we reconstituted them by adding wild type Sbds. We then performed a comprehensive analysis of cellular functions including colony formation, translational and transcriptional RNA-seq, stress and drug sensitivity. We show that: 1. Mutant Sbds causes a reduction in cellular clonogenic capability and oncogene-induced transformation. 2. Mutant Sbds causes a marked increase in immature 60S subunits, limited impact on mRNA specific initiation of translation, but reduced global protein synthesis capability. 3. Chronic loss of SBDS activity leads to a rewiring of gene expression with reduced ribosomal capability, but increased lysosomal and catabolic activity. 4. Consistently with the gene signature, we found that SBDS loss causes a reduction in ATP and lactate levels, and increased susceptibility to DNA damage. Combining our data, we conclude that a cell-specific fragile phenotype occurs when SBDS protein drops below a threshold level, and propose a new interpretation of the disease.",,"['Calamita, Piera', 'Miluzio, Annarita', 'Russo, Arianna', 'Pesce, Elisa', 'Ricciardi, Sara', 'Khanim, Farhat', 'Cheroni, Cristina', 'Alfieri, Roberta', 'Mancino, Marilena', 'Gorrini, Chiara', 'Rossetti, Grazisa', 'Peluso, Ivana', 'Pagani, Massimiliano', 'Medina, Diego L', 'Rommens, Johanna', 'Biffo, Stefano']","['Calamita P', 'Miluzio A', 'Russo A', 'Pesce E', 'Ricciardi S', 'Khanim F', 'Cheroni C', 'Alfieri R', 'Mancino M', 'Gorrini C', 'Rossetti G', 'Peluso I', 'Pagani M', 'Medina DL', 'Rommens J', 'Biffo S']","['INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'DiSIT, University of Eastern Piedmont, Alessandria, Italy.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham Edgbaston Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM)-Fondazione Telethon, Pozzuoli, Italy.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM)-Fondazione Telethon, Pozzuoli, Italy.', 'SickKids Children Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'INGM, National Institute of Molecular Genetics, ""Romeo ed Enrica Invernizzi"", Milan, Italy.', 'DBS, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170105,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA Damage', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Homeostasis', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Phenotype', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosome Subunits, Large, Eukaryotic/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/01/06 06:00,2017/05/26 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1006552 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-16-02029 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2017 Jan 5;13(1):e1006552. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006552. eCollection 2017 Jan.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3780-1050', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4214-1904', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6361-311X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8732-825X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3780-1050']","['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sbds protein, mouse)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",,,"['338999/ERC_/European Research Council/International', 'GGP10012/TI_/Telethon/Italy']",PMC5249248,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,

NPM1 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). NPM1c oligomerizes with wild-type nucleophosmin 1 (wt-NPM1), and this leads to its continuous cytoplasmic delocalization and contributes to leukemogenesis. Recent studies have shown that Cytoplasmic NPM1 (NPM1c) degradation leads to growth arrest and apoptosis of NPM1c AML cells and corrects wt-NPM1 normal nucleolar localization. METHODS: AML cells expressing wt-NPM1 or NPM1c or transfected with wt-NPM1 or NPM1c as well as wt-NPM1 and NPM1c AML xenograft mice were used. Cell growth was assessed with trypan blue or a CellTiter 96 proliferation kit. The cell cycle was studied with a propidium iodide (PI) assay. Caspase-mediated intrinsic apoptosis was assessed with annexin V/PI, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and poly(adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerase cleavage. The expression of NPM1, p53, phosphorylated p53, and p21 was analyzed via immunoblotting. Localization was performed with confocal microscopy. The leukemia burden was evaluated by flow cytometry with an anti-human CD45 antibody. RESULTS: The imidazoquinoxaline 1-(3-methoxyphenyl)-N-methylimidazo[1,2-a]quinoxalin-4-amine (EAPB0503) induced selective proteasome-mediated degradation of NPM1c, restored wt-NPM1 nucleolar localization in NPM1c AML cells, and thus yielded selective growth arrest and apoptosis. Introducing NPM1c to cells normally harboring wt-NPM1 sensitized them to EAPB0503 and led to their growth arrest. Moreover, EAPB0503 selectively reduced the leukemia burden in NPM1c AML xenograft mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings further reinforce the idea of targeting the NPM1c oncoprotein to eradicate leukemic cells and warrant a broader preclinical evaluation and then a clinical evaluation of this promising drug.

The most active epigenetic marks are DNA methylation and histone protein modifications and they are involved in basic biological phenomena in every cell. Their role in tumorigenesis is stressed by recent unbiased large-scale studies providing evidence that several epigenetic modifiers are recurrently mutated or frequently dysregulated in multiple cancers. The interest in epigenetic marks is especially due to the fact that they are potentially reversible and thus druggable. In B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) there is a relative paucity of reports on the role of histone protein modifications (acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation) as compared to acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell ALL, or other hematologic cancers, and in this setting chromatin modifications are relatively less well studied and reviewed than DNA methylation. In this paper, we discuss the biomarker associations and evidence for a driver role of dysregulated global and loci-specific histone marks, as well as mutations in epigenetic modifiers in BCP-ALL. Examples of chromatin modifiers recurrently mutated/disrupted in BCP-ALL and associated with disease outcomes include MLL1, CREBBP, NSD2, and SETD2. Altered histone marks and histone modifiers and readers may play a particular role in disease chemoresistance and relapse. We also suggest that epigenetic regulation of B-cell differentiation may have parallel roles in leukemogenesis.",,"['Janczar, Szymon', 'Janczar, Karolina', 'Pastorczak, Agata', 'Harb, Hani', 'Paige, Adam J W', 'Zalewska-Szewczyk, Beata', 'Danilewicz, Marian', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech']","['Janczar S', 'Janczar K', 'Pastorczak A', 'Harb H', 'Paige AJ', 'Zalewska-Szewczyk B', 'Danilewicz M', 'Mlynarski W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz 91-738, Poland. szymon.janczar@umed.lodz.pl.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz 92-213, Poland. karolina.janczar@umed.lodz.pl.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz 91-738, Poland. agata.pastorczak@umed.lodz.pl.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiochemistry, Molecular Diagnostics, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg 35043, Germany. harbh@staff.uni-marburg.de.', 'Department of Life Sciences, University of Bedfordshire, Bedfordshire LU1 3JU, UK.

Specific missense and in-frame insertion/deletion mutations in exons 1 and 2 have been identified in uterine leiomyomas, breast tumors, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we characterize the first MED12 5' end nonsense mutation (c.97G>T, p.E33X) identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and show that it escapes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) by using an alternative translation initiation site. The resulting N-terminally truncated protein is unable to enter the nucleus due to the lack of identified nuclear localization signal (NLS). The absence of NLS prevents the mutant MED12 protein to be recognized by importin-alpha and subsequent loading into the nuclear pore complex. Due to this mislocalization, all interactions between the MED12 mutant and other Mediator components are lost. Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the MED12 functions and indicate that somatic nonsense mutations in early exons may avoid NMD.","['(c) 2016 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.']","['Heikkinen, Tuomas', 'Kampjarvi, Kati', 'Keskitalo, Salla', 'von Nandelstadh, Pernilla', 'Liu, Xiaonan', 'Rantanen, Ville', 'Pitkanen, Esa', 'Kinnunen, Matias', 'Kuusanmaki, Heikki', 'Kontro, Mika', 'Turunen, Mikko', 'Makinen, Netta', 'Taipale, Jussi', 'Heckman, Caroline', 'Lehti, Kaisa', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Varjosalo, Markku', 'Vahteristo, Pia']","['Heikkinen T', 'Kampjarvi K', 'Keskitalo S', 'von Nandelstadh P', 'Liu X', 'Rantanen V', 'Pitkanen E', 'Kinnunen M', 'Kuusanmaki H', 'Kontro M', 'Turunen M', 'Makinen N', 'Taipale J', 'Heckman C', 'Lehti K', 'Mustjoki S', 'Varjosalo M', 'Vahteristo P']","['Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medicum, Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medicum, Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medicum, Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medicum, Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Finnish Cancer Institute, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute of Biotechnology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Research Programs Unit, Genome-Scale Biology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Medicum, Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170111,United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,IM,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', '*Codon, Nonsense', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Mediator Complex/*genetics', '*Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay', '*Nucleotide Motifs', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA Transport']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BioID', '*MED12', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*affinity purification mass spectrometry', '*nonsense mutation']",2017/01/06 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/humu.23157 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2017 Mar;38(3):269-274. doi: 10.1002/humu.23157.

We showed coordinated proportional changes in naive CD4+ T-cells (decreased), intermediate CD27- CD28+ CD4+ T-cells (increased) and CD21low B-cells (increased) that were stable for over three years. Moreover, the lymphocytes' immunophenotype in this patient cluster exhibited features of profound immunosenescence and chronic activation. Thrombocytopenia was only found in this cluster (36% of cases, manifested as Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) or Evans syndrome). Clinical complications more frequently found in these patients include lung fibrosis (in 59% of cases) and bronchiectasis (55%). The degree of severity of these symptoms corresponded to more deviation from normal levels with respect to CD21low B-cells, naive CD4+ and CD27- CD28+ CD4+ T-cells. Next-generation sequencing did not reveal any common genetic background.

In addition, cellular acquisition of unlimited replicative potential, which is closely related to the maintenance of telomeres mostly via the reactivation of telomerase, has been shown to confer loss of sensitivity to a wide range of anti-neoplastic agents. METHODS: To evaluate whether telomerase inhibition using non-nucleosidic inhibitor of telomerase BIBR1532 could enhance cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Nalm-6 pre-B ALL cells were subjected to combination treatment and subsequent cell viability, growth kinetics, caspase-3 activity, and transcriptional alteration of p73, p21, FOXO3a, c-Myc, hTERT, and other apoptosis-related target genes were investigated. RESULTS: Combination of BIBR1532 with doxorubicin produced a synergistic anticancer effect probably through induction of p73. Transcription factor p73 not only suppressed the proliferative capacity of the cells through induction of p21-mediated G1 arrest, but also down-regulated the mRNA level of hTERT and c-Myc. Our results also report that BIBR1532 induced a caspase-dependent apoptosis, at least partially, through heightened ROS levels, and noteworthy enhanced the pro-oxidant property of doxorubicin. In harmony, transcriptional repression of survivin could be a probable underlying mechanism for the induction of apoptosis through shifting the ratio of death promoters to death repressors via alteration of Bax and Bcl2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it seems that combination of BIBR1532 and doxorubicin could be a novel therapeutic strategy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia that may be clinically accessible in the near future.",,"['Bashash, Davood', 'Zareii, Mohadeseh', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Omrani, Mir Davood', 'Ghaffari, Seyed H']","['Bashash D', 'Zareii M', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Omrani MD', 'Ghaffari SH']","['a Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran.', 'a Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran.', 'a Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran.', 'b Department of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine , Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran.', 'c Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center , Tehran University of Medical Sciences , Tehran , Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170105,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Aminobenzoates/*pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['BIBR1532', 'Nalm-6 cells', 'Pre-B ALL', 'doxorubicin', 'telomerase']",2017/01/06 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1275426 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 Jul;22(6):330-340. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1275426.

NK cell activation is mediated by several activating receptors and co-receptors able to recognize ligands on virus-infected or tumor cells. To prevent healthy cells from auto-aggression, NK cells are provided with strong inhibitory receptors (KIRs and NKG2A) which recognize HLA class I molecules on target cells and, sensing their level of expression, allow killing of targets underexpressing HLA-class I. In vivo, NK cell-mediated anti-tumor function may be suppressed by tumor or tumor-associated cells via inhibitory soluble factors/cytokines or the engagement of the so called immune-check point molecules (e.g., PD1-PDL1). The study of these immune check-points is now offering new important opportunities for the therapy of cancer. In haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, alloreactive NK cells (i.e., those that express KIRs, which do not recognize HLA class I molecules on patient cells), derived from HSC of haploidentical donors, are able to kill leukemia blasts and patient's DC, thus preventing both tumor relapses and graft-versus-host disease. A clear correlation exists between size of the alloreactive NK cell population and clinical outcome. Thus, in view of the recent major advances in cancer therapy based on immuno-mediated mechanisms, the phenotypic analysis of cells and molecules involved in these mechanisms plays an increasingly major role.

Sustained existence of AML blasts is a fundamental determinant for the development of leukemia and resistance to therapy. Recent evidences suggest that Meis1 is tightly associated with the self-renewal capacity of normal hematopoietic stem cells. Meis1 was also found to be essential for the development of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia. Whether Meis1 functions independently of MLL abnormality in the context of leukemia is unclear. Herein, we identified a distinct expression pattern of Meis1 in patients with newly diagnosed AML without MLL abnormality. High levels of Meis1 expression were found in 64 of 95 (67.4%) AML patients; whereas, 31 of 95 (32.6%) patients showed dramatically lower levels of Meis1, compared with the median level of Meis1 in healthy donors. The whole cohort and subgroup analyses further demonstrated that high Meis1 expression levels were associated with a resistance to conventional chemotherapy, compared with the group with low Meis1 levels (P = 0.014 and P = 0.029, respectively). In vitro knockdown experiments highlighted a role of Meis1 in regulating maintenance and survival of human AML cells.

The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of HPIP in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical method was performed using 42 normal ovarian specimens and 145 specimens with EOC. The correlations of HPIP expression with the clinicopathological factors and prognosis of EOC patients were evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed using the chi-square test, multivariate Cox proportional hazard, and Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: HPIP expression in EOC was higher than that in normal tissues (P<0.001). HPIP expression was significantly associated with histological grade, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, and lymphatic metastasis of EOC (P<0.05). Patients with high HPIP expression had poorer overall survival and disease-free survival (P<0.001) compared with patients with low HPIP expression. Multivariate Cox analysis demonstrated that HPIP was an independent factor for overall survival and disease-free survival (P<0.05).

Similar effects induced by miRNA mimics were seen in cells with additional chromosomal abnormalities with the exception of certain CLL clones harboring TP53 alterations. Administration of miRNA mimics to NSG mice previously engrafted with CLL clones resulted in substantial tumor regression. CLL cell transfection with miR-15a and miR-16-1-specific inhibitors resulted in increased cell viability in vitro and in an enhanced capacity of the engrafted cells to grow in NSG mice generating larger splenic nodules.

Emerging evidence has indicated a pathological connection between axonal degeneration and autophagy. However, the physiological function and induction mechanism of autophagy in axons remain elusive. We herein show that, through activation of BECLIN1, glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B)-mediated phosphorylation of BCL2 family member MCL1 induces axonal autophagy and axonal degeneration. Phosphorylated MCL1 is ubiquitinated by the FBXW7 ubiquitin ligase and degraded by the proteasome, thereby releasing BECLIN1 to induce axonal autophagy. Axonal autophagy contributes to local adenosine triphosphate production in degenerating axons and the exposure of phosphatidylserine-an ""eat-me"" signal for phagocytes-on transected axons and is required for normal recruitment of phagocytes to axonal debris in vivo. These results suggest that GSK3B-MCL1 signaling to regulate autophagy might be important for the successful completion of Wallerian degeneration.",['(c) 2017 Wakatsuki et al.'],"['Wakatsuki, Shuji', 'Tokunaga, Shinji', 'Shibata, Megumi', 'Araki, Toshiyuki']","['Wakatsuki S', 'Tokunaga S', 'Shibata M', 'Araki T']","['Department of Peripheral Nervous System Research, National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, 4-1-1 Ogawa-higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 187-8502, Japan swaka@ncnp.go.jp taraki@ncnp.go.jp.', 'Department of Peripheral Nervous System Research, National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, 4-1-1 Ogawa-higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 187-8502, Japan.', 'Department of Peripheral Nervous System Research, National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, 4-1-1 Ogawa-higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 187-8502, Japan.', 'Department of Peripheral Nervous System Research, National Institute of Neuroscience, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, 4-1-1 Ogawa-higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 187-8502, Japan swaka@ncnp.go.jp taraki@ncnp.go.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170104,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Autophagy', 'Axons/*enzymology/pathology', 'Beclin-1/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'F-Box Proteins/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*enzymology/pathology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phagocytes/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'RNA Interference', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', '*Wallerian Degeneration']",,,2017/01/06 06:00,2017/06/01 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.201606020 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.201606020 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2017 Feb;216(2):477-493. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201606020.

However, antigen-loss tumor escape variants and the absence of currently targeted antigens on several malignancies hamper the widespread application of immunotherapy. We have isolated a TCR targeting a peptide of the intracellular B cell-specific transcription factor BOB1 presented in the context of HLA-B*07:02. TCR gene transfer installed BOB1 specificity and reactivity onto recipient T cells. TCR-transduced T cells efficiently lysed primary B-cell leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in vitro. We also observed recognition and lysis of healthy BOB1-expressing B cells. In addition, strong BOB1-specific proliferation could be demonstrated for TCR-modified T cells upon antigen encounter.

Overexpression of miR-125a or miR-125b is frequent in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the overexpression of these miRNAs in mice leads to expansion of hematopoietic stem cells accompanied by perturbed hematopoiesis with mostly myeloproliferative phenotypes. However, whether and how miR-125 family miRNAs cooperate with known AML oncogenes in vivo, and how the resultant leukemia is dependent on miR-125 overexpression, are not well understood. We modeled the frequent co-occurrence of miR-125b overexpression and MLL translocations by examining functional cooperation between miR-125b and MLL-AF9 By generating a knock-in mouse model in which miR-125b overexpression is controlled by doxycycline induction, we demonstrated that miR-125b significantly enhances MLL-AF9-driven AML in vivo, and the resultant leukemia is partially dependent on continued overexpression of miR-125b Surprisingly, miR-125b promotes AML cell expansion and suppresses apoptosis involving a non-cell-intrinsic mechanism. MiR-125b expression enhances VEGFA expression and production from leukemia cells, in part by suppressing TET2 Recombinant VEGFA recapitulates the leukemia-promoting effects of miR-125b, whereas knockdown of VEGFA or inhibition of VEGF receptor 2 abolishes the effects of miR-125b In addition, significant correlation between miR-125b and VEGFA expression is observed in human AMLs. Our data reveal cooperative and dependent relationships between miR-125b and the MLL oncogene in AML leukemogenesis, and demonstrate a miR-125b-TET2-VEGFA pathway in mediating non-cell-intrinsic leukemia-promoting effects by an oncogenic miRNA.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Liu, Jun', 'Guo, Bo', 'Chen, Zhuo', 'Wang, Nayi', 'Iacovino, Michelina', 'Cheng, Jijun', 'Roden, Christine', 'Pan, Wen', 'Khan, Sajid', 'Chen, Suning', 'Kyba, Michael', 'Fan, Rong', 'Guo, Shangqin', 'Lu, Jun']","['Liu J', 'Guo B', 'Chen Z', 'Wang N', 'Iacovino M', 'Cheng J', 'Roden C', 'Pan W', 'Khan S', 'Chen S', 'Kyba M', 'Fan R', 'Guo S', 'Lu J']","['Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', ""Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Cell Biology, and.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Surgery, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute and Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN; and.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Cell Biology, and.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Stem Cell Center, Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale Center for RNA Science and Medicine, New Haven, CT.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Video-Audio Media', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knock-In Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*physiology']",,,2017/01/06 06:00,2017/08/24 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33594-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-06-721027 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Mar 16;129(11):1491-1502. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-06-721027.

We have recently demonstrated that APL cells undergo a novel cell death program, termed ETosis, which involves release of extracellular chromatin. However, the role of promyelocytic extracellular chromatin in APL-associated coagulation remains unclear. Our objectives were to identify the novel role of ATRA-promoted extracellular chromatin in inducing a hypercoagulable and hyperfibrinolytic state in APL and to evaluate its interaction with fibrin and endothelial cells (ECs). Results from a series of coagulation assays have shown that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin increases thrombin and plasmin generation, causes a shortening of plasma clotting time of APL cells, and increases fibrin formation. DNase I but not anti-tissue factor antibody could inhibit these effects. Immunofluorescence staining showed that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin and phosphatidylserine on APL cells provide platforms for fibrin deposition and render clots more resistant to fibrinolysis. Additionally, coincubation assays revealed that promyelocytic extracellular chromatin is cytotoxic to ECs, converting them to a procoagulant phenotype. This cytotoxity was blocked by DNase I by 20% or activated protein C by 31%. Our current results thus delineate the pathogenic role of promyelocytic extracellular chromatin in APL coagulopathy. Furthermore, the remaining coagulation disturbance in high-risk APL patients after ATRA administration may be treatable by intrinsic pathway inhibition via accelerating extracellular chromatin degradation.",,"['Cao, Muhua', 'Li, Tao', 'He, Zhangxiu', 'Wang, Lixiu', 'Yang, Xiaoyan', 'Kou, Yan', 'Zou, Lili', 'Dong, Xue', 'Novakovic, Valerie A', 'Bi, Yayan', 'Kou, Junjie', 'Yu, Bo', 'Fang, Shaohong', 'Wang, Jinghua', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Shi, Jialan']","['Cao M', 'Li T', 'He Z', 'Wang L', 'Yang X', 'Kou Y', 'Zou L', 'Dong X', 'Novakovic VA', 'Bi Y', 'Kou J', 'Yu B', 'Fang S', 'Wang J', 'Zhou J', 'Shi J']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The First Hospital, and.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, The Second Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Research, VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Cardiology, The First Hospital, and.', 'Department of Cardiology, The Second Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China; and.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', ""Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, VA Boston Healthcare System and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Blood Coagulation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*pathology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Fibrin/metabolism', '*Fibrinolysis', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*complications', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2017/01/06 06:00,2017/08/24 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33544-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-09-739334 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Mar 30;129(13):1855-1864. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-09-739334.

In such regard, the presence of circulating CD66b(+) neutrophil populations, exerting either immunosuppressive or proinflammatory functions, has been described in several acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. However, due to the lack of specific markers, the precise phenotype and maturation status of these neutrophil populations remain unclear. Herein, we report that CD10, also known as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, neutral endopeptidase, or enkephalinase, can be used as a marker that, within heterogeneous populations of circulating CD66b(+) neutrophils present in inflammatory conditions, clearly distinguishes the mature from the immature ones. Accordingly, we observed that the previously described immunosuppressive neutrophil population that appears in the circulation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-treated donors (GDs) consists of mature CD66b(+)CD10(+) neutrophils displaying an activated phenotype. These neutrophils inhibit proliferation and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) production by T cells via a CD18-mediated contact-dependent arginase 1 release. By contrast, we found that immature CD66b(+)CD10(-) neutrophils, also present in GDs, display an immature morphology, promote T-cell survival, and enhance proliferation and IFNgamma production by T cells. Altogether, our findings uncover that in GDs, circulating mature and immature neutrophils, distinguished by their differential CD10 expression, exert opposite immunoregulatory properties. Therefore, CD10 might be used as a phenotypic marker discriminating mature neutrophils from immature neutrophil populations present in patients with acute or chronic inflammatory conditions, as well as facilitating their isolation, to better define their specific immunoregulatory properties.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Marini, Olivia', 'Costa, Sara', 'Bevilacqua, Dalila', 'Calzetti, Federica', 'Tamassia, Nicola', 'Spina, Cecilia', 'De Sabata, Donata', 'Tinazzi, Elisa', 'Lunardi, Claudio', 'Scupoli, Maria T', 'Cavallini, Chiara', 'Zoratti, Elisa', 'Tinazzi, Ilaria', 'Marchetta, Antonio', 'Vassanelli, Aurora', 'Cantini, Maurizio', 'Gandini, Giorgio', 'Ruzzenente, Andrea', 'Guglielmi, Alfredo', 'Missale, Francesco', 'Vermi, William', 'Tecchio, Cristina', 'Cassatella, Marco A', 'Scapini, Patrizia']","['Marini O', 'Costa S', 'Bevilacqua D', 'Calzetti F', 'Tamassia N', 'Spina C', 'De Sabata D', 'Tinazzi E', 'Lunardi C', 'Scupoli MT', 'Cavallini C', 'Zoratti E', 'Tinazzi I', 'Marchetta A', 'Vassanelli A', 'Cantini M', 'Gandini G', 'Ruzzenente A', 'Guglielmi A', 'Missale F', 'Vermi W', 'Tecchio C', 'Cassatella MA', 'Scapini P']","['Division of General Pathology.', 'Division of General Pathology.', 'Division of General Pathology.', 'Division of General Pathology.', 'Division of General Pathology.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine.', 'Interdepartmental Laboratory of Medical Research, and.', 'Interdepartmental Laboratory of Medical Research, and.', 'Applied Research on Cancer-Network, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Division of General Medicine, Sacro Cuore Hospital of Negrar, Verona, Italy.', 'Rheumatology Unit, Division of General Medicine, Sacro Cuore Hospital of Negrar, Verona, Italy.', 'Transfusion Medicine Department, Integrated University Hospital, Verona, Italy.', 'Transfusion Medicine Department, Integrated University Hospital, Verona, Italy.', 'Transfusion Medicine Department, Integrated University Hospital, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of General Surgery ""A,"" University of Verona, Verona, Italy; and.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of General Surgery ""A,"" University of Verona, Verona, Italy; and.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit.', 'Division of General Pathology.', 'Division of General Pathology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170104,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Neprilysin/analysis/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,2017/01/06 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33623-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-04-713206 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Mar 9;129(10):1343-1356. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-04-713206.

We previously reported that the inhibition of the NAD-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) SIRT2 induces granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells, suggesting the involvement of protein acetylation in ATRA-induced leukemia cell differentiation. Herein, we show that p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor (PCAF), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), is a prerequisite for ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells. We found that PCAF expression was markedly increased in leukemia cell lines (NB4 and HL-60) and primary APL cells during ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Consistent with these results, the expression of PCAF was markedly up-regulated in the bone marrow cells of APL patients who received ATRA-containing chemotherapy. The knockdown of PCAF inhibited ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cell lines and primary APL cells. Conversely, the overexpression of PCAF induced the expression of the granulocytic differentiation marker CD11b at the mRNA level. Acetylome analysis identified the acetylated proteins after ATRA treatment, and we found that histone H3, a known PCAF acetylation substrate, was preferentially acetylated by the ATRA treatment. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PCAF is required for the acetylation of histone H3 on the promoter of ATRA target genes, such as CCL2 and FGR, and for the expression of these genes in ATRA-treated leukemia cells. These results strongly support our hypothesis that PCAF is induced and activated by ATRA, and the subsequent acetylation of PCAF substrates promotes granulocytic differentiation in leukemia cells.

Poisson regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between estimated radiation dose (lagged by 2 years) and incident Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed at least 2 years after the first CT scan.Results: There were 65 incident cases of Hodgkin lymphoma in the cohort of 178,601 patients. Neither estimated red bone marrow dose nor mean lymphocyte dose from CT scans was clearly associated with an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma (RR for 20+ mGy vs. <5 mGy = 0.92 (0.38-2.22) Ptrend > 0.5 and 1.44 (0.60-3.48) Ptrend > 0.5), respectively.Conclusions: Radiation exposure from pediatric CT scans 2 or more years before diagnosis was not associated with Hodgkin lymphoma in this large UK cohort.Impact: These findings are consistent with the majority of previous studies, which do not support a link between ionizing radiation and Hodgkin lymphoma. The results contrast our previous positive findings in this cohort for brain tumors and leukemia, both of which are known to be strongly linked to radiation exposure during childhood.

The lungs are frequently affected during the course of allo-HSCT, and among the non-infectious pulmonary complications bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the most common and considered the only diagnostic manifestation of pulmonary GVHD. BOS is an irreversible obstructive disease that affects the terminal bronchioles, and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Area covered: We discuss the features of chronic GVHD, including the pathophysiological and cytokine-mediated alteration in BOS. Early treatment, before structural and irreversible changes have occurred, is crucial to reduce disease morbidity and mortality. This is challenging, given the unspecific symptoms of early stage disease and the complexity of the disease pathophysiology, obstructing both the diagnostic workup and the initiation of treatment. We highlight the main issues regarding diagnostic challenges, and we discuss the treatment options with a focus on new therapeutic options and modalities. Expert commentary: BOS is one of the most serious late complications after allo-HSCT and remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Inactivation of this gene through DNA methylation has been found to be the most prevalent epigenetic alteration reported, with a high frequency in all French-American-British subtypes of acute myeloid leukemias, including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In this study,we investigated the prognostic significance of p15 gene promoter hypermethylation and its expression in APL patients of Kashmir (North India). MATERIALS AND METHODS: p15 gene promoter hypermethylation was conducted by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, while its subsequent expression analysiswas carried out by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Of the 37 patients, 16 (43.2%) were found to have methylated p15 genes. Of these 16 cases, seven (43.8%) were methylated partially and nine (56.2%) were found to have complete methylation. Moreover, nine of the 37 patients (24.3%) who presented with leukocytosis at their baseline had complete p15 gene methylation as well (p < 0.05). Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed a complete loss of p15 expression in nine patients with complete methylation coupled with leukocytosis (p=0.031), while seven patients with partial methylation showed decreased p15 expression. Six patients relapsed during the maintenance phase of treatment and were found to have a completely methylated p15 gene and no p15 mRNA. CONCLUSION: Complete methylation and loss of p15 gene expression causes susceptibility to relapse and decreased survival in APL patients. Thus, p15 promoter hypermethylation is a prospective prognostic indicator and a reliable clinical aid in assessment of patients with APL.",,"['Baba, Shahid M', 'Azad, Niyaz A', 'Shah, Zafar A', 'Dil-Afroze', 'Pandith, Arshad A', 'Jan, Aleem', 'Aziz, Sheikh A']","['Baba SM', 'Azad NA', 'Shah ZA', 'Dil-Afroze', 'Pandith AA', 'Jan A', 'Aziz SA']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161205,Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Arsenic tri-oxide', 'Kashmir', 'Leukocytosis', 'Promoter hypermethylation', 'p15Ink4b']",2017/01/06 06:00,2018/03/30 06:00,['2017/01/06 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['crt.2016.108 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2016.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2017 Jul;49(3):790-797. doi: 10.4143/crt.2016.108.

Caspase-1, the first identified member of the caspase family, regulates differentiation in various cell types such as Th17 cells and adipocytes. However, the contribution of caspase-1 in monocyte-macrophage differentiation remains elusive. Here we report that caspase-1 is significantly downregulated in leukemia cells from patients with acute monocytic leukemia. By using the phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced cell differentiation model, we found that caspase-1 activation was required for the differentiation of human monocytes to macrophages. Further analysis of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) protein levels revealed that the monocyte-macrophage differentiation program could be divided into two stages. Caspase-1-mediated downregulation of PPARgamma was important in the late stage of monocyte-macrophage differentiation; however, PPARgamma protein levels had little effect on the early stage differentiation. Accumulation of PPARgamma protein by troglitazone treatment potently suppressed the late stage of macrophage differentiation, which might be linked to inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB activity. The data provide a plausible mechanistic basis by which caspase-1 promotes the differentiation of macrophages from monocytes.",['(c) 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Niu, Zhiyuan', 'Tang, Jiajin', 'Zhang, Wenlong', 'Chen, Yongjun', 'Huang, Yahong', 'Chen, Bing', 'Li, Jiahong', 'Shen, Pingping']","['Niu Z', 'Tang J', 'Zhang W', 'Chen Y', 'Huang Y', 'Chen B', 'Li J', 'Shen P']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology and MOE Key Laboratory of Model Animal for Disease Study, Model Animal Research Center, Nanjing University, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170205,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Caspase 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/immunology', 'PPAR gamma/*genetics/immunology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'Troglitazone']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PPARgamma', '*acute monocytic leukemia', '*caspase-1', '*macrophage differentiation', '*nuclear factor-kappaB']",2017/01/05 06:00,2017/06/24 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.13998 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2017 Feb;284(4):568-585. doi: 10.1111/febs.13998.

Morphologic and molecular remission status at the time of transplant were key predictors of disease relapse and survival in patients with FLT3-AML.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gaballa, Sameh', 'Saliba, Rima', 'Oran, Betul', 'Brammer, Jonathan E', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Marin, David', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Andersson, Borje S', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Daver, Naval', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Ciurea, Stefan O']","['Gaballa S', 'Saliba R', 'Oran B', 'Brammer JE', 'Chen J', 'Rondon G', 'Alousi AM', 'Kebriaei P', 'Marin D', 'Popat UR', 'Andersson BS', 'Shpall EJ', 'Jabbour E', 'Daver N', 'Andreeff M', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Patel K', 'Champlin RE', 'Ciurea SO']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Transplant Myeloid Study Group, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170213,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Preoperative Period', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,2017/01/05 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24632 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Apr;92(4):331-337. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24632.

Between January 2003 and September 2014, 647 newly diagnosed patients were treated [HyperCVAD-based (n = 531); Augmented BFM (n = 116)]. Six hundred and one (93%) achieved complete remission (CR), and 546 (91%) became MRD negative. Fifty-five patients [HyperCVAD-based (n = 49); Augmented BFM (n = 6)] developed recurrence of MRD while still in morphological CR and are the subjects of this study. MRD was assessed by 6-color (4-color prior to 2009) multi-parameter flow cytometry (MFC) at CR and multiple time points thereafter. Their median age was 44 years (range, 18-72 years), median WBC at initial presentation was 7.3 K/microL(-1) (range, 0.6-303.8 K/microL(-1) ) and median bone marrow blast percentage 88% (range, 26-98%). The median time to MRD relapse was 14 months (range 3-58 months). Forty-four (80%) patients subsequently developed morphological relapse after median of 3 months (range, <1-33 months) from detection of MRD recurrence. Treatments received after MRD positivity and prior to morphological relapse: 16 continued maintenance chemotherapy; 15 received late intensification; 9 allogeneic stem cell transplant, 9 changed chemotherapy, 6 no further therapy. Only six remain alive and in CR1 and nine are alive after morphological relapse. MRD relapse detected by MFC at any time after achieving CR is associated with a high risk for morphological relapse. SCT can result in long-term remission in some patients. Prospective studies of long-term MRD assessments, together with less toxic treatment strategies to eradicate MRD, are warranted.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Thomas, Deborah', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Konoplev, Sergej', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Garris, Rebecca', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Pemmaraju N', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jorgensen JL', 'Jabbour E', 'Jain N', 'Thomas D', ""O'Brien S"", 'Wang X', 'Huang X', 'Wang SA', 'Konopleva M', 'Konoplev S', 'Kadia T', 'Garris R', 'Pierce S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, Irvine, California.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170201,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnostic imaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/01/05 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24629 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Mar;92(3):279-285. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24629.

While recent data proposes that FAB classification does not provide additional prognostic information for patients for whom NPM1 status is available, it is unknown whether FAB still retains a current prognostic role in predicting outcome of AML patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Using the European Society of Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation registry we analyzed outcome of 1690 patients transplanted in CR1 to determine if FAB classification provides additional prognostic value. Multivariate analysis revealed that M6/M7 patients had decreased leukemia free survival (hazard ratio (HR) of 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.99; P = .046) in addition to increased nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rates (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.06-3.01; P = .028) compared with other FAB types. In the NPM1(wt) AML, NOS cohort, FAB M6/M7 was also associated with increased NRM (HR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.14-4.16; P = .019). Finally, in FLT3-ITD(+) patients, multivariate analyses revealed that specific FAB types were tightly associated with adverse outcome. In conclusion, FAB classification may predict outcome following transplantation in AML, NOS patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Canaani, Jonathan', 'Beohou, Eric', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Huynh, Anne', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Gedde-Dahl, Tobias', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Fegueux, Nathalie', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Canaani J', 'Beohou E', 'Labopin M', 'Socie G', 'Huynh A', 'Volin L', 'Cornelissen J', 'Milpied N', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Deconinck E', 'Fegueux N', 'Blaise D', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Acute Leukemia Working Party office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Acute Leukemia Working Party office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Acute Leukemia Working Party office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse, Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-leveque, Pessac, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinic for Cancer, Surgery and Transplantation, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Service d`Hematologie, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France.', 'Departement d`Hematologie Clinique, CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Marseille, France.', 'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Universite Pierre & Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Tel Aviv University, Israel.', 'EBMT Acute Leukemia Working Party office, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170207,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Classification', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/01/05 06:00,2017/07/18 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24640 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Apr;92(4):344-350. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24640.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. DATA SOURCE: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) national database. PATIENTS: A total of 2873 VHA beneficiaries aged 18-89 years who had at least one encounter at any of the ~150 VHA hospitals and 800 VHA clinics, had a diagnosis code for CML, and filled at least one prescription for imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib between October 1, 2001, and September 30, 2010. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The VHA database was used for the time period of October 1, 2000, to September 30, 2012, allowing for a 1-year observation period to identify CML treatments prior to study enrollment and a minimum of a 2-year follow-up period to assess study end points. Primary study end points included change in TKI treatment, gaps in TKI treatment, TKI treatment persistence, and patient survival. Persistence for each distinct line of treatment was defined as the time of continuous therapy, quantified by the number of days covered by the drug from treatment initiation until a 60-day gap in treatment was identified or a switch in treatment occurred. A Kaplan-Meier model was used to evaluate persistence and survival. Of the 2873 patients receiving first-line TKI treatment, 586 (20.4%) switched to a different TKI, constituting second-line treatment. Overall, 245 patients (8.5%) were switched again to third-line treatment. Only 4.4% of patients receiving first-line treatment experienced a gap in therapy of 60 or more days. First-line treatment persistence rates were 75%, 65%, and 55% for the first, second, and third years of treatment, respectively. Five-year survival with first-line treatment was 62%. CONCLUSION: In this national cohort of VHA patients, 1-year persistence of first-line TKI treatment was similar to that in prior studies. Five-year survival was comparable with that in other observational studies but was lower than that in prospective clinical trials. Persistence rates declined after the introduction of the new TKIs.","['(c) 2017 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Kreys, Eugene D', 'Frei, Christopher R', 'Villarreal, Sarah M', 'Bollinger, Mary J', 'Jones, Xavier', 'Koeller, Jim M']","['Kreys ED', 'Frei CR', 'Villarreal SM', 'Bollinger MJ', 'Jones X', 'Koeller JM']","['Clinical and Administrative Sciences, College of Pharmacy, California Northstate University, Elk Grove, California.', 'Pharmacotherapy Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Pharmacotherapy Education and Research Center, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.', 'Pharmacotherapy Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Pharmacotherapy Education and Research Center, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.', 'South Texas Veterans Health Care System, San Antonio, Texas.', 'South Texas Veterans Health Care System, San Antonio, Texas.', 'Pharmacotherapy Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Pharmacotherapy Education and Research Center, School of Medicine, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170222,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dasatinib/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*long term', '*survival', '*treatment persistence', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors', '*veterans']",2017/01/05 06:00,2017/10/05 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/phar.1893 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2017 Mar;37(3):278-286. doi: 10.1002/phar.1893.

A minimal PBPK model was developed based on prior in vitro and in vivo clinical data using a ""middle-out"" approach. The PBPK model was independently verified against clinical studies of the strong CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole, the strong CYP3A inducer, multiple-dose rifampin, and the steady-state venetoclax PK in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) subjects by comparing predicted to observed ratios of the venetoclax maximum concentration (Cmax R) and area under the curve from time 0 to infinity (AUCinfinity R) from these studies. The verified PBPK model was then used to simulate the effects of different CYP3A inhibitors and inducers on the venetoclax PK. Comparison of the PBPK model predicted to the observed PK parameters indicated good agreement. Verification of the PBPK model demonstrated that the ratios of the predicted:observed Cmax R and AUCinfinity R of venetoclax were within 0.8- to 1.25-fold range for strong CYP3A inhibitors and inducers. Model simulations indicated no effect of weak CYP3A inhibitors or inducers on Cmax or AUCinfinity , while both moderate and strong CYP3A inducers were estimated to decrease venetoclax exposure. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors were estimated to increase venetoclax AUCinfinity , by 100% to 390% and 480% to 680%, respectively. The recommended venetoclax dose reductions of at least 50% and 75% when coadministered with moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors, respectively, maintain venetoclax exposures between therapeutic and maximally administered safe doses.","['(c) 2017, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']","['Freise, Kevin J', 'Shebley, Mohamad', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Freise KJ', 'Shebley M', 'Salem AH']","['AbbVie, Inc, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie, Inc, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie, Inc, North Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170104,England,J Clin Pharmacol,Journal of clinical pharmacology,0366372,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inducers/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Sulfonamides/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABT-199/GDC-0199', '*BCL-2', '*CYP3A', '*PBPK', '*drug-drug interaction', '*venetoclax']",2017/01/05 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcph.858 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharmacol. 2017 Jun;57(6):796-804. doi: 10.1002/jcph.858.

HMA-resistant patients have very poor prognosis and this cohort of patients constitutes an important area of research. To understand the mechanisms underlying HMA-resistance and to overcome it, we established an azacitidine-resistant cell line, MOLM/AZA-1 and a decitabine-resistant cell line, MOLM/DEC-5 using MOLM-13. For cytogenetic characterization, we performed microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH), which identified a total of 15 copy number alterations (CNAs). Among these CNAs, eight regions in HMA-resistant cell lines showed CNA patterns distinct from the parental MOLM-13 genome. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray was also performed to obtain a more reliable interpretation of the identified CNAs, and all HMA-resistance-specific CNAs except one detected by array-CGH were successfully validated. In addition to CNAs, copy neutral loss of heterozygosity and mosaic loss events were identified in HMA-resistant cell lines. In our resistant cell lines, MDR-1 was not overexpressed, while DNMT3b was upregulated. Azacitidine and decitabine did not inhibit DNMT1, DNMT3a, or DNMT3b in both HMA-resistant cell lines, while they inhibited the enzymes in parental MOLM-13. We also developed mouse xenograft models using MOLM/AZA-1 and MOLM/DEC-5. Our in vitro and in vivo models of HMA-resistant cell lines will provide clues for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms related to the development of resistance to HMA and tools for the application of novel therapeutics for AML and MDS.",,"['Hur, Eun-Hye', 'Jung, Seung-Hyun', 'Goo, Bon-Kwan', 'Moon, Juhyun', 'Choi, Yunsuk', 'Choi, Dae Ro', 'Chung, Yeun-Jun', 'Lee, Je-Hwan']","['Hur EH', 'Jung SH', 'Goo BK', 'Moon J', 'Choi Y', 'Choi DR', 'Chung YJ', 'Lee JH']","['Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Evolution Research Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea.', 'Integrated Research Center for Genome Polymorphism, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematological Malignancies, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Hallym University Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Chuncheon, Korea.', 'Integrated Research Center for Genome Polymorphism, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea.', 'Department of Microbiology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['MOLM-13', 'azacitidine', 'cytogenetics', 'decitabine', 'resistance']",2017/01/05 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['14342 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14342 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 14;8(7):11748-11762. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14342.,,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,PMC5355301,,,,,,,,,

Although TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII) isoforms have been isolated from human leukemia cells, their expression patterns and functions of these variants are unclear. In this study, we determined that two TbetaRII isoforms (TbetaRII and TbetaRII-B) are abnormally expressed in leukemic cells, as compared to normal hematopoietic cells. TbetaRII-B, but not TbetaRII, was found to promote cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation of leukemic cells. TbetaRII-B also enhanced TGF-beta1 binding and downstream signaling and reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. By contrast, TbetaRII blocked all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation through inhibition of TbetaRII-B. Overall survival was significantly lower in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with high compared to low TbetaRII expression.

Fli-1 was initially isolated following retrovirus insertional mutagenesis screens for leukemic initiator genes, and accordingly, inhibition of this transcription factor can suppress leukemia through induction of erythroid differentiation. To search for modulators of Fli-1, we hereby performed repurposing drug screens with compounds isolated from Chinese medicinal plants. We identified agents that can transcriptionally activate or inhibit a Fli-1 reporter. Remarkably, agents that increased Fli-1 transcriptional activity conferred a strong anti-cancer activity upon Fli-1-expressing leukemic cells in culture. As opposed to drugs that suppress Fli1 activity and lead to erythroid differentiation, growth suppression by these new Fli-1 transactivating compounds involved erythroid to megakaryocytic conversion (EMC). The identified compounds are structurally related to diterpene family of small molecules, which are known agonists of protein kinase C (PKC). In accordance, these PKC agonists (PKCAs) induced PKC phosphorylation leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, increased cell attachment and EMC, whereas pharmacological inhibition of PKC or MAPK diminished the effect of our PKCAs. Moreover, in a mouse model of leukemia initiated by Fli-1 activation, the PKCA compounds exhibited strong anti-cancer activity, which was accompanied by increased presence of CD41/CD61 positive megakaryocytic cells in leukemic spleens. Thus, PKC agonists offer a novel approach to combat Fli-1-induced leukemia, and possibly other cancers,by inducing EMC in part through over-activation of the PKC-MAPK-Fli-1 pathway.",,"['Liu,

Positive psychological responses such as benefit-finding may buffer the negative impacts of cancer but are poorly understood in this population. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively describe the content and trajectory of benefit- and burden-finding among AYAs to develop potential targets for future intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-on-one semistructured interviews were conducted with English-speaking AYA patients (aged 14-25 years) within 60 days of diagnosis of a noncentral nervous system malignancy requiring chemotherapy, 6-12 and 12-18 months later. Interviews were coded using directed content analyses with a priori schema defined by existing theoretical frameworks, including changed sense of self, relationships, philosophy of life, and physical well-being. We compared the content, raw counts, and ratios of benefit-to-burden by patient and by time point. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Seventeen participants at one tertiary academic medical center (mean age 17.1 years, SD = 2.7) with sarcoma (n = 8), acute leukemia (n = 6), and lymphoma (n = 3) completed 44 interviews with >100 hours of transcript-data. RESULTS: Average benefit counts were higher than average burden counts at each time point; 68% of interviews had a benefit-to-burden ratio >1. Positive changed sense-of-self was the most common benefit across all time points (44% of all reported benefits); reports of physical distress were the most common burden (32%). Longitudinal analyses suggested perceptions evolved; participants tended to focus less on physical manifestations and more on personal strengths and life purpose. CONCLUSIONS: AYAs with cancer identify more benefits than burdens throughout cancer treatment and demonstrate rapid maturation of perspectives. These findings not only inform communication practices with AYAs but also suggest opportunities for interventions to potentially improve outcomes.",,"['Straehla, Joelle P', 'Barton, Krysta S', 'Yi-Frazier, Joyce P', 'Wharton, Claire', 'Baker, Kevin Scott', 'Bona, Kira', 'Wolfe, Joanne', 'Rosenberg, Abby R']","['Straehla JP', 'Barton KS', 'Yi-Frazier JP', 'Wharton C', 'Baker KS', 'Bona K', 'Wolfe J', 'Rosenberg AR']","['1 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Harvard Medical School , Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston, Massachusetts.', ""3 Cancer and Blood Disorders Center , Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", ""4 Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics , Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", ""3 Cancer and Blood Disorders Center , Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", '5 Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington , Seattle, Washington.', ""3 Cancer and Blood Disorders Center , Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", ""3 Cancer and Blood Disorders Center , Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", '5 Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington , Seattle, Washington.', '6 Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle, Washington.', '1 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Harvard Medical School , Boston, Massachusetts.', '2 Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston, Massachusetts.', ""7 Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital , Boston, Massachusetts."", '8 Division of Population Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston, Massachusetts.', '1 Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Harvard Medical School , Boston, Massachusetts.', ""7 Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital , Boston, Massachusetts."", '8 Division of Population Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston, Massachusetts.', '9 Department of Psychosocial Oncology and Palliative Care, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston, Massachusetts.', ""3 Cancer and Blood Disorders Center , Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", ""4 Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics , Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", '5 Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington , Seattle, Washington.', '6 Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,20170104,United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attitude to Health', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Prospective Studies', '*Psychology, Adolescent', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescent and young adult', '*benefit-finding', '*communication', '*palliative care', '*pediatric cancer', '*psychosocial']",2017/01/05 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jpm.2016.0369 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2017 May;20(5):494-501. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2016.0369.

Survival among this group has not improved as much as in younger children with cancer. The aim of this study was evaluate the trends in cancer mortality of AYA aged 15-29 years in Brazil. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Atlas of Cancer Mortality databases from 1979 to 2013. Age-specific mortality rates were calculated based on the deaths from each type of cancer and the period via a direct method using the proposed world population age groups. To identify significant changes in the trends, we performed joinpoint regression analysis. RESULTS: The mortality rates per million were 54 deaths in those aged 15-19 years, 61 deaths in those aged 20-24 years, and 88 deaths in those aged 25-29 years. Leukemias, lymphomas, and central nervous system (CNS) tumors occurred at high rates in all age groups. Rates of cervical cancer were highest in those aged 25-29 years. There were significant increases in mortality trends in the North and Northeast regions for all tumor groups, especially CNS tumors. A small decrease in the mortality rate from lymphomas was observed in the South and Southeast regions.

This study will investigate the functions and the mechanism of miR-638 in osteosarcoma (OS). The expression of miR-638 in OS and the DNA copy number of miR-638 were detected by real-time PCR. The effect of miR-638 on cell proliferation was measured by CCK8 assay. Different assays, including bioinformatics algorithms, luciferase report assay, and Western blotting, were used to identify the target gene proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (PIM1) of miR-638 in OS. The expression of PIM1 in clinical OS tissues was also validated by immunohistochemical assay. From this research, we found that miR-638 was downregulated in OS tissues compared with corresponding noncancerous tissues (NCTs), and the DNA copy number of miR-638 was lower in OS than in NCTs, which may induce the corresponding downregulation of miR-638 in OS. Ectopic expression of miR-638 inhibited OS cell growth in vitro. Subsequently, we identified that PIM1 is the downstream target gene of miR-638 in OS cells, and silencing PIM1 expression phenocopied the inhibitory effect of miR-638 on OS cell proliferation. Furthermore, we observed that PIM1 was overexpressed in OS tissues, and high expression of PIM1 in OS predicted poor overall survival. In summary, we revealed that miR-638 functions as a tumor suppressor through inhibiting PIM1 expression in OS.",,"['Wang, Xiao-Xu', 'Liu, Jue', 'Tang, Yi-Min', 'Hong, Liang', 'Zeng, Zhi', 'Tan, Guang-Hua']","['Wang XX', 'Liu J', 'Tang YM', 'Hong L', 'Zeng Z', 'Tan GH']","[""Department of Joint Surgery, the Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, 35 Jiefang Road, Hengyang, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Dobstertics and Gynecology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Nursing, the First Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Joint Surgery, the Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, 35 Jiefang Road, Hengyang, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Joint Surgery, the Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, 35 Jiefang Road, Hengyang, Hunan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Joint Surgery, the Second Affiliated Hospital, University of South China, 35 Jiefang Road, Hengyang, Hunan, People's Republic of China. fueryisheng@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170103,Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Osteosarcoma', 'PIM1', 'Proliferation', 'miR-638']",2017/01/05 06:00,2017/01/05 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-016-5379-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-016-5379-1 [pii]']",aheadofprint,Tumour Biol. 2017 Jan 3. pii: 10.1007/s13277-016-5379-1. doi: 10.1007/s13277-016-5379-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples were scanned with 20 and 40 MHz ultrasound and assessed histologically in terms of cellular structure. Frequency-domain analysis of 20 MHz ultrasound data demonstrated midband fit changes of 6.0 +/- 0.7 dBr, 6.2 +/- 1.8 dBr, 4.0 +/- 1.0 dBr and -4.6 +/- 1.7 dBr after 48-hour cisplatinum-induced apoptosis, 48-hour oncotic decay, 36-hour colchicine-induced mitotic arrest, and heat treatment compared to control, respectively. Trends from 40 MHz ultrasound were similar. Spectral slope changes obtained from 40 MHz ultrasound data were reflective of alterations in cell and nucleus size. Chromatin pyknosis or lysis trends suggested that the density of nuclear material may be responsible for observed changes in ultrasound backscatter. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed the modes of cell death and supported midband fit trends in ultrasound data.

The appropriate features of adult ALL, which are known to differ from those of childhood ALL in certain biological characteristics and prognosis, remain insufficiently studied. The aim of this study was to assess the stability of IG and TCR gene rearrangements in adult ALL.

Mismatch in clonal rearrangements at onset and relapse was identified in 83% of patients, indicating clonal instability during treatment. Clonal evolution and diversity of IG and TCR gene rearrangements may be one of the tumor progression mechanisms. New rearrangements may emerge due to residual VDJ-recombinase activity in tumor cells. Also, many clonal IG and TCR gene rearrangements may be present at different levels at a diagnosis, but less abundant clones may be ""invisible"" due to limited detection sensitivity.

The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor delta (PPARdelta) sustains other cancers, and in silico analysis showed higher PPARD expression in CLL cells than normal lymphocytes and other hematologic cancers. A direct association was found between PPARdelta protein levels in CLL cells and clinical score. Transgenic expression of PPARdelta increased the growth and survival of CD5(+) Daudi cells and primary CLL cells in stressful conditions including exhausted tissue culture media, low extracellular glucose, hypoxia and exposure to cytotoxic drugs. Glucocorticoids and synthetic PPARdelta agonists up-regulated PPARD expression and also protected Daudi and primary CLL cells from metabolic stressors.

We found that Tal2 was induced during neural differentiation in P19 cells, which are pluripotent mouse embryonal carcinoma cells that differentiate into the neural lineage upon both exposure to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and the formation of cell aggregation. Tal2 expression during neural differentiation in P19 cells was detected within 3 h after induction with atRA and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha). The atRA-RARalpha complex is known to bind to a characteristic retinoic acid response element (RARE) located in the promoter of target genes. We found a RARE-like element in the intron of Tal2. We also found a TATA-box-like element in the 5' region. The TATA-box-like element functioned as a core promoter, and TATA- box binding protein bound to this element upstream of Tal2 in P19 cells. The RARE-like element responded to atRA signaling that activated the transcription, and RARalpha was bound to this element in the intron of Tal2 in P19 cells. Furthermore, the interaction between these elements on Tal2 was confirmed in a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Because the neural differentiation of P19 cells mimics in part the development of the nervous system, P19 cells are useful for studying the mechanism underlying the role of Tal2 in neural differentiation.

Glands of the uterus are essential for establishment of pregnancy in mice and likely in humans. Forkhead box a2 (FOXA2) is a transcription factor expressed specifically in the glands of the uterus and is a critical regulator of postnatal uterine gland differentiation in mice. In this study, we conditionally deleted FOXA2 in the adult mouse uterus using the lactotransferrin Cre (Ltf-Cre) model and in the neonatal mouse uterus using the progesterone receptor Cre (Pgr-Cre) model. The uteri of adult FOXA2-deleted mice were morphologically normal and contained glands, whereas the uteri of neonatal FOXA2-deleted mice were completely aglandular. Notably, adult FOXA2-deleted mice are completely infertile because of defects in blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a critical implantation factor of uterine gland origin, was not expressed during early pregnancy in adult FOXA2-deleted mice. Intriguingly, i.p. injections of LIF initiated blastocyst implantation in the uteri of both gland-containing and glandless adult FOXA2-deleted mice. Although pregnancy was rescued by LIF and was maintained to term in uterine gland-containing adult FOXA2-deleted mice, pregnancy failed by day 10 in neonatal FOXA2-deleted mice lacking uterine glands. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized role for FOXA2 in regulation of adult uterine function and fertility and provide original evidence that uterine glands and, by inference, their secretions play important roles in blastocyst implantation and stromal cell decidualization.",,"['Kelleher, Andrew M', 'Peng, Wang', 'Pru, James K', 'Pru, Cindy A', 'DeMayo, Francesco J', 'Spencer, Thomas E']","['Kelleher AM', 'Peng W', 'Pru JK', 'Pru CA', 'DeMayo FJ', 'Spencer TE']","['Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211.', 'Department of Animal Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164.', 'Department of Animal Sciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164.', 'Pregnancy and Female Reproduction Group, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.', 'Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO 65211; spencerte@missouri.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,20170103,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Decidua/metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics', 'Female', 'Fertility/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-beta/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infertility/*genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*FOXA2', '*LIF', '*gland', '*pregnancy', '*uterus']",2017/01/05 06:00,2018/04/17 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['1618433114 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1618433114 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2017 Feb 7;114(6):E1018-E1026. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1618433114.

We compared 2 induction regimens in newly diagnosed patients ages 18 to 65 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, that is, idarubicine-cytarabine (cycle I) and amsacrine-cytarabine (cycle II) without or with clofarabine (10 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 of each of both cycles). Consolidation involved chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Event-free survival (EFS, primary endpoint) and other clinical endpoints and toxicities were assessed. We randomized 402 and 393 evaluable patients to the control or clofarabine induction treatment arms. Complete remission rates (89%) did not differ but were attained faster with clofarabine (66% vs 75% after cycle I). Clofarabine added grades 3 to 4 toxicities and delayed hematological recovery. At a median follow-up of 36 months, the study reveals no differences in overall survival and EFS between the control (EFS, 35% +/- 3 [standard error] at 4 years) and clofarabine treatments (38% +/- 3) but a markedly reduced relapse rate (44% +/- 3 vs 35% +/- 3) in favor of clofarabine and an increased death probability in remission (15% +/- 2 vs 22% +/- 3).

The rate of resistance and clonal composition of PD are incompletely characterized. We report on CLL patients treated with single-agent ibrutinib on an investigator-initiated phase 2 trial. With median follow-up of 34 months, 15 of 84 evaluable patients (17.9%) progressed. Relapsed/refractory disease at study entry, TP53 aberration, advanced Rai stage, and high beta-2 microglobulin were independently associated with inferior progression-free survival (P < .05 for all tests). Histologic transformation occurred in 5 patients (6.0%) and was limited to the first 15 months on ibrutinib. In contrast, progression due to CLL in 10 patients (11.9%) occurred later, diagnosed at a median 38 months on study. At progression, mutations in BTK (Cys481) and/or PLCG2 (within the autoinhibitory domain) were found in 9 patients (10.7%), in 8 of 10 patients with progressive CLL, and in 1 patient with prolymphocytic transformation. Applying high-sensitivity testing (detection limit approximately 1 in 1000 cells) to stored samples, we detected mutations up to 15 months before manifestation of clinical progression (range, 2.9-15.4 months).

Tumor-host interactions are critical for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells; accordingly, we hypothesize that specific targeting of the tumor microenvironment may constitute an alternative or additional strategy to conventional tumor-directed chemotherapy. Because adipocytes have been shown to promote breast and prostate cancer proliferation, and because the bone marrow adipose tissue accounts for up to 70% of bone marrow volume in adult humans, we examined the adipocyte-leukemia cell interactions to determine if they are essential for the growth and survival of AML. Using in vivo and in vitro models of AML, we show that bone marrow adipocytes from the tumor microenvironment support the survival and proliferation of malignant cells from patients with AML. We show that AML blasts alter metabolic processes in adipocytes to induce phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and consequently activate lipolysis, which then enables the transfer of fatty acids from adipocytes to AML blasts. In addition, we report that fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4) messenger RNA is upregulated in adipocytes and AML when in coculture. FABP4 inhibition using FABP4 short hairpin RNA knockdown or a small molecule inhibitor prevents AML proliferation on adipocytes. Moreover, knockdown of FABP4 increases survival in Hoxa9/Meis1-driven AML model. Finally, knockdown of carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA in an AML patient-derived xenograft model improves survival.

Because of the redundancy of SLAM family receptors (SFRs) and the complexity of SAP actions, how SFRs and SAP mediate these processes remains elusive. Here, we examined NKT cell development and humoral immunity in mice completely deficient in SFR. We found that SFR deficiency severely impaired NKT cell development. In contrast to SAP deficiency, SFR deficiency caused no apparent defect in follicular helper T (TFH) cell differentiation. Intriguingly, the deletion of SFRs completely rescued the severe defect in TFH cell generation caused by SAP deficiency, whereas SFR deletion had a minimal effect on the defective NKT cell development in SAP-deficient mice. These findings suggest that SAP-dependent activating SFR signaling is essential for NKT cell selection; however, SFR signaling is inhibitory in SAP-deficient TFH cells. Thus, our current study revises our understanding of the mechanisms underlying T cell defects in patients with XLP.",['(c) 2017 Chen et al.'],"['Chen, Shasha', 'Cai, Chenxu', 'Li, Zehua', 'Liu, Guangao', 'Wang, Yuande', 'Blonska, Marzenna', 'Li, Dan', 'Du, Juan', 'Lin, Xin', 'Yang, Meixiang', 'Dong, Zhongjun']","['Chen S', 'Cai C', 'Li Z', 'Liu G', 'Wang Y', 'Blonska M', 'Li D', 'Du J', 'Lin X', 'Yang M', 'Dong Z']","['Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100086, China.', 'Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100086, China.', 'Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100086, China.', 'Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL 33136.', 'Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100086, China.', 'Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100086, China.', 'Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100086, China.', 'Biomedical Translational Research Institute, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Institute for Immunology and School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100086, China dongzj@biomed.tsinghua.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170103,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/physiology', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins/physiology', 'Immunity, Humoral', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Mice', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Associated Protein/physiology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family/*physiology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1/*physiology']",,,2017/01/05 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2017/01/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/29 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20161312 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20161312 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2017 Feb;214(2):475-489. doi: 10.1084/jem.20161312.

The imidazole carbamate analog, 8a (EC50=0.9muM), was 16 times more potent than MMB. The comparative bioavailabilities of 8a and MMB were determined in BALB/c mice following oral dosing of these compounds. It has been demonstrated that the absolute plasma bioavailabilities of MMB and 8a were 6.7+/-0.8%, and 45.5+/-2%, respectively.

Recent reports have identified inhibitory effects of ALV-J on autophagy, a process involving in innate and adaptive immunity. Inspired by this connection between autophagy and immunity, we developed a novel DNA vaccine against ALV-J which includes co-administration of rapamycin to stimulate autophagy. To measure the efficacy of the developed prototype vaccine, five experimental groups of seven-day-old chickens was immunized three times at three-week intervals respectively with vector, pVAX1-gp85, pVAX1-gp85-LC3, pVAX1-gp85+rapamycin and pVAX1-gp85-LC3+rapamycin through electroporation. We then tested their antibody titers, cytokine levels and cellular immune responses. The immunoprotective efficacy of the prototype vaccines against the challenge of the ALV-J GD1109 strain was also examined. The results showed that the combination of pVAX1-gp85-LC3 and rapamycin was able to induce the highest antibody titers, and enhance interleukin(IL)-2, IL-10 and interferon (IFN)-gamma expression, and the chickens immunized with the combination of pVAX1-gp85-LC3 and rapamycin showed the highest percentage of CD3+CD8+T lymphocytes. Based on our results, we suggest that stimulating autophagy can improve the efficacy of DNA vaccines and that our DNA vaccine shows the potential of being a candidate vaccine against ALV-J.

Here, an infant with leukemia developed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) bacteremia that persisted for 26 days despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Sequencing of 22 consecutive VRE isolates identified the emergence of a single missense mutation (L152F) in relA, which constitutively activated the stringent response, resulting in elevated baseline levels of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). Although the mutant remained susceptible to both linezolid and daptomycin in clinical MIC testing and during planktonic growth, it demonstrated tolerance to high doses of both antibiotics when growing in a biofilm. This biofilm-specific gain in resistance was reflected in the broad shift in transcript levels caused by the mutation. Only an experimental biofilm-targeting ClpP-activating antibiotic was able to kill the mutant strain in an established biofilm. The relA mutation was associated with a fitness trade-off, forming smaller and less-well-populated biofilms on biological surfaces. We conclude that clinically relevant relA mutations can emerge during prolonged VRE infection, causing baseline activation of the stringent response, subsequent antibiotic tolerance, and delayed eradication in an immunocompromised state. IMPORTANCE: The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens is a major challenge currently facing the medical community. Such pathogens are of particular importance in immunocompromised patients as these individuals may favor emergence of novel resistance determinants due to lack of innate immune defenses and intensive antibiotic exposure. During the course of chemotherapy, a patient developed prolonged bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium that failed to clear despite multiple front-line antibiotics. The consecutive bloodstream isolates were sequenced, and a single missense mutation identified in the relA gene, the mediator of the stringent response. Strains harboring the mutation had elevated baseline levels of the alarmone and displayed heightened resistance to the bactericidal activity of multiple antibiotics, particularly in a biofilm. Using a new class of compounds that modulate ClpP activity, the biofilms were successfully eradicated. These data represent the first clinical emergence of mutations in the stringent response in vancomycin-resistant entereococci.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Honsa et al.'],"['Honsa, Erin S', 'Cooper, Vaughn S', 'Mhaissen, Mohammed N', 'Frank, Matthew', 'Shaker, Jessica', 'Iverson, Amy', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey', 'Hayden, Randall T', 'Lee, Richard E', 'Rock, Charles O', 'Tuomanen, Elaine I', 'Wolf, Joshua', 'Rosch, Jason W']","['Honsa ES', 'Cooper VS', 'Mhaissen MN', 'Frank M', 'Shaker J', 'Iverson A', 'Rubnitz J', 'Hayden RT', 'Lee RE', 'Rock CO', 'Tuomanen EI', 'Wolf J', 'Rosch JW']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA Joshua.wolf@stjude.org jason.rosch@stjude.org."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA Joshua.wolf@stjude.org jason.rosch@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170103,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bacteremia/microbiology', 'Biofilms/drug effects/growth & development', '*Drug Tolerance', 'Enterococcus faecium/*drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification/physiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/*microbiology', 'Guanosine Tetraphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Ligases/*genetics', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Mutant Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococci/drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification']",,,2017/01/04 06:00,2017/06/29 06:00,['2017/01/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/29 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.02124-16 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.02124-16 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2017 Jan 3;8(1). pii: mBio.02124-16. doi: 10.1128/mBio.02124-16.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7726-0765'],"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '33503-72-9 (Guanosine Tetraphosphate)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', ""EC 6.- (guanosine 3',5'-polyphosphate synthetases)""]",,,"['R01 AI110618/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI111449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI110578/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI124302/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM034496/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI027913/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5210501,,,,,['MBio. 2017 Feb 21;8(1):null.

To enhance cell-to-cell transmission of HTLV-1, the virus increases the number of infected cells in vivo. HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is constitutively expressed in HTLV-1 infected cells and ATL cells and promotes T-cell proliferation. However, the detailed mechanism by which it does so remains unknown. Here, we show that HBZ enhances the proliferation of expressing T cells after stimulation via the T-cell receptor. HBZ promotes this proliferation by influencing the expression and function of multiple co-inhibitory receptors. HBZ suppresses the expression of BTLA and LAIR-1 in HBZ expressing T cells and ATL cells. Expression of T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) and Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) was enhanced, but their suppressive effect on T-cell proliferation was functionally impaired. HBZ inhibits the co-localization of SHP-2 and PD-1 in T cells, thereby leading to impaired inhibition of T-cell proliferation and suppressed dephosphorylation of ZAP-70 and CD3zeta. HBZ does this by interacting with THEMIS, which associates with Grb2 and SHP-2. Thus, HBZ interacts with the SHP containing complex, impedes the suppressive signal from PD-1 and TIGIT, and enhances the proliferation of T cells. Although HBZ was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm of T cells, HBZ was localized largely in the nucleus by suppressed expression of THEMIS by shRNA. This indicates that THEMIS is responsible for cytoplasmic localization of HBZ in T cells. Since THEMIS is expressed only in T-lineage cells, HBZ mediated inhibition of the suppressive effects of co-inhibitory receptors accounts for how HTLV-1 induces proliferation only of T cells in vivo. This study reveals that HBZ targets co-inhibitory receptors to cause the proliferation of infected cells.",,"['Kinosada, Haruka', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Shimura, Kazuya', 'Miyazato, Paola', 'Onishi, Chiho', 'Iyoda, Tomonori', 'Inaba, Kayo', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Kinosada H', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Shimura K', 'Miyazato P', 'Onishi C', 'Iyoda T', 'Inaba K', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Mammalian Regulatory Network, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Animal Development and Physiology, Division of Systemic Life Science, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunology, Department of Animal Development and Physiology, Division of Systemic Life Science, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170103,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/virology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*transmission/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",,,2017/01/04 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2017/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1006120 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-16-01739 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2017 Jan 3;13(1):e1006120. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1006120. eCollection 2017 Jan.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8408-4138', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7939-2080', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4360-4029', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0473-754X']","['0 (BTLA protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD3 antigen, zeta chain)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Pdcd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (T cell Ig and ITIM domain protein, mouse)', '0 (leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1)', '0 (themis protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Zap70 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",['PLoS Pathog. 2017 Feb 23;13(2):e1006228.

To facilitate the treatment strategy decision, disease assessment should involve molecular response to initial treatment for an individual patient. Patients predicted not to achieve major molecular response (MMR) at 24 months to frontline imatinib may be better treated with alternative frontline therapies, such as nilotinib or dasatinib. The aims of this study were to i) understand the clinical prediction 'rules' for predicting MMR at 24 months for CML patients treated with imatinib using clinical, molecular, and cell count observations (predictive factors collected at diagnosis and categorised based on available knowledge) and ii) develop a predictive model for CML treatment management. This predictive model was developed, based on CML patients undergoing imatinib therapy enrolled in the TIDEL II clinical trial with an experimentally identified achieving MMR group and non-achieving MMR group, by addressing the challenge as a machine learning problem. The recommended model was validated externally using an independent data set from King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Saudi Arabia. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The common prognostic scores yielded similar sensitivity performance in testing and validation datasets and are therefore good predictors of the positive group. The G-mean and F-score values in our models outperformed the common prognostic scores in testing and validation datasets and are therefore good predictors for both the positive and negative groups. Furthermore, a high PPV above 65% indicated that our models are appropriate for making decisions at diagnosis and pre-therapy. Study limitations include that prior knowledge may change based on varying expert opinions; hence, representing the category boundaries of each predictive factor could dramatically change performance of the models.",,"['Banjar, Haneen', 'Ranasinghe, Damith', 'Brown, Fred', 'Adelson, David', 'Kroger, Trent', 'Leclercq, Tamara', 'White, Deborah', 'Hughes, Timothy', 'Chaudhri, Naeem']","['Banjar H', 'Ranasinghe D', 'Brown F', 'Adelson D', 'Kroger T', 'Leclercq T', 'White D', 'Hughes T', 'Chaudhri N']","['School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'The Department of Computer Science, King AbdulAziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', 'School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Auto-ID Lab, School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'School of Molecular and Biomedical Science, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Cancer Theme, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide.

Both CXCR4/SDF-1 and VLA-4/VCAM1 axes are involved in leukemia protection but little is known about the role of CCL2/CCR2 in AML biology and protection against chemotherapy. We measured CCR2 expression in AML cell lines and primary AML cells by flow cytometry (FCM), real time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot (WB). CCL2 production was quantified by solid phase ELISA in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) serum. We measured chemotaxis in a transwell system with different concentrations of CCL2/CCR2 blockers; cell cycle with BrDU and propidium iodide and proliferation with yellow tetrazolium MTT. We determined synergy in in vitro cell apoptosis combining chemotherapy and CCL2/CCR2 blockade. Finally, we performed chemoprotection studies in an in vivo mouse model. Of 35 patients, 23 (65%) expressed CCR2 by FCM in PB. Two cell lines expressed high levels of CCR2 (THP-1 and murine AML). RT-PCR and WB confirmed CCR2 production. CCL2 solid phase ELISA showed significantly lower levels of CCL2 in PB and BM compared to normal controls. Chemotaxis experiments confirmed a dose-dependent migration in AML primary cells expressing CCR2 and THP-1 cells. A significant inhibition of transmigration was seen after CCL2/CCR2 blockade. Proliferation of CCR2+ AML cell lines was slightly increased (1.4-fold) after axis stimulation. We observed a non-significant increase in phase S THP-1 cells exposed to CCL2 and a concomitant decrease of cells in G1. The chemotherapy studies did not show a protective effect of CCL2 on cytarabine-induced apoptosis or synergy with chemotherapy after CCL2/CCR2 blockade both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, CCL2/CCR2 axis is expressed in the majority of monocytoid AML blasts.

Patients and Methods Analysis included 3,113 patients who were treated in the Medical Research Council UKALL2003 multicenter randomized trial (NCT00222612) between 2003 and 2011. MRD was measured by using standardized real-time quantitative PCR. Median follow-up was 5 years 9 months. Results Fifty-nine patients (1.9%) had morphologic induction failure with 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 50.7% (95% CI, 37.4 to 64.0) and 5-year overall survival of 57.7% (95% CI, 44.2 to 71.2). Of these, a small proportion of patients with M2 marrow (6 of 44) and a low EOI MRD level (< 0.01%) had 5-year EFS of 100%. Conversely, among patients with morphologic remission 2.3% (61 of 2,633) had high MRD (>/= 5%) and 5-year EFS of 47.0% (95% CI, 32.9 to 61.1), which was similar to those with morphologic induction failure. Redefining induction failure to include morphologic induction failure and/or MRD >/= 5% identified 3.9% (120 of 3,133 patients) of the trial cohort with 5-year EFS of 48.0% (95% CI, 39.3 to 58.6). Induction failure (morphologic or MRD >/= 5%) occurred most frequently in T-ALL (10.1%; 39 of 386 T-ALL cases) and B-other ALL, that is, lacking established chromosomal abnormalities (5.6%; 43 of 772 B-other cases). Genetic testing within the B-other group revealed the presence of PDGFRB gene fusions, particularly EBF1-PDGFRB, in almost one third of B-other ALL cases. Conclusion Integration of EOI MRD level with morphology identifies induction failure more precisely than morphology alone. Prevalence of EBF1-PDGFRB fusions in this group highlights the importance of genetic screening to identify abnormalities that may be targets for novel agents.",,"[""O'Connor, David"", 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Wade, Rachel', 'Hancock, Jeremy', 'Tan, Ronald M R', 'Bartram, Jack', 'Moppett, John', 'Schwab, Claire', 'Patrick, Katharine', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Hough, Rachael', 'Goulden, Nick', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Samarasinghe, Sujith']","[""O'Connor D"", 'Moorman AV', 'Wade R', 'Hancock J', 'Tan RM', 'Bartram J', 'Moppett J', 'Schwab C', 'Patrick K', 'Harrison CJ', 'Hough R', 'Goulden N', 'Vora A', 'Samarasinghe S']","[""David O'Connor, Ronald M.R.

METHOD: The target compounds were submitted to theoretical ADMET analyses and their binding properties on different HDAC6 conformers were evaluated through docking calculations. RESULTS: These in silico studies allowed us to identify a compound named B-R2B. In order to have more information about the B-R2B binding recognition properties on HDAC6, the B-R2B-HDAC6 complex was submitted through 100 ns-long Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation coupled to MMGBSA approach, revealing that B-R2B is located at the entrance of HDAC6 active pocket, blocking the passage of the substrate without reaching the HDAC6 binding site. Based on these results, B-R2B was synthesized, characterized and biologically tested. The HDAC6 fluorometric drug discovery kit Fluor-de-Lys (ENZO Life Sciences Inc.) was used to determine the HDAC6 human inhibitory activity (IC50 value) of B-R2B compound. In addition, B-R2B show IC50 values on cancer cell lines (HeLa; IC50 = 72.6 microM), acute myeloid leukemia (THP-1; IC50 = 16.5 microM), human mast leukemia (HMC; IC50 = 79.29 microM) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (Kasumi; IC50 = 101 microM). CONCLUSION: These results show that B-R2B is a HDAC6 inhibitor, specifically a non-competitive type in a similar way that tubacin does, according to MD simulations.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Rodriguez-Fonseca, Rolando Alberto', 'Sixto-Lopez, Yudibeth', 'Fragoso-Vazquez, M Jonathan', 'Flores-Mejia, Raul', 'Cabrera-Perez, Laura Cristina', 'Vazquez-Moctezuma, Ismael', 'Rosales-Hernandez, Martha Cecilia', 'Bello, Martiniano', 'Martinez-Archundia, M', 'Trujillo-Ferrara, Jose Guadalupe', 'Becerra-Martinez, Elvia', 'Correa-Basurto, Jose']","['Rodriguez-Fonseca RA', 'Sixto-Lopez Y', 'Fragoso-Vazquez MJ', 'Flores-Mejia R', 'Cabrera-Perez LC', 'Vazquez-Moctezuma I', 'Rosales-Hernandez MC', 'Bello M', 'Martinez-Archundia M', 'Trujillo-Ferrara JG', 'Becerra-Martinez E', 'Correa-Basurto J']","['Laboratorio de Modelado Molecular, Diseno de farmacos y Bioinformatica, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Mexico, Plan de San Luis y Salvador Diaz Miron S/N, Col.

We herein systematically analyzed two piPSC lines, derived by lentiviral transduction and cultured under either leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) conditions, to shed more light on the underlying biological mechanisms of porcine pluripotency. LIF-derived piPSCs were more successful than their FGF-derived counterparts in the generation of in vitro chimeras and in teratoma formation. When LIF piPSCs chimeras were transferred into surrogate sows and allowed to develop, only their prescence within the embryonic membranes could be detected. Whole-transcriptome analysis of the piPSCs and porcine neonatal fibroblasts showed that they clustered together, but apart from the two pluripotent cell populations of early porcine embryos, indicating incomplete reprogramming. Indeed, bioinformatic analysis of the pluripotency-related gene network of the LIF- versus FGF-derived piPSCs revealed that ZFP42 (REX1) expression was absent in both piPSC-like cells, whereas it was expressed in the porcine inner cell mass at Day 7/8. A second striking difference was the expression of ATOH1 in piPSC-like cells, which was absent in the inner cell mass. Moreover, our gene expression analyses plus correlation analyses of known pluripotency genes identified unique relationships between pluripotency genes in the inner cell mass, which are to some extent, in the piPSC-like cells. This deficiency in downstream gene activation and divergent gene expression may be underlie the inability to derive germ line-transmitting piPSCs, and provides unique insight into which genes are necessary to achieve fully reprogrammed piPSCs. 84: 229-245, 2017.

In the present study, we explored the pharmacological targeting of mesenchymal stromal/stem cells in BM (BM-MSCs) to eliminate chemoresistant BCP-ALL cells. Human BCP-ALL cells (NALM-6 cells) that adhered to human BM-MSCs (NALM-6/Ad) were highly resistant to multiple anti-cancer drugs, and exhibited pro-survival characteristics, such as an enhanced Akt/Bcl-2 pathway and increased populations in the G0 and G2/S/M cell cycle stages. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, interfered with adhesion between BM-MSCs and NALM-6 cells and up-regulated the matricellular protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) in BM-MSCs, thereby reducing the NALM-6/Ad population. Inhibition of SPARC expression in BM-MSCs using a small interfering RNA enhanced adhesion of NALM-6 cells. Conversely, recombinant SPARC protein interfered with adhesion of NALM-6 cells. These results suggest that SPARC disrupts adhesion between BM-MSCs and NALM-6 cells. Co-treatment with bortezomib and doxorubicin prolonged the survival of BCP-ALL xenograft mice, with a significant reduction of leukemia cells in BM. Our findings demonstrate that bortezomib contributes to the elimination of BCP-ALL cells through disruption of their adhesion to BM-MSCs, and offer a novel therapeutic strategy for BCP-ALL through targeting of BM-MSCs.",,"['Iwasa, Masaki', 'Miura, Yasuo', 'Fujishiro, Aya', 'Fujii, Sumie', 'Sugino, Noriko', 'Yoshioka, Satoshi', 'Yokota, Asumi', 'Hishita, Terutoshi', 'Hirai, Hideyo', 'Andoh, Akira', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Maekawa, Taira']","['Iwasa M', 'Miura Y', 'Fujishiro A', 'Fujii S', 'Sugino N', 'Yoshioka S', 'Yokota A', 'Hishita T', 'Hirai H', 'Andoh A', 'Ichinohe T', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan. ym58f5@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, 650-0047, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Himeji Medical Center, Hyogo, 670-8520, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine, Shiga University of Medical Science, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Kyoto University Hospital, 54 Kawaharacho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20170102,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mice, SCID', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Osteonectin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-adhesion molecule', 'B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Bortezomib', 'Human bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cell', 'SPARC']",2017/01/04 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2017/01/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2169-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2169-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 May;105(5):587-597. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2169-x.

Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from calcium dysregulation in neural cells and the invasion of activated immune cells are responsible for stroke-induced neurodegeneration. Scientists have failed thus far to identify antioxidant-based drugs that can enhance neural cell survival and improve recovery after stroke. However, several groups have demonstrated success in protecting against stroke by increasing expression of antioxidant enzymes in neural cells. These enzymes, which include but are not limited to enzymes in the glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase families, degrade ROS that otherwise damage cellular components such as DNA, proteins, and lipids. Several groups have identified cellular therapies including neural stem cells and human umbilical cord blood cells, which exert neuroprotective and oligoprotective effects through the release of pro-survival factors that activate PI3K/Akt signaling to upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. Other studies demonstrate that treatment with soluble factors released by these cells yield similar changes in enzyme expression after stroke. Treatment with the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor increases the expression of peroxiredoxin IV and metallothionein III in glia and boosts expression of superoxide dismutase 3 in neurons. Through cell-specific upregulation of these enzymes, LIF and other Akt-inducing factors have the potential to protect multiple cell types against damage from ROS during the early and late phases of ischemic damage.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

RTs are enzymes that are able to synthesize DNA using RNA or DNA as templates (DNA polymerase activity), and degrade RNA when forming RNA/DNA hybrids (ribonuclease H activity). In retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons (Metaviridae and Pseudoviridae), the coordinated action of both enzymatic activities converts single-stranded RNA into a double-stranded DNA that is flanked by identical sequences known as long terminal repeats (LTRs). RTs of retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons are active as monomers (e.g. murine leukemia virus RT), homodimers (e.g. Ty3 RT) or heterodimers (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT). RTs lack proofreading activity and display high intrinsic error rates. Besides, high recombination rates observed in retroviruses are promoted by poor processivity that causes template switching, a hallmark of reverse transcription. HIV-1 RT inhibitors acting on its polymerase activity constitute the backbone of current antiretroviral therapies, although novel drugs, including ribonuclease H inhibitors, are still necessary to fight HIV infections. In Hepadnaviridae and Caulimoviridae, reverse transcription leads to the formation of nicked circular DNAs that will be converted into episomal DNA in the host cell nucleus. Structural and biochemical information on their polymerases is limited, although several drugs inhibiting HIV-1 RT are known to be effective against the human hepatitis B virus polymerase.

However, currently there are no specific therapies for AML patients with AML1-ETO. Here, we report that AML1-ETO protein is rapidly degraded by Honokiol (HNK), a natural phenolic compound isolated from the plant Magnolia officinalis. HNK induced the degradation of AML1-ETO in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in leukemic cell lines and primary AML blasts with t(8;21) translocation. Mechanistically, HNK obviously increased the expression of UbcH8, an E2-conjugase for the degradation of AML1-ETO, through triggering accumulation of acetylated histones in the promoter region of UbcH8. Knockdown of UbcH8 by small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) prevented HNK-induced degradation of AML-ETO, suggesting that UbcH8 plays a critical role in the degradation of AML1-ETO. HNK inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptotic death without activation of caspase-3, which was reported to cleave and degrade AML1-ETO protein. Thus, HNK-induced degradation of AML1-ETO is independent of activation of caspase-3. Finally, HNK reduced the angiogenesis and migration in Kasumi-1-injected zebrafish, decreased xenograft tumor size in a xenograft leukemia mouse model, and prolonged the survival time in mouse C1498 AML model. Collectively, HNK might be a potential treatment for t(8;21) leukemia by targeting AML1-ETO oncoprotein.",['Copyright A(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: American EPA inhalation risk model and ICMM model of occupational health risk assessment were conducted to assess occupational health risk in a small wooden furniture enterprises, respectively. Results: There was poor protective measure and equipment of occupational disease in the plant. The concentration of wood dust in the air of two workshops was over occupational exposure limit (OEL) , and the CTWA was 8.9 mg/m(3) and 3.6 mg/m(3), respectively. According to EPA model, the workers who exposed to benzene in this plant had high risk (9.7x10(-6) ~34.3x10(-6)) of leukemia, and who exposed to formaldehyde had high risk (11.4 x 10(-6)) of squamous cell carcinoma. There were inconsistent evaluation results using the ICMM tools of standard-based matrix and calculated risk rating. There were very high risks to be attacked by rhinocarcinoma of the workers who exposed to wood dust for the tool of calculated risk rating, while high risk for the tool of standard-based matrix. For the workers who exposed to noise, risk of noise-induced deafness was unacceptable and medium risk using two tools, respectively.

Chemoresistance is the major reason for relapse in AML. RAD001 (everolimus) has been used at d1 and d7 of an induction chemotherapy regimen for AML, which has acceptable toxicity and may improve conventional chemotherapeutic treatment. Dual inhibitors of PI3K and mTOR overcome some of the intrinsic disadvantages of rapamycin and its derivatives. In this study, we evaluated the effects of BEZ235, a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor, on the multidrug-resistant AML cell lines HL-60/VCR and K562/ADR in vitro. BEZ235 dose-dependently inhibited the viability of HL-60/VCR and K562/ADR cells with the IC50 values of 66.69 and 71.44 nmol/L, respectively. BEZ235 (25-100 nmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the migration of the two AML cell lines, and it also significantly sensitized the two AML cell lines to VCR and ADR. After treatment with BEZ235, the miR-1-3p levels were markedly increased in HL-60/VCR cells. Using TargetScan analysis and luciferase assays, we showed that miR-1-3p targeted BAG4, EDN1 and ABCB1, the key regulators of cell apoptosis, migration and multidrug resistance, and significantly decreased their levels in the two AML cell lines. Transfection of HL-60/VCR and K562/ADR cells with miR-1-3p-AMO to inhibit miR-1-3p could reverse the anti-proliferation effects of BEZ235.

Additionally, over-expression and/or mutational activation of c-Kit have been implicated in numerous malignant diseases including acute myeloid leukemia. However, the translational regulation of c-Kit expression remains largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrated that loss of Pim1 led to specific down-regulation of c-Kit expression in HSPCs of Pim1(-/-) mice and Pim1(-/-)2(-/-)3(-/-) triple knockout (TKO) mice, and resulted in attenuated ERK and STAT3 signaling in response to stimulation with stem cell factor. Transduction of c-Kit restored the defects in colony forming capacity seen in HSPCs from Pim1(-/-) and TKO mice. Pharmacologic inhibition and genetic modification studies using human megakaryoblastic leukemia cells confirmed the regulation of c-Kit expression by Pim1 kinase: i.e., Pim1-specific shRNA knockdown down-regulated the expression of c-Kit whereas overexpression of Pim1 up-regulated the expression of c-Kit. Mechanistically, inhibition or knockout of Pim1 kinase did not affect the transcription of c-Kit gene. Pim1 kinase enhanced c-Kit (35)S methionine labeling and increased the incorporation of c-Kit mRNAs into the polysomes and monosomes, demonstrating that Pim1 kinase regulates c-Kit expression at the translational level.

METHODS: Patients with CML-CP who had previously achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), but had a suboptimal molecular response, with frontline imatinib therapy (N = 18) were assigned to receive nilotinib 300 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was the change in BCR-ABL1 transcript levels from baseline after 12 months; rates of major molecular response (MMR) and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: At 3 months after switching to nilotinib, 10 of 17 (59%) evaluable patients had achieved MMR. At 12 months, 9 of 12 (75%) evaluable patients had achieved MMR, and the median BCR-ABL1 level among all patients remaining in the study was 0.020% on the International Scale (IS), equivalent to a 3.7-log reduction from the standardized IS baseline (primary endpoint). Adverse events (AEs) were typically grade 1/2 and manageable with dose interruptions. A total of three patients experienced serious study drug-related AEs, including pancreatitis, bradycardia, and vertigo. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, results from this exploratory study suggest that switching to nilotinib due to suboptimal molecular response with imatinib can result in improved molecular response for patients with CML-CP.",,"['Ailawadhi, Sikander', 'Akard, Luke P', 'Miller, Carole B', 'Jillella, Anand', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Ericson, Solveig G', 'Lin, Felice', 'Warsi, Ghulam', 'Radich, Jerald']","['Ailawadhi S', 'Akard LP', 'Miller CB', 'Jillella A', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Ericson SG', 'Lin F', 'Warsi G', 'Radich J']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, 4500 San Pablo Road, Jacksonville, FL 32224, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology, St. Agnes Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, GA, USA.', 'Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'Clinical Cancer Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161124,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML-CP', 'ENABL', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'suboptimal response', 'switch', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2017/01/04 06:00,2017/01/04 06:01,['2017/01/03 06:00'],"['2017/01/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620716678118 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620716678118 [pii]']",ppublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2017 Jan;8(1):3-12. doi: 10.1177/2040620716678118.

Although the BET-protein inhibitor (BETi) OTX015 caused accumulation of BRD4, treatment with equimolar concentrations of ARV-825 caused sustained and profound depletion (>90%) of BRD4 and induced significantly more apoptosis in cultured and patient-derived (PD) CD34+ post-MPN sAML cells, while relatively sparing the CD34+ normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. RNA-Seq, Reverse Phase Protein Array and mass cytometry 'CyTOF' analyses demonstrated that ARV-825 caused greater perturbations in messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expressions than OTX015 in sAML cells. Specifically, compared with OTX015, ARV-825 treatment caused more robust and sustained depletion of c-Myc, CDK4/6, JAK2, p-STAT3/5, PIM1 and Bcl-xL, while increasing the levels of p21 and p27. Compared with OTX015, PROTAC ARV-771 treatment caused greater reduction in leukemia burden and further improved survival of NSG mice engrafted with luciferase-expressing HEL92.1.7 cells. Co-treatment with ARV-825 and JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib was synergistically lethal against established and PD CD34+ sAML cells. Notably, ARV-825 induced high levels of apoptosis in the in vitro generated ruxolitinib-persister or ruxolitinib-resistant sAML cells.

In an in vivo experiment, T24 cells were subcutaneously implanted in the right rear flank of nu/nu mice.

Although these features hint at a role of lncRNAs in beta cell gene regulation and diabetes, the function of beta cell lncRNAs remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of beta cell-specific lncRNAs and transcription factors using transcript knockdowns and co-expression network analysis. This revealed lncRNAs that function in concert with transcription factors to regulate beta cell-specific transcriptional networks.

Although DNA aberrations change over time, IgHV sequences and mutational status are considered stable. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective review, 409 CLL patients, between 2008 and 2015, had IgHV analysis: 56 patients had multiple analyses performed. Seven patients' IgHV results changed: 2 from unmutated to mutated and 5 from mutated to unmutated IgHV sequence. RESULTS: Three concurrently changed their variable heavy-chain sequence. Secondary to allelic exclusion, 2 of the new variable heavy chains produced were biologically nonplausible. CONCLUSION: The existence of these new nonplausible heavy-chain variable regions suggests either the CLL cancer stem-cell maintains the ability to rearrange a previously silenced IgH allele or more likely that the cancer stem-cell produced at least 2 subclones, suggesting that the CLL cancer stem cell exists before the process of allelic exclusion occurs.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, no survival benefit has been proven and leukapheresis can potentially affect coagulation and worsen bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We analyzed the effect of leukapheresis on coagulation tests in a cohort of hyperleukocytic AML patients. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of hyperleukocytic AML patients who underwent leukapheresis between 2003 and 2014. Blood coagulation tests (platelets, PT, INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-Dimers and fibrin degradation products (FDP)) were collected before and after each procedure and DIC score was computed. Transfusions of platelets and coagulation factors were collected. RESULTS: Ninety patients and 129 leukapheresis sessions were screened. After exclusion of the sessions associated with transfusions, we observed in 44 patients a significant decrease in platelets (from 75.69+/-89.48 to 44.59+/-47.71.10(9)/L, p=0.001) and fibrinogen (from 4.05+/-1.29 to 3.35+/-1.37g/L, p<0.0005) along with an increase in PT (from 14.62+/-2.73 to 15.62+/-3.63s, p=0.001), aPTT (from 33.70+/-6.32 to 39.24+/-13.53s, p=0.009) and INR (from 1.33+/-0.2 to 1.45+/-0.34, p=0.002) after the first procedure. Bleeding complications, all intracerebral hemorrhages, were documented in 3 patients within 24h of leukapheresis. After combining 73 repeat procedures, we observed similar significant results except for the aPTT prolongation. The platelets and PT components of the DIC score, but not the fibrinogen component, were significantly increased after leukapheresis. CONCLUSIONS: In hyperleukocytic AML patients, leukapheresis is associated with clinically significant decreases in platelets and fibrinogen and prolonged clotting times.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

These data are represented either by the ratio of methylated cytosine versus total coverage at a CpG site or numbers of methylated and unmethylated cytosines. Multiple statistical methods can be used to detect differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) between conditions, and these methods are often the base for the next step of differentially methylated region identification. The ratio data have a flexibility of fitting to many linear models, but the raw count data take consideration of coverage information. There is an array of options in each datatype for DMC detection; however, it is not clear which is an optimal statistical method. In this study, we systematically evaluated four statistic methods on methylation ratio data and four methods on count-based data and compared their performances with regard to type I error control, sensitivity and specificity of DMC detection and computational resource demands using real RRBS data along with simulation. Our results show that the ratio-based tests are generally more conservative (less sensitive) than the count-based tests. However, some count-based methods have high false-positive rates and should be avoided. The beta-binomial model gives a good balance between sensitivity and specificity and is preferred method.

Our study describes for the first time a critical role in CLL for the KRAB-zinc finger protein ZNF224. High ZNF224 transcript levels were detected in CLL patients with respect to control cells. Moreover, ZNF224 expression was significantly lowered after conventional chemotherapy treatment in a subset of CLL patients. By in vitro experiments we confirmed that ZNF224 expression is suppressed by fludarabine and demonstrated that ZNF224 is involved in apoptosis resistance in CLL cells. Moreover, we showed that ZNF224 positively modulates cyclin D3 gene expression. Consistently, we observed that alteration of ZNF224 expression leads to defects in cell cycle control. All together, our results strongly suggest that in CLL cells high expression level of ZNF224 can lead to inappropriate cell growth and apoptosis resistance, thus contributing to CLL progression.

We sought to characterize the incidence of CVRFs in a TBI-exposed survivor cohort and to describe prognostic indicators of their development through a retrospective analysis of CVRFs in 1-year survivors of leukemia or lymphoma treated with TBI at Memorial Sloan Kettering between April 1987 and May 2011. Eligible participants were age </=21 years at the time of TBI and were not receiving glucocorticoid therapy at the time of entry to long-term follow-up. Survivors were assessed for obesity (body mass index >/=95th percentile for age </= 20 years and >/=30 kg/m(2) for age >20 years), elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides [TG], low high-density lipoprotein [HDL]), and glucose intolerance (fasting glucose >/=100 mg/dL); those with >/=3 risk factors were deemed to have a CVRF cluster, a surrogate for metabolic syndrome. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for factors associated with each CVRF. To compare the prevalence of CVRFs in HCT survivors and the general population, survivors were compared with age-, sex-, and race-matched controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A total of 123 survivors were evaluated (62.6% males). The median age at TBI was 11.8 years (range, 1.6 to 21.9 years). The median duration of follow-up was 8.0 years (range, 1.01 to 24.6 years), and the median age at last follow-up was 20.1 years (range, 4.0 to 41.3 years). The 5-year cumulative incidence was 14.7% for elevated blood pressure, 10.5% for elevated glucose, 26.8% for low HDL, 39.2% for hypertriglyceridemia, and 16.0% for obesity, and corresponding 10-year cumulative incidences of 28.8%, 33.1%, 52.0%, 65.0%, and 18.6%. The median cumulative incidence of a CVRF cluster rose from 10.6% (range, 5.6% to 17.5%) at 5 years to 28.4% (range, 18.8% to 38.7%) at 10 years. In multivariate analysis, growth hormone (GH) deficiency (hazard ratio [HR], 8.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 34.4; P = .002), history of cranial radiation (HR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.7 to 9.6; P = .002), and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease GVHD (HR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.5 to 12.2; P = .008) were associated with the risk of developing a CVRF cluster. Compared with a random sample of matched population controls, HCT survivors had an increased prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL, but not of glucose intolerance, elevated blood pressure, or CVRF cluster. Given the young age of this HCT survivor cohort, these data highlight the importance of routine screening for CVRF starting in childhood in individuals exposed to TBI.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The immune response to HTLV-1-infection is polarized to the Th1-type, and the presence of CXCL9/CXCL10 chemokines may lead to an increase in the recruitment of pro-inflammatory molecules in spinal cord tissue, contributing to the damage observed in the development of HAM/TSP. It has been observed that in chronic helminth-infections, such as schistosomiasis, there is a deviation toward the Th2/regulatory immune response. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of Schistosoma spp. proteins to decrease the in vitro CXCL9 and CXCL10 production by PBMC of HTLV-1-infected individuals. METHODS: The Schistosoma proteins rSm29, rSh-TSP-2 and PIII were added to PBMC cultures of HTLV-1-infected individuals and the levels of chemokines in the supernatants were measured using a sandwich ELISA method. RESULTS: The addition of rSm29 to the cultures resulted in decreased production of CXCL9 in all the analyzed individuals and HAM/TSP group (18167+/-9727pg/mL, p=0.044; 20237+/-6023pg/mL, p=0.028, respectively) compared to the levels in unstimulated cultures (19745+/-9729pg/mL; 25078+/-2392pg/mL, respectively). The addition of rSh-TSP-2 decreased the production of CXCL9 in all studied individuals and carriers group (16136+/-9233pg/mL, p=0.031; 13977+/-8857pg/mL, p=0.026) vs unstimulated cultures (19745+/-9729pg/mL; 18121+/-10508pg/mL, respectively). Addition of PIII did not alter the results. There was no significant change in the levels of CXCL10 by the addition of the studied proteins. CONCLUSION: The Schistosoma proteins used in this study were able to down modulate the production of CXCL9, a chemokine associated with the inflammatory process in HTLV-1-infection.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanism of proteasome inhibition in endometrial cancer is not very clear. Carfilzomib inhibition of type I endometrial carcinoma cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase was investigated in our study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HEC-1-A and Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cell lines and three tumor cell lines were treated by different concentrations of carfilzomib. Methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay was used to detect cell viability. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle. Western blot was used to detect proteins involved in cell cycle progression. RESULTS: Carfilzomib impaired viability of myelogenous leukemia cell line K562, cervical cancer cell line HeLa, hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMCC-7721, and endometrial carcinoma cell lines HEC-1-A and Ishikawa. The cell cycle was arrested at the G2/M phase in carfilzomib-treated HEC-1-A endometrial carcinoma cells, while it was arrested at both S and G2/M phases in carfilzomib-treated Ishikawa cells. Carfilzomib treatment significantly induced p21(Waf1/ Cip1) and p27, while substantially reduced cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 1. CONCLUSION: This study showed that carfilzomib inhibited endometrial cancer proliferation by upregulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1), and reducing cyclin-dependent kinase 1 to arrest the cell cycle at the G2/M phase.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

In the era of targeted therapy, mutation profiling of cancer is a crucial aspect of making therapeutic decisions. Mapping driver gene mutations for the GC patient population as a whole has significant potential to advance precision therapy. METHODS: GC patients with sequencing data (N = 473) were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 295), Moffitt Cancer Center Total Cancer Care (TCC; n = 33), and three published studies (n = 145). In addition, relevant somatic mutation frequency data were obtained from cBioPortal, the TCC database, and an in-house analysis tool, as well as relevant publications. RESULTS: We found that the somatic mutation rates of several driver genes vary significantly between GC patients of Asian and Caucasian descent, with substantial variation across different geographic regions. Non-parametric statistical tests were performed to examine the significant differences in protein-altering somatic mutations between Asian and Caucasian GC patient groups. The frequencies of somatic mutations of five genes were: APC (Asian: Caucasian 6.06 vs. 14.40%, p = 0.0076), ARIDIA (20.7 vs. 32.1%, p = 0.01), KMT2A (4.04 vs. 12.35%, p = 0.003), PIK3CA (9.6 vs. 18.52%, p = 0.01), and PTEN (2.52 vs. 9.05%, p = 0.008), showing significant differences between Asian and Caucasian GC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found significant differences in protein-altering somatic mutation frequencies in diverse geographic populations.

IL1beta also stimulates an NF-kappaB-independent pro-survival and proliferation signal through activation of the JNK pathway.

However, the implications of 5hmC on survival in normal karyotype AML patients have not been fully evaluated. The 5hmC levels were analyzed in 375 patients using ELISA. The levels of 5hmC in DNA samples were converted to a log scale for the analysis and correlations with TET2 and/or IDH1/2 mutations were evaluated. The median 5hmC level was 0.065% (range 0.001-0.999). Mutation rates were 13.1% for TET2mut, 6.7% for IDH1mut, and 13.9% for IDH2mut. The prevalence of TET2 and/or IDH1/2 was 33.1% (124/375). TET2 and IDH1/2 mutated patients had significantly lower levels of log(5hmC) compared with patients without TET2 or IDH1/2 mutations (p<0.001).

To identify its prognostic value, we sub-classified the levels of 5hmC into tertiles for 5hmC values. However, there was no significant association between the categories of 5hmC levels and survival or relapse risk (all p>0.05). Patients with TET2 or IDH1/2 mutations had lower levels of 5hmC.

This study estimates the 2010 complete prevalence of malignant primary brain tumors overall and by Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) histology groups, and compares the brain tumor prevalence estimates to the complete prevalence of other common cancers as determined by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) by age at prevalence (2010): children (0-14 y), adolescent and young adult (AYA) (15-39 y), and adult (40+ y). Methods: Complete prevalence proportions were estimated using a novel regression method extended from the Completeness Index Method, which combines survival and incidence data from multiple sources. In this study, two datasets, CBTRUS and SEER, were used to calculate complete prevalence estimates of interest. Results: Complete prevalence for malignant primary brain tumors was 47.59/100000 population (22.31, 48.49, and 57.75/100000 for child, AYA, and adult populations). The most prevalent cancers by age were childhood leukemia (36.65/100000), AYA melanoma of the skin (66.21/100000), and adult female breast (1949.00/100000). The most prevalent CBTRUS histologies in children and AYA were pilocytic astrocytoma (6.82/100000, 5.92/100000), and glioblastoma (12.76/100000) in adults. Conclusions: The relative impact of malignant primary brain tumors is higher among children than any other age group; it emerges as the second most prevalent cancer among children. Complete prevalence estimates for primary malignant brain tumors fills a gap in overall cancer knowledge, which provides critical information toward public health and health care planning, including treatment, decision making, funding, and advocacy programs.","['(c) The Author(s) 2016.

Evading cell death is a major hallmark of cancer, driving tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. To evade apoptosis, cancers use antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins to bind to and neutralize apoptotic activators, such as Bim. Investigation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in clinical breast cancer datasets revealed greater expression and more frequent gene amplification of MCL1 as compared with BCL2 or BCL2L1 (Bcl-xL) across three major molecular breast cancer subtypes, Luminal (A and B), HER2-enriched, and Basal-like. While Mcl-1 protein expression was elevated in estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha)-positive and ERalpha-negative tumors as compared with normal breast, Mcl-1 staining was higher in ERalpha(+) tumors. Targeted Mcl-1 blockade using RNAi increased caspase-mediated cell death in ERalpha(+) breast cancer cells, resulting in sustained growth inhibition. In contrast, combined blockade of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL only transiently induced apoptosis, as cells rapidly acclimated through Mcl-1 upregulation and enhanced Mcl-1 activity, as measured in situ using Mcl-1/Bim proximity ligation assays. Importantly, MCL1 gene expression levels correlated inversely with sensitivity to pharmacologic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition in luminal breast cancer cells, whereas no relationship was seen between the gene expression of BCL2 or BCL2L1 and sensitivity to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition. These results demonstrate that breast cancers rapidly deploy Mcl-1 to promote cell survival, particularly when challenged with blockade of other Bcl-2 family members, warranting the continued development of Mcl-1-selective inhibitors for targeted tumor cell killing.Implications: Mcl-1 levels predict breast cancer response to inhibitors targeting other Bcl-2 family members, and demonstrate the key role played by Mcl-1 in resistance to this drug class.

Although CD19-targeting second-generation (2nd-G) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells carrying CD28 or 4-1BB domains have demonstrated potency in patients with advanced B-ALL, these 2 signalling domains endow CAR-T cells with different and complementary functional properties. Preclinical results have shown that third-generation (3rd-G) CAR-T cells combining 4-1BB and CD28 signalling domains have superior activation and proliferation capacity compared with 2nd-G CAR-T cells carrying CD28 domain. The aim of the current study is therefore to investigate the safety and efficacy of 3rd-G CAR-T cells in adults with r/r B-ALL. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a phase I clinical trial for patients with r/r B-ALL to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of 3rd-G CAR-T cells. Before receiving lymphodepleting conditioning regimen, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from eligible patients will be leukapheresed, and the T cells will be purified, activated, transduced and expanded ex vivo. On day 6 in the protocol, a single dose of 1 million CAR-T cells per kg will be administrated intravenously. The phenotypes of infused CAR-T cells, copy number of CAR transgene and plasma cytokines will be assayed for 2 years after CAR-T infusion using flow cytometry, real-time quantitative PCR and cytometric bead array, respectively. Moreover, several predictive plasma cytokines including interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, Soluble Interleukin (sIL)-2R-alpha, solubleglycoprotein (sgp)130, sIL-6R, Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP1), Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP1)-alpha, MIP1-beta and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are highly associated with severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS), will be used to forecast CRS to allow doing earlier intervention, and CRS will be managed based on a revised CRS grading system. In addition, patients with grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicities or persistent B-cell aplasia will be treated with dexamethasone (10 mg intravenously every 6 hours) or IgG, respectively. Descriptive and analytical analyses will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval for the study was granted on 10 July 2014 (YLJS-2014-7-10). Written informed consent will be taken from all participants. The results of the study will be reported, through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations and an internal organisational report.

Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells against CD19 (CART19) have displayed anti-leukemia activities. However, data from systemic trials in Chinese patients are limited.Experimental Design: T cells transduced with CD19-directed CAR lentiviral vectors were infused in patients with R/R ALL under fludarabine- and cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion. The postinfusion responses, toxicities, expansion, and persistence of CART19s in enrolled patients were observed and monitored.Results: We enrolled 15 patients with R/R ALL. The median transduction efficiency of CART19s was 33%. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were conducted and showed prominent antileukemia activities with CART19s. The patients received CART19s infusion at doses of 1.1 x 10(6)/kg to 9.8 x 10(6)/kg. Twelve patients achieved complete remission 1 month after CART19s infusion. CART19s expanded and persisted in peripheral blood and bone marrow. At 150 days, the overall survival rate and leukemia-free survival rate were 65.5% and 37.8%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of relapse and the nonrelapse mortality rate were 54.5% and 7.7%, respectively. Four patients underwent subsequent haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this trial, 10 patients experienced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Grade 3 CRS developed in 40% of patients and was associated with a higher disease burden on day -1 and a higher number of previous relapses.Conclusions: This trial demonstrated potent antileukemia activities of CART19s in Chinese patients with R/R ALL. Disease relapse remained the main obstacle. However, patients with a high risk of relapse after CART19s might benefit from subsequent haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

In this work, we identified an IRF-1 splicing transcript (IRF-1-s) in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-treated acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4 cells. It lost the exon 8 and 9 of the full length IRF-1, expressed in numerous cell types and could be induced to expression by ATRA in NB4 cells. It turned out similar biological activity as full length IRF-1 to enhance the transcription of interferon stimulated response element (ISRE)-containing target genes.

However, it seems to have improved since the introduction of rituximab. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the characteristics (including the cell-of-origin), and the prognosis of 29 patients with TL and 101 with de novo DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy. RESULTS: Patients with TL and de novo DLBCL had similar characteristics. All TL cases evolving from follicular lymphoma were germinal-center B-cell-like, while those TL from marginal zone lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia were non-germinal-center B-cell-like. The complete response rate was similar in TL and de novo DLBCL (62 vs. 66%, P=.825). The 5-year overall and progression-free survival probabilities (95% CI) were 59% (40-78) and 41% (22-60) for TL and 63% (53-73) and 60% (50-70) for de novo DLBCL, respectively (P=.732 for overall survival and P=.169 for progression-free survival).

Recently LEF1 staining was identified as a fairly characteristic finding in CLL/SLL, with positivity identified in up to 95% of cases. LEF1 staining has not been reported as being present in cases of MCL, making this stain a useful tool in distinguishing these diagnoses. We identified an index case of MCL with cyclin D1 expression and the presence of the typical t(11;14) IGH-CCND1, which expressed LEF1. Subsequently, we assessed LEF1 immunohistochemical staining in a series of 23 cases of MCL, as confirmed by staining for cyclin D1 and/or SOX11.

Here, we demonstrate that 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) enhanced the effect of ABT-199 to induce cell apoptosis in hematologic malignancies with up-regulated Bcl-xL expression. Our study revealed that 2-DG could decrease glucose-dependent and Akt-independent Mcl-1 expression, which is mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. Moreover, the combination of 2-DG and ABT-199 triggered c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and subsequent Bcl-xL degradation, whereas 2-DG and ABT-199 alone had little effect on JNK activation. Therefore, the combination of 2-DG and ABT-199 initiated cell death through the reduction of Mcl-1 expression and JNK activation.

Over 90% of the patients carry the D816V point mutation in the KIT receptor that renders this receptor constitutively active. We assessed the sensitivity of primary mast cells (MC) and mast cell lines HMC1.2 (D816V mutated), ROSA (KIT WT) and ROSA (KIT D816V) cells to histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) treatment. We found that of four HDACi, suberoyl anilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was the most effective in killing mutated MC. SAHA downregulated KIT, followed by major MC apoptosis. Primary SM patient MC cultured ex vivo were even more sensitive to SAHA than HMC1.2 cells, whereas primary MC from healthy subjects were less affected. There was a correlation between cell death and SM disease severity, where cell death was more pronounced in the case of aggressive SM, with almost 100% cell death among MC from the mast cell leukemia patient. Additionally, ROSA (KIT D816V) was more affected by HDACi than ROSA (KIT WT) cells. Using ChIP qPCR, we found that the level of active chromatin mark H3K18ac/H3 decreased significantly in the KIT region. This epigenetic silencing was seen only in the KIT region and not in control genes upstream and downstream of KIT, indicating that the downregulation of KIT is exerted by specific epigenetic silencing. In conclusion, KIT D816V mutation sensitized MC to HDACi mediated killing, and SAHA may be of value as specific treatment for SM, although the specific mechanism of action requires further investigation.",,"['Lyberg, Katarina', 'Ali, Hani Abdulkadir', 'Grootens, Jennine', 'Kjellander, Matilda', 'Tirfing, Malin', 'Arock, Michel', 'Hagglund, Hans', 'Nilsson, Gunnar', 'Ungerstedt, Johanna']","['Lyberg K', 'Ali HA', 'Grootens J', 'Kjellander M', 'Tirfing M', 'Arock M', 'Hagglund H', 'Nilsson G', 'Ungerstedt J']","['Immunology and Allergy Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet and clinical immunology and transfusion medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Mastocytosis Center Karolinska, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet and Hematology Center, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Mastocytosis Center Karolinska, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Immunology and Allergy Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet and clinical immunology and transfusion medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Mastocytosis Center Karolinska, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet and Hematology Center, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Immunology and Allergy Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet and clinical immunology and transfusion medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', ""Molecular and Cellular Oncology, LBPA CNRS UMR 8113, Ecole Normale Superieure de Cachan, Cachan, France and Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France."", 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University and Section of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Immunology and Allergy Unit, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet and clinical immunology and transfusion medicine, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Mastocytosis Center Karolinska, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet and Hematology Center, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Mastocytosis Center Karolinska, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing/*drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vorinostat']",['NOTNLM'],"['KIT', 'chromatin', 'epigenetics', 'mast cells', 'systemic mastocytosis']",2016/12/31 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/12/31 06:00'],"['2016/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['14181 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14181 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 7;8(6):9647-9659. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14181.,,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,PMC5354760,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to elucidate factors contributing to transformation, we have performed super-SILAC quantitative proteome profiling of malignant plasma cells collected from the same patient at both the MM and sPCL stages of the disease. 795 proteins were found to be differentially expressed in the MM and sPCL samples. Gene ontology analysis indicated a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis in sPCL as well as marked down-regulation of enzymes involved in glycan synthesis, potentially mediating altered glycosylation of surface receptors. There was no significant change in overall genomic 5-methylcytosine or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at the two stages, indicating that epigenetic dysregulation was not a major driver of transformation to sPCL.

For this purpose, total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from 88 CLL patients and 33 non-leukemic blood donors, and poly(A)-RNA was reversely transcribed. HIF1A mRNA levels were quantified using real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high HIF1A mRNA expression predicts inferior overall survival for CLL patients (p=0.001). Bootstrap univariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that HIF1A mRNA overexpression is a significant unfavorable prognosticator in CLL (hazard ratio=3.75, bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence interval=1.43-24.36, bootstrap p<0.001), independent of other established prognostic factors, including CD38 expression, the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV), and the clinical stage (Binet or Rai stage) or risk group (p<0.001 in all cases). Interestingly, HIF1A mRNA positivity retains its unfavorable prognostic value in distinct subgroups of patients, stratified according to established prognostic factors. Thus, HIF1A mRNA overexpression can be regarded as a promising, independent molecular biomarker of unfavorable prognosis in CLL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Post hoc analysis of a multicenter database within 20 years was performed. All patients with malignancies and Berlin ARDS definition were included. Noninvasive ventilation use was defined as NIV lasting more than 1 hour, whereas failure was defined as a subsequent requirement of invasive ventilation. Conditional backward logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 1004 met the Berlin definition of ARDS. Noninvasive ventilation was used in 387 patients (38.6%) and NIV failure occurred in 71%, with an in-hospital mortality of 62.7%. Severity of ARDS defined by the partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (odds ratio [OR], 2.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-4.19), pulmonary infection (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.08-3.03), and modified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.21) were associated with NIV failure. Factors associated with hospital mortality were NIV failure (OR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.56-4.07), severe ARDS as compared with mild ARDS (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19), and modified SOFA score (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.05-1.19). CONCLUSION: Noninvasive ventilation failure in ARDS patients with malignancies is frequent and related to ARDS severity, SOFA score, and pulmonary infection-related ARDS. Noninvasive ventilation failure is associated with in-hospital mortality.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR)analysis showed that heterocyclic alkane at the solvent interface position could significantly increase the potency for the inhibition of proliferation of MV4-11 cell line. Compound 10a and 10d exhibited better efficacy (MV4-11, IC50: 14.7 nM for 10a and 24.8 nM for 10d) than positive control sunitinib (MV4-11, IC50: 38.5 nM). The kinase and cellular inhibition assay exhibited that 10d (FLT3, IC50: 5.3 nM) was a potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic experiments showed that 10d had good properties of oral bioavailability, Cmax, Tmax, T1/2 and AUC in mice, respectively.

SYK downstream target AKT was subsequently induced and MCL-1 expression was increased. Concomitant inhibition of SYK by the SYK inhibitor R406 resulted in reduced activation of AKT and prevented upregulation of MCL-1. Moreover, short-term CD38 stimulation enhanced BCR-signaling, as indicated by increased ERK phosphorylation. CXCL12-dependent migration was increased after CD38 stimulation. Treating CLL cells with R406 inhibited CD38-mediated migration. In addition, we observed marked downregulation of CD38 expression for CLL cells treated with R406 compared to vehicle control.

Here we showed that AT406, an IAP antagonist, was cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic to both established (HepG2, SMMC-7721 lines) and primary HCC cells. Activation of mTOR could be a key resistance factor of AT406 in HCC cells. mTOR inhibition (by OSI-027), kinase-dead mutation or knockdown remarkably enhanced AT406-induced lethality in HCC cells. Reversely, forced-activation of mTOR by adding SC79 or exogenous expressing a constitutively active S6K1 (T389E) attenuated AT406-induced cytotoxicity against HCC cells. We showed that AT406 induced degradation of IAPs (cIAP-1 and XIAP), but didn't affect another anti-apoptosis protein Mcl-1. Co-treatment of OSI-027 caused simultaneous Mcl-1 downregulation to overcome AT406's resistance. Significantly, shRNA knockdown of Mcl-1 remarkably facilitated AT406-induced apoptosis in HCC cells.

For selective targeting, appropriate engineering of the PVLP surface is needed. Here, we describe a chemical approach to retarget PVLPs to cancer cells displaying abnormally high levels of transferrin receptor. We created an array of transferrin molecules on the surface of PVLPs by combining a high-yielding bioconjugation approach with specific point modification of transferrin. This artificial surface protein architecture enables (i) suppression of natural VP1-specific interactions by blocking the surface conformational epitope on the VP1 protein, (ii) unusually high cellular uptake efficiency, and (iii) selective retargeting of PVLPs to osteosarcoma (U2OS) and lymphoblastoid leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cells.",,"['Zackova Suchanova, Jirina', 'Neburkova, Jitka', 'Spanielova, Hana', 'Forstova, Jitka', 'Cigler, Petr']","['Zackova Suchanova J', 'Neburkova J', 'Spanielova H', 'Forstova J', 'Cigler P']","['Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Charles University , Vinicna 5, 128 44 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS , v.v.i., Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 10, Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University , Katerinska 32, 121 08, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Charles University , Vinicna 5, 128 44 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS , v.v.i., Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 10, Prague 6, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Science, Charles University , Vinicna 5, 128 44 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS , v.v.i., Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 10, Prague 6, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170110,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Capsid/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Polyomavirus/*chemistry', 'Surface Properties']",,,2016/12/31 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2016/12/31 06:00'],"['2016/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00622 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2017 Feb 15;28(2):307-313. doi: 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00622.

However, there are overlapping features between ATL subtypes and between ATL and nonmalignant (non-ATL) HTLV-1 infection complicating diagnosis and prognostication. To further refine the diagnosis and prognosis of ATL, we characterized the immunophenotype of HTLV-1-infected cells in ATL and non-ATL. A retrospective study of peripheral blood samples from 10 HTLV-1-uninfected subjects (UI), 54 HTLV-1-infected patients with non-ATL, and 22 with ATL was performed using flow cytometry. All patients with ATL had CD4(+) CCR4(+) CD26(-) immunophenotype and the frequency of CD4(+) CCR4(+) CD26(-) T cells correlated highly significantly with the proviral load in non-ATL suggesting CD4(+) CCR4(+) CD26(-) as a marker of HTLV-1-infected cells. Further immunophenotyping of CD4(+) CCR4(+) CD26(-) cells revealed that 95% patients with ATL had a CD7(-) (</=30% CD7(+) cells), whereas 95% HTLV+ non-ATL had CD7(+) (>30% CD7(+) cells) immunophenotype. All patients with aggressive ATL had a CCR7(+) (>/=30%), whereas 92% with indolent ATL and 100% non-ATL had a CCR7(-) (<30%) immunophenotype. Patients with nonprogressing indolent ATL were CD127(+) but those with progressive lymphocytosis requiring systemic therapy had a CD127(-) (</=30%) immunophenotype. In summary, HTLV-1-infected cells have a CD4(+) CCR4(+) CD26(-) immunophenotype. Within this population, CD7(-) phenotype suggests a diagnosis of ATL, CCR7(+) phenotype identifies aggressive ATL, while CCR7(-) CD127(-) phenotype identifies progressive indolent ATL.",['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Alternate breakpoints in BCR (m-bcr, mu-bcr, and others) or ABL1 result in the expression of few rare fusion transcripts (e19a2, e1a2, e13a3, e14a3) and fusion proteins (p190, p200, p225) whose exact clinical significance remains to be determined. METHODS: Our study was designed to determine the type and frequency of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts in 1260 CML patients and to analyze the prognosis and treatment response in patients harboring rare BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts. RESULTS: The frequency of various BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts was as follows: e14a2 (60%), e13a2 (34.3%), e1a2 (1.2%), e1a2 + e13a2 (2.0%), e1a2 + e14a2 (1.8%), e19a2 (0.3%), and e14a3 (0.3%). CML patients with e1a2 transcripts had higher rates of disease progression, resistance, or suboptimal response to imatinib and failed to achieve major molecular response. CONCLUSION: Characterization of the specific fusion transcript in CML patients is important owing to the difference in prognosis and response to therapy in addition to the conventional need for monitoring treatment response. CML patients with e1a2 transcripts have to be closely monitored due to the high incidence of disease progression and treatment resistance/failure.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Arun, A K', 'Senthamizhselvi, A', 'Mani, S', 'Vinodhini, K', 'Janet, N B', 'Lakshmi, K M', 'Abraham, A', 'George, B', 'Srivastava, A', 'Srivastava, V M', 'Mathews, V', 'Balasubramanian, P']","['Arun AK', 'Senthamizhselvi A', 'Mani S', 'Vinodhini K', 'Janet NB', 'Lakshmi KM', 'Abraham A', 'George B', 'Srivastava A', 'Srivastava VM', 'Mathews V', 'Balasubramanian P']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Cytogenetics Unit, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161229,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'CML', 'e1a2 transcripts', 'rare fusion transcripts']",2016/12/31 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2016/12/31 06:00'],"['2016/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12616 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Jun;39(3):235-242. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12616.

WP1066 exhibits stronger anti-cancer activity than AG490 against malignant glioma and other cancer cells and is regarded as a promising therapeutic agent. By screening a small library of target-known compounds, we identified WP1066 as an inhibitor of macrophage cell death induced by agonists of the NLRP3 inflammasome, an intracellular protein complex required for the processing of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1beta. WP1066 strongly inhibited cell death as well as extracellular release of IL-1beta induced by inflammasome agonists in mouse peritoneal exudate cells and human leukemia monocytic THP-1 cells that were differentiated into macrophagic cells by treatment with PMA. However, inflammasome agonists did not increase STAT3 phosphorylation, and another JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, did not inhibit cell death, although it strongly inhibited basal STAT3 phosphorylation. Thus, WP1066 appears to suppress macrophage cell death independently of its inhibitory effect on STAT3. In contrast, WP1066 itself induced the death of undifferentiated THP-1 cells, suggesting that WP1066 differentially modulates cell death in a context-dependent manner. Consistent with previous findings, WP1066 induced the death of human glioma A172 and T98G cells. However, neither ruxolitinib nor AG490, the former of which completely suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation, induced the death of these glioma cells. These results suggest that WP1066 targets cell death-modulating molecules other than those involved in JAK-STAT3 signaling.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Histopathologically, the lesions are composed of a dermal or subcutaneous proliferation of blood vessels of varying sizes with plump and bland endothelial cells, which often show vacuolization and protrusion of the cytoplasm into the lumen. The vascular proliferation is admixed with a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, eosinophils and mast cells. Lymphoid follicles with germinal centers can sometimes be seen. In addition, fibrosis is a common accompanying feature. Some clinical and histopathological variants of ALHE have already been described in the literature. In this report, we present 3 rare associations of ALHE that have not been previously described. Case 1 was a 73-year-old woman with a lesion on her right medial thigh. Examination showed ALHE admixed with a chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) infiltrate. Case 2 was a 55-year-old woman with a lesion on her right anterior ankle, which was a syringocystadenoma papilliferum co-existing with an ALHE. Case 3 was a 54-year-old man with a lesion on the left medial thigh, which showed overlapping features of IgG4-related disease associated with areas of ALHE.

The expression of miRNA301a in patient with CML cells was higher than the expression of normal patients. Overall survival (OS) of chronic granulocytic leukemia cell patient with low miRNA301 expression was superior to that of CML patient with high miRNA301 expression. Moreover, the upregulation of miRNA301a increased cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis and caspase-3 and -9 activity of K562 cells. Next, the upregulation of miRNA301a suppressed Bax/Bcl-2 rate and TIMP2 protein expression, increased phosphorylation-ERK1/2 and decreased phosphorylation-AKT protein expression of K562 cells.

Evolutionary selection at the molecular level is nature's test on functional consequences of genetic elements. By prioritizing genes that show significant statistical association and high functional impact, our new method reduces the chances of including spurious markers in the predictive model. When applied to predicting therapeutic responses for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and to predicting metastasis for patients with prostate cancers, the new method gave rise to evolution-informed models that enjoyed low complexity and high accuracy. The identified genetic markers also have significant implications in tumor progression and embrace potential drug targets.

Primary BM cells lentivirally infected with human DeltaNp73 were not immortalized in culture and did not present significant changes in the percentage of CD11b. Finally, we assessed the impact of DeltaNp73 on leukemogenesis or its possible cooperation with PML/RARA fusion protein in the induction of an APL-leukemic phenotype. After 120 days of follow-up, all transplanted mice were clinically healthy and, no evidence of leukemia/myelodysplasia was apparent. Taken together, our data suggest that DeltaNp73 had no leukemic transformation capacity by itself and apparently did not cooperate with the PML/RARA fusion protein to induce a leukemic phenotype in a murine BM transplantation model. In addition, the forced expression of DeltaNp73 in murine BM progenitors did not alter the ATRA-induced differentiation rate in vitro or induce aberrant cell proliferation, but exerted an important role in cell survival, providing resistance to drug-induced apoptosis.",,"['Lucena-Araujo, Antonio R', 'Coelho-Silva, Juan L', 'Pereira-Martins, Diego A', 'Thome, Carolina', 'Scheucher, Priscila S', 'Lange, Ana P', 'Paiva, Helder H', 'Hemmelgarn, Benjamin T', 'Morais-Sobral, Mariana C', 'Azevedo, Elisa A', 'Franca-Neto, Pedro L', 'Franca, Rafael F', 'Silva, Cleide L', 'Krause, Alexandre', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Coelho-Silva JL', 'Pereira-Martins DA', 'Thome C', 'Scheucher PS', 'Lange AP', 'Paiva HH', 'Hemmelgarn BT', 'Morais-Sobral MC', 'Azevedo EA', 'Franca-Neto PL', 'Franca RF', 'Silva CL', 'Krause A', 'Rego EM']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhaes, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Virology, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhaes, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Virology, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz, Centro de Pesquisas Aggeu Magalhaes, Recife, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cathepsin G/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Protein p73/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'lentiviral gene transfer', 'DeltaNp73']",2016/12/31 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/12/31 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['14295 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14295 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 31;8(5):8475-8483. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14295.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)']",,,,PMC5352415,,,,,,,,,

In this study, ZGDHu-1 shows potent anti-lymphoma activity in MCL cells. ZGDHu-1 significantly induces cell cycle G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in MCL cells. ZGDHu-1 reduces the protein levels of Mcl-1, Bcl-XL and cyclin D1. Importantly, ZGDHu-1 inhibits TNFalpha-induced IkBa phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation and NF-kB downstream target gene expression in MCL cells. MCL samples expressing high levels of Bcl-2 and high Bcl-2/Bax ratios tend to be less effective to ZGDHu-1. Together, these results suggest that ZGDHu-1 could inhibit the NF-kB signaling pathway partly, which may lead to the suppression of cell proliferation and the induction of apoptosis in MCL cells.

However, the role and the mechanism of RARalpha in gastric carcinoma (GC) were unknown. Here, the expression of RARalpha was frequently elevated in human GC tissues and cell lines, and its overexpression was closely correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and clinical stages in GC patients. Moreover, RARalpha overexpression was related with pathological differentiation. Functionally, RARalpha knockdown inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of GC cells, as well as enhanced drug susceptibility both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, RARalpha knockdown suppressed GC progression through regulating the expression of cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasion and drug resistance associated proteins, such as PCNA, CyclinB1, CyclinD2, CyclinE, p21, MMP9 and MDR1. Mechanistically, the above oncogenic properties of RARalpha in GC were closely associated with Akt signaling activation. Moreover, overexpression of RARalpha was induced by IL-1beta/Akt signaling activation, which suggested a positive feedback loop of IL-1beta/Akt/RARalpha/Akt signaling in GC. Taken together, we demonstrated that RARalpha was frequently elevated in GC and exerted oncogenic properties.

In this population, we evaluated escalating doses of lenalidomide combined with intensive chemotherapy in a phase II study. Treatment consisted of daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-3 in cohort 1, escalated to 60 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-3 in cohorts 2 and 3) combined with cytosine arabinoside (200 mg/m(2)/day, days 1-7) and lenalidomide (10 mg/day, days 1-21 in cohorts 1 and 2, escalated to 25 mg/day, days 1-21 in cohort 3). Eighty-two patients with 5q deletion were enrolled, including 62 with acute myeloblastic leukemia, 62/79 (78%) of whom had a complex karyotype (median 7 cytogenetic abnormalities, all but 2 of them monosomal) and three had unknown karyotypes. Thirty-eight patients (46%) achieved complete remission and the overall response rate was 58.5%. Among the 62 patients with a complex karyotype, 27 achieved complete remission (44%) and 21 had cytogenetic responses. A lower response rate was observed in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia but other pretreatment factors, including cytogenetic complexity and treatment cohort, did not significantly influence response. Fifteen patients underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, including 11 patients in first remission. The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 64.6% and the median overall survival was 8.2 months. By comparison with conventional intensive chemotherapy, the treatment protocol we used appeared to produce higher hematologic and cytogenetic complete remission rates in patients with very poor cytogenetics, but response duration was short in this very poor risk population, highlighting the need for better post-induction strategies.

Alisertib, an aurora A kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in trials of myeloid malignancy, and this efficacy appears enhanced in combination with conventional chemotherapies. In this phase I, dose-escalation study, newly diagnosed patients received conventional induction with cytarabine and idarubicin, after which alisertib was administered for 7 days. Dose escalation occurred via cohorts. Patients could then receive up to four cycles of consolidation, incorporating alisertib, and thereafter alisertib maintenance for up to 12 months. Twenty-two patients were enrolled. One dose limiting toxicity occurred at dose level 2 (prolonged thrombocytopenia), and the recommended phase 2 dose was established at 30mg twice daily. Common therapy-related toxicities included cytopenias and mucositis. Only three (14%) patients had persistent disease at mid-cycle, requiring ""5+2"" reinduction. The composite remission rate (complete remission and complete remission with incomplete neutrophil recovery) was 86% (nineteen of twenty-two patients; 90% CI 68-96%). Among those over age 65 and those with high-risk disease (secondary acute leukemia or cytogenetically high-risk disease), the composite remission rate was 88% and 100%, respectively. The median follow up was 13.5 months.

However, ibrutinib also inhibits several other enzymes that contain cysteine residues homologous to Cys-481 in BTK. Patients with relapsed/refractory or previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demonstrate a high overall response rate to ibrutinib with prolonged survival. Acalabrutinib, a selective BTK inhibitor developed to minimize off-target activity, has shown promising overall response rates in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. A head-to-head comparison of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib in CLL cell cultures and healthy T cells is needed to understand preclinical biologic and molecular effects.Experimental Design: Using samples from patients with CLL, we compared the effects of both BTK inhibitors on biologic activity, chemokine production, cell migration, BTK phosphorylation, and downstream signaling in primary CLL lymphocytes and on normal T-cell signaling to determine the effects on other kinases.Results: Both BTK inhibitors induced modest cell death accompanied by cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. Production of CCL3 and CCL4 chemokines and pseudoemperipolesis were inhibited by both drugs to a similar degree. These drugs also showed similar inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of BTK and downstream S6 and ERK kinases. In contrast, off-target effects on SRC-family kinases were more pronounced with ibrutinib than acalabrutinib in healthy T lymphocytes.Conclusions: Both BTK inhibitors show similar biological and molecular profile in primary CLL cells but appear different on their effect on normal T cells.

The animal was treated with a combination of AZT and alpha interferon. Proviral load (PVL) was measured every week. Because the disease continued to progress, the animal was euthanized. Abnormal infiltrates of CD3(+)CD25(+) lymphocytes and Tax-positive cells were found by histological analyses in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. PVL was measured and clonal diversity was assessed by LM-PCR (Ligation-Mediated Polymerase Chain Reaction) and high throughput sequencing, in blood during treatment and in 14 different organs. The highest PVL was found in lymph nodes, spleen and lungs. One major clone and a number of intermediate abundance clones were present in blood throughout the course of treatment, and in organs. These results represent the first multi-organ clonality study in ATLL. We demonstrate a previously undescribed clonal complexity in ATLL.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients in this study were treated for non-metastatic breast cancer at the Curie institute, Paris, between 1981 and 2000. We calculated the cumulative incidence of second malignancies and the risk of developing each type of second malignancies over a period of 10 to 15 years. The observed crude incidence rates in the entire patient population were then compared to the expected incidence in the general population of French women, as provided by age-standardized data. A standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for all second malignancies. We also calculated second malignancies standardized incidence ratios for patients who underwent adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. RESULTS: The study cohort included a total of 17,745 women. The median follow-up since diagnosis was 13.4 years (range: 2-29 years). The 15-year cumulative incidence of second malignancies was 1.807 per 100,000 (CI 1.729-1.884). A total of 2370 second malignancies were observed during follow-up, 2010 in the radiotherapy arm and 360 in the no radiotherapy arm (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [1.03-1.28], P=0.0134). Crude incidence rates were significantly higher in our cohort than in the general population for contralateral breast cancer (SIR 2.96 [confidence interval (CI) 2.82-3.12], P<0.0001), sarcomas (SIR 8.48 [CI 6.41-11.22], P<0.0001), leukaemia (SIR 2.37 [CI 1.85-3.04], P<0.0001), lung cancer (SIR 1.39 [CI 1.13-1.72], P<0.0022) and gynaecological cancer (SIR 1.31 [CI 1.15-1.50], P=0.0001). Among patients treated for breast cancer, those who received radiotherapy was associated with an excess risk of sarcoma as compared to those have not had (RR 5.59 [CI 1.35-23.17], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Women treated for breast cancer had a significantly increased risk of several kinds of second malignancies compared to the general population.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Societe francaise de radiotherapie oncologique (SFRO).', 'Published by Elsevier SAS.

We aimed to determine the clinical and genetic landscape of those with IGH-CRLF2 or P2RY8-CRLF2 (CRLF2-r) using multiple genomic approaches. Clinical and demographic features of CRLF2-r patients were characteristic of B-ALL. Patients with IGH-CRLF2 were older (14 y vs. 4 y, P < .001), while the incidence of CRLF2-r among Down syndrome patients was high (50/161, 31%). CRLF2-r co-occurred with primary chromosomal rearrangements but the majority (111/161, 69%) had B-other ALL. Copy number alteration (CNA) profiles were similar to B-other ALL, although CRLF2-r patients harbored higher frequencies of IKZF1 (60/138, 43% vs. 77/1351, 24%) and BTG1 deletions (20/138, 15% vs. 3/1351, 1%). There were significant differences in CNA profiles between IGH-CRLF2 and P2RY8-CRLF2 patients: IKZF1 (25/35, 71% vs. 36/108, 33%, P < .001), BTG1 (11/35, 31% vs. 10/108, 9%, P =.004), and ADD3 deletions (9/19, 47% vs. 5/38, 13%, P =.008). A novel gene fusion, USP9X-DDX3X, was discovered in 10/54 (19%) of patients. Pathway analysis of the mutational profile revealed novel involvement for focal adhesion. Although the functional relevance of many of these abnormalities are unknown, they likely activate additional pathways, which may represent novel therapeutic targets.","['(c) 2017 The Authors Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer Published byWiley Periodicals,', 'Inc.']","['Russell, Lisa J', 'Jones, Lisa', 'Enshaei, Amir', 'Tonin, Stefano', 'Ryan, Sarra L', 'Eswaran, Jeyanthy', 'Nakjang, Sirintra', 'Papaemmanuil, Elli', 'Tubio, Jose M C', 'Fielding, Adele K', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Campbell, Peter J', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Russell LJ', 'Jones L', 'Enshaei A', 'Tonin S', 'Ryan SL', 'Eswaran J', 'Nakjang S', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Tubio JM', 'Fielding AK', 'Vora A', 'Campbell PJ', 'Moorman AV', 'Harrison CJ']","['Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Bioinformatics Support Unit, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Department of Epidemiology-Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, USA.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Research Department of Haemaoloty, UCL Cancer Institute, London, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, UK."", 'Cancer Genome Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170118,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/12/30 06:00,2017/07/22 06:00,['2016/12/30 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22439 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2017 May;56(5):363-372. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22439.

Further, the underlying germline genetics that contribute to SMN in these survivors are not known. METHODS: The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) database of patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2010 was analysed. SMN risk was accessed by cumulative incidence, standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk. A candidate gene-based association study evaluated genetic susceptibility to SMN in neuroblastoma survivors. RESULTS: Of the 5987 patients in the INRG database with SMN data enrolled in a clinical trial, 43 (0.72%) developed a SMN. The 10-year cumulative incidence of SMN for high-risk patients was 1.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.6%) compared with 0.38% (95% CI: 0.22-0.94%) for low-risk patients (P = 0.01). High-risk patients had an almost 18-fold higher incidence of SMN compared to age- and sex-matched controls (SIR = 17.5 (95% CI: 11.4-25.3), absolute excess risk = 27.6). For patients treated on high- and intermediate-risk clinical trials, the SIR of acute myelogenous leukaemia was 106.8 (95% CI: 28.7-273.4) and 127.7 (95%CI: 25.7-373.3), respectively. Variants implicating DNA repair genes XRCC3 (rs861539: P = 0.006; odds ratio: 2.04, 95%CI: 1.19-3.46) and MSH2 (rs17036651: P = 0.009; odds ratio: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.81) were associated with SMN. CONCLUSION: The intensive multi-modality treatment strategy currently used to treat high-risk neuroblastoma is associated with a significantly increased risk of secondary acute myelogenous leukaemia. Defining the interactions of treatment exposures and genetic factors that promote the development of SMN is critical for optimising survivorship care.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), decreased ADAMTS-13 had also been reported in patients with malignancy. However, the knowledge of expression and potential role of ADAMTS-13 in hematological malignancies is still limited. We measured and compared ADAMTS-13 levels in the plasma of 82 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and 34 healthy controls and found that AML patients possessed lower ADAMTS-13 than controls. AML patients with infections possessed lower level of ADAMTS-13 than patients without infections and ADAMTS-13 levels were negatively correlated with C-reactive protein(CRP), IL-6, TNFalpha and IL-1beta. Furthermore, high risk AML patients are with lower ADAMTS-13 than patients with low risk. ADAMTS-13 negatively correlated with ISTH scores and patients accompanying DIC possessed lower ADAMTS-13.Multivariate analyses proved that low level of ADAMTS-13 is an independent risk factor for AML outcome. To conclude, ADAMTS-13 levels are decreased in plasma of AML patients and the level of ADAMTS-13 is related to inflammation and infection of AML patients.

From April 2008 to December 2015, 31 patients with such presentation were retrospectively reviewed. The F-FDG uptake was semiquantified using SUVmax and BM to cerebellum (BM/C) ratio. The origin of super BMU was diagnosed by pathology. Some blood parameters, as well as fever, were also collected and analyzed. For comparison, 106 patients with mildly and moderately uptake in BM and 20 healthy subjects were selected as the control group.Bone marrow MI was diagnosed in 93.5% (29/31) patients with super BMU, which mostly originated from acute leukemia and highly aggressive lymphoma. The super BMU group had markedly higher F-FDG uptake in the BM than those of mildly and moderately uptake, and the control subjects (all P = 0.000) and the BM/C ratio reached a high of 1.24 +/- 0.36. The incidence of bone marrow MI in the super BMU group was markedly higher than that of mildly and moderately uptake (93.5% vs 36.8%, P = 0.000). Based on the receiver operating characteristic analysis, when cut-off values of BM/C and SUVmax were set at 0.835 and 6.560, the diagnostic specificity for bone marrow MI reached the high levels of 91.4% and 95.7%, respectively.

There are limited data regarding the impact of lnc-LAMC2-1:1 rs2147578 as well as CASC8 rs10505477 T>C polymorphisms on cancer development. Here we examined for the first time whether rs2147578 and rs10505477 polymorphisms are associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a total of 110 cases and 120 healthy controls. Genotyping was achieved by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The rs2147578 variant increased the risk of ALL in codominant (OR=4.33, 95%CI=2.00-9.37, p<0.0001, CG vs CC, and OR=5.81, 95%CI=2.30-14.69, p=0.0002, GG vs CC), dominant (OR=4.63, 95%CI=2.18-9.86, p<0.0001, CG+GG vs CC), overdominant (OR=1.74, 95%CI=1.02-2.97, p=0.0444, CG vs CC+GG) and allele (OR=1.91, 95%CI=1.32-2.77, p=0.0008, G vs C) inheritance models tested. No significant association was found between the CASC8 rs10505477 T>C variant and risk of childhood ALL. In conclusion, the present study revealed that the lnc-LAMC2-1:1 rs2147578 polymorphism may be a risk factor for developing childhood ALL.

Therefore, inhibition of Nrf2 activity may be a promising target in leukemia therapy. Here, we used an antioxidant response element-luciferase reporter system to identify a novel pyrazolyl hydroxamic acid derivative, 1-(4-(tert-Butyl)benzyl)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N-hydroxy-1H pyrazole-5-carboxamide (4f), that inhibited Nrf2 activity. 4f had a profound growth-inhibitory effect on three AML cell lines, THP-1, HL-60 and U937, and a similar anti-growth effect in a chick embryo model. Moreover, flow cytometry of AML cells revealed increased apoptosis with 4f (10 muM) treatment for 48 h. The protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase were enhanced in all three AML cell types. Furthermore, Nrf2 protein level was downregulated by 4f. Upregulation of Nrf2 by tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) or Nrf2 overexpression could ameliorate 4f-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Treatment with 4f reduced both B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expression and Bcl-2/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) ratio, which indicated that 4f induced apoptosis, at least in part, via mitochondrial-dependent signaling. Therefore, as an Nrf2 inhibitor, the pyrazolyl hydroxamic acid derivative 4f may be a promising agent in AML therapy.",,"['Zhang, JinFeng', 'Su, Le', 'Ye, Qing', 'Zhang, ShangLi', 'Kung, HsiangFu', 'Jiang, Fan', 'Jiang, GuoSheng', 'Miao, JunYing', 'Zhao, BaoXiang']","['Zhang J', 'Su L', 'Ye Q', 'Zhang S', 'Kung H', 'Jiang F', 'Jiang G', 'Miao J', 'Zhao B']","['Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Cells and Developmental Biology, School of Life Science, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.', 'School of Municipal and Environmental Engineering, Shandong Jianzhu University, Jinan 250101, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Cells and Developmental Biology, School of Life Science, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Health, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Cells and Developmental Biology, School of Life Science, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Cells and Developmental Biology, School of Life Science, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.', 'Institute of Pathology and Southwest Cancer Center, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400038, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Health, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.', 'Key Medical Laboratory for Tumor Immunology and Traditional Chinese Medicine Immunology, Key Laboratory for Rare and Uncommon Diseases of Shandong, Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan 250062, China.', 'Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Cells and Developmental Biology, School of Life Science, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Remodeling and Function Research, Chinese Ministry of Education and Chinese Ministry of Health, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Chick Embryo', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Discovery', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'U937 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'Nrf2 inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'pyrazolyl hydroxamic acid derivatives']",2016/12/30 06:00,2018/03/03 06:00,['2016/12/30 06:00'],"['2016/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['13825 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.13825 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 31;8(5):7625-7636. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13825.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Pyrazoles)']",,,,PMC5352348,,,,,,,,,

It is also detected in 2% to 5% of children with ALL. Historically, patients with Ph-positive ALL carried a dismal prognosis, with poor response to most chemotherapy combinations, short remission durations, and long-term disease-free survival rates of 10% to 20%. The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized therapy of Ph-positive ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective and descriptive single center study was carried out based on data retrieved of 508 patients treated for ALL from 2007 to 2014. Of these thirty patients were Ph-positive ALL and were available for analysis, and these patients were included in the study. Ph-positive ALL was defined as ALL carrying the t(9;22) translocation on standard karyotype and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis and/or positivity for BCR-ABL fusion transcript detection by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis. Patients were treated with combination chemotherapy and oral TKIs and responses were classified as either CR defined by the absence of circulating blasts and <5% marrow blasts on a bone marrow examination done at the end of induction chemotherapy or failure, including persistent disease and early death. RESULTS: There were 30 (5.9%) cases of Ph-positive ALL out of a total of 508 cases of ALL with a median age of 27.5 years (range: 7-55). The choice of first line TKI was Imatinib in 25 (83.3 %) patients and Dasatinib in 1 (3.3 %) patient. Fourteen patients (46.6 %) had a CR, 3 (10 %) had a partial response (PR), 8 (26.6 %) had persistence of disease at the end of induction chemotherapy. The overall survival in those who received sequential chemotherapy followed by TKI (n = 4) was 28.5 months (95% CI 10.78 to 46.21 months) compared with 13.98 months (95% CI 6.04 to 21.97 months) for patients who received concurrent chemotherapy and TKI (n = 20); log rank (Mantel Cox) X(2) = 8.33, P = 0.040), however limited sample precluded meaningful subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: The results of our study showed that we still have a long way to go to match outcomes of western published series, even when the same treatment protocol is used, probably due to the underutilization of Allogeneic SCT as an option in first CR.",,"['Danthala, Madhav', 'Gundeti, Sadashivudu', 'Maddali, Laxmi Srinivas', 'Pillai, Ashok', 'Puligundla, Krishna Chaitanya', 'Adusumilli, Raja Praveen']","['Danthala M', 'Gundeti S', 'Maddali LS', 'Pillai A', 'Puligundla KC', 'Adusumilli RP']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India."", ""Department of Medical Oncology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,India,South Asian J Cancer,South Asian journal of cancer,101618774,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'chemotherapy', 'overall survival']",2016/12/30 06:00,2016/12/30 06:01,['2016/12/30 06:00'],"['2016/12/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2278-330X.195336 [doi]', 'SAJC-5-176 [pii]']",ppublish,South Asian J Cancer. 2016 Oct-Dec;5(4):176-178. doi: 10.4103/2278-330X.195336.,,,,,,PMC5184751,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,

METHODS: This study targeted 100 pediatric leukemia survivors, who visited the Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Center in South Korea from Aug to Dec 2011. A structured questionnaire of ego-resilience, family function and quality of life used to collect data through direct interview with the pediatric patients and their parents. The correlation between the study variables analyzed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient, and the impact on quality of life analyzed using a stepwise multiple regression. RESULTS: Ego-resilience (r = 0.69, P<0.001) and family function (r =0.46, P< 0.001) had a positive correlation with quality of life and all the sub-categories of quality of life.

A subset of FL cases transform into more aggressive malignancies, most often to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL); in addition, lymphoblastic lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have also been rarely reported. The most common cytogenetic abnormalities associated with FL are translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21) with BCL2 rearrangements, present in 80-90% of all FL. However, that translocation alone is insufficient to cause FL and additional genomic events specifically leading to this kind of disease are still to be determined. The most frequently reported secondary changes are gains of chromosomes 7p or 7q, Xp, 12q and 18q, as well as losses on 6q and mutations within BCL2 and/or BCL6 genes. The presence of additional genomic aberrations, in particular 17p and 6q deletions is more frequent in grade 2 and 3 FL patients and correlated with shorter survival and a higher rate of transformation into DLBCL. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe here, an adult FL grade 2 patient that had transformed to B-ALL at diagnosis. Banding cytogenetics, refined by multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization including array-proven multicolor banding revealed a unique complex karyotype involving eleven chromosomes, translocation t(X;20)(p21.3;q11.2), translocation t(3;20)(q26.2;q12), and a dicentric dic(17;18). Interestingly, the dicentric chromosome led to monosomy of the tumor suppressor gene TP53. The case had an immunophenotype consistent with follicular center cell lymphoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, a comparable adult FL grade 2 case that transformed to B-ALL associated with such a complex karyotype and loss of TP53 was not previously reported. Most of complex aberrations were found simultaneously in approximately 85% of studied malignant cells and the remained cells studied were non-clonal; mechanisms explaining this may be either multiple-step mechanisms or single step in sense of chromothripsis.

Moreover, inhibition of Mek1/2 by trametinib alone is sufficient to suppress leukemia induced by both CSF3R proximal and ruxolitinib-resistant compound mutations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To define the pathogenic molecular features associated with del(5q), next-generation sequencing was applied to 133 patients with myeloid neoplasms (MDS; N = 69, MDS/MPN; N = 5, sAML; N = 29, pAML; N = 30) with del(5q) as a sole abnormally or a part of complex karyotype and results were compared to molecular features of patients diploid for chr5. FINDINGS: A number of 5q genes with haploinsufficient expression and/or recurrent somatic mutations were identified; for these genes, CSNK1A1 and G3BP1 within the commonly deleted 5q region and DDX41 within a commonly retained region were most commonly affected by somatic mutations. These genes showed consistent haploinsufficiency in deleted cases; low expression/mutations of G3BP1 or DDX41 were associated with poor survival, likely due to decreased cellular function.

In this report, we show that tumor-initiating cells (TICs), represented by spheres derived from the MCF7 cell line, exhibit higher intracellular labile iron pool, mitochondrial iron accumulation and are more susceptible to iron chelation. TICs also show activation of the IRP/IRE system, leading to higher iron uptake and decrease in iron storage, suggesting that level of properly assembled cytosolic iron-sulfur clusters (FeS) is reduced. This finding is confirmed by lower enzymatic activity of aconitase and FeS cluster biogenesis enzymes, as well as lower levels of reduced glutathione, implying reduced FeS clusters synthesis/utilization in TICs. Importantly, we have identified specific gene signature related to iron metabolism consisting of genes regulating iron uptake, mitochondrial FeS cluster biogenesis and hypoxic response (ABCB10, ACO1, CYBRD1, EPAS1, GLRX5, HEPH, HFE, IREB2, QSOX1 and TFRC). Principal component analysis based on this signature is able to distinguish TICs from cancer cells in vitro and also Leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) from non-LICs in the mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Majority of the described changes were also recapitulated in an alternative model represented by MCF7 cells resistant to tamoxifen (TAMR) that exhibit features of TICs.

Stem cell gene signatures predict poor prognosis in AML patients; however, with few exceptions, these deregulated molecular pathways cannot be targeted therapeutically. In this study, we demonstrate that the TNF superfamily ligand-receptor pair CD70/CD27 is expressed on AML blasts and AML stem/progenitor cells. CD70/CD27 signaling in AML cells activates stem cell gene expression programs, including the Wnt pathway, and promotes symmetric cell divisions and proliferation. Soluble CD27, reflecting the extent of CD70/CD27 interactions in vivo, was significantly elevated in the sera of newly diagnosed AML patients and is a strong independent negative prognostic biomarker for overall survival. Blocking the CD70/CD27 interaction by mAb induced asymmetric cell divisions and differentiation in AML blasts and AML stem/progenitor cells, inhibited cell growth and colony formation, and significantly prolonged survival in murine AML xenografts. Importantly, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from healthy BM donors express neither CD70 nor CD27 and were unaffected by blocking mAb treatment.

Nonspecific inactivation of gammaretroviruses by serum factors appears insufficient to explain these observations. To investigate further, we explored the susceptibilities of primary and established human cell lines to FeLV-B, the most likely zoonotic variant. Fully permissive infection was common in cancer-derived cell lines but was also a feature of nontransformed keratinocytes and lung fibroblasts. Cells of hematopoietic origin were generally less permissive and formed discrete groups on the basis of high or low intracellular protein expression and virion release. Potent repression was observed in primary human blood mononuclear cells and a subset of leukemia cell lines. However, the early steps of reverse transcription and integration appear to be unimpaired in nonpermissive cells. FeLV-B was subject to G-->A hypermutation with a predominant APOBEC3G signature in partially permissive cells but was not mutated in permissive cells or in nonpermissive cells that block secondary viral spread. Distinct cellular barriers that protect primary human blood cells are likely to be important in protection against zoonotic infection with FeLV.IMPORTANCE Domestic exposure to gammaretroviruses such as feline leukemia viruses (FeLVs) occurs worldwide, but the basis of human resistance to infection remains incompletely understood. The potential threat is evident from the human genome sequence, which reveals many past epidemics of gammaretrovirus infection, and from recent cross-species jumps of gammaretroviruses from rodents to primates and marsupials. This study examined resistance to infection at the cellular level with the most prevalent human cell-tropic FeLV variant, FeLV-B. We found that blood cells are uniquely resistant to infection with FeLV-B due to the activity of cellular enzymes that mutate the viral genome. A second block, which appears to suppress viral gene expression after the viral genome has integrated into the host cell genome, was identified. Since cells derived from other normal human cell types are fully supportive of FeLV replication, innate resistance of blood cells could be critical in protecting against cross-species infection.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Terry et al.'],"['Terry, Anne', 'Kilbey, Anna', 'Naseer, Asif', 'Levy, Laura S', 'Ahmad, Shamim', 'Watts, Ciorsdaidh', 'Mackay, Nancy', 'Cameron, Ewan', 'Wilson, Sam', 'Neil, James C']","['Terry A', 'Kilbey A', 'Naseer A', 'Levy LS', 'Ahmad S', 'Watts C', 'Mackay N', 'Cameron E', 'Wilson S', 'Neil JC']","['MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'MRC University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom James.Neil@glasgow.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20170214,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cats', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome, Viral', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Tropism', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Replication', 'Zoonoses/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*APOBEC', '*feline leukemia virus', '*restriction factors', '*zoonosis']",2016/12/30 06:00,2017/05/30 06:00,['2016/12/30 06:00'],"['2016/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02119-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02119-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Feb 14;91(5). pii: JVI.02119-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02119-16.

Precursor BCR (pre-BCR) signaling, which is critical during normal B lymphopoiesis, also plays an important role in pre-BCR(+) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Here, we investigated the activity and mechanism of action of the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in preclinical models of B-ALL. Pre-BCR(+) ALL cells were exquisitely sensitive to ibrutinib at therapeutically relevant drug concentrations. In pre-BCR(+) ALL, ibrutinib thwarted autonomous and induced pre-BCR signaling, resulting in deactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling. Ibrutinib modulated the expression of pre-BCR regulators (PTPN6, CD22, CD72, and PKCbeta) and substantially reduced BCL6 levels. Ibrutinib inhibited ALL cell migration toward CXCL12 and beneath marrow stromal cells and reduced CD44 expression. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing revealed that both BTK and B lymphocyte kinase (BLK) are relevant targets of ibrutinib in pre-BCR(+) ALL.

However, the majority of CML patients treated with imatinib develop resistance with prolonged therapy. Dendrophthoe pentandra (L.) Miq. is a Malaysian mistletoe species that has been used as a traditional treatment for several ailments such as smallpox, ulcers, and cancers. Methods: We developed a resistant cell line (designated as K562R) by long-term co-culture of a BCR/ ABL positive CML cell line, K562, with imatinib mesylate. We then investigated the anti-proliferative effects of D. pentandra methanol extract on parental K562 and resistant K562R cells. Trypan blue exclusion assays were performed to determine the IC50 concentration; apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were conducted by flow cytometry. Results: D. pentandra extract had greater anti-proliferative effects towards K562R (IC50= 192 mug/mL) compared to K562 (500 mug/ mL) cells. Upon treatment with D. pentandra extract at the IC50. concentration: K562 but not K562R demonstrated increase in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACIs) are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of AML. HDACIs have limited single-agent clinical activities, but when combined with conventional or investigational drugs they have demonstrated favorable outcomes. Previous studies have shown that decreasing expression of important DNA damage repair proteins enhances standard chemotherapy drugs. In our recent studies, the pan-HDACI panobinostat has been shown to enhance conventional chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin in AML cells by decreasing the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51. In this study, we utilized class- and isoform-specific HDACIs and shRNA knockdown of individual HDACs to determine which HDACs are responsible for decreased expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51 following pan-HDACI treatment in AML cells. We found that inhibition of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 was necessary to decrease the expression of BRCA1, CHK1, and RAD51, enhance cytarabine- or daunorubicin-induced DNA damage and apoptosis, and abrogate cytarabine- or daunorubicin-induced cell cycle checkpoint activation in AML cells.

BTB and CNC Homology 1 Basic Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor 2 (BACH2) is a suppressor of transcription. The BACH2-BCL6 balance controls selection at the pre-B cell receptor checkpoint by regulating p53 expression. However, the underlying mechanism and the clinical relevance of the BCL6/BACH2 axis are unknown. Here, we found that Ikaros, a tumor suppressor encoded by IKZF1, directly binds to both the BCL6 and BACH2 promoters where it suppresses BCL6 and promotes BACH2 expression in B-cell ALL (B-ALL) cells. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibitors increase Ikaros function thereby inhibiting BCL6 and promoting BACH2 expression in an Ikaros-dependent manner. We also found that the expression of BCL6 is higher while BACH2 expression is lower in patients with B-ALL than normal bone marrow control. High BCL6 and low BACH2 expression is associated with high leukemic cell proliferation, unfavorable clinical and laboratory features, and inferior outcomes. Moreover, IKZF1 deletion is associated with high BCL6 and low BACH2 expression in B-ALL patients. CK2 inhibitors increase Ikaros binding to the promoter of BCL6 and BACH2 and suppress BCL6 while promoting BACH2 expression in the primary B-ALL cells. Our data indicates that Ikaros regulates expression of the BCL6/BACH2 axis in B-ALL.

The aim of this study was to develop a limited sampling strategy (LSS) suitable for the prediction of exposure to VP-16 defined as area under time-concentration curve (AUC). METHODS: The study included 28 pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who were administered a 4-hour infusion of 60 mg/kg VP-16. VP-16 concentrations were determined in samples collected 4-124 hours after the beginning of infusion. On obtaining the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, a population PK model was developed in NONMEM (ICON Development Solutions, Hanover, MD) with first-order conditional estimation with interaction algorithm. LSSs were chosen by means of a multivariate regression analysis and cross-validated with a leave-one-out approach. Predictive performance of LSSs was assessed by calculating relative prediction error (PE), mean PE, mean absolute PE, and root mean squared PE for model-predicted and observed AUC. RESULTS: VP-16 PKs was best described by a 2-compartment first-order model, and a large variability in the PK parameters was observed. A 3-sample strategy allowed the estimation of VP-16 with highest accuracy and precision (mean relative PE = 0.18%, 95% confidence interval, 1.73%-2.09%; mean absolute relative PE = 3.47%, 95% confidence interval, 2.28%-4.66%; root mean squared PE = 4.43%). The final equation was AUC = 6.85 x C6 h + 3.88 x C12 h + 46.11 x C28 h + 282.0 (adjusted R = 0.9540). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, developed LSS allows accurate and precise estimation of VP-16 AUC and might be useful for therapeutic drug monitoring.",,"['Danielak, Dorota', 'Sobiak, Joanna', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Glowka, Franciszek', 'Chrzanowska, Maria']","['Danielak D', 'Sobiak J', 'Wachowiak J', 'Glowka F', 'Chrzanowska M']","['Departments of *Physical Pharmacy and Pharmacokinetics and daggerPediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infusions, Intravenous/methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Specimen Handling/methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",,,2016/12/29 06:00,2017/12/01 06:00,['2016/12/29 06:00'],"['2016/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FTD.0000000000000368 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2017 Apr;39(2):138-144. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000368.,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, recent advances in the field have highlighted the importance of optimizing known efficacious agents by improving drug delivery or bypassing resistance mechanisms. The current status of novel agents which are shaping the clinical management of AML patients are summarized in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Practice changing findings over the past year include improved overall survival (OS) in a molecularly defined AML subgroup as well as in elderly patients with secondary AML (sAML). Specifically, synergistic combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine (i.e., CPX-351) was found to improve OS in sAML patients. Furthermore, although multiple mutation specific inhibitors have been developed, optimal combination with additional agents appears critical, as monotherapies have not resulted in durable remissions or improved outcomes. Improved OS via the addition of midostaurin to intensive chemotherapy in FLT3 mutant AML supports this concept. SUMMARY: For the first time in AML, personalized therapy has become possible through improved understanding of the molecular architecture and survival pathways of an individual's disease. The landscape of AML treatment is encouraging, with multiple novel agents likely to gain approval over the next 5 years.",,"['Sallman, David A', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E']","['Sallman DA', 'Lancet JE']","['Malignant Hematology Department, H.

Traditional challenges are, however, that (13)C-detected NMR is insensitive despite its high resolution, and that MS-based techniques cannot easily differentiate positional isotopomers. In addition, current (13)C NMR or LC/GC-MS has limitations in detecting metabolites in living cells. Here, we describe a non-uniform sampling-based 2D heteronuclear single quantum coherence (NUS HSQC) approach to measure metabolic isotopomers in both cell lysates and living cells. The method provides a high resolution that can resolve multiplet structures in the (13)C dimension while retaining the sensitivity of the (1)H-indirect detection. The approach was tested in L1210 mouse leukemia cells labeled with (13)C acetate by measuring NUS HSQC with 25% sampling density. The results gave a variety of metabolic information such as (1) higher usage of acetate in acetylation pathway than aspartate synthesis, (2) TCA cycle efficiency changes upon the inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by pharmacological agents, and (3) position-dependent isotopomer patterns in fatty acids in living cells. In addition, we were able to detect fatty acids along with other hydrophilic molecules in one sample of live cells without extraction. Overall, the high sensitivity and resolution along with the application to live cells should make the NUS HSQC approach attractive in studying carbon flux information in metabolic studies.",,"['Lee, Sujin', 'Wen, He', 'An, Yong Jin', 'Cha, Jin Wook', 'Ko, Yoon-Joo', 'Hyberts, Sven G', 'Park, Sunghyouk']","['Lee S', 'Wen H', 'An YJ', 'Cha JW', 'Ko YJ', 'Hyberts SG', 'Park S']","['Natural Product Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University , Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea.', 'Natural Product Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University , Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University , Shenzhen 518060, China.', 'Natural Product Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University , Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea.', 'Natural Product Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University , Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea.', 'Natural Constituents Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) , Gangneung 25451, Korea.', 'National Center for Inter-University Research Facilities (NCIRF), Seoul National University , Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School , Boston, Massachusetts 02115, United States.', 'Natural Product Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University , Sillim-dong, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 151-742, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161227,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Acetates/analysis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carbon Isotopes/analysis/*metabolism', 'Carbon-13 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Leukemia/metabolism', '*Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Metabolomics/*methods', 'Mice', 'Specimen Handling/methods']",,,2016/12/29 06:00,2019/01/12 06:00,['2016/12/29 06:00'],"['2016/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02107 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2017 Jan 17;89(2):1078-1085. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b02107.

In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the activity of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK-3beta) has been associated with changes in the transcriptional activity and expression of nuclear factor kappa beta (NFKB) in the mononuclear cells of bone marrow. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the possible role of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) and nuclear factor kappa beta (NFKB) as prognostic variables in pediatric patients with ALL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a descriptive, transversal, and observational study. Bone marrow and blood samples were obtained from 30 children with newly-diagnosed ALL, who were seen at the Hematology-Oncology Service, Hospital para el Nino (HPN), Toluca, Mexico, from 20142015. Anthropometric variables, clinical lab results, immunophenotype and cytogenetic abnormalities were registered. GSK-3beta was evaluated through immunohistochemistry, and NFKB messenger RNA (mRNA) with real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The cases of ALL were classified into two groups of risk: high and habitual. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 7.1 years (range 213 years). Twenty-one were male and 9 female. Employing the morphological classification, 26 patients had type L1 ALL and the remaining 4 patients had type L2 ALL. Abnormal genes were found in 7 (23.33%) patients, ETV-RUNX1 in 3, followed by TCF3-PBX1 (two), STL1-TAL1 (one), and BCR-ABL1 (one). NFKB relative expression levels, in comparison to the GSK-3beta immunohistochemistry results of the bone marrow samples, showed significant differences between positive and negative cases (p = 0.001) and between weak-positive and negative cases (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that GSK-3beta may be a prognostic biomarker in childhood ALL.",,"['Tovar, Cristian Fabian Layton', 'Zeron, Hugo Mendieta', 'Romero, Maria Del Socorro Camarillo', 'Sanchez, Yanko V Fabila', 'Romero, Isidoro Tejocote']","['Tovar CF', 'Zeron HM', 'Romero MD', 'Sanchez YV', 'Romero IT']","['School of Medicine, Autonomous University of the State of Mexico, Toluca, Mexico.', 'Latin American Scientific Association and Cipres Medical Group, Toluca, Mexico.', 'Medical Sciences Research Center, Autonomous University of the State of Mexico, Toluca, Mexico.', 'Terranova University, Toluca, Mexico.', ""Hematology and Oncology Service, The Children's Hospital, Maternal Child of the State of Mexico Institute, Toluca, Mexico.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*GSK-3beta', '*NFKB', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*prognostic']",2016/12/29 06:00,2017/06/02 06:00,['2016/12/29 06:00'],"['2015/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17219/acem/63752 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2016 Nov-Dec;25(6):1139-1147. doi: 10.17219/acem/63752.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study used the mouse leukemia cell lines L615 and L1210 that were induced by murine leukemia virus and transfected with hCD4/CCR5 loaded-lentiviral vector. Lentiviral vectors containing the genes hCD4/CCR5 under the transcriptional control of cytomegalovirus promoter were designed. Transfection efficiencies of human CD4 and CCR5 in L615 and L1210 cells were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assay. Results showed that hCD4 and CCR5 proteins were expressed on the cell surface, demonstrating that the L615 and L1210 cells were humanized and that they possess the characteristics necessary for HIV infection of human host cells. Moreover, the sensitivity of human CD4/CCR5 transgenic mouse cells to HIV infection was confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA.

CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 73-year-old female with a previous medical history of AML in remission for 3 years who presented with symptoms of low back pain and right lower extremity radiculopathy. A magnetic resonance scan showed an extradural, foraminal lesion centered at the L2 level involving the right L2 nerve root. In view of the history of AML, this lesion was potentially considered MS, a form of AML relapse. Surgery consisting of a right L1 and L2 hemilaminectomy facilitated gross total resection of the purely extradural lesion the proved histologically to be a cavernoma. CONCLUSION: In patients with a history of leukemia, MS must be considered in the differential diagnosis for any epidural or nerve root lesion that appears following treatment.

One approach involves administration of soluble bispecific (or dual-affinity) antibody-based constructs that temporarily bridge T cells and cancer cells. Another approach infuses ex vivo-engineered T cells that express a surface plasma membrane-inserted antibody construct called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Both bispecific antibodies and CARs circumvent natural target cell recognition by creating a physical connection between cytotoxic T cells and target cancer cells to activate a cytolysis signaling pathway; this connection allows essentially all cytotoxic T cells in a patient to be engaged because typical tumor cell resistance mechanisms (such as T-cell receptor specificity, antigen processing and presentation, and major histocompatibility complex context) are bypassed. Both the bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody construct blinatumomab and CD19-CARs are immunotherapies that have yielded encouraging remission rates in CD19-positive r/r ALL, suggesting that they might serve as definitive treatments or bridging therapies to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. With the introduction of these immunotherapies, new challenges arise related to unique toxicities and distinctive pathways of resistance. An increasing body of knowledge is being accumulated on how to predict, prevent, and manage such toxicities, which will help to better stratify patient risk and tailor treatments to minimize severe adverse events.

TAL1 is normally expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) but is silenced in immature thymocytes. We hypothesize that TAL1 contributes to leukemogenesis by activating genes that are normally repressed in immature thymocytes. Herein, we identified a novel TAL1-regulated super-enhancer controlling the GIMAP locus, which resides within an insulated chromosomal locus in T-ALL cells. The GIMAP genes are expressed in HSCs and mature T cells but are downregulated during the immature stage of thymocyte differentiation. The GIMAP enhancer is activated by TAL1, RUNX1 and GATA3 in human T-ALL cells but is repressed by E-proteins. Overexpression of human GIMAP genes in immature thymocytes alone does not induce tumorigenesis but accelerates leukemia development in zebrafish.

Cytogenetic findings of a neoplasm play an important role in stratifying patients into different risk groups and thus predict the response to treatment and overall survival. CASE REPORT: A 59-year-old man was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Following this, he underwent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) based chemotherapy and achieved remission. Four years later, the disease relapsed and he was given idarubicin, mitoxantrone and ATRA followed by maintenance chemotherapy (ATRA, mercaptopurine and methotrexate). He achieved a second remission for the next 11 years. During a follow-up later, his full blood picture showed leucocytosis, anaemia and leucoerythroblastic picture. Bone marrow examination showed hypercellular marrow with trilineage dysplasia, 3% blasts but no abnormal promyelocyte. Fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) study of the PML/RARA gene was negative. Karyotyping result revealed complex abnormalities and monosomal karyotype (MK). A diagnosis of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm with unfavourable karyotypes and MK was made. The disease progressed rapidly and transformed into therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia in less than four months, complicated with severe pneumonia. Despite aggressive treatment with antibiotics and chemotherapy, the patient succumbed to the illness two weeks after the diagnosis. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of t-MN should be suspected in patients with a history of receiving cytotoxic agents. Karyotyping analysis is crucial for risk stratification as MK in addition to complex aberrant karyotypes predicts unfavourable outcome. Further studies are required to address the optimal management for patients with t-MN.",,"['Tang, Y L', 'Chia, W K', 'Yap, E C S W', 'Julia, M I', 'Leong, C F', 'Salwati, S', 'Wong, C L']","['Tang YL', 'Chia WK', 'Yap EC', 'Julia MI', 'Leong CF', 'Salwati S', 'Wong CL']","['Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Jalan Yaacob Latif, Bandar Tun Razak, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. tangyl@ppukm.ukm.edu.my.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,,Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,2016/12/29 06:00,2017/06/20 06:00,['2016/12/29 06:00'],"['2016/12/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/20 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2016 Dec;38(3):315-319.,,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We describe a unique case of monozygotic twins with simultaneous TAM from a triplet pregnancy at 34 weeks' gestation. Previously reported cases of TAM and DS-AMKL in monozygotic twins have been reviewed to compare with our cases. The current concept of a sequential multistep process in leukemogenesis and disease evolution of TAM into DS-AMKL through the collaboration among trisomy 21, GATA1, and other gene mutations is also reviewed. RESULTS: Distinct GATA1 mutations are identified in our neonate twins with TAM from a triplet pregnancy, whereas precisely identical GATA1 mutations have been detected in all three monozygotic DS twins reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: Identical GATA1 mutations in cases of monozygotic twins are likely derived from twin-twin transmission. Distinct GATA1 mutations identified in our neonate twins with TAM provide unequivocal evidence of independent intra-utero GATA1 mutations, a completely different mechanism of development of TAM in monozygotic twins from previously reported cases. Interaction of trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutation produces TAM, but additional gene mutations are required for TAM to transform into DS-AMKL.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016.

The family of diseases generated by dysregulated fusion tyrosine kinase (TK) genes is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) category, ""Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1, or with PCM1-JAK2"" In addition to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), these patients can present with myelodysplastic syndrome/MPN, as well as de novo or secondary mixed-phenotype leukemias or lymphomas. Eosinophilia is a common, but not invariable, feature of these diseases. The natural history of PDGFRA- and PDGFRB-rearranged neoplasms has been dramatically altered by imatinib. In contrast, patients with FGFR1 and JAK2 fusion TK genes exhibit a more aggressive course and variable sensitivity to current TK inhibitors, and in most cases, long-term disease-free survival may only be achievable with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Similar poor prognosis outcomes may be observed with rearrangements of FLT3 or ABL1 (eg, both of which commonly partner with ETV6), and further investigation is needed to validate their inclusion in the current WHO-defined group of eosinophilia-associated TK fusion-driven neoplasms. The diagnosis chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS) is assigned to patients with MPN with eosinophilia and nonspecific cytogenetic/molecular abnormalities and/or increased myeloblasts. Myeloid mutation panels have identified somatic variants in patients with a provisional diagnosis of hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance, reclassifying some of these cases as eosinophilia-associated neoplasms.

The MPN-restricted driver mutations, including those in JAK2, calreticulin (CALR), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus (MPL), abnormally activate the cytokine receptor/JAK2 pathway and their downstream effectors, more particularly the STATs. The most frequent mutation, JAK2V617F, activates the 3 main myeloid cytokine receptors (erythropoietin receptor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, and MPL) whereas CALR or MPL mutants are restricted to MPL activation. This explains why JAK2V617F is associated with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) whereas CALR and MPL mutants are found in ET and PMF. Other mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation, splicing, and signaling cooperate with the 3 MPN drivers and play a key role in the PMF pathogenesis. Mutations in epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A are involved in disease initiation and may precede the acquisition of JAK2V617F. Other mutations in epigenetic regulators such as EZH2 and ASXL1 also play a role in disease initiation and disease progression. Mutations in the splicing machinery are predominantly found in PMF and are implicated in the development of anemia or pancytopenia. Both heterogeneity of classical MPNs and prognosis are determined by a specific genomic landscape, that is, type of MPN driver mutations, association with other mutations, and their order of acquisition. However, factors other than somatic mutations play an important role in disease initiation as well as disease progression such as germ line predisposition, inflammation, and aging.

These mutations activate the receptor, leading to the proliferation of neutrophils that are a hallmark of CNL. Recently, the World Health Organization guidelines have been updated to include CSF3R mutations as part of the diagnostic criteria for CNL. Because of the high prevalence of CSF3R mutations in CNL, it is tempting to think of this disease as being solely driven by this genetic lesion. However, recent additional genomic characterization demonstrates that CNL has much in common with other chronic myeloid malignancies at the genetic level, such as the clinically related diagnosis atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. These commonalities include mutations in SETBP1, spliceosome proteins (SRSF2, U2AF1), and epigenetic modifiers (TET2, ASXL1). Some of these same mutations also have been characterized as frequent events in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, suggesting a more complex disease evolution than was previously understood and raising the possibility that an age-related clonal process of preleukemic cells could precede the development of CNL. The order of acquisition of CSF3R mutations relative to mutations in SETBP1, epigenetic modifiers, or the spliceosome has been determined only in isolated case reports; thus, further work is needed to understand the impact of mutation chronology on the clonal evolution and progression of CNL.

Although their clinical significance is still debated, they may play an important role in the pathogenesis of several hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Herein, we offer a comprehensive review on ASXL1 mutations, and link them with survival and clinical outcomes in patients with various myeloid neoplasms. Most relevant publications were identified through searching the PubMed/Medline database for articles published from inception to February 2016. FINDINGS: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), ASXL1 mutations tend to correlate with older age and male gender, and affect predominantly patients with secondary AML. De novo AML patients with ASXL1 mutations had significantly lower complete remission rates after standard high-dose chemotherapy and shorter survival. In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and low- or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, frameshift and nonsense mutations correlated with shorter survival and a higher risk of leukemic transformation. Overall survival was also shorter in primary myelofibrosis in the presence of ASXL1 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Further research on the role of ASXL1 mutations and therapeutic implications in neoplastic myeloid disorders is stringently needed.

Before sperm production, there are no sperm available for cryopreservation. Thus, it is necessary to identify a solution to ameliorate the busulfan-induced damage of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrated that melatonin relieved the previously described SSC loss and apoptosis in mouse testes. Melatonin increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), which regulated the production of busulfan-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Moreover, melatonin promoted sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1) expression. SIRT1 participated in the deacetylation of p53, which promotes p53 ubiquitin degradation. Decreased concentrations of deacetylated p53 resulted in spermatogonial cell resistance to apoptosis. Acute T cell leukemia cell assay demonstrated that melatonin does not affect busulfan-induced cancer cell apoptosis and ROS. INNOVATION: The current evidence suggests that melatonin may alleviate the side effects of alkylating drugs, such as busulfan. CONCLUSION: Melatonin promoted MnSOD and SIRT1 expression, which successfully ameliorated busulfan-induced SSC apoptosis caused by high concentrations of ROS and p53. Antioxid.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results of clinical and hematological survey of 1465 children living in Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv regions for the period from 2008 to 2014 were presented. There were 777 children with anemia, 466 with changes in hemogram, 191 with acute leukemia. The irradiation doses, correlation of integrated pollution degree of territories with hematopoietic parameters and course hematologic diseases were estimated. Metal con tent in hair, nails, and blood was determined in 121 children. RESULTS: We have found the most common cause of anemia in children and peculiarities of acute leukemia depend ing on the area integrated contamination. Number of children living in contaminated areas with pro B ALL and T ALL having an initial leukocytosis and unfavorable course of the disease was higher compared to the number of patients from moderately polluted regions (r = 0.47). There is a direct correlation between percentage of children with monocytosis and degree of territory contamination: the 20.2 % of such children lived in the intensively polluted areas and 10,3 % in moderately contaminated ones (p < 0.05). Content of Pb, Cu, Cr, Mn, Zn in biological tissues did not exceed the permissible MAC. Level of Zn in all children was at the lower normal threshold. Individual levels of metals in hair, nails and blood did not depend on gender of patients and their radiation doses. Criteria of increased risk of hematologic diseases in children living in ecologically unfavorable regions were grounded. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation and non radiation environmental factors influencing the development of changes in hematopoiesis and characteristics of the blood system diseases in children play a role in leukeima development processes. These findings are the basis for a further research in the field of radiobiology and ecology.","['V. G. Bebeshko, K. M. Bruslova, V. V. Stankevych, N. M. Tsvietkova, L. capital O,', 'Cyrillic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 46 children with ALL were studied, who lived in Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv regions. Studies were conducted before the start of chemotherapy (ChT), on the 33 day of ChT (phase I), and after the com pletion of ChT (phase II). Exposure doses of patients, hemogram and myelogram parameters both with indices of mat uration of progenitor cells were evaluated. Signs of dysplasia of hematopoietic branch elements were revewed. RESULTS: The 46 patients were studied. They have had the B ALL, namely pro B ALL (n=5), <<common type>> (n=36), pre B ALL (n=3), and T ALL in 2 other cases. In a debut of ALL the bone marrow was represented by lymphoblasts. Along with ChT conduction the bone marrow hematopoiesis recovered by such types, as erythroid, granulocyte, gran ulocyte whith monocytes, and uniform, when the cells number of all branches was within a normal quantity. At the phase capital I, Ukrainiancapital I, Ukrainian of ChT the number of patients with hematopoiesis recovery by erythroid type decreased and number of chil dren with activation of granulocyte branch of hematopoiesis increased. In children with pro B ALL the number of erythroid elements was higher than normative at both ChT phases. A direct correlation was established between the number of myelokaryocytes (Mkc) and megakaryocytes (Mgkc) in both phase capital I, Ukrainian and phase capital I, Ukrainiancapital I, Ukrainian of treatment (Rs = +0.72; Rs = +0.56, respectively). There was no correlation between the radiation dose in patients (3.73 +/- 0.12 mSv) and studied parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Types of bone marrow recovery were established in ALL patients after the ChT indicating to the differ ent kinetic pathways of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Evaluation of reasons of prevalence of some hematopoietic branches will allow to reveal their role in leukemogenesis and to correct the treatment programs.","['V. G. Bebeshko, K. M. Bruslova, T. I.

METHODS: We performed a single-centre retrospective study to investigate the prevalence of the above quoted complications, the association with most important prognostic markers and their impact on survival (n = 795). RESULTS: Almost one out of three patients experienced at least one complication and only 0.9% of the cohort developed all three complications. One hundred and twenty (20%) subjects developed SC, 98 MI (12%) and 80 AD (10%); these complications seem to occur in a mutually exclusive manner. By Kaplan-Meier analysis we estimated that after 20 years from the diagnosis SC, MI and AD occurred in 48%, 42% and 29% of patients, respectively. Furthermore, we showed that some clinical and biological markers are skewed among patients with different complications and that subjects with MI and SC had a worse prognosis than those with AD and all other patients (p < 0.0001).

Here in the ACTIM phase 2 clinical trial, we asked whether pioglitazone add-on therapy to imatinib would impact CML residual disease, as assessed by BCR-ABL1 transcript quantification. METHODS: CML patients were eligible if treated with imatinib for at least 2 years at a stable daily dose, having yielded major molecular response (MMR) but not having achieved molecular response 4.5 (MR(4.5) ) defined by BCR-ABL1/ABL1(IS) RNA levels </= 0.0032%. After inclusion, patients started pioglitazone at a dosage of 30 to 45 mg/day in addition to imatinib. The primary objective was to evaluate the cumulative incidence of patients having progressed from MMR to MR(4.5) over 12 months. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included (age range, 24-79 years). No pharmacological interaction was observed between the drugs. The main adverse events were weight gain in 12 patients and a mean decrease of 0.4 g/dL in hemoglobin concentration. The cumulative incidence of MR(4.5) was 56% (95% confidence interval, 37%-76%) by 12 months, despite a wide range of therapy duration (1.9-15.5 months), and 88% of 17 evaluable patients who were still on imatinib reached MR(4.5) by 48 months. The cumulative incidence of MMR to MR(4.5) spontaneous conversions over 12 months was estimated to be 23% with imatinib alone in a parallel cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone in combination with imatinib was well tolerated and yielded a favorable 56% rate. These results provide a proof of concept needing confirmation within a randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2009-011675-79). Cancer 2017;123:1791-1799. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Matrine, a main alkaloid extracted from Sophora flavescens Ait, has antitumour activity against acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML). Whether autophagy is involved in antileukaemia activity of matrine remains unobvious. In this study, we demonstrated that matrine inhibited cell viability and colony formation via inducing apoptosis and autophagy in AML cell lines HL-60, THP-1 and C1498 as well as primary AML cells. Matrine promoted caspase-3 and PARP cleavage dose-dependently. Matrine up-regulated the level of LC3-II and down-regulated the level of SQSTM1/p62 in a dose-dependent way, indicating that autophagy should be implicated in anti-AML effect of matrine. Furthermore, the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 relieved the cytotoxicity of matrine by blocking the autophagic flux, while the autophagy promoter rapamycin enhanced the cytotoxicity of matrine. Additionally, matrine inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and their downstream substrates p70S6K and 4EBP1, which led to the occurrence of autophagy. In vivo study demonstrated that autophagy was involved in antileukaemia effect of matrine in C57BL/6 mice bearing murine AML cell line C1498, and the survival curves showed that mice did benefit from treatment with matrine. Collectively, our findings indicate that matrine exerts antitumour effect through apoptosis and autophagy, and the latter one might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AML.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

For decades, cancer therapy was based on biophysical parameters, with surgical resection to debulk, followed by radiation and chemotherapy to target the rapidly growing tumor cells, while mostly sparing quiescent normal tissues. One breakthrough occurred with allogeneic bone-marrow transplant for patients with leukemia, which provided a sometimes curative therapy. The field of adoptive cell therapy for solid tumors was established with the discovery that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes could be expanded and used to treat and even cure patients with metastatic melanoma. Tumor-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) were identified and engineered into patient peripheral blood lymphocytes, which were also found to treat tumors. However, these were limited by patient HLA-restriction. Close behind came generation of CAR, combining the exquisite recognition of an antibody with the effector function of a T cell. The advent of CD19-targeted CARs for treating patients with multiple forms of advanced B-cell malignancies met with great success, with up to 95% response rates. Applying CAR treatment to solid tumors, however, has just begun, but already certain factors have been made clear: the tumor target is of utmost importance for clinicians to do no harm; and solid tumors respond differently to CAR therapy compared with hematologic ones.

However, relapsed and refractory leukemia is still the major cause of mortality in leukemia patients. Besides, advancing age, poor performance status and severe co-morbidities limit the applicability of cytotoxic chemotherapy in certain groups of leukemia patients. Novel agents including nucleoside analogs, kinase inhibitors targeting oncoproteins and monoclonal antibodies are under investigation for the management of leukemia. Nevertheless, the outcome remains disappointing. Since immune system plays an important role in eradicating tumor cells, a lot of studies have been conducted in the administration of cytotherapy of immune cells as an alternative method when chemotherapy and transplantation fail to cure the disease, including usage of natural killer (NK) cells, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells, dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccine and antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Due to overexpression of several leukemia associated antigens (LAA), leukemic cells are potentially suitable for cellular therapy approach.

OCT1 expression and its relationship to the proliferation of cancer cells, development of metastases and resistance to chemotherapy has been observed in solid tumors. There is no data concerning the significance of OCT1 expression in the clinical course and treatment results in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The objective of the study was firstly to evaluate OCT1 mRNA expression in patients with newly diagnosed de novo AML, and secondly to compare the obtained results to the healthy control group as well as analyze them according to leukemia subtypes, CD34 expression, cytogenetic and molecular factors and treatment results. 101 patients with AML, excluding the subtype classified as M3 by French-American-British (FAB) criteria, were analyzed. The control group consisted of 26 healthy individuals. The evaluated material was bone marrow (BM). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) was used in the study as a method of evaluating OCT1 mRNA expression. The study showed a statistically significant lower expression of OCT1 mRNA in patients with AML in comparison to the control group. The level of OCT1 mRNA expression was lowest for CD34+ leukemia. No significant correlation between OCT1 mRNA expression and cytogenetic and molecular factors was observed. A significant influence of OCT1 mRNA expression on the clinical outcome of the disease was observed: patients with lower expression had higher chances of achieving complete remission (CR) and longer overall survival (OS).",,"['Stefanko, Ewa', 'Rybka, Justyna', 'Jazwiec, Bozena', 'Haus, Olga', 'Stapor, Sylwia', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz', 'Wrobel, Tomasz']","['Stefanko E', 'Rybka J', 'Jazwiec B', 'Haus O', 'Stapor S', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Wrobel T']","['Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland. ewastefanko@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Collegium Medicum Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161226,Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'OCT1', 'Resistance to chemotherapy']",2016/12/28 06:00,2018/03/21 06:00,['2016/12/28 06:00'],"['2015/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-016-0161-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-016-0161-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2017 Jul;23(3):665-671. doi: 10.1007/s12253-016-0161-7.

Drug-induced injury of the gastrointestinal tract is a relatively frequent but usually under-recognized disease entity. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 56-year-old male with a history of relapsed follicular lymphoma status post allogenic bone marrow transplant who developed severe diarrhea with a skin eruption mimicking graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 6 months after starting idelalisib. He underwent a colonoscopy demonstrating a grossly normal-appearing colon and terminal ileum. Biopsies taken during the procedure revealed mild active ileitis, colitis, and proctitis with frequent epithelial apoptosis, and focal intra-epithelial lymphocytosis. Skin biopsies revealed sub-acute spongiotic dermatitis suggestive of either contact dermatitis or an eczematous drug reaction. Symptoms were attributed to idelalisib given their resolution with withdrawal of the drug in conjunction with the skin and colonic biopsies. CONCLUSION: High clinical suspicion and awareness of the histological features of idelalisib-associated colitis is important to distinguish it from potential mimickers such as GVHD and infectious colitis.",,"['Hammami, Muhammad Bader', 'Al-Taee, Ahmad', 'Meeks, Marshall', 'Fesler, Mark', 'Hurley, M Yadira', 'Cao, Dengfeng', 'Lai, Jin-Ping']","['Hammami MB', 'Al-Taee A', 'Meeks M', 'Fesler M', 'Hurley MY', 'Cao D', 'Lai JP']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, 1402 S.

AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma (MM) originate from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We wanted to characterize germline susceptibility to AL amyloidosis using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 1229 AL amyloidosis patients from Germany, UK and Italy, and 7526 healthy local controls. For comparison with MM, recent GWAS data on 3790 cases were used. For AL amyloidosis, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 10 loci showed evidence of an association at P<10(-5) with homogeneity of results from the 3 sample sets; some of these were previously documented to influence MM risk, including the SNP at the IRF4 binding site. In AL amyloidosis, rs9344 at the splice site of cyclin D1, promoting translocation (11;14), reached the highest significance, P=7.80 x 10(-11); the SNP was only marginally significant in MM. SNP rs79419269 close to gene SMARCD3 involved in chromatin remodeling was also significant (P=5.2 x 10(-8)). These data provide evidence for common genetic susceptibility to AL amyloidosis and MM.

BI 836909 induced selective lysis of BCMA-positive MM cells, activation of T cells, release of cytokines and T-cell proliferation; whereas BCMA-negative cells were not affected. Activity of BI 836909 was not influenced by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, soluble BCMA or a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). In ex vivo assays, BI 836909 induced potent autologous MM cell lysis in both, newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory patient samples. In mouse xenograft studies, BI 836909 induced tumor cell depletion in a subcutaneous NCI-H929 xenograft model and prolonged survival in an orthotopic L-363 xenograft model. In a cynomolgus monkey study, administration of BI 836909 led to depletion of BCMA-positive plasma cells in the bone marrow.

We report an in vivo insertional-mutagenesis screen for genes cooperating with one AML initiating mutations (PML-RARA, oncogene of acute promyelocytic leukemia, APL), which allowed identification of hundreds of genetic cooperators. The cooperators are mutated at low frequency in APL or AML patients but are always abnormally expressed in a cohort of 182 APLs and AMLs analyzed. These deregulations appear non-randomly distributed and present in all samples, regardless of their associated genomic mutations. Reverse-engineering approaches showed that these cooperators belong to a single transcriptional gene network, enriched in genes mutated in AMLs, where perturbation of single genes modifies expression of others. Their gene-ontology analysis showed enrichment of genes directly involved in cell proliferation control. Therefore, the pool of PML-RARA cooperating mutations appears large and heterogeneous, but functionally equivalent and deregulated in the majority of APLs and AMLs.

In this study, we investigated the mechanism(s) of drug resistance in the human acute leukemia cell line MOLT-3 and its idarubicin-resistant derivative MOLT-3/IDR through complete mitochondrial and nuclear DNA analyses. We identified genetic differences between these two cell lines. The ND3 mutation site (p.Thr61Ile) in the mitochondrial DNA sequence was unique to MOLT-3/IDR cells. Moreover, we identified five candidate genes harboring genetic alterations, including GALNT2, via CGH array analysis. Sequencing of the GALNT2 exon revealed a G1716K mutation present within the stop codon in MOLT-3/IDR cells but absent from MOLT-3 cells. This mutation led to an additional 18 amino acids in the protein encoded by GALNT2. Using real-time PCR, we determined an expression value for this gene of 0.35. Protein structure predictions confirmed a structural change in GALNT2 in MOLT-3/IDR cells that corresponded to the site of the mutation.

The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL has been implicated in several tumor entities and a selective AXL small molecule inhibitor (BGB324) is currently being tested in clinical trials for patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer or acute myeloid leukemia. Our study investigates AXL expression during HNSCC progression and its use as a potential therapeutic target in HNSCC. AXL protein expression was determined in a HNSCC cohort (n = 364) using immunohistochemical staining. For functional validation, AXL was either overexpressed or inhibited with BGB324 in HNSCC cell lines to assess proliferation, migration and invasion. We found AXL protein expression increasing during tumor progression with highest expression levels in recurrent tumors. In HNSCC cell lines in vitro, AXL overexpression increased migration as well as invasion. Both properties could be reduced through treatment with BGB324. In contrast, proliferation was neither affected by AXL overexpression nor by inhibition with BGB324. Our patient-derived data and in vitro results show that, in HNSCC, AXL is important for the progression to more advanced tumor stages.

The results showed that goat ICM derived cells in 2i medium adding leukaemia inhibitor factor (LIF) possessed a mouse ES-like morphology. But these cells had much compromised proliferation capacity, resulting in difficulty in expansion. In 2i alone medium, goat ICM derived cells possessed primate ES-like morphology. These cells expressed pluripotent markers and could differentiate into derivatives of three germ layers in vitro. However, these cells could not be proliferated in long-term (persisted for 15 passages) because of spontaneously neural differentiation. Additionally, goat ICM derived cells could be inducing differentiated into neural lineage in vitro.

Apigenin, a flavonoid present in fruits and vegetables, is a potent dietary phytochemical effective in cancer chemoprevention. AIM: This study was undertaken to investigate the potential synergistic antitumor activity of apigenin and 5-FU on Solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC). METHODS: Eighty Swiss albino male mice were divided into four equal groups: vehicle treated control SEC, SEC+5-FU, SEC+apigenin, SEC+ 5-FU+apigenin. Beclin-1 and caspases 3, 9 and JNK activities were estimated by ELISA; mRNA expression levels of the antiapoptotic gene Mcl-1 were estimated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, while tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity were evaluated spectrophotometrically. A part of the tumor was examined for histopathological and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry analysis. RESULTS: 5-FU and/or apigenin caused significant increase in tissue levels of Beclin-1, caspases 3, 9 and JNK activities, MDA with significant decrease in tumor volume, Mcl-1expression, tissue glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity and alleviated the histopathological changes with significant decrease of Ki-67 proliferation index compared to vehicle treated SEC control group.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinicopathologic, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic characteristics of SS in Egyptian patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: The study was conducted during the period from April 2011 to March 2015. For each patient, a clinical evaluation and histological assessment of cutaneous lesions were recorded. Diagnostic investigations, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic features of leukemia were analyzed. Therapeutic monitoring and follow up of both diseases were registered. RESULTS: The study included 13 patients (7 males and 6 females) with a mean age of 44.4+/-17.49years. Fever was recorded in 10 cases and most of the lesions (61.5%) appeared during the post remission period. Clinically, the lesions were more frequently located on the extremities (61.5%), presented as solitary lesion (53.8%) and mostly tender (69.2%). Atypical presentations were observed in 5 cases and included ulcerative lesion, indurated mass and a gangrenous mass. Histological assessment revealed two patterns of inflammatory reactions described as classic (dermal) form (38.5%) and deep (subcutaneous) form (61.5%). Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis in 61.5%, neutropenia in 38.5%, anaemia in 92.3%, and thrombocytopenia in 84.6%. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed suppressed trilineage hematopoesis in 84.6% and blast cell count >50% in 69.2%. The common subtypes of AML included M2 and M4 (23.1% for each). Cytogenetic studies revealed genetic abnormalities in 69.2% of cases. Most of the cases (76.9%) showed a poor response to oral prednisolone but responded well to alternative therapies, including dapsone, colchicine and cyclosporine. CONCLUSION: Sweet syndrome associated with AML may show atypical clinical forms that have an aggressive course and is mostly associated with subcutaneous involvement. Although chemotherapy of AML may play a significant role in the development of SS, the exact mechanism remains unclear. The disease is considered a steroid refractory and genetic abnormalities may have a role in altering the classic nature of the disease.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

METHODS: Human platelet lysate(HPL) was obtained by repeated freezing and thawing of concentrated platelet. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were cultured in alpha-minimal essential medium (alpha-MEM) containing 10% HPL or 10% FBS. The morphology, cell phenotype, multilineage differentiation potential in vitro and proliferation capacity between the mesenchymal stem cells cultured with HPL or FBS were compared. The human bone marrow formation capacity of HPL-cultured MSC was observed. The MSC was seeded on beta-TCP scaffolds for 12h, then the MSC-coated scaffold were implanted in a subcutaneous pocket on the dorsum of NOD/SCID mice. After 8-12 week, the scaffolds were harvested from the mice, then fixed, paraffin-embedded and stained for HE. RESULTS: Whether cultured in the presence of HPL or FBS, the MSC all displayed a spindle-shaped fibroblast-like morphology; the flow cytometry analysis revealed no obvious differences in cell immunophenotype in this 2 groups; they all have the ability to differentiate towards osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes in vitro. However, the mesenchymal stem cells cultivated with HPL-contained medium showed stronger proliferation capacity and higher activity to differentiate towards osteoblasts. Mesenchymal stem cells cultivated with HPL still have in vivo bone-forming capacity. CONCLUSION: HPL cultured MSC have stronger proliferation capacity and potential of differentiate towards osteoblasts, HPL-cultured MSC also can reconstruct humanized bone marrow niche in murine host.",,"['Chen, Huan', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Li, Bin', 'Xing, Hai-Yan', 'Li, Huan', 'Tang, Ke-Jing', 'Wang, Min', 'Rao, Qing']","['Chen H', 'Tian Z', 'Li B', 'Xing HY', 'Li H', 'Tang KJ', 'Wang M', 'Rao Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020,China.

METHODS: The engraftment, graft versus host disease (GVHD), infection, relapse and survival of 10 T-LBL patients received allo-HSCT was observed. The clinical outcome of allo-HSCT for T-LBL patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 25 years old, 10 (6 males and 4 females) T-LBL patients received allo-HSCT including 3 from HLA-matched unrelated donors, 3 from HLA-matched sibling donors, 2 from HLA haploidentical sibling donors, and 2 from haploidentical related donors. The clinical staging showed that 1 case was in stage III and 8 cases were in stage IV. The bone marrow was involved in 7 patients. All the 10 patients achieved engraftment, and the median times of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 11 (10-19) days and 12(7-19) days, respectively. Acute GVHD occurred in 5 patients and chronic GVHD occured in 1 patient. After the median follow-up of 26 months (11-51 months), 3 patients died, out of them 1 died from relapse after transplantation, 1 from infection and 1 from GVHD.

METHODS: Forty-one adult B-ALL patients treated with VICP+L-ASP/TKI from August 2008 to June 2014 were following-up. The complete remission(CR) rate, toxicity, overall survival(OS) and event free survival(EFS) after induction treatment were analyzed, the therapeutic outcome of patients between different risk stratification subgroups was compared, the influence of standardized consolidatory and maintaining treatment as well as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) on survival time was analyzed. RESULTS: The early death not occurred in 41 patients with B-ALL including 37 cases with CR; the CR rate of 1 course treatment was 90.2%. The follow-up time lasted to March 17, 2015, the median follow-up time was 25(9-79) months; the 1 year OS rate was 75.3%, the EFS rate was 58.3%. Analysis of risk factors showed that the initial WBC count over 30x10(9)/L, LDH over 250 U/L and minimal residual disease(MRD) over 10(-4) after treatment were poor prognostic factors. After remission, the standardized consolidatory treatment or allo-HSCT according to the ""2012 China adult ALL diagnosis and treatment expert consensus"" could improve long-term survival, 3 years OS rate was 73.8% and 61.5% respectively, 3 years EFS were 63.5% and 65.7% respectively.

METHODS: Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from umbilical cord of newborns. Co-culture system was established by HUC-MSC and NB4 in vitro. The experiment was divided into 4 groups: NB4 group (NB4 cells alone) , NM group (NB4 cells co-cultured with HUC-MSC) , NA group (NB4 cells treated with ATRA) , NMA group (NB4 cells co-cultured with HUC-MSC and treated with ATRA) . NB4 cells were counted by a microscopy, NB4 proliferation was monitored by CCK-8 assay, NB4 differentiation was assessed by Wright ' s staining and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test. IL-6 levels in the culture supernatant of different groups were tested by ELISA kit. Quantitative PCR was used to detect the transcription level of CDKN1A, CCND1 and Survivin. RESULTS: NB4 and HUC-MSC in the co-culturing systems were in good condition with a slight repression of NB4 proliferation by HUC-MSC. HUC-MSC could collaborate with ATRA to induce significant NB4 differentiation. Consistent with this finding, IL-6 expression levels of co-cultured groups were remarkably higher than that in any other groups or the group of HUC-MSC alone.

METHODS: Clinical data of 19 acute myeloid leukemia patients aged over 70 years admitted in our hospital from March 2006 to April 2016 years were analyzed retrospectively. Among them 15 patients received priming regimen and 4 patients received best supportive treatment. The overall survival time between patients with priming regimen and patients with best supportine treatment was compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The prognostic factors were evaluated by using multivariate analysis. Out of the 19 patients, 9 were males and 10 were females, with median age of 75 years (70-84). RESULTS: After 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy, the complete response rate was (7/15)46.6% and overall response rate was (11/15) 73%. Significant longer median survival time was observed in priming regimen group, compared with that in best supportive treatment group (11 months vs 2 months)(chi(2)=17.077, P<0.001). The patients were well tolerant to side-effect of chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that only receiving induction chemotherapy or not was the independent prognostic factor of the survival time(P<0.05), while the sex, age, ECOG index, CD34, HLA-DR, WBC count and ratio of blast cells in bone marrow were factor affecting the prognosis.

METHODS: The treatment and efficacy of 80 Ph negative B-ALL in patients of 16-39 years old in the Hematology Department of 301(65 cases) and 309(15 cases) hospital from 1999 to 2016 are retrospectively analyzed. The patients received combined induction chemotherapy of 4 or 5 chemotherapeutic drugs (VDCLP/ VDLP/ DOLP/ IOLP). After remission patients received consolidation protocols of 3-5 cycls, and then received allo-HSCT or haploidentical HSCT. The median follow-up time was 29 (6-153) months. RESULTS: HSCT was carried out after CR1. The 5-year OS and EFS of allo-HSCT group(n=29) was (73+/-16)% and (67+/-17)%, respectively, while those of haploidentical-HSCT group(n=20) were (53+/-22)% and (53+/-22)%, respectively, and those of pediatric-inspired protocols(n=31) was (63+/-17)% and (50+/-18)%, respectively. The difference between OS and EFS in 3 group was not statistically significant(P>0.05). The re-remission rate of recurrent patients was (50+/-23)%. On the one side, the cumulative incidence of TRM of pediatric-inspired protocol was better than that of HSCT (P<0.05). On the other side, the cummulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of pediatric-inspired protocol was poorer than that of HSCT, yet without significant difference (P>0.05).

METHODS: MTT method was used to determine the antiproliferating effect of different concentrations of HHT, As2O3 and their combination on U937 cells; the flow cytometry with Annexin-V-FITC/PI double staining was used to determine the apoptosis-induced effect of HHT and As2O3 alone or their combination; Western blot method was used to detect the protein expression of P-Akt(Ser473),P-Akt(Thr308),BCL-XL, BID,MCL-1,P-MCL-1 and so on. RESULTS: HHT and As2O3 could significantly inhibit proliferation of U937 cells and induce their apoptosis. The combination of these 2 drugs could significantly enhance the early apoptosis of U937 cells. After combination of these 2 drugs was used, the protein expressions of P-Akt(Ser473),P-Akt(Thr308),MCL-1,P-MCL-1 and BCL-XL were obviously down-regulated, but the expression of BID protein did not change.

METHODS: Firstly, Two CLL cell lines (MEC-1-GFP and HG3-GFP)with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) were established by lentivirus system respectively, and then the MEC-1-GFP cells (5x10(7)/ml) were inoculated into forelimb, hindlimb and abdomen to observe the tumorigenesis. Secondly, the MEC-1-GFP and HG3-GFP cells with same density (5x10(7)/ml) were inoculated into forelimb to compare the time and rate of tumor formation. Thirdly, the MEC-1-GFP cells (1x10(7)/ml) and HG3-GFP cells (5x10(7)/ml) were inoculated into forelimb to compare the time and rate of tumor formation at different inoculative density. After observation for 5 weeks, the peripheral blood was collected and treated with EDTA and erythrocytolysin, then the of GFP positive cells were detected by flow cytomety. Meanwhile, the tumor-bearing mice were killed, and the tumors were isolated and cut into slices for histopathological examination. RESULTS: MEC-1-GFP and HG3-GFP cell lines were successfully established, and after inocutation of MEC-1-GFP cells with 5x10(7)/ml the xenograt tumors were formated in forelimb, hindlimb and abdomen of mice, especially in the forelimb with a higher tumorigenic rate. In addition, the inoculation of same density of MEC-1-GFP and HG3-GFP cells (5x10(7)/ml) also resulted in xenograft in forelimb, and the tumorigenic rate reached to 80% after 5 weeks. Moreover, the inocutation of MEC-1-GFP and HG3-GFP cells with 1x10(7) and 5x10(7)/ml respectively also effectively resulted to xenograft tumor in forelimb. The flow cytometry showed that there was no MEC-1-GFP and HG3-GFP cells in peripheral blood, while histopathological examination demonstrated CLL cell metastasis towards peritoneal cavity.

METHODS: Expression of IDO and TLR9 in HL-60 and K562 cells cocultured with or without IFN-gamma,Talpha1,IFN-gamma+Talpha1 and chloroquine were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR). Then, the IDO activity in HL-60 and K562 cells cocultured with or without IFN-gamma,Talpha1,IFN-gamma+ Talpha1 was assayed by coomassie brilliant blue staining and modified colorimetric method. RESULTS: Both IDO and TLR9 mRNA were expressed in HL-60 and K562 cells; IFN-gamma increased the expression and activity of IDO in a concentration-dependent manner; Talpha1 decreased the expression and activity of IDO in a concentration-dependent manner; the up-regulation of IFN-gamma on IDO induced expression and activity had been weakened by Talpha1(P<0.01); Chloroquine had no effect on the expression of IDO. The expression of TLR9 in HL-60 cells and K562 cells cocultured with IFN-gamma,Talpha1,IFN-gamma+Talpha1 and chloroquine was not significantly changed. CONCLUSION: IDO can be expressed in acute myeloid leukemia cells and possesses the activity. IDO may play an important role in immune tolerance induced by leukemia cells, and become a new predictor of AML prognosis.

METHODS: The immunophenotypical markers of AML cells were detected by multiple parameter flow cytometry; the expression of WT1, MDK, ETO, PML-RaRa and BCR-ABL were detected by RT-PCR; and cellular features were analyzed by R-band in 304 patients. The patients were divided into three groups according to their immunophenotypes: AML with CD7 expression (CD7 group), AML with CD4 expression(CD4 group) and AML without CD7 and CD4 expression (common AML group). RESULTS: The expression rate and level of HLA-DR in CD7 group were higher than those in the common AML group, and the expression rate of CD33 and CD34 was higher than that in the other two groups. The expression rate and level of CD15, CD64 in the CD4 group were higher than those in the other 2 groups, and the expression rate and level of CD33 were higher than those in the common AML group.

METHODS: Long term survival of 170 newly diagnosed APL patients was retrospective analyzed. Mutation rate of FLT3-ITD was assayed, and its influence on disease-free survival(DFS) or overall survival (OS) was analyzed. RESULTS: The mutation rate of FLT3-ITD in newly diagnosed patients with APL was 14.1%. WBC count at diagnosis was higer in FLT3-ITD positive group than that in negative group, and the mutation rate of FLT3-ITD was highest in high risk group. Induction death rate in FLT3-ITD positive and negative group were 12.5% and 2.9%, respectively (P=0.031). Complete remission(CR) rate in 2 groups were 83.3% and 97.1%(P=0.004). The 5-year OS rates in 2 groups were 87.5+/-6.8% and 90.6+/-2.6% (P=0.740). The 5-year DFS in 2 groups were 82.8+/-9.1% and 83.6+/-3.4%(P=0.928). CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD mutation is related with high peripheral white blood cell count in APL, the APL with FLT3-ITD mutation has higher induction death rate and lower CR rate than those in that without FLT3-ITD mutation, but FLT3-ITD mutation did not affect on long term DFS and OS.",,"['Gong, Ben-Fa', 'Wang, Ying', 'Lin, Dong', 'Wei, Hui', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhou, Chun-Lin', 'Liu, Bing-Cheng', 'Liu, Kai-Qi', 'Zhang, Guang-Ji', 'Liu, Yun-Tao', 'Li, Yan', 'Wei, Shu-Ning', 'Gong, Xiao-Yuan', 'Zhao, Xing-Li', 'Qiu, Shao-Wei', 'Gu, Run-Xia', 'Mi, Ying-Chang', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang']","['Gong BF', 'Wang Y', 'Lin D', 'Wei H', 'Li W', 'Zhou CL', 'Liu BC', 'Liu KQ', 'Zhang GJ', 'Liu YT', 'Li Y', 'Wei SN', 'Gong XY', 'Zhao XL', 'Qiu SW', 'Gu RX', 'Mi YC', 'Wang JX']","['Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'Institute of Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.

Doxorubicin (DOX) was widely used for the treatment of leukemia. However, severe toxic side effects and drug resistance are the major limitations of DOX. Nanocarriers offer the opportunity to overcome these drawbacks, there are many attempts to enhance the activity of DOX against drug resistance. This study aimed to develop a novel transferrin (Tf) modified and doxorubicin (DOX) loaded Pluronic 85/lipid-polymeric nanoparticles for the treatment of leukemia. METHODS: In this study, a novel targeted ligand: transferrin-polyethylene glycol-oleic acid (Tf-PEG-OA) was synthesized. Tf modified and DOX loaded Pluronic 85/lipid-polymeric nanoparticles (Tf-DOX P85/LPNs) were prepared via the self-assembly of PLGA, P85, stearic acid and Tf-PEG-OA using the nanoprecipitation method. The physicochemical properties of LPNs were characterized. In vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of LPNs was evaluated in human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60 cells) and DOX resistance HL-60 cell line (HL-60/DOX cells) including the relevant animal models. RESULTS: Tf-DOX P85/LPNs displayed strong anti-tumor ability on both HL-60 cells and HL-60/DOX cells than other formulations used as contrast. Also, in HL-60/DOX bearing animal models, Tf-DOX P85/LPNs exhibited the highest efficiency as well as the lowest systemic toxicity. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that Tf P85/LPNs is a promising platform to enhance efficacy, reduce toxicity and overcome drug resistance of DOX for the treatment of leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TRAF6, a TLR effector with ubiquitin (Ub) ligase activity, is overexpressed in MDS hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found that TRAF6 overexpression in mouse HSPC results in impaired hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. Using a global Ub screen, we identified hnRNPA1, an RNA-binding protein and auxiliary splicing factor, as a substrate of TRAF6. TRAF6 ubiquitination of hnRNPA1 regulated alternative splicing of Arhgap1, which resulted in activation of the GTP-binding Rho family protein Cdc42 and accounted for hematopoietic defects in TRAF6-expressing HSPCs.

Clonal circulating T cells can also be associated with non-renal autoimmune disorders induced by overproduction of specific patterns of cytokines or unbalanced lymphocytes sub-populations. METHODS: Immunophenotyping of circulating T cells and TCR gene restriction analysis using Biomed-2 protocol. NF-kappaB staining and mRNA quantification of inflammatory genes in HK-2 epithelial renal cells exposed to supernatants of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with clonal T-cell population. RESULTS: Here, we could identify a persistent clonal T-cell population, only characterized by in-depth immunophenotyping of circulating lymphocytes and using multiplex PCR analysis of TCR gene rearrangements, in two patients with polymorphic inflammatory renal fibrosis of unknown origin. Using an in vitro approach, we could demonstrate that peripheral blood mononuclear cells including the clonal population can trigger a phenotype switch of epithelial renal cells from a quiescent state to a pro-inflammatory state characterized by NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and overexpression of inflammatory cytokine or chemokine. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that circulating T-cell clones may directly activate epithelial renal cells or promote a T-/B-cell population with autoimmune reactive properties against kidney cells, which, in the absence of overt renal lymphoma infiltration, lead to the subsequent inflammatory renal fibrotic phenotype.",,"['Ribes, David', 'Casemayou, Audrey', 'El Hachem, Helene', 'Laurent, Camille', 'Guilbeau-Frugier, Celine', 'Vergez, Francois', 'Tavitian, Suzanne', 'Schanstra, Joost P', 'Chauveau, Dominique', 'Bascands, Jean-Loup', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Faguer, Stanislas']","['Ribes D', 'Casemayou A', 'El Hachem H', 'Laurent C', 'Guilbeau-Frugier C', 'Vergez F', 'Tavitian S', 'Schanstra JP', 'Chauveau D', 'Bascands JL', 'Ysebaert L', 'Faguer S']","[""Departement de Nephrologie et Transplantation d'organes et Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1048, Institut of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', ""Departement de Nephrologie et Transplantation d'organes et Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Anatomo-pathologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse, Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Anatomo-pathologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse, Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie-Immunophenotypage et Hematologie Cellulaire, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1048, Institut of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', ""Departement de Nephrologie et Transplantation d'organes et Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1048, Institut of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1048, Institut of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease, Toulouse, France.', 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', 'DeTROI - Inserm U1188 - Universite de La Reunion Diabete atherothrombose Therapies Reunion Ocean Indien, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", ""Departement de Nephrologie et Transplantation d'organes et Centre de reference des maladies renales rares, CHU Rangueil, Toulouse, France. faguer.s@chu-toulouse.fr."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM), U1048, Institut of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disease, Toulouse, France. faguer.s@chu-toulouse.fr.', 'Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse III, Toulouse, France. faguer.s@chu-toulouse.fr.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,20161226,Japan,Clin Exp Nephrol,Clinical and experimental nephrology,9709923,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kidney/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nephritis, Interstitial/blood/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Biomed-2', 'Interstitial nephritis', 'Large granular lymphocytic leukemia', 'Renal fibrosis', 'T-cell clone']",2016/12/27 06:00,2018/06/12 06:00,['2016/12/27 06:00'],"['2016/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10157-016-1373-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s10157-016-1373-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Nephrol. 2017 Oct;21(5):781-786. doi: 10.1007/s10157-016-1373-6.

These synthetic viral particles are safer surrogates of native viruses and acquire the tropism and host entry pathway characteristics governed by the heterologous envelope glycoprotein used. They have proven to be very useful tools used in research with many applications, such as enabling the study of entry pathways of enveloped viruses and to generate effective gene-delivery vectors. The basis for their generation lies in the capacity of some viruses, such as murine leukemia virus (MLV), to incorporate envelope glycoproteins of other viruses into a pseudotyped virus particle. These can be engineered to contain reporter genes such as luciferase, enabling quantification of virus entry events upon pseudotyped particle infection with susceptible cells. Here, we detail a protocol enabling generation of MLV-based pseudotyped particles, using the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (S) as an example of a heterologous envelope glycoprotein to be incorporated.

These include those manifesting chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as well as xenografts of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). These models have led to an improved understanding of disease etiology, B-cell biology, immunomodulation, and the importance of the tumor microenvironment. Despite these efforts in CLL, DLBCL, and MCL, considerably little progress toward a model of splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) has been accomplished. Herein, we describe the similarities and differences between CLL, MCL, and SMZL and highlight effective murine models that mimic disease in the two former, in hopes of informing a potential model of the latter. At the time of writing this review, the precise molecular events of SMZL remain to be determined and a treatment regimen remains to be identified. Therefore, based on the efforts put forth in the B-cell lymphoma field throughout the past three decades, the established role of caveolin-1 in B- and T-cell biology as an oncogene or tumor suppressor, and the recurrent deletion or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 7q in many cancers, we make recommendations for a murine model of SMZL.",,"['Patten, Chelsey L', 'Cutucache, Christine E']","['Patten CL', 'Cutucache CE']","['University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.', 'University of Nebraska at Omaha , Omaha, NE , USA.']",['eng'],"['Review', 'Journal Article']",,20161214,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,['NOTNLM'],"['7q LOH', '7q minimally deleted region', 'genetically engineered', 'neoplasms', 'splenic marginal zone lymphoma']",2016/12/27 06:00,2016/12/27 06:01,['2016/12/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2016.00258 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2016 Dec 14;6:258. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2016.00258. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC5155011,,,,,,,,,

These recommendations were developed following the previously established process based on the Institute of Medicine's clinical practice guidelines. In doing so, a systematic literature search was performed for high-impact studies from 2004 to 2014 and was supplemented with further literature as identified by the panel. The consensus panel met in December of 2014 with the goal to generate consensus recommendations for the clinical use of immunotherapy in patients with hematologic malignancies. During this meeting, consensus panel voting along with discussion were used to rate and review the strength of the supporting evidence from the literature search. These consensus recommendations focus on issues related to patient selection, toxicity management, clinical endpoints, and the sequencing or combination of therapies. Overall, immunotherapy is rapidly emerging as an effective therapeutic strategy for the management of hematologic malignances.

MDM2 inhibitor molecules are able to antagonize p53-MDM2 interaction allowing p53 to exert tumor suppressor transcriptional regulation and to induce apoptotic pathways. Recent preclinical and clinical studies propose that MDM2 targeted therapy represents a promising anticancer strategy restoring p53 dependent mechanisms in ALL disease. Here, we discussed the use of new small molecule targeting p53 pathways as a promising drug target therapy in ALL.",,"['Trino, Stefania', 'De Luca, Luciana', 'Laurenzana, Ilaria', 'Caivano, Antonella', 'Del Vecchio, Luigi', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","['Trino S', 'De Luca L', 'Laurenzana I', 'Caivano A', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Martinelli G', 'Musto P']","['Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata Rionero in Vulture (PZ), Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata Rionero in Vulture (PZ), Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata Rionero in Vulture (PZ), Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS - Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata Rionero in Vulture (PZ), Italy.', ""CEINGE - Biotecnologie Avanzate S.C.a R.L.Naples, Italy; Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnologies, Universita' degli Studi di Napoli Federico IINaples, Italy."", 'Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. and A.

The trial design was a 2 x 2 factorial for frontline therapies only. Motivated by the idea that subsequent salvage treatments affect survival time, we model therapy as a dynamic treatment regime (DTR), that is, an alternating sequence of adaptive treatments or other actions and transition times between disease states. These sequences may vary substantially between patients, depending on how the regime plays out. To evaluate the regimes, mean overall survival time is expressed as a weighted average of the means of all possible sums of successive transitions times. We assume a Bayesian nonparametric survival regression model for each transition time, with a dependent Dirichlet process prior and Gaussian process base measure (DDP-GP). Posterior simulation is implemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We provide general guidelines for constructing a prior using empirical Bayes methods. The proposed approach is compared with inverse probability of treatment weighting, including a doubly robust augmented version of this approach, for both single-stage and multi-stage regimes with treatment assignment depending on baseline covariates. The simulations show that the proposed nonparametric Bayesian approach can substantially improve inference compared to existing methods.

Lenalidomide binding to the Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase results in targeted ubiquitination and degradation of the lymphoid transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3) leading to growth inhibition of multiple myeloma cells. Recently, Basigin (BSG) was identified as another protein regulated by CRBN that is involved in the activity of lenalidomide. Here, we analyzed the prognostic value of IKZF1, IKZF3, CRBN and BSG mRNA expression levels in pretreatment plasma cells from 60 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma uniformly treated with lenalidomide in combination with intensive chemotherapy within a clinical trial. We found that IKZF1 mRNA expression levels are significantly associated with progression-free survival (PFS). Patients in the lowest quartile (Q1) of IKZF1 expression had a superior PFS compared with patients in the remaining quartiles (Q2-Q4; 3-year PFS of 86 vs 51%, P=0.01). This translated into a significant better overall survival (100 vs 74%, P=0.03). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant impact of IKZF1, IKZF3 and BSG expression levels on PFS in cytogenetically defined standard-risk but not high-risk patients.

Using CRISPR/Cas9-generated Mec-1 cell line models, we show that NOTCH1 regulates growth and homing of CLL cells by dictating expression levels of the tumor suppressor gene DUSP22. Specifically, NOTCH1 affects the methylation of DUSP22 promoter by modulating a nuclear complex, which tunes the activity of DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A). These effects are enhanced by PEST-domain mutations, which stabilize the molecule and prolong signaling. CLL patients with a NOTCH1-mutated clone showed low levels of DUSP22 and active chemotaxis to CCL19. Lastly, in xenograft models, NOTCH1-mutated cells displayed a unique homing behavior, localizing preferentially to the spleen and brain. These findings connect NOTCH1, DUSP22, and CCL19-driven chemotaxis within a single functional network, suggesting that modulation of the homing process may provide a relevant contribution to the unfavorable prognosis associated with NOTCH1 mutations in CLL.",,"['Arruga, F', 'Gizdic, B', 'Bologna, C', 'Cignetto, S', 'Buonincontri, R', 'Serra, S', 'Vaisitti, T', 'Gizzi, K', 'Vitale, N', 'Garaffo, G', 'Mereu, E', 'Diop, F', 'Neri, F', 'Incarnato, D', 'Coscia, M', 'Allan, J', 'Piva, R', 'Oliviero, S', 'Furman, R R', 'Rossi, D', 'Gaidano, G', 'Deaglio, S']","['Arruga F', 'Gizdic B', 'Bologna C', 'Cignetto S', 'Buonincontri R', 'Serra S', 'Vaisitti T', 'Gizzi K', 'Vitale N', 'Garaffo G', 'Mereu E', 'Diop F', 'Neri F', 'Incarnato D', 'Coscia M', 'Allan J', 'Piva R', 'Oliviero S', 'Furman RR', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Deaglio S']","['Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnologies and Health Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnologies and Health Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnologies and Health Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnologies and Health Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnologies and Health Science, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Life Sciences and Systems Biology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Translational Medicine, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Human Genetics Foundation, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161226,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CCL19/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Dual-Specificity Phosphatases/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Phosphatases/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics']",,,2016/12/27 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2016/12/27 06:00'],"['2016/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016383 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.383 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Sep;31(9):1882-1893. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.383.

METHODS: A prospective observational study conducted in 164 patients aged >/=65years and diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Responsiveness of the GAH scales was studied by means of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score, the visual analog scale (VAS), and the physician's subjective assessment, used as clinical anchors to identify whether patients had changed clinically (either improved or worsened) or not since the baseline visit. Responsiveness was evaluated on the basis of effect size (ES). RESULTS: 164 patients (men, 63.7%; median age, 77.0 (72.8-81.4) participated. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between the investigator's qualitative assessment and changes in ECOG, KPS, and VAS scores. Likewise, a statistically significant correlation was obtained between the investigator's qualitative assessment and changes in the GAH scale score. Responsiveness of the GAH scale to detect clinical change was satisfactory (ES 0.34). CONCLUSION: Findings confirm that the GAH scale is responsive to clinical changes in patients' health status. Additionally, the GAH scale is a promising tool to improve clinical decision-making in older patients with hematological malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

FTO is highly expressed in AMLs with t(11q23)/MLL rearrangements, t(15;17)/PML-RARA, FLT3-ITD, and/or NPM1 mutations. FTO enhances leukemic oncogene-mediated cell transformation and leukemogenesis, and inhibits all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced AML cell differentiation, through regulating expression of targets such as ASB2 and RARA by reducing m(6)A levels in these mRNA transcripts.

A Belgian study.,452-454,S0009-9120(16)30219-3 [pii] 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2016.12.006 [doi],"This retrospective multicenter study in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase was undertaken to confirm the clinical relevance of imatinib plasma concentrations monitoring in daily practice. Forty-one patients, with 47 imatinib plasma measurements, were analyzed during treatment with imatinib given at a fixed 400mg daily dose. A significant inverse relationship of imatinib concentration with the patients' weight was observed (Pearson's test: p=0.02, R(2)=0.1). More interestingly, patients with poor response (switched to another tyrosine kinase inhibitor because of imatinib failure, or because of disease progression after an initial response) displayed a significantly lower mean imatinib concentration as compared to patients maintained on imatinib (822ng/mL vs 1099ng/mL; Student's t-test, p=0.04). Failure or disease progression occurred more often in patients in the lowest quartile of imatinib concentrations compared to patients in the highest quartile (p=0.02, logrank test). No correlation could be established with other biological or clinical parameter, including complete cytogenic response and major molecular response. IN CONCLUSION: in patients treated with imatinib at a fixed daily dose of 400mg, imatinib plasma concentrations decreased with increasing body weight and were lower in patients switched to another tyrosine kinase inhibitor due to imatinib failure. Systematic determination of imatinib plasma trough levels should be encouraged in such patients.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and HTLV-1 associated neurological disorders including mainly HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/Tropical spastic paraparesis. The involvement of the central nervous diseases occurs among: HTLV-1 infected patients from endemic areas, HIV positive individuals and drug users. The ability of HTLV-1 to cause associated neuropathies starts with the virus crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB), then entering and infecting the cells of the central nervous system. As a consequence, to the viral attack, HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha, Interleukin 1 beta and interleukin 6 which further disrupts the BBB. Different serological tests have been used in the diagnosis of HTLV-1. These include: ELISA, Western Blotting (WB), Immunofluorescence, Particle Agglutination and Polymerase Chain Reaction which is used as a confirmatory test. Danazol, pentoxifylline, azathioprine and vitamin C have been used in the treatment of the HTLV-1 associated neurological disorders. Other antiviral drugs (lamivudine, zidovudine), monoclonal antibodies (Daclizumab) and therapeutic agents (valporic acid, interferons) have also been evaluated. No known drug, so far, has been shown to be efficacious. The aim of this review is to present the complexities of HTLV-1 associated neurological disorders and their current ongoing treatment. In addition to discussing future possible therapeutic strategies, by targeting HTVL-1 viral components and gene/s products, for the treatment of those neurological conditions.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Khan, Muhammad Yasir', 'Khan, Ishaq Nasib', 'Farman, Muhammad', 'Al Karim, Saleh', 'Qadri, Ishtiaq', 'Kamal, Muhammad Amjad', 'Al Ghamdi, Khalid', 'Harakeh, Steve']","['Khan MY', 'Khan IN', 'Farman M', 'Al Karim S', 'Qadri I', 'Kamal MA', 'Al Ghamdi K', 'Harakeh S']","['Center of Biotechnology and Microbiology, University of Peshawar, Peshawar 25000, Pakistan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Khyber Medical University, Peshawar 25100, Pakistan.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Center of Innovation in Personalized Medicines, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Special Infectious Unit, King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Enzymoics, 7 Peterlee Place, Hebersham, NSW 2770.', 'Novel Global Community Educational Foundation, Australia.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Fahd Medical Research Center, King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia; Enzymoics, 7 Peterlee Place, Hebersham, NSW 2770; Novel Global Community Educational Foundation.

The inclusion criterion regarding HLA disparities was three or fewer antigen mismatches in the graft-versus-host direction at the HLA-A, B, and DR loci. Four patients received spousal SCT as a third transplant attempt after post-transplant relapse and one as rescue for graft rejection. The reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen consisted of fludarabine, melphalan, and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) with 3 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) for relapse cases and ATG plus 4 Gy of TBI for the rejection case. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus, methylprednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil. Peripheral blood stem cells were transplanted. Granulocyte engraftment was achieved in all cases between days 9 and 11 (median, 10) with complete spousal chimerism. In three of the five patients, no acute GVHD was observed, while one case developed grade III GVHD and one case grade IV. All four patients evaluable for the anti-leukemic effect achieved complete remission; however, all relapsed between 106 and 334 day post-transplant, and died between days 152 and 548.

This acid overload must be counterbalanced with a high rate of H(+) extrusion to maintain cell viability. In this sense, many H(+) transporters have been reported to be crucial for cell survival and proposed as antineoplastic target. By the way, voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1) mediate highly selective H(+) outward currents, capable to compensate acid burden in brief periods of time. This structure is canonically described acting as NADPH oxidase counterbalance in reactive oxygen species production. In this work, we show, for the first time in a oncohematologic cell line, that inhibition of Hv1 channels by Zn(2+) and the more selective blocker 2-(6-chloro-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)guanidine (ClGBI) progressively decreases intracellular pH in resting conditions. This acidification is evident minutes after blockade and progresses under prolonged exposure (2, 17, and 48 h), and we firstly demonstrate that this is followed by cell death through apoptosis (annexin V binding).

The target of miR-149-5p was predicted by using the microRNA.org database, and verified by RT-PCR, Western blot, and Dual-Luciferase reporter assays. Further, small interfering RNA (siRNA) against the target gene was co-transfected with miR-149-5p inhibitor, and then the cell apoptosis and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins were assessed. RESULTS MiR-149-5p was significantly up-regulated in leukemia cell lines and samples from leukemia patients (P<0.01 or P<0.001), especially in THP-1 cells and samples from AML patients. Cell apoptosis was significantly decreased by miR-149-5p overexpression (P<0.01) and increased by miR-149-5p suppression (P<0.05). Fas Ligand (FASLG) was a direct target of miR-149-5p, and was negatively regulated by miR-149-5p. More importantly, the inductive effects of miR-149-5p suppression on cell apoptosis were abrogated by si-FASLG (P<0.01). Furthermore, the up-regulative effects of miR-149-5p suppression on the phosphorylated form of Fas-associated via death domain (p-FADD), caspase-8, caspase-2, caspase-3, and the cleaved forms of these caspases were abrogated by si-FASLG. CONCLUSIONS Inhibition of miR-149-5p can induce apoptosis in THP-1 cells. These inductive effects might be via targeting FASLG and activating FADD and caspases.",,"['Tian, Peijun', 'Yan, Li']","['Tian P', 'Yan L']","['Department of Haematology, Ankang City Central Hospitalg, Ankang, Shaanxi, China (mainland).', 'Tumor Department of Hematology, Shaanxi Province Chinese Medicine Hospital, Ankang, Shaanxi, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161225,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/12/26 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2016/12/26 06:00'],"['2016/12/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['899114 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.899114 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2016 Dec 25;22:5116-5123. doi: 10.12659/msm.899114.,,"['0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (MIRN149 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,PMC5207011,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,

METHODS: A case scenario and a review of the literature related to the pertinent facts concerning DIC are provided. RESULTS: DIC is a systemic pathophysiologic process and not a single disease entity, resulting from an overwhelming activation of coagulation that consumes platelets and coagulation factors and causes microvascular fibrin thrombi, which can result in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome from tissue ischemia. Some conditions associated with acute DIC include septic shock, exsanguinating trauma, burns, or acute promyelocytic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The massive tissue factor stimulus results in excess intravascular thrombin, which overcomes the anticoagulant systems and leads to thrombosis. Because of consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, DIC also has a hemorrhagic phase. Treatment of the bleeding patient with DIC is supportive with the use of blood components.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2016. All rights reserved.

METHODS: We examined the ex vivo cytotoxic activity of CPX-351 against leukemic cells isolated from 53 AML patients and an additional 127 samples including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasms, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma. We assessed activity with respect to common molecular lesions and used flow cytometry to assess CPX-351 cellular uptake. RESULTS: AML specimen sensitivity to CPX-351 was similar across conventional risk groups. FLT3-ITD cases were five-fold more sensitive to CPX-351. CPX-351 was active across other indications with nearly all cases exhibiting IC50 values markedly lower than reported 72-h plasma drug concentration in patients receiving CPX-351. The range and distribution of CPX-351 IC50 values were comparable for AML, CLL, and ALL, whereas MDS/MPN cases were less sensitive. CPX-351 uptake analysis revealed a correlation between uptake of CPX-351 and cytotoxic potency. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with clinical data, in which CPX-351 activity is retained in high-risk AML patients. Ex vivo analysis of cytotoxic potency may provide a means to identify specific AML subsets, such as FLT3-ITD, that benefit most from CPX-351 and warrant additional clinical evaluation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Fostamatinib (R406) and entospletinib (GS-9973) are ATP-competitive inhibitors designed to target spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) that have shown clinical activity with acceptable toxicity in trials with CLL patients. Preclinical studies with these inhibitors in CLL have focused on their effect in patient-derived leukemic B cells. In this work we show that clinically relevant doses of R406 and GS-9973 impaired the activation and proliferation of T cells from CLL patients. This effect could not be ascribed to Syk-inhibition given that we show that T cells from CLL patients do not express Syk protein. Interestingly, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP)-70 phosphorylation was diminished by both inhibitors upon TCR stimulation on T cells. In addition, we found that both agents reduced macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of rituximab-coated CLL cells. Overall, these results suggest that in CLL patients treated with R406 or GS-9973 T cell functions, as well as macrophage-mediated anti-tumor activity of rituximab, might be impaired.

We therefore performed a meta-analysis to systemically evaluate the associations. Eligible studies were identified by a search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and article reference lists. We pooled risk estimates from individual studies using a random-effect model to quantify the associations between intakes of specific carotenoids and NHL risk. A total of 10 (7 case-control and 3 cohort) studies met our inclusion criteria. In the highest versus lowest analyses, intakes of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin, but not lycopene or beta-cryptoxanthin, were associated with a significant reduced risk of NHL. The estimated summary relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin were 0.87 (0.78-0.97), 0.80 (0.68-0.94), and 0.82 (0.69-0.97), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that evidence supporting these protective associations was mostly based on studies with a case-control design. In addition, intakes of alpha-carotene and beta-carotene were associated with a significant decreased risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, but not follicular lymphoma or small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. There was a significant inverse dose-response relationship between alpha-carotene intake and NHL risk (13% lower risk per 1000 mug/day increment of intake). In conclusion, our findings suggest that higher intakes of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and lutein/zeaxanthin might protect against NHL development. Further cohort studies with a control of plausible confounding are needed to confirm these associations.",,"['Chen, Feifei', 'Hu, Jiyi', 'Liu, Ping', 'Li, Jing', 'Wei, Zheng', 'Liu, Peng']","['Chen F', 'Hu J', 'Liu P', 'Li J', 'Wei Z', 'Liu P']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'School of Nursing, Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, Sichuan, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, 180 Fenglin Road, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China. liu.peng@zs-hospital.sh.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,20161224,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Carotenoids/*administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Lutein/*administration & dosage', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*prevention & control', 'Observational Studies as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Zeaxanthins/*administration & dosage', 'beta Carotene/*administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['Carotenoids', 'Dose-response', 'Meta-analysis', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'Risk']",2016/12/25 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2016/12/25 06:00'],"['2016/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2898-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2898-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2017 Jun;96(6):957-965. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2898-1.

High proviral load (PVL) is a risk factor for the progression to ATL. We previously reported that some asymptomatic carriers had severely reduced functions of CTLs against HTLV-1 Tax, the major target Ag. Furthermore, the CTL responses tended to be inversely correlated with PVL, suggesting that weak HTLV-1-specific CTL responses may be involved in the elevation of PVL. Our previous animal studies indicated that oral HTLV-1 infection, the major route of infection, caused persistent infection with higher PVL in rats compared with other routes. In this study, we found that Tax-specific CD8(+) T cells were present, but not functional, in orally infected rats as observed in some human asymptomatic carriers. Even in the infected rats with immune unresponsiveness against Tax, Tax-specific CTL epitope-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) therapy reduced the PVL and induced Tax-specific CD8(+) T cells capable of proliferating and producing IFN-gamma. Furthermore, we found that monocyte-derived DCs from most infected individuals still had the capacity to stimulate CMV-specific autologous CTLs in vitro, indicating that DC therapy may be applicable to most infected individuals. These data suggest that peptide-pulsed DC immunotherapy will be useful to induce functional HTLV-1-specific CTLs and decrease PVL in infected individuals with high PVL and impaired HTLV-1-specific CTL responses, thereby reducing the risk of the development of ATL.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Ando, Satomi', 'Hasegawa, Atsuhiko', 'Murakami, Yuji', 'Zeng, Na', 'Takatsuka, Natsuko', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Masuda, Takao', 'Suehiro, Youko', 'Kannagi, Mari']","['Ando S', 'Hasegawa A', 'Murakami Y', 'Zeng N', 'Takatsuka N', 'Maeda Y', 'Masuda T', 'Suehiro Y', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan; hase.impt@tmd.ac.jp.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka Minami Medical Center, Osaka 586-8521, Japan; and.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Therapy, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka 811-1395, Japan.', 'Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161223,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology/*therapy/virology', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', '*Vaccination', 'Viral Load']",,,2016/12/25 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2016/12/25 06:00'],"['2016/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1601557 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1601557 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 Feb 1;198(3):1210-1219. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1601557.

Meetings are held every two years since 2005 and evidence-based recommendations are elaborated after evaluation of the literature and discussion among specialists of nearly all European countries. In this manuscript, the ECIL group presents the 2015-update of the recommendations for the targeted treatment of invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Current data now allow a very strong recommendation in favor of echinocandins for first-line therapy of candidemia irrespective of the underlying predisposing factors.

Here, constitutive expression of PRL-3 in human AML cells sustains leukemogenesis in vitro and in vivo Furthermore, PRL-3 phosphatase activity dependently upregulates LIN28B, a stem cell reprogramming factor, which in turn represses the let-7 mRNA family, inducing a stem cell-like transcriptional program. Notably, elevated levels of LIN28B protein independently associate with worse survival in AML patients. Thus, these results establish a novel signaling axis involving PRL-3/LIN28B/let-7, which confers stem cell-like properties to leukemia cells that is important for leukemogenesis.Implications: The current study offers a rationale for targeting PRL-3 as a therapeutic approach for a subset of AML patients with poor prognosis.

LSC maintenance is related, at least in part, to signals from the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM). Our previous studies have shown that Wnt signaling from the BMM contributes to preservation of CML LSC following TKI treatment. Secretion of Wnt ligands requires their modification by the O-acyl transferase Porcupine (PORCN). Here we investigated the activity of a potent and selective PORCN inhibitor, WNT974, against CML stem and progenitor cells. WNT974 efficiently antagonized Wnt signaling in human CML CD34(+) cells, and in combination with the TKI nilotinib (NIL) significantly enhanced inhibition of proliferation and colony-forming potential of CML stem and progenitor cells and reduced their growth in immunodeficient mice in vivo, in comparison with NIL alone. Treatment of transgenic CML mice in vivo with NIL in combination with WNT974 significantly reduced leukemic stem and progenitor cell numbers, reduced regeneration of leukemic long-term hematopoietic stem cells in secondary transplant recipients, and enhanced survival of mice after discontinuation of treatment, in comparison with NIL alone. CML progenitors demonstrated enhanced sensitivity to Wnt stimulation, associated with increased expression of the FZD4 receptor. FZD4 knockdown inhibited CML progenitor growth.

As clinical responses vary, improved knowledge regarding activation and regulation of BCR signaling in individual patients is needed. Here, using phosphospecific flow cytometry to obtain malignant B-cell signaling profiles from 95 patients representing 4 types of NHL revealed a striking contrast between chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumors. Lymphoma cells from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients had high basal phosphorylation levels of most measured signaling nodes, whereas follicular lymphoma cells represented the opposite pattern with no or very low basal levels. MCL showed large interpatient variability in basal levels, and elevated levels for the phosphorylated forms of AKT, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, p38, STAT1, and STAT5 were associated with poor outcome. CLL tumors had elevated basal levels for the phosphorylated forms of BCR-signaling nodes (Src family tyrosine kinase, spleen tyrosine kinase [SYK], phospholipase Cgamma), but had low alpha-BCR-induced signaling. This contrasted MCL tumors, where alpha-BCR-induced signaling was variable, but significantly potentiated as compared with the other types. Overexpression of CD79B, combined with a gating strategy whereby signaling output was directly quantified per cell as a function of CD79B levels, confirmed a direct relationship between surface CD79B, immunoglobulin M (IgM), and IgM-induced signaling levels. Furthermore, alpha-BCR-induced signaling strength was variable across patient samples and correlated with BCR subunit CD79B expression, but was inversely correlated with susceptibility to Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and SYK inhibitors in MCL. These individual differences in BCR levels and signaling might relate to differences in therapy responses to BCR-pathway inhibitors.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Myklebust, June H', 'Brody, Joshua', 'Kohrt, Holbrook E', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Czerwinski, Debra K', 'Walchli, Sebastien', 'Green, Michael R', 'Troen, Gunhild', 'Liestol, Knut', 'Beiske, Klaus', 'Houot, Roch', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Alizadeh, Ash A', 'Irish, Jonathan M', 'Levy, Ronald']","['Myklebust JH', 'Brody J', 'Kohrt HE', 'Kolstad A', 'Czerwinski DK', 'Walchli S', 'Green MR', 'Troen G', 'Liestol K', 'Beiske K', 'Houot R', 'Delabie J', 'Alizadeh AA', 'Irish JM', 'Levy R']","['Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Center for Cancer Biomedicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Lymphoma Immunotherapy Program, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Cancer Clinic, Department of Oncology, and.', 'Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Center for Cancer Biomedicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cellular Therapy, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Eppley Institute for Cancer Research, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.', 'Cancer Clinic, Department of Pathology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Center for Cancer Biomedicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Informatics, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Cancer Clinic, Department of Pathology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rennes, Rennes, France."", 'INSERM U917, Universite de Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161223,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'CD79 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Syk Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/12/25 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2016/12/25 06:00'],"['2016/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33715-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-05-718494 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Feb 9;129(6):759-770. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-05-718494.

The study covers four conventional and 11 new-generation anticancer drugs. Four parameters were analyzed simultaneously in leukemia and normal lymphocytes treated with drug, melatonin, or their combination: cell viability, induction of apoptosis, level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and level of protein-carbonyl products. Almost all investigated combinations of melatonin with new-generation anticancer drugs were characterized by synergistic cytotoxicity towards leukemia lymphocytes, while the combinations with conventional drugs exhibited additive or antagonistic effects on cell viability. In leukemia lymphocytes, the additive cytotoxicity of doxorubicin plus melatonin was accompanied by low levels of ROS and protein-carbonyl products, as well as by suppression of apoptosis. In normal lymphocytes, none of the studied parameters changed significantly compared to cells treated with doxorubicin only. The combinations of everolimus plus melatonin and barasertib plus melatonin exhibited impressive synergistic cytotoxic effects on leukemia lymphocytes but did not affect the viability of normal lymphocytes. In leukemia cells, the synergistic cytotoxicity was accompanied by strong induction of apoptosis but a decrease of ROS to a level below that of the control. In normal lymphocytes, these combinations did not affect the level of ROS nor of protein-carbonyl products, and did not induce apoptosis. The data suggest that melatonin is a promising supplementary component in chemotherapy which allows the therapeutic doses of anticancer drugs to be reduced, minimizing their side-effects.","['Copyright(c) 2017 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']","['Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Ivanova, Donika', 'Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Aoki, Ichio', 'Higashi, Tatsuya']","['Zhelev Z', 'Ivanova D', 'Bakalova R', 'Aoki I', 'Higashi T']","['Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Institute of Biophysics & Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Chiba, Japan bakalova.rumiana@qst.go.jp.', 'Medical Faculty, Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, National Institute for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Carbonylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['Melatonin', 'anticancer drugs', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia lymphocytes', 'normal lymphocytes', 'reactive oxygen species']",2016/12/25 06:00,2017/01/31 06:00,['2016/12/25 06:00'],"['2016/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['37/1/149 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11300 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Jan;37(1):149-159. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11300.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A five drug induction protocol for ALL was initiated; post induction consolidation was with HiDAC (3 g/m(2) IV every 12 h on days 1, 3 and 5). Post consolidation, cytogenetic remission was attained and he received an intensification and maintenance regimen for ALL, for a period of approximately 24 months. Four months following the completion of his treatment, the patient relapsed within the central nervous system (CNS). Intravenous salvage chemotherapy was initiated using a combination of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2), followed by cytarabine 2 g/m(2) 4 h later on days 1 through 5 (FA). On day # 23 of FA, he developed a severe headache. A gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed increased intracranial pressure. On day # 25, ophthalmology examination suggested bilateral papilledema. He was started on acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily. He had spontaneous resolution of his symptoms. The patient had no recurrence of papilledema or any other neurological symptoms. Intracranial hypertension secondary to HiDAC, is an exceedingly rare complication and is not regularly associated as a common side effect of cytarabine administration. Prompt action in diagnosing and treating intracranial hypertension will save the patient from consequences, such as loss of vision, that are prevalent in this condition.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

Theoretical studies suggested that the coordinated methanol molecule can be easily replaced by DMSO used in the preparation of stock solutions, with the formation of [In(L)Cl2(DMSO)] (HL = thiosemicarbazonate ligand), and that the replacement of DMSO by water is unfavorable. However, for all complexes the displacement of one or two chloride ligands by water in aqueous solution is extremely favorable. The cytotoxic activity of the compounds was evaluated against HL-60, Jurkat and THP-1 leukemia and against MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 solid tumor cell lines, as well as against Vero non-malignant cells. The cytotoxicity and selectivity indexes (SI) increased in several cases for the indium(iii) complexes in comparison with the free thiosemicarbazones. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was investigated against Candida albicans, Candida dubliniensis, Candida lusitaniae and Candida parapsilosis. In many cases complexation resulted in a substantial increase of the antifungal activity. Complexes (1-4) were revealed to be very active against C. lusitaniae and C. dubliniensis.

RECENT FINDINGS: Impairments in processing speed, working memory, executive function and attention continue to be demonstrated in survivors of childhood cancers. Children receiving radiation treatment for their cancer demonstrate greater impairment than those who undergo surgery and/or chemotherapy without radiation. However, CRCI still occurs in the absence of radiation treatment, particularly in the domain of attention. Recent neuroimaging studies highlight atypical connectivity of white matter and its associations with cognitive performance. Given impairments in cognitive function and associated neuroanatomical factors, it is not surprising that survivors of childhood cancers experience academic difficulties. However, early intervention may provide one means of improving cognitive and academic outcomes. SUMMARY: Children with cancer are at risk of impairment in the domains of processing speed, attention, working memory and executive function. Those who receive radiation are likely to experience greater CRCI than those who do not receive this treatment. All survivors of childhood cancers should be carefully monitored to provide support and implement evidence-based interventions to ameliorate cognitive late effects.",,"['Hutchinson, Amanda D', 'Pfeiffer, Susan M', 'Wilson, Carlene']","['Hutchinson AD', 'Pfeiffer SM', 'Wilson C']","['aSchool of Psychology, Social Work & Social Policy, University of South Australia Adelaide, SA, Australia bFlinders Centre for Innovation in Cancer, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia cCancer Council South Australia, Eastwood, SA, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,,United States,Curr Opin Support Palliat Care,Current opinion in supportive and palliative care,101297402,IM,"['Academic Success', 'Cancer Survivors/psychology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Cognition/physiology', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",,,2016/12/24 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2016/12/24 06:00'],"['2016/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/SPC.0000000000000258 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2017 Mar;11(1):70-75. doi: 10.1097/SPC.0000000000000258.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using information available in population-based Swedish registries, we evaluated indices of health, education and economy from the 980 patients in the Swedish CML register diagnosed between 2002 and 2012. Apart from internal comparisons, five age-, gender- and region-matched control subjects per patient served as control cohort. Median follow-up time from CML diagnosis was 4.8 years. RESULTS: Among patients with CML, low personal or household income, short education, living alone, poor performance status and high age (>60 years) were significantly associated with an inferior survival (in univariate analyses). However, similar findings were noted also in the matched control group, and in comparisons adjusted for calendar year, age and performance status, socio-economic variables were not significantly associated with CML survival. Meanwhile, both education and income were independently linked to TKI treatment overall and to upfront treatment with second-generation TKIs. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, socio-economic conditions were associated with survival in the studied CML cohort but these associations could be explained by differences at baseline.

METHODS: Results of ESA therapy were analyzed in 163 MF patients with severe anemia, most of whom had inadequate erythropoietin (EPO) levels (<125 U/L) at treatment start. RESULTS: According to the revised criteria of the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Treatment and Research, anemia response was achieved in 86 patients (53%). Median response duration was 19.3 months. In multivariate analysis, baseline factors associated with a higher response rate were female sex (P=.007), leukocyte count >/=10x10(9) /L (P=.033), and serum ferritin <200 ng/mL (P=.002). Patients with 2 or 3 of the above features had a significantly higher response rate than the remainder (73% vs 28%, respectively; P<.001). Over the 373 patient-years of follow-up on ESA treatment, nine patients developed thrombotic complications (six arterial, three venous), accounting for 2.41 events per 100 patient-years. Survival time from ESA start was longer in anemia responders than in non-responders (P=.011).

Here we show that YB-1 protein is highly enriched in the nuclei of activated T cells and malignant human T-ALL cell lines but not in resting T cells. YB-1 S(102) mutations that either mimic (S102D) or prevent phosphorylation (S102N) led to accumulation of YB-1 in the nucleus of T cells or strictly excluded it, respectively. Inactivation of ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) was sufficient to abrogate T-cell and T-ALL cell proliferation, suggesting that RSK mediates cell-cycle progression, possibly dependent on YB-1-phosphorylation. Indeed, phosphomimetic YB-1(S102D) enhanced proliferation implying that S(102) phosphorylation is a prerequisite for malignant T-cell proliferation. At initial diagnosis of T-ALL, YB-1 localization was significantly altered in the nuclei of tumor blasts derived from bone marrow or peripheral blood. Our data show deregulated YB-1 in the nucleus as a yet unreported characteristic of T-ALL blasts and may refine strategies to restrict progression of hematopoietic tumors.",,"['Gieseler-Halbach, Steffi', 'Meltendorf, Stefan', 'Pierau, Mandy', 'Weinert, Soenke', 'Heidel, Florian H', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Handschuh, Juliane', 'Braun-Dullaeus, Ruediger C', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Lindquist, Jonathan A', 'Mertens, Peter R', 'Thomas, Ulrich', 'Brunner-Weinzierl, Monika C']","['Gieseler-Halbach S', 'Meltendorf S', 'Pierau M', 'Weinert S', 'Heidel FH', 'Fischer T', 'Handschuh J', 'Braun-Dullaeus RC', 'Schrappe M', 'Lindquist JA', 'Mertens PR', 'Thomas U', 'Brunner-Weinzierl MC']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology and Angiology, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine II, Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Leibniz-Institute on Aging, Fritz-Lipmann-Institute, Jena 07745, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Department of Neurochemistry and Molecular Biology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg 39118, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Cardiology and Angiology, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Centre Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Clinic of Nephrology, Hypertension, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Clinic of Nephrology, Hypertension, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.', 'Department of Neurochemistry and Molecular Biology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology, Magdeburg 39118, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University Hospital, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg 39120, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161223,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enterotoxins/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monosaccharides/pharmacology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Y-Box-Binding Protein 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/12/24 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2016/12/24 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2016141 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2016.141 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2017 Feb;24(2):371-383. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2016.141.

A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of the medical records of 328 patients with ALL identified 4 cases with ON, corresponding to 1.2% of all cases observed.

Regarding the lesion size of ON, in all cases the femoral head (monolateral in 1 case and bilateral in 3 cases) was involved and was associated with the scapula-humeral joint in one case. ON of the weight-bearing joints has been identified as a severe complication in children with leukemia that may be associated with the development of articular surface collapse, subsequent debilitating arthritis, sometimes needing arthroplasty.

In vitro analysis demonstrated a significant increase in IL-26 production by CD4 T cells following CD26 costimulation, while immunoglobulin Fc domain fused with the N-terminal of caveolin-1, the ligand for CD26, (Cav-Ig) effectively inhibited production of IL-26.

We now confirm that PIM2 is overexpressed in multiple myeloma (MM) patients, and within MM group it is overexpressed in the high-risk MF subset (activation of proto-oncogenes MAF/MAFB). This is consistent with our finding of PIM2's role in key signaling pathways (IL-6, CD28 activation) that confer chemotherapy resistance in MM cells. These studies have identified a novel PIM2-selective non-ATP competitive inhibitor (JP11646) that has a 4 to 760-fold greater suppression of MM proliferation and viability than ATP-competitive PIM inhibitors. This increased efficacy is due not only to the inhibition of PIM2 kinase activity, but also to a novel mechanism involving specific downregulation of PIM2 mRNA and protein expression not seen with the ATP competitive inhibitors. Treatment with JP11646 in xenogeneic myeloma murine models demonstrated significant reduction in tumor burden and increased median survival.

JAK2 has the potential to activate multiple other signaling molecules, either directly through downstream effectors, or indirectly through induction of target gene expression. We have interrogated myeloproliferative signaling in myelofibrosis (MF) and secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) patient samples using mass cytometry, which allows the quantitative measurement of multiple signaling molecules simultaneously at the single-cell level, in cell populations representing a nearly complete spectrum of hematopoiesis. MF and sAML malignant cells demonstrated a high prevalence of hyperactivation of the JAK-STAT, MAP kinase, PI3 kinase and NFkappaB signaling pathways. Constitutive NFkappaB signaling was evident across MF and sAML patients. A supporting gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of MF showed many NFkappaB target genes to be expressed above normal levels in MF patient CD34+ cells.

Compared with MM patients diagnosed in earlier years, those diagnosed after 2010 had higher rates of novel therapy use and better survival outcomes; patients diagnosed in 2012 were 1.25 times more likely to survive 2 years than those diagnosed in 2006. MM patients showed improved survival over the study period, with the 2-year survival gap between MM patients and matched controls decreasing at a rate of 3% per year. Total costs among MM patients have increased in all healthcare services over the years; however, the relative contribution of drug costs has remained fairly stable since 2009 despite new novel therapies coming to market. Findings from this study corroborate clinical data, suggesting a paradigm shift in MM treatment over the past decade that is associated with substantial survival gains.

Salvage ASCT at first relapse may still effectively rescue patients who did not receive upfront ASCT. To evaluate the long-term benefit of upfront ASCT vs CC+R and the impact of salvage ASCT in patients who received upfront CC+R, we conducted a pooled analysis of 2 phase III trials (RV-MM-209 and EMN-441). Primary endpoints were PFS1, progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), overall survival (OS). A total of 268 patients were randomized to 2 courses of melphalan 200 mg/m(2) and ASCT (MEL200-ASCT) and 261 to CC+R. Median follow-up was 46 months. MEL200-ASCT significantly improved PFS1 (median: 42 vs 24 months, HR 0.53; P<0.001), PFS2 (4 years: 71 vs 54%, HR 0.53, P<0.001) and OS (4 years: 84 vs 70%, HR 0.51, P<0.001) compared with CC+R. The advantage was noticed in good and bad prognosis patients. Only 53% of patients relapsing from CC+R received ASCT at first relapse. Upfront ASCT significantly reduced the risk of death (HR 0.51; P=0.007) in comparison with salvage ASCT.

However, the mechanisms of action of idelalisib in colon cancer cells are not well understood. We investigated how idelalisib suppresses colon cancer cells growth and potentiates effects of other chemotherapeutic drugs. In this study, we found that idelalisib treatment induces PUMA in colon cancer cells irrespective of p53 status through the p65 pathway following AKT inhibition and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) activation. PUMA is necessary for idelalisib-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Idelalisib also synergized with 5-FU or regorafenib to induce marked apoptosis via PUMA in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, PUMA deficiency suppressed apoptosis and antitumor effect of idelalisib in xenograft model. These results demonstrate a critical role of PUMA in mediating the anticancer effects of idelalisib in colon cancer cells and suggest that PUMA induction can be used as an indicator of idelalisib sensitivity, and also have important implications for it clinical applications.",,"['Yang, Shida', 'Zhu, Zhiyong', 'Zhang, Xiaobing', 'Zhang, Ning', 'Yao, Zhicheng']","['Yang S', 'Zhu Z', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang N', 'Yao Z']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The People's Hospital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The People's Hospital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The People's Hospital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shenyang, China.', ""Department of Neurology, The People's Hospital of Liaoning Province, Shenyang, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Purines/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Quinazolinones/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'eIF-2 Kinase/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['GSK3beta', 'PUMA', 'apoptosis', 'colon cancer', 'idelalisib']",2016/12/23 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/12/24 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['14043 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.14043 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 24;8(4):6102-6113. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.14043.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '24T2A1DOYB (regorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",,,,PMC5351616,,,,,,,,,

This is a serious global health problem because arsenic is a Group 1 (proven) human carcinogen and chronic exposure is known to cause skin, lung, and bladder tumors. Furthermore, arsenic exposure can result in a myriad of other adverse health effects including diseases of the cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, reproductive, and endocrine systems. In addition to chronic environmental exposure to arsenic, arsenic trioxide is approved for the clinical treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and is in clinical trials for other hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors. Considerable inter-individual variability in susceptibility to arsenic-induced disease and toxicity exists, and the reasons for such differences are incompletely understood. Transport pathways that influence the cellular uptake and export of arsenic contribute to regulating its cellular, tissue, and ultimately body levels. In the current review, membrane proteins (including phosphate transporters, aquaglyceroporin channels, solute carrier proteins, and ATP-binding cassette transporters) shown experimentally to contribute to the passage of inorganic, methylated, and/or glutathionylated arsenic species across cellular membranes are discussed.

Although mimicking leukemic bone marrow niche relies on two-dimensional (2D) culture conditions, it cannot recapitulate complex bone marrow structure that causes introduction of different three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. Simultaneously, microfluidic platform by perfusing medium culture mimic interstitial fluid flow, along with 3D scaffold would help for mimicking bone marrow microenvironment. In this study TF-1 cells were cocultured with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in 2D and 3D microfluidic devices. Phenotype maintenance during cell culture and proliferation rate was assayed and confirmed by cell cycle analysis. Morphology of cells in 2D and 3D culture conditions was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. After these experiments, drug screening was performed by applying azacitidine and cytarabine and cytotoxicity assay and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) were done to compare drug resistance in 2D and 3D culture conditions. Our result shows leukemic cells in 3D microfluidic device retaining their phenotype and proliferation rate was significantly higher in 3D culture condition in comparison to 2D culture condition (p < 0.05), which was confirmed by cell cycle analysis. Cytotoxicity assay also illustrated drug resistance in 3D culture condition and qRT-PCR demonstrated higher BCL2 expression in 3D microfluidic device in contrast to 2D microfluidic device (p < 0.05). On balance, mimicking bone marrow niche would help the target therapy and specify the role of niche in development of leukemia in AML patients.",,"['Houshmand, Mohammad', 'Soleimani, Masoud', 'Atashi, Amir', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Abdollahi, Mohammad', 'Nikougoftar Zarif, Mahin']","['Houshmand M', 'Soleimani M', 'Atashi A', 'Saglio G', 'Abdollahi M', 'Nikougoftar Zarif M']","['1 Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine , Tehran, Iran .', '2 Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University , Tehran, Iran .', '3 Stem cell and Tissue Engineering Research Center, Shahroud University of Medical Sciences , Shahroud, Iran .', '4 Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, ""S.

We studied role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptosis in nilotinib toxicity using a complex approach. Nilotinib impaired mitochondrial function and induced formation of ROS under clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, ability of nilotinib to induce ER stress has been shown. These events result in apoptotic cell death. All these mechanisms contribute to cytotoxic effect of the drug.

The developed analysis software identified microrafts on the array with greater than 99% sensitivity and cells on the microrafts with 100% sensitivity. The software enabled time-lapse imaging and the use of temporally varying characteristics as sort criteria. The automated hardware released microrafts with 98% efficiency and collected released microrafts with 100% efficiency. The automated system was used to examine the temporal variation in EGFP expression in cells transfected with CRISPR-Cas9 components for gene editing. Of 11,499 microrafts possessing a single cell, 220 microrafts were identified as possessing temporally varying EGFP-expression. Candidate cells (n=172) were released and collected from the microraft array and screened for the targeted gene mutation. Two cell colonies were successfully gene edited demonstrating the desired mutation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Tensin (TNS) 1 is a key component of specialized cellular adhesions (fibrillar adhesions) that bind to extracellular fibronectin fibrils. We hypothesized that TNS1 may play a role in modulating myofibroblast-mediated matrix formation. We found that TNS1 expression is increased in fibroblastic foci from lungs with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta profoundly up-regulates TNS1 expression with kinetics that parallel the expression of the myofibroblast marker, smooth muscle alpha-actin. TGF-beta-induced TNS1 expression is dependent on signaling through the TGF-beta receptor 1 and is Rho coiled-coiled kinase/actin/megakaryoblastic leukemia-1/serum response factor dependent. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of TNS1 disrupted TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation, without affecting TGF-beta/Smad signaling. In contrast, loss of TNS1 resulted in disruption of focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, focal adhesion formation, and actin stress fiber development. Finally, TNS1 was essential for the formation of fibrillar adhesions and the assembly of nascent fibronectin and collagen matrix in myofibroblasts. In summary, our data show that TNS1 is a novel megakaryoblastic leukemia-1-dependent gene that is induced during pulmonary fibrosis. TNS1 plays an essential role in TGF-beta-induced myofibroblast differentiation and myofibroblast-mediated formation of extracellular fibronectin and collagen matrix.

Increased TSPO expression is also prominent in several cancerous tissues where it appears to correlate with the degree of malignancy. Currently, TSPO is thus actively investigated as a generic biomarker for disease activity and a therapeutic target for a wide range of diseases. In this study, we report a Jurkat human T cell leukemia cell line that has only trace expression of TSPO mRNA. Through the use of bisulphite genomic sequencing, we show that the Jurkat TSPO promoter is highly methylated except for CpG sites that are adjacent to the transcription start site. Control measurements in HEK-293, HeLa, and U87-MG cells with high TSPO mRNA expression showed low levels of TSPO promoter methylation. Demethylation with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) caused a dose-dependent increase in TSPO mRNA with a corresponding demethylation of the TSPO promoter in Jurkat cells. Treating HeLa and U87-MG cells with 5-aza-dC caused no change in the level of TSPO mRNA. These observations confirm the epigenetic regulation of TSPO and suggest it to be a more common mechanism by which the differential expression of TSPO in various cell types and in health and disease may be explained.",,"['Middleton, Ryan J', 'Kam, Winnie Wai-Ying', 'Liu, Guo-Jun', 'Banati, Richard B']","['Middleton RJ', 'Kam WW', 'Liu GJ', 'Banati RB']","['1 Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization , Lucas Heights, Australia .', '1 Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization , Lucas Heights, Australia .', '2 Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University , Hung Hom, Hong Kong, China .', '1 Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization , Lucas Heights, Australia .', '3 National Imaging Facility, Brain and Mind Centre and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney , Camperdown, Australia .', '1 Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization , Lucas Heights, Australia .', '3 National Imaging Facility, Brain and Mind Centre and Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney , Camperdown, Australia .']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161222,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,IM,"['Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Decitabine', '*Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Receptors, GABA/*deficiency/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Jurkat', 'TSPO', 'methylation']",2016/12/23 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/12/23 06:00'],"['2016/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2016.3385 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2017 Feb;36(2):103-108. doi: 10.1089/dna.2016.3385.

Expert commentary: Although conventional strategies (genome sequencing, morphology assays, and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and/or immunochemistry) have allowed the establishment of the disease stage based on different parameters, it is still necessary to utilize novel approaches (e.g., proteomics) that have the potential to simultaneously analyze thousands of molecules to improve understanding of CLL.",,"['Diez, Paula', 'Gongora, Rafael', 'Orfao, Alberto', 'Fuentes, Manuel']","['Diez P', 'Gongora R', 'Orfao A', 'Fuentes M']","['a Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus , Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL) , Salamanca , Spain.', 'b Proteomics Unit , Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL) , Salamanca , Spain.', 'a Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus , Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL) , Salamanca , Spain.', 'a Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus , Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL) , Salamanca , Spain.', 'a Department of Medicine and General Cytometry Service-Nucleus , Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL) , Salamanca , Spain.', 'b Proteomics Unit , Cancer Research Centre (IBMCC/CSIC/USAL/IBSAL) , Salamanca , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161230,England,Expert Rev Proteomics,Expert review of proteomics,101223548,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proteomics/*methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL heterogeneity', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*cytogenetics', '*proteomics', '*signaling pathways']",2016/12/23 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2016/12/23 06:00'],"['2016/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14789450.2017.1275967 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Proteomics. 2017 Feb;14(2):137-146. doi: 10.1080/14789450.2017.1275967.

In the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology ALL-2008 treatment protocol, treatment stratification in B-lineage ALL is based on results of minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In this study, we determined whether RT-qPCR of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript can be a reliable alternative for MRD analysis. METHODS: Seventy-eight bone marrow samples from 29 children at diagnosis and day 15, 29, and 78 during treatment were analyzed for MRD with FACS and with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Fusion transcript MRD was defined as the ETV6-RUNX1/GUSB ratio at the follow-up time point (day 15/29/78) divided with the ETV6-RUNX1/GUSB ratio at diagnosis (%). RESULTS: MRD analysis with FACS and with RT-qPCR of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion transcript showed strong correlation. All cases showed concordant results at the treatment stratifying time points day 29 and day 78, when comparing the two methods with a cutoff set to 0.1%.

However, these studies did not analyze minimal residual disease in the CNS at the time of allo-HSCT. We evaluated the effect of residual CNS+ on the transplant outcomes of 214 AML patients in a single institution. Twenty-one (10%) patients were diagnosed with CNS+ prior to allo-HSCT. Of these, 13 patients had CNS disease at the time of allo-HSCT. The patients in CNS+ AML remission at the time of allo-HSCT had better overall survival (OS) than the patients who were not in remission (2-year OS: 55% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.0001).

Some recent studies established the fundamental role of epigenetic aberrations such as DNA hypermethylation, to influence patients' outcome and response to chemotherapy. Moreover, L-asparaginase is an important chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of ALL and resistance to this drug has been linked to ASNS expression, which can be silenced through methylation. Therefore, we tested whether the sensitivity of T-ALL cell lines towards L-asparaginase is correlated to the epigenetic status of ASNS gene and whether the sensitivity can be modified by concurrent demethylating treatment. Hence we treated different T-ALL cell lines with L-asparaginase and correlated different responses to the treatment with ASNS expression. Then we demonstrated that the ASNS expression was dependent on the methylation status of the promoter. Finally we showed that, despite the demethylating effect on the ASNS gene expression, the combined treatment with the demethylating agent Decitabine could synergistically improve the L-asparaginase sensitivity in those T-ALL cell lines characterized by hypermethylation of the ASNS gene. In conclusion, this preclinical study identified an unexpected synergistic activity of L-asparaginase and Decitabine in the subgroup of T-ALL with low ASNS expression due to hypermethylation of the ASNS promoter, while it did not restore sensitivity in the resistant cell lines characterized by higher ASNS expression.",,"['Serravalle, Salvatore', 'Bertuccio, Salvatore N', 'Astolfi, Annalisa', 'Melchionda, Fraia', 'Pession, Andrea']","['Serravalle S', 'Bertuccio SN', 'Astolfi A', 'Melchionda F', 'Pession A']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy; ""Giorgio Prodi"" Cancer Research Center, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, S.Orsola-Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161127,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Asparagine/*administration & dosage', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*genetics', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",,,2016/12/23 06:00,2017/02/01 06:00,['2016/12/23 06:00'],"['2016/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/1985750 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2016;2016:1985750. doi: 10.1155/2016/1985750.

ALL comprises multiple subtypes characterized by distinct genetic alterations, with stereotyped patterns of aneuploidy present in many cases. Although alterations of TP53 are common in many tumors, they are infrequent in ALL, with the exception of two ALL subtypes associated with poor outcome: relapsed disease and ALL with hypodiploidy. TP53 alterations are present in almost all cases of ALL with low hypodiploidy and are associated with alterations of the lymphoid transcription factor IKZF2 and the tumor-suppressor gene loci CDKN2A and CDKN2B. Remarkably, more than half of TP53 mutations in low-hypodiploid ALL in children are present in nontumor cells, indicating that low-hypodiploid ALL is a manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of the genetic pathogenesis of hypodiploid ALL, suggesting that alteration of TP53 function may promote the distinctive aneuploidy characteristic of hypodiploid ALL.

We examined the long-term outcome of patients with newly diagnosed APL treated at our institution on 3 consecutive prospective clinical trials, using the combination of ATRA and ATO, with or without GO. For induction, all patients received ATRA (45 mg/m(2) daily) and ATO (0.15 mg/kg daily) with a dose of GO (9 mg/m(2) on day 1) added to high-risk patients (white blood cell count, >10 x 10(9)/L), as well as low-risk patients who experienced leukocytosis during induction. Once in complete remission, patients received 4 cycles of ATRA plus ATO consolidation. One hundred eighty-seven patients, including 54 with high-risk and 133 with low-risk disease, have been treated. The complete remission rate was 96% (52 of 54 in high-risk and 127 of 133 in low-risk patients). Induction mortality was 4%, with only 7 relapses. Among low-risk patients, 60 patients (45%) required either GO or idarubicin for leukocytosis. Median duration of follow-up was 47.6 months.

B1a cells are characterized by lack of germinal center (GC) development, and the B1a cell population is increased in mice with reduced GC formation. As a major mediator of follicular B-cell migration, the G protein-coupled receptor Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2 or GPR183) directs B-cell migration in the lymphoid follicles in response to its endogenous ligands, oxysterols. Thus, upregulation of EBI2 drives the B cells toward the extrafollicular area, whereas downregulation is essential for GC formation. We therefore speculated whether increased expression of EBI2 would lead to an expanded B1 cell subset and, ultimately, progression to CLL. Here, we demonstrate that B-cell-targeted expression of human EBI2 (hEBI2) in mice reduces GC-dependent immune responses, reduces total immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG levels, and leads to increased proliferation and upregulation of cellular oncogenes. Furthermore, hEBI2 overexpression leads to an abnormally expanded CD5(+) B1a B-cell subset (present as early as 4 days after birth), late-onset lymphoid cancer development, and premature death. These findings are highly similar to those observed in CLL patients and identify EBI2 as a promoter of B-cell malignancies.",,"['Niss Arfelt, Kristine', 'Barington, Line', 'Benned-Jensen, Tau', 'Kubale, Valentina', 'Kovalchuk, Alexander L', 'Daugvilaite, Viktorija', 'Christensen, Jan Pravsgaard', 'Thomsen, Allan Randrup', 'Egerod, Kristoffer L', 'Bassi, Maria R', 'Spiess, Katja', 'Schwartz, Thue W', 'Wang, Hongsheng', 'Morse, Herbert C 3rd', 'Holst, Peter J', 'Rosenkilde, Mette M']","['Niss Arfelt K', 'Barington L', 'Benned-Jensen T', 'Kubale V', 'Kovalchuk AL', 'Daugvilaite V', 'Christensen JP', 'Thomsen AR', 'Egerod KL', 'Bassi MR', 'Spiess K', 'Schwartz TW', 'Wang H', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Holst PJ', 'Rosenkilde MM']","['Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Virology and Cellular Immunology Section, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD; and.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology and.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology and.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology and.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Virology and Cellular Immunology Section, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD; and.', 'Virology and Cellular Immunology Section, Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD; and.', 'Department of Immunology and Microbiology and.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161221,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Germinal Center/cytology/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics/immunology', '*Up-Regulation']",,,2016/12/23 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2016/12/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33691-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-02-697185 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Feb 16;129(7):866-878. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-02-697185.

One feature of cytogenetically normal AML is alterations to the DNA methylome. We analyzed 57 AML patients with normal karyotype by using Illumina's 450k array and showed that aberrant DNA methylation is significantly altered at enhancer regions and that the methylation levels at specific enhancers predict overall survival of AML patients. The majority of sites that become differentially methylated in AML occur in regulatory elements of the human genome. Hypermethylation associates with enhancer silencing. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analyses showed that a subset of hypomethylated sites correlate with enhancer activation, indicated by increased H3K27 acetylation. DNA hypomethylation is therefore not sufficient for enhancer activation. Some sites of hypomethylation occur at weak/poised enhancers marked with H3K4 monomethylation in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Other hypomethylated regions occur at sites inactive in progenitors and reflect the de novo acquisition of AML-specific enhancers. Altered enhancer dynamics are reflected in the gene expression of enhancer target genes, including genes involved in oncogenesis and blood cell development. This study demonstrates that histone variants and different histone modifications interact with aberrant DNA methylation and cause perturbed enhancer activity in cytogenetically normal AML that contributes to a leukemic transcriptome.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Qu, Ying', 'Siggens, Lee', 'Cordeddu, Lina', 'Gaidzik, Verena I', 'Karlsson, Kasper', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Ekwall, Karl', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Lennartsson, Andreas']","['Qu Y', 'Siggens L', 'Cordeddu L', 'Gaidzik VI', 'Karlsson K', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner K', 'Ekwall K', 'Lehmann S', 'Lennartsson A']","['Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, and.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Neurobiology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine Huddinge, and.', 'Hematology Centre, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden; and.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161221,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', '*DNA Methylation', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Code', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcriptome']",,,2016/12/23 06:00,2017/08/17 06:00,['2016/12/23 06:00'],"['2016/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33700-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-07-726877 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Feb 16;129(7):e13-e25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-07-726877.

Here, the mechanism of TSY-1 on cellular Telomerase activity was further investigated using HL60, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood. TSY-1 increases Telomerase activity in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells with innately low Telomerase activity but decreases Telomerase activity in HL60 cells with high intrinsic Telomerase activity, both in a dose-response manner. Gene profiling analysis identified Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) as the potential target gene associated with the TSY-1 effect, which was verified by both RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The beta-galactosidase reporter staining assay showed that the effect of TSY-1 on Telomerase activity correlates with cell senescence. TSY-1 induced hypomethylation within TERT core promoter in HL60 cells but induced hypermethylation within TERT core promoter in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an established treatment for adults with Ph-positive ALL, but relapse remains the primary cause of treatment failure, and is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. The emergence of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) poses a challenge for patients with disease relapses after initial treatment with TKI-containing regimens. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two patients with TKI-resistant recurrent Ph-positive ALL. DIAGNOSES: Ph-positive ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Anti-CD19 CAR T-cell infusion. OUTCOMES: One patient's bone marrow blasts decreased significantly, and the other reached negative minimal residual disease (MRD). However, we first recorded the development of new-onset acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after anti-CD19 CAR T-cell infusion in a patient who received allogeneic HSCT. Our 2 case reports also demonstrate the efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy in the treatment of TKI-resistant Ph-positive ALL. LESSONS: Our report suggests that anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy may be a promising option for the treatment of relapsed Ph-positive ALL after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT. However, caution is due given the possibility of the adverse effects of cytokine release syndrome (CRS)-induced aGVHD for patients receiving allogeneic HSCT.",,"['Zhu, Yang-Min', 'Wu, Zhao', 'Tan, You-Ping', 'Du, Yuan-Yuan', 'Liu, Zhi', 'Ou, Rui-Ming', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Pu, Cheng-Fei', 'Jiang, Jing', 'Wang, Jin-Ping', 'Xiao, Lei', 'Zhang, Qing']","['Zhu YM', 'Wu Z', 'Tan YP', 'Du YY', 'Liu Z', 'Ou RM', 'Liu S', 'Pu CF', 'Jiang J', 'Wang JP', 'Xiao L', 'Zhang Q']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangdong No. 2 Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou Innovative Cellular Therapeutics Co., Ltd.

Although Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1) is considered as a tumor suppressor, few research covers its role in RA. This study aims to reveal effects and potential mechanisms of BRG1 in human FLS cell line MH7A.BRG1 expression in MH7A cells was altered by transfection of overexpression vectors or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Cell viability and apoptosis were detected by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry after transfection. Factors involved in inflammation and apoptosis were quantified by qPCR and Western blot. The interaction between BRG1 and p53 was assessed by immunoprecipitation (IP).Results showed that BRG1 overexpression significantly suppressed MH7A cell viability and induced apoptosis (P < 0.01), and its knockdown had opposite effects. BRG1 reduced mRNA levels of matrix metallopeptidase 3, TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2, cyclooxygenase 2, and interleukin 6, implying its suppressive effects on inflammation. BRG1 interacted with and promoted p53 (P < 0.05). B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 was suppressed (P < 0.05), while cytochrome c, caspase 3 (CASP3) and CASP9 were activated (P < 0.01) by BRG1. However, the regulation on these factors was abrogated by p53 knockdown (P < 0.01).These findings suggest that BRG1 may induce apoptosis and suppress inflammation in MH7A cells. Potential functional mechanisms involve the regulation of apoptotic factors by BRG1, which may depend on the recruitment and promotion of p53. This study provides the essential proof for applying BRG1 to the molecular therapy of RA.",,"['Hou, Hongli', 'Xing, Weipeng', 'Li, Wuyin']","['Hou H', 'Xing W', 'Li W']","['Luoyang Orthopedic-traumatological Hospital of Henan Province, Orthopedic Hospital of Henan Province, Luoyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*physiopathology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'DNA Helicases/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/physiopathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Synoviocytes/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",,,2016/12/22 06:00,2017/02/18 06:00,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000005241 [doi]', '00005792-201612230-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2016 Dec;95(51):e5241. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000005241.,,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SMARCA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",,,,PMC5181802,,,['The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,

Combination of midostaurin with conventional intensive chemotherapy followed by one year maintenance monotherapy was recently reported to improve the survival of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with Flt3 mutations. Areas covered: Relevant publications were identified through literature searches in the PubMed database. We searched for (i) original articles describing the results from clinical studies; (ii) published articles describing the importance of midostaurin-inhibited kinases for leukemogenesis and chemosensitivity. Expert opinion: Midostaurin monotherapy is well tolerated, combined with conventional chemotherapy gastrointestinal toxicity increases significantly. Midostaurin alters anthracycline pharmacokinetics. Furthermore, its antileukemic effects may not only be mediated through Flt3 inhibition alone; the inhibition of other kinases may also be important for the overall antileukemic effect. Midostaurin may then have direct effects on the leukemic cells but also indirect antileukemic effects through inhibition of the AML-supporting effects of neighboring stromal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. Midostaurin may thus be used in combination with intensive chemotherapy, as maintenance treatment or as disease-stabilizing treatment for elderly unfit patients.",,"['Tvedt, Tor Henrik', 'Nepstad, Ina', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Tvedt TH', 'Nepstad I', 'Bruserud O']","['a Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Section for Hematology , Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.', 'a Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine , Haukeland University Hospital , Bergen , Norway.', 'b Section for Hematology , Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen , Bergen , Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,20161228,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Staurosporine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"[""*4'-N-benzoylstaurosporine"", '*Flt3 ligand', '*Platelet derived growth factor', '*Protein kinase c', '*Protein tyrosine kinase', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*vascular endothelia growth factor']",2016/12/22 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2017.1275564 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2017 Mar;26(3):343-355. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2017.1275564.

Previous studies have indicated that miR-196b and miR-1290 play critical roles in T-cell ALL (T-ALL) and B-cell ALL (B-ALL), respectively. Resveratrol, a natural edible polyphenolic phytoalexin, possesses certain anticancer activities. Nevertheless, the mechanism involved in the regulation of ALL by resveratrol is still poorly understood. The present study aimed to reveal the potential mechanism underlying the antitumor effect of resveratrol in ALL focusing on miRNAs. Research indicates that insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) plays a critical role in the aetiology of ALL. In the present study, we first demonstrated that the expression of IGFBP3 was decreased in ALL patients. We further identified that miR-196b and miR-1290 were overexpressed in T-ALL TALL-104 and B-ALL SUP-B15 cell lines, respectively. Moreover, resveratrol markedly decreased the overexpression of miR-196b/miR-1290 and elevated IGFBP3 expression in the ALL cell lines. As an miR-196b/miR-1290 inhibitor, resveratrol was further demonstrated to exert antitumor effects on ALL cells including antiproliferation, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and inhibition of migration. Dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-196b/miR-1290 directly bound to the 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) region of IGFBP3 mRNA. Moreover, we observed that IGFBP3 short interfering RNA reversed the antitumor activity of resveratrol against ALL cells. Taken together, the present study provides evidence that resveratrol targets miR-196b and miR-1290 for its antitumor activity in T-ALL and B-ALL, respectively. The present study also confirms that both miR196b and miR-1290 target the IGFBP3 3'-UTR and are potential therapeutic targets for ALL.",,"['Zhou, Wei', 'Wang, Shunqing', 'Ying, Yi', 'Zhou, Ruiqing', 'Mao, Ping']","['Zhou W', 'Wang S', 'Ying Y', 'Zhou R', 'Mao P']","[""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510180, P.R.

In addition, 22 (44.0%) and 48 (66.7%) patients achieved a complete response (CR) on day 14 in the E. coli-asparaginase and PEG-asparaginase groups, respectively (P = 0.032). No different 5-year event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS) rate (P = 0.632 and 0.769) was observed. Multivariate analysis revealed later CR (P = 0.008) and older age (P = 0.049) as adverse prognostic factors for both EFS and OS. In addition, we specifically monitored the known adverse effects of asparaginase, and no asparaginase-related death was observed. Allergy occurred in 9 patients using E. coli-asparaginase, and no patient in the PEG-asparaginase group suffered from allergies (P < 0.001). The incidence of other asparaginase-related toxicities was similar. We conclude that PEG-asparaginase can be safely and effectively used as asparaginase in adults with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL.",,"['Liu, Wen-Jian', 'Wang, Hua', 'Wang, Wei-da', 'Zhu, Meng-Yuan', 'Liu, Cheng-Cheng', 'Wang, Jing-Hua', 'Lu, Yue']","['Liu WJ', 'Wang H', 'Wang WD', 'Zhu MY', 'Liu CC', 'Wang JH', 'Lu Y']","[""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161221,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/12/22 06:00,2018/08/15 06:00,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep39463 [pii]', '10.1038/srep39463 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Dec 21;6:39463. doi: 10.1038/srep39463.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,PMC5175128,,,,,,,,,

The median age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) in children aged 0-14 years in Brazil is 53.3 per million. While overall survival rates for children with leukemia have improved significantly, data for incidence, trends, and relative survival among children and adolescents with leukemia in Recife, Brazil, remain incomplete, which hampers our analyses and provision of the best healthcare. The objective of this report is to provide that data. METHODS: Data from the Population-Based Cancer Registry of Recife were analyzed from 1998 to 2007. Our analyses included frequencies and AAIR, together with age-specific incidence rates for all leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. To evaluate incidence trends, joinpoint regression, including annual average percent change, were analyzed. Relative survival was calculated using the life-table method. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five cases were identified, 51% in females. The review reduced the not otherwise specified (NOS) leukemia category by 50% and diagnosis by death certificate only from 5.7% to 1.1%. The AAIR for leukemia was 41.1 per million, with a peak among children aged 1-4 (78.3 per million). Incidence trends during the period were stable. The five-year relative survival rate was 69.8%. CONCLUSIONS: These data represent the incidence rate and survival of childhood leukemia in Recife, located in the northeast region of Brazil, using a high-quality database.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lins, Mecneide Mendes', 'Santos, Marceli de Oliveira', 'de Albuquerque, Maria de Fatima Pessoa Militao', 'de Castro, Claudia Cristina Lima', 'Mello, Maria Julia Goncalves', 'de Camargo, Beatriz']","['Lins MM', 'Santos MO', 'de Albuquerque MFPM', 'de Castro CCL', 'Mello MJG', 'de Camargo B']","['Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira (IMIP), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Oncology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira-IMIP, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Divisao de Vigilancia e Analise de Situacao Coordenacao de Prevencao e Vigilancia (Surveilance Division and Surveilance and Prevention Coordination Situation of Analysis) at Instituto Nacional do Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Saude Coletiva (Collective Health Department) of CPqAM, FIOCRUZ, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Secretaria Municipal de Saude de Recife - Registro de Cancer de Base Populacional, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Research Center, Instituto de Medicina Integral Prof. Fernando Figueira - IMIP, Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161221,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['childhood', 'incidence', 'leukemia', 'population-based cancer registry', 'survival']",2016/12/22 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26391 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Aug;64(8). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26391.

In Mexico, cancer is the number one cause of death in children aged 5-14. Until recently, many children with cancer from Baja California, Mexico, went untreated. We reasoned that an initiative inspired by the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) ""twinning"" model could successfully be applied to the San Diego-Tijuana border region. In 2008, a twinning project was initiated by Rady Children's Hospital, SJCRH, and the General Hospital Tijuana (GHT). Our aim was to establish a pediatric oncology unit in a culturally sensitive manner, adapted to the local healthcare system. PROCEDURE: An initial assessment revealed that despite existence of basic hospital infrastructure at the GHT, the essential elements of a pediatric cancer unit were lacking, including dedicated space, trained staff, and uniform treatment. A 5-year action plan was designed to offer training, support the staff financially, and improve the infrastructure. RESULTS: After 7 years, accomplishments include the opening of a new inpatient unit with updated technology, fully trained staff, and a dedicated, interdisciplinary team. Over 700 children have benefited from accurate diagnosis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Initiatives that implement long-term partnerships between institutions along the Mexican-North American border can be highly effective in establishing successful pediatric cancer control programs. The geographic proximity facilitated accelerated training and close monitoring of project development. Similar initiatives across other disciplines may benefit additional patients and synergize with pediatric oncology programs to reduce health disparities in underserved areas.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Aristizabal, Paula', 'Fuller, Spencer', 'Rivera-Gomez, Rebeca', 'Ornelas, Mario', 'Nuno, Laura', 'Rodriguez-Galindo, Carlos', 'Ribeiro, Raul', 'Roberts, William']","['Aristizabal P', 'Fuller S', 'Rivera-Gomez R', 'Ornelas M', 'Nuno L', 'Rodriguez-Galindo C', 'Ribeiro R', 'Roberts W']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.', ""Peckham Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego, California."", 'Reducing Cancer Disparities Program, Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.', 'School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.', 'Hospital General de Tijuana, Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.', 'Hospital General de Tijuana, Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.', 'Hospital General de Tijuana, Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.', ""Department of Global Pediatric Medicine and International Outreach Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Leukemia and Lymphoma Division, Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.', ""Peckham Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego, California."", 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,20161221,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*U.S.-Mexico border', '*global health', '*international collaboration', '*international oncology', '*pediatric cancer disparities', '*pediatric oncology']",2016/12/22 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/09/27 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26387 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Jun;64(6). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26387.

Combination with conventional chemotherapy may have benefit as evidenced by recently presented results, and data from ongoing trials are eagerly awaited. Several trials are also evaluating TKI given after HSCT, and a large international randomized trial is planned. We may be close to an era of targeted therapy where the standard of care for this biologically defined subset will involve incorporation of a FLT3 TKI during induction chemotherapy and after HSCT.

However, their number and phenotype in human bone marrow of biopsy (BMB) samples of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and their association with disease progression from an initial chronic phase (CP) to accelerated phase (AP) to advanced blast phase (BP) are still unclear. BMB samples from 127 CML patients and 30 patients with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) as control group were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of CD68, CD163, and CD206 in BMB samples of CML patients were significantly higher than those in the patients of control group (P < 0.01), and we observed that their positive expression was gradually elevated during the transformation of CML-CP to AP to BP (P < 0.01). However, the expressions of CD68, CD163, and CD206 in released group were downregulated and contrasted to these in control group; there exists statistical significance (P < 0.01). The percentage ratio of CD163 and CD206 to CD68 was pronounced to be increasing from CML-CP to AP to BP (P < 0.01). Hence, the higher proportion of CD68(+), CD163(+) and CD206(+) macrophages in BMB samples can be considered a key factor for disease progression of CML patients.

Here, we investigated the possibility of targeting CCL22-expressing cells by activating specific T cells.

T cells recognizing an epitope derived from the signal-peptide of CCL22 will recognize CCL22-expressing cells even though CCL22 is secreted out of the cell. CCL22-specific T cells recognized and killed CCL22-expressing cancer cells. Furthermore, CCL22-specific T cells lysed acute monocytic leukemia cells in a CCL22 expression-dependent manner. Using the Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSPOT assay, we examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-A2+ cancer patients and healthy volunteers for reactivity against the CCL22-derived T-cell epitope. This revealed spontaneous T-cell responses against the CCL22-derived epitope in cancer patients and in healthy donors. Finally, we performed tetramer enrichment/depletion experiments to examine the impact of HLA-A2-restricted CCL22-specific T cells on CCL22 levels among PMBCs.

In the present investigation, Bacillus sp. PG03 and Bacillus sp. PG04 were studied. METHODS: L- asparaginases were produced using different culture media and were purified using ion exchange chromatography. RESULTS: Maximum productivity was obtained when asparagine was used as the nitrogen source at pH 7 and 48 h after cultivation. New intracellular L-asparaginases showed an apparent molecular weight of 25 kDa and 30 kDa by SDS-PAGE respectively. These enzymes were active in a wide pH range (3-9) with maximum activity at pH 6 for Bacillus PG03 and pH 7 for Bacillus PG04 L-asparaginase. Bacillus PG03 enzyme was optimally active at 37 C and Bacillus PG04 maximum activity was observed at 40 C. Kinetic parameters km and Vmax of both enzymes were studied using L-asparagine as the substrate. Thermal inactivation studies of Bacillus PG03 and Bacillus PG04 L-asparaginase exhibited t1/2 of 69.3 min and 34.6 min in 37 C respectively.

However, mechanisms underlying this restriction were not explored in depth. For herpesviruses, one of the possible mechanisms suggested is chromatinization and silencing of the incoming genomes. To test this hypothesis, we followed infection with three herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) fluorescence expressing recombinants in the presence or absence of histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDACi's). Unexpectedly, a lower number of viral genomes initiated expression in the presence of these inhibitors. This phenomenon was observed using several HDACi: Trichostatin A (TSA), Suberohydroxamic Acid, Valporic Acid, and Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid. We found that HDACi presence did not change the progeny outcome from the infected cells but did alter the kinetic of the gene expression from the viral genomes. Different cell types (HFF, Vero, and U2OS), which vary in their capability to activate intrinsic and innate immunity, show a cell specific basal average number of viral genomes establishing infection. Importantly, in all cell types, treatment with TSA reduced the number of viral genomes. ND10 nuclear bodies are known to interact with the incoming herpes genomes and repress viral replication. The viral immediate early protein, ICP0, is known to disassemble the ND10 bodies and to induce degradation of some of the host proteins in these domains. HDACi treated cells expressed higher levels of some of the host ND10 proteins (promyelocytic leukemia and ATRX), which may explain the lower number of viral genomes initiating expression per cell. Corroborating this hypothesis, infection with three HSV-1 recombinants carrying a deletion in the gene coding for ICP0, show a reduction in the number of genomes being expressed in U2OS cells. We suggest that alterations in the levels of host proteins involved in intrinsic antiviral defense may result in differences in the number of genomes that initiate expression.",,"['Shapira, Lev', 'Ralph, Maya', 'Tomer, Enosh', 'Cohen, Shai', 'Kobiler, Oren']","['Shapira L', 'Ralph M', 'Tomer E', 'Cohen S', 'Kobiler O']","['Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161206,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ICP0 deletion', 'gene expression', 'herpes simplex virus-1', 'histone deacetylase inhibitors', 'intrinsic immunity', 'virus host interactions']",2016/12/22 06:00,2016/12/22 06:01,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2016.01970 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2016 Dec 6;7:1970. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01970. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC5138200,,,,,,,,,

Related retroviruses have been found in Southeast Asian mice although the sequence similarity was limited. Viruses with a higher sequence homology were isolated from Melomys burtoni, the Australian and Indonesian grassland melomys. However, only the habitats of the koalas and the grassland melomys in Australia are overlapping, indicating that the melomys virus may not be the precursor of the GaLV. Viruses closely related to GaLV/KoRV were also detected in bats. Therefore, given the fact that the habitats of the gibbons in Thailand and the koalas in Australia are far away, and that bats are able to fly over long distances, the hypothesis that retroviruses of bats are the origin of GaLV and KoRV deserves consideration.

The RG7787 RIT targets the cancer antigen mesothelin to deliver a recombinantly-engineered, reduced immunogenicity variant of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) to the cytosol where it inhibits protein synthesis. Here we demonstrate that maximal doses of RG7787 temporarily halt growth of pancreatic cancer tumor xenografts, similar to the approved drugs gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, however, combination of the RIT with nab-paclitaxel produces durable complete regressions in most mice. Synergy between taxane and anti-MSLN RITs has been previously demonstrated in mouse models, but direct interaction of the combination in cell culture was not observed. Here, we show that this favorable interaction occurs in cell culture, is dependent on the dose and duration of RG7787 exposure, requires the catalytically active PE, and still occurs with RIT targeting a non-MSLN surface antigen. Unexpectedly, the combination does not increase RG7787-mediated protein synthesis inhibition nor perturb downstream apoptotic markers of RIT-mediated killing, but does augment levels of acetylated tubulin, a marker of taxane activity. Taken together, these data suggest that PE increases cell sensitivity to taxane-mediated killing by increasing taxane-mediated microtubule stability and priming cells for apoptosis by decreasing levels of the pro-survival factor Mcl-1.",,"['Kolyvas, Emily', 'Rudloff, Michael', 'Poruchynsky, Marianne', 'Landsman, Rebekah', 'Hollevoet, Kevin', 'Venzon, David', 'Alewine, Christine']","['Kolyvas E', 'Rudloff M', 'Poruchynsky M', 'Landsman R', 'Hollevoet K', 'Venzon D', 'Alewine C']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Current address: Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee WI, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Genitourinary Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Current address: Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood IL, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Current address: Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, Laboratory for Therapeutic and Diagnostic Antibodies, KU Leuven, Belgium.', 'Biostatistics and Data Management Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Albumins/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Mesothelin', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['immunotoxin', 'mesothelin', 'nab-paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'pancreatic cancer']",2016/12/22 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['13984 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.13984 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Feb 7;8(6):9189-9199. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13984.,,"['0 (130-nm albumin-bound paclitaxel)', '0 (Albumins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (MSLN protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Msln protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', 'D6AT024T4P (LMB-100)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,,PMC5354724,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that an agent that promotes chromatin opening, the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) AR-42, ameliorates the deficiency of adult neurogenesis in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus and rescues hippocampal memory defects in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome (Kmt2d(+/betaGeo)). Unlike a drug, a dietary intervention could be quickly transitioned to the clinic. Therefore, we have explored whether treatment with a ketogenic diet could lead to a similar rescue through increased amounts of beta-hydroxybutyrate, an endogenous HDACi. Here, we report that a ketogenic diet in Kmt2d(+/betaGeo) mice modulates H3ac and H3K4me3 in the granule cell layer, with concomitant rescue of both the neurogenesis defect and hippocampal memory abnormalities seen in Kmt2d(+/betaGeo) mice; similar effects on neurogenesis were observed on exogenous administration of beta-hydroxybutyrate.

Epigenome studies often disregard the study of repeat elements owing to technical complexity and their undefined role in genome regulation. We have developed NSUMA (Next-generation Sequencing of UnMethylated Alu), a cost-effective approach allowing the unambiguous interrogation of DNA methylation in more than 130,000 individual Alu elements, the most abundant retrotransposon in the human genome. DNA methylation profiles of Alu repeats have been analyzed in colon cancers and normal tissues using NSUMA and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. Normal cells show a low proportion of unmethylated Alu (1%-4%) that may increase up to 10-fold in cancer cells. In normal cells, unmethylated Alu elements tend to locate in the vicinity of functionally rich regions and display epigenetic features consistent with a direct impact on genome regulation. In cancer cells, Alu repeats are more resistant to hypomethylation than other retroelements. Genome segmentation based on high/low rates of Alu hypomethylation allows the identification of genomic compartments with differential genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic features. Alu hypomethylated regions show low transcriptional activity, late DNA replication, and its extent is associated with higher chromosomal instability. Our analysis demonstrates that Alu retroelements contribute to define the epigenetic landscape of normal and cancer cells and provides a unique resource on the epigenetic dynamics of a principal, but largely unexplored, component of the primate genome.",['(c) 2017 Jorda et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Jorda, Mireia', 'Diez-Villanueva, Anna', 'Mallona, Izaskun', 'Martin, Berta', 'Lois, Sergi', 'Barrera, Victor', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Vavouri, Tanya', 'Peinado, Miguel A']","['Jorda M', 'Diez-Villanueva A', 'Mallona I', 'Martin B', 'Lois S', 'Barrera V', 'Esteller M', 'Vavouri T', 'Peinado MA']","['Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona 08908, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Department of Physiological Sciences II, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08907, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona 08010, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Germans Trias i Pujol Health Science Research Institute (IGTP), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Institute of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (IMPPC), Badalona 08916, Catalonia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161220,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,IM,"['Alu Elements/*genetics', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans']",,,2016/12/22 06:00,2018/01/05 06:00,['2016/12/22 06:00'],"['2016/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.207522.116 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.207522.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2017 Jan;27(1):118-132. doi: 10.1101/gr.207522.116.

RNA sequencing of the regenerated donor Lin(-) SCA-1(+) KIT(+) (LSK) cells shows dysregulated expression of ZEB1-associated genes involved in the small GTPase-dependent actin polymerization pathway. Misexpression of DOCK2, WAVE2, and activation of CDC42 results in apolar F-actin localization, leading to defects in adhesion, migration and homing of HSCs regenerated in a Wnt5a-haploinsufficient microenvironment. Moreover, these cells show increased differentiation in vitro, with rapid loss of HSC-enriched LSK cells.

TRAIL is a promising anticancer agent that virtually not shows any toxicity to normal cells. We have recently carried out clinical trials with a human circularly permuted TRAIL, CPT, against MM saw a partial response in approximate 20-30% of patients. In the current study, we investigated the cause of CPT resistance and revealed that the majority of the MM patients express elevated levels of c-FLIP. Knockdown of c-FLIP expression by siRNA alone was sufficient to increase CPT-mediated apoptosis in a CPT-resistant human MM cell line U266. To overcome CPT resistance, we investigated the combination of CPT with Rocaglamides(s) in MM which has been shown to inhibit c-FLIP expression in vitro. We show that Rocaglamide(s) overcomes CPT resistance in U266 in vitro and significant increases in anti-tumor efficacies of CPT in mice xenografted with U266. Similar results were also obtained in mice xenografted with the CPT-resistant human acute T-cell leukemia cell line Molt-4.

METHODS: We used the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database to describe the overall survival (OS) and treatment pattern of elderly patients (age > 65 years) with ALAL. OS analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier method, and its determinants were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression method with a significant P < .05. RESULTS: We included 705 patients with ALAL and a median age of 80 years. The 2-year OS was 16.4% for patients aged 66 to 70 years, 8.1% for patients aged 71 to 75 years, 5.5% for patients aged 76 to 80 years, and 3.7% for patients aged > 80 years (P < .01). Two-year OS did not significantly vary by race or gender. Among the study cohort, 151 patients received chemotherapy. Two-year OS was 17% in the chemotherapy group and 3% in the no-chemotherapy group (P < .001). On multivariate analysis, age less than 80 years (Age 66-70 years: hazard ratio [HR]; 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.85; age 71-75 years: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.65-0.99; age 76-80 years: HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66-0.98; P = .004) and chemotherapy (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.42-0.62; P = .001) significantly reduced the hazard for mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the OS of elderly patients with ALAL remains poor. Although treatment improved the OS, only 21.5% of patients received therapy. The optimal choice of therapy needs to be determined by prospective studies.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The plasma membrane, however, is not a passive matrix. It rather takes an active role and regulates receptor distribution and function by its composition and the interaction of its lipid components with embedded and surrounding proteins. Furthermore, it is not a homogenous fluid but contains lipid and protein domains of various sizes and characteristic lifetimes which are important in regulating receptor function and signaling. The precise lateral organization of the plasma membrane, the differences between the inner and outer leaflet, and the influence of the cytoskeleton are still debated. Furthermore, there is a lack of comparisons of the organization and dynamics of the plasma membrane of different cell types. Therefore, we used four different specific membrane markers to test the lateral organization, the differences between the inner and outer membrane leaflet, and the influence of the cytoskeleton of up to five different cell lines, including Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1), Human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), fibroblast (WI-38) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells by Imaging Total Internal Reflection (ITIR)-Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS). We measure diffusion in the temperature range of 298-310K to measure the Arrhenius activation energy (EArr) of diffusion and apply the FCS diffusion law to obtain information on the spatial organization of the probe molecules on the various cell membranes. Our results show clear differences of the FCS diffusion law and EArr for the different probes in dependence of their localization. These differences are similar in the outer and inner leaflet of the membrane. However, these values can differ significantly between different cell lines raising the question how molecular plasma membrane events measured in different cell lines can be compared.

Monoclonal immunoglobulins may act as a potential trigger in the pathogenesis of TMA. To determine the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy and clinicopathological features of TMA associated with monoclonal immunoglobulin, we performed a retrospective study in adults (18 and older) with a clinical diagnosis of TMA. Of 146 patients with TMA, we detected monoclonal immunoglobulin in 20 patients (13.7%). Among patients 50 and older, the prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy was 21%, which is approximately five-fold higher than the 4.2% expected rate in this population. Fifteen patients had monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, one had multiple myeloma, one with smoldering myeloma, two had POEMS syndrome, and one had T-cell lymphocytic leukemia. Renal biopsy was performed in 15 cases, of which six showed thrombi, 11 showed mesangiolysis, and all showed double contours along glomerular capillary walls. Acute tubular injury was present in 12 cases. Treatment options were varied and included therapeutic plasma exchange in 11 patients. Ten patients progressed to end-stage renal disease, of which two received kidney transplant. Thus, our study shows an unexpectedly high prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy in patients with TMA, suggesting a potential pathogenetic mechanism. This study underscores the importance of evaluating for a monoclonal gammopathy in patients with TMA as well as the potential for targeting the underlying hematologic disorder as an approach to treating TMA.","['Copyright (c) 2016 International Society of Nephrology.

We examined rates of initiation and adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) among Medicare beneficiaries with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with and without cost-sharing subsidies. We selected TKIs given their effectiveness and strong indication for use among patients diagnosed with CML. Patients and Methods Using SEER-Medicare data, we identified individuals diagnosed with CML from 2007 to 2011. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to assess time from diagnosis to TKI initiation. We used generalized estimating equations to examine treatment initiation within 180 days and TKI adherence among initiators. We defined adherence as at least 80% of days covered during the 6 months after TKI initiation. Results Among 393 individuals diagnosed with CML from 2007 to 2011, 68% initiated TKI treatment within 180 days after diagnosis. In multivariate analysis, individuals with cost-sharing subsidies, younger age, lower comorbidity, and later year of diagnosis were significantly more likely to initiate TKIs. Among TKI initiators, 61% were adherent; adherence was lower for individuals age 80 years or older versus 66 to 69 years. Conclusion Only 68% of Medicare beneficiaries with CML initiated TKI therapy within 6 months of diagnosis. Delayed initiation among individuals without cost-sharing subsidies suggests that out-of-pocket costs may be a barrier to timely initiation of therapy among individuals diagnosed with CML.",,"['Winn, Aaron N', 'Keating, Nancy L', 'Dusetzina, Stacie B']","['Winn AN', 'Keating NL', 'Dusetzina SB']","[""Aaron N.

We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, recommended dosage, and potential for efficacy of blinatumomab in children with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Methods This open-label study enrolled children < 18 years old with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL in a phase I dosage-escalation part and a phase II part, using 6-week treatment cycles. Primary end points were maximum-tolerated dosage (phase I) and complete remission rate within the first two cycles (phase II). Results We treated 49 patients in phase I and 44 patients in phase II. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 (phase I). Three experienced grade 4 cytokine-release syndrome (one attributed to grade 5 cardiac failure); one had fatal respiratory failure. The maximum-tolerated dosage was 15 microg/m(2)/d. Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics was linear across dosage levels and consistent among age groups. On the basis of the phase I data, the recommended blinatumomab dosage for children with relapsed/refractory ALL was 5 microg/m(2)/d for the first 7 days, followed by 15 microg/m(2)/d thereafter. Among the 70 patients who received the recommended dosage, 27 (39%; 95% CI, 27% to 51%) achieved complete remission within the first two cycles, 14 (52%) of whom achieved complete minimal residual disease response. The most frequent grade >/= 3 adverse events were anemia (36%), thrombocytopenia (21%), and hypokalemia (17%). Three patients (4%) and one patient (1%) had cytokine-release syndrome of grade 3 and 4, respectively. Two patients (3%) interrupted treatment after grade 2 seizures. Conclusion This trial, which to the best of our knowledge was the first such trial in pediatrics, demonstrated antileukemic activity of single-agent blinatumomab with complete minimal residual disease response in children with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL. Blinatumomab may represent an important new treatment option in this setting, requiring further investigation in curative indications.",,"['von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Zugmaier, Gerhard', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Trippett, Tanya M', 'Rizzari, Carmelo', 'Bader, Peter', ""O'Brien, Maureen M"", 'Brethon, Benoit', 'Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Schlegel, Paul Gerhardt', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Cooper, Todd Michael', 'Zwaan, Christian M', 'Barnette, Phillip', 'Messina, Chiara', 'Michel, Gerard', 'DuBois, Steven G', 'Hu, Kuolung', 'Zhu, Min', 'Whitlock, James A', 'Gore, Lia']","['von Stackelberg A', 'Locatelli F', 'Zugmaier G', 'Handgretinger R', 'Trippett TM', 'Rizzari C', 'Bader P', ""O'Brien MM"", 'Brethon B', 'Bhojwani D', 'Schlegel PG', 'Borkhardt A', 'Rheingold SR', 'Cooper TM', 'Zwaan CM', 'Barnette P', 'Messina C', 'Michel G', 'DuBois SG', 'Hu K', 'Zhu M', 'Whitlock JA', 'Gore L']","[""Arend von Stackelberg, Charite Campus Virchow, Berlin; Gerhard Zugmaier, Amgen Research (Munich), Munich; Rupert Handgretinger, University of Tubingen, Tubingen; Peter Bader, Hospital for Children and Adolescents III, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt; Paul Gerhardt Schlegel, University Children's Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg; Arndt Borkhardt, University of Dusseldorf Medical Faculty, Dusseldorf, Germany; Franco Locatelli, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, University of Pavia, Pavia; Carmelo Rizzari, San Gerardo Hospital, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza; Chiara Messina, Clinica di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Padova, Padova, Italy; Benoit Brethon, Hopital Robert Debre, Service Hematologie-Immunologie Pediatrique, Paris; Gerard Michel, Hopital de la Timone, Marseille, France; Christian M.

Moreover, suitable reaction conditions were observed by potentiometry depending on pH in case of binary system Ag-Gly. X-ray analysis confirmed argentophilic interactions in complex 1 with an Ag1-Ag2 distance of 2.8018(6) A. Antimicrobial testing indicates higher growth inhibition effect of complex 1 than complex 2. Moreover the effectivity of both complexes against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) is superior (or similar) to that of the commercially available Ag(I) sulfadiazine, AgSD (used, for example, in Dermazine cream). The binding of the Ag(I) complexes to calf thymus DNA was investigated using electronic absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectrophotometry. The Stern-Volmer quenching constants obtained from the linear quenching plot were estimated in the range from 2.01x10(3) to 20.34x10(3)M(-1). The results of topoisomerase I and topoisomerase II (Topo I and Topo II) inhibition assay suggested that complex 2 inhibits the enzyme activity of both enzymes at a concentration of 2muM. The cytotoxicity of both complexes on L1210 leukemia cells was revealed to be approximately three times higher than that of cisplatin. Moreover, the new Ag(I) complexes also induced apoptosis of the leukemia cells. The high DNA binding activity of these complexes is considered to be responsible for their cytotoxic effects.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we focus on a case of a man with a familial history of RUNX1(R174Q) mutation who developed at the age of 42 years a T2-ALL and, 2 years after remission, an AML-M0. Both AML-M0 and T2-ALL blast populations demonstrated a loss of 1p36.32-23 and 17q11.2 regions as well as other small deletions, clonal rearrangements of both TCRgamma and TCRdelta and a presence of 18 variants at a frequency of more than 40%. Additional variants were identified only in T2-ALL or in AML-M0 evoking the existence of a common original clone, which gave rise to subclonal populations. Next generation sequencing (NGS) performed on peripheral blood-derived CD34(+) cells 5 years prior to T2-ALL development revealed only the missense TET2(P1962T) mutation at a frequency of 1%, which increases to more than 40% in fully transformed leukaemic T2-ALL and AML-M0 clones. This result suggests that TET2(P1962T) mutation in association with germline RUNX1(R174Q) mutation leads to amplification of a haematopoietic clone susceptible to acquire other transforming alterations.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Additional mutations may occur in epigenetic regulators, signaling, or splicing genes that may be useful in the prognostic assessment of MPN patients. In primary myelofibrosis, molecular-based prognostic scoring systems have been recently proposed, but few data are available to date for polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). In this study, we used a next generation sequencing-based 18-gene panel in 50 JAK2V617F positive PV and JAK2V617F positive ET patients from an institutional cohort investigated at diagnosis and at 3-year follow-up (3y). Disease progression at 3y was defined by a composite criterion. Patients (28 PV and 22 ET) were included according to their clinical status, with or without disease progression. At diagnosis, we found 28 additional mutations in 21 of the 50 patients. Patients with disease progression were more likely to have at least one additional mutation. There was no difference between PV and ET. All patients with two or more additional mutations exhibited disease progression at 3y. No novel mutations appeared at 3y. The allele burden increase by at least one mutation at 3y was more frequent in patients with disease progression. Our data suggest that screening for additional mutations in PV and ET could identify patients at a higher risk of disease progression.

Sleep disturbance can negatively impact overall quality of life, neurodevelopment, memory consolidation, and wound healing. Hypothalamic orexin neurons are influential wake-promoting neurons, and disturbances in orexin signaling leads to abnormal sleep behavior. A new class of drug, the orexin receptor antagonists, could be an intriguing option for sleep disorders caused by increased orexinergic output. Our aim was to examine the impact of ALL treatment doses of corticosteroids on the orexin system in rodents and in children undergoing treatment for childhood ALL. METHODS: We administered repeated injections of dexamethasone to rodents and measured responsive orexin neural activity compared to controls. In children with newly diagnosed standard risk B-cell ALL receiving dexamethasone therapy per Children's Oncology Group (COG) induction therapy from 2014-2016, we collected pre- and during-steroids matched CSF samples and measured the impact of steroids on CSF orexin concentration. RESULTS: In both rodents, all markers orexin signaling, including orexin neural output and orexin receptor expression, were preserved in the setting of dexamethasone. Additionally, we did not detect a difference in pre- and during-dexamethasone CSF orexin concentrations in children receiving dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that rodent and human orexin physiology is largely preserved in the setting of high dose dexamethasone.

T cell ALL (T-ALL) represents about 15% of pediatric ALL cases and is considered a high-risk disease. T-ALL is often associated with resistance to treatment, including steroids, which are currently the cornerstone for treating ALL; moreover, initial steroid response strongly predicts survival and cure. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying steroid resistance in T-ALL patients are poorly understood. In this study, we combined various genomic datasets in order to identify candidate genetic mechanisms underlying steroid resistance in children undergoing T-ALL treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole genome sequencing on paired pre-treatment (diagnostic) and post-treatment (remission) samples from 13 patients, and targeted exome sequencing of pre-treatment samples from 69 additional T-ALL patients. We then integrated mutation data with copy number data for 151 mutated genes, and this integrated dataset was tested for associations of mutations with clinical outcomes and in vitro drug response. Our analysis revealed that mutations in JAK1 and KRAS, two genes encoding components of the interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) signaling pathway, were associated with steroid resistance and poor outcome. We then sequenced JAK1, KRAS, and other genes in this pathway, including IL7R, JAK3, NF1, NRAS, and AKT, in these 69 T-ALL patients and a further 77 T-ALL patients. We identified mutations in 32% (47/146) of patients, the majority of whom had a specific T-ALL subtype (early thymic progenitor ALL or TLX). Based on the outcomes of these patients and their prednisolone responsiveness measured in vitro, we then confirmed that these mutations were associated with both steroid resistance and poor outcome. To explore how these mutations in IL7R signaling pathway genes cause steroid resistance and subsequent poor outcome, we expressed wild-type and mutant IL7R signaling molecules in two steroid-sensitive T-ALL cell lines (SUPT1 and P12 Ichikawa cells) using inducible lentiviral expression constructs. We found that expressing mutant IL7R, JAK1, or NRAS, or wild-type NRAS or AKT, specifically induced steroid resistance without affecting sensitivity to vincristine or L-asparaginase. In contrast, wild-type IL7R, JAK1, and JAK3, as well as mutant JAK3 and mutant AKT, had no effect. We then performed a functional study to examine the mechanisms underlying steroid resistance and found that, rather than changing the steroid receptor's ability to activate downstream targets, steroid resistance was associated with strong activation of MEK-ERK and AKT, downstream components of the IL7R signaling pathway, thereby inducing a robust antiapoptotic response by upregulating MCL1 and BCLXL expression. Both the MEK-ERK and AKT pathways also inactivate BIM, an essential molecule for steroid-induced cell death, and inhibit GSK3B, an important regulator of proapoptotic BIM. Importantly, treating our cell lines with IL7R signaling inhibitors restored steroid sensitivity. To address clinical relevance, we treated primary T-ALL cells obtained from 11 patients with steroids either alone or in combination with IL7R signaling inhibitors; we found that including a MEK, AKT, mTOR, or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor strongly increased steroid-induced cell death. Therefore, combining these inhibitors with steroid treatment may enhance steroid sensitivity in patients with ALL. The main limitation of our study was the modest cohort size, owing to the very low incidence of T-ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Using an unbiased sequencing approach, we found that specific mutations in IL7R signaling molecules underlie steroid resistance in T-ALL.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an antitumor candidate in cancer therapy. This study examines the proapoptotic effects of poly(propylene imine) (PPI) glycodendrimers modified with the maltotriose residues (PPI-G4-OS-Mal-III and PPI-G4-DS-Mal-III) on the TNF family in CLL cells. The combination of an understanding of the signaling pathways associated with CLL and the development of a molecular profiling is a key issue for the design of personalized approaches to therapy. Gene expression is determined with two-color microarray 8 x 60K. The findings indicate that PPI-G4-OS/DS-Mal-III affect gene expression from the TRAIL apoptotic pathway and exert a strong effect on CLL cells comparable with fludarabine. Dendrimer-targeted technology may well prove to bridge the gap between the ineffective treatment of today and the effective personalized therapy of the future.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods: The chemical synthetic miRNA-21 inhibitor was transfered into K562 cells by electrotransfection. RT-PCR was used to detect the miRNA-21 expression changes. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined by using MTT and flow cytometry. Western-blot were used to detect the protein expression changes of PTEN, PI3K and p-AKT respectively. Results: The relative expression of miRNA-21 in experimental group was (8.070 +/- 5.138)% at 24 hours, which was lower than control groups (P<0.05). The apoptotic rate of (13.370+/-0.250)% at 24 hours in experimental group was obviously higher than control groups. The cellular proliferation were significantly different at 24 hours. The proliferation inhibition rate was (8.1+/-0.9)% at 24 hours, which was up to (43.1+/-2.1)% at 60 hours, but the control groups showed no difference. K562 cell proliferation significantly decreased, while cell apoptosis markedly increased by inhibiting miRNA-21 expression (P<0.01). Western-blot analysis revealed up-regulation of PTEN and down-regulation of PI3K and p-AKT protein expressions after successfully suppressed miRNA-21 expression (P<0.01).

Methods: The modeling group was made up of 130 classical APL patients during the period of 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2013. After single factor screening of clinical variables, the logistic regression model was used to identify the final model variables. A nomogram subsequently established by R software was validated by Bootstrap resampling as internal validation. Concordance index (C-index) was used for the accuracy evaluation of the nomogram, and calibration curves were painted to test the actual observation and the nomogram-prediction of occurrence rate of DS. Results: Occurrence rate of DS in 130 APL patients was 30.0%; In multivariate analysis, body mass index (BMI) >/=24 kg/m(2) and without using steroids for prevention of DS were identified as independent risk factors. The C-index of the nomogram for predicting DS was 0.818 (95% CI 0.741-0.895).

Methods: From May to November in 2014, anonymous questionnaires were distributed to adult CML patients who were receiving TKI treatment in China. The impact of TKI-related side effects on daily life were assessed by the score of 1 (no impact) to 5 (high impact) from patient self-report. Results: Data from 731 respondents in the CP who reported the score of the impact of TKI-related side effects on daily life were collected. 407 (56%) were male. The median age was 41 years (range, 18 to 88 years). 560 (77%) started TKI treatment within 1 year after diagnosis. With a median treatment duration of 3 years (range, <1 to 13 years), 549 (75% ) respondents achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and 301 (41%) achieved a complete molecular response (CMR). The most common TKI-related adverse effects were edema (n=323, 44% ), fatigue (n=277, 38% ), gastrointestinal disorders (n=235, 32% ), skin color changes (n=142, 19% ), muscle cramps (n=137, 19% ), rash (n=105, 14% ), hepatic function abnormalities (n=91, 12%), weight gain (n=86, 12%), and cytopenia (n=59, 8%). Multivariate analyses showed that TKI treatment duration <4 years was the factor associated with fatigue; Edema was more observed in female, >/=40 years old and use of 1st generation TKI; Gastrointestinal disorders in use of 1st generation TKI; Hepatic function abnormalities and rash in use of 2nd generation TKI; Weight gain in female; Muscle cramps in long-term interval from diagnosis to therapy and use of 1st generation TKI; Low blood counts in use of generic TKI. There was no impact of TKI-related side effects on daily life in 218 (30%)respondents (1 score). 375 (51%)respondents reported their daily life were slightly or moderately decreased (2 or 3 score), while 138 (19%) significantly decreased (4 or 5 score). Multivariate analyses showed that female, >/=40 years old, use of generic TKI, TKI treatment duration <4 years were factors associated with negative effect on their daily life. When taking TKI related side-effects into considderation, secondary school and below, use of generic TKI, TKI treatment duration <4 years, edema, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, skin color changes, rash and hepatic function abnormalities, were factors associated with negative effect on their daily life. Conclusion: Edema, fatigue, gastrointestinal disorders, rash, skin color changes and hepatic function abnormalities were common TKI-related side effects and influenced CML patients' daily life in China.

In our studies, lactic acid in tumor microenvironments inhibited IFNgamma and IL4 productions from NKT cells, and more profound influence on IFNgamma was observed. By adjusting the pH of culture medium we further showed that, dysfunction of NKT cells could simply be induced by low extracellular pH.

CASE DESCRIPTION: We herein report a successful pregnancy and delivery in a patient diagnosed with CML. The patient was treated with imatinib (400 mg/day) as a first-line therapy. However, she became pregnant while she was in complete hematological remission and had a complete cytogenetic response. Because she elected to continue the pregnancy to term, imatinib treatment was stopped after 5 months of gestation and the patient was then treated with interferon-alpha for the remainder of her pregnancy. However, the CML did not relapse. She successfully gave birth to a male infant at 39 weeks by cesarean section with no adverse sequelae or malformations. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: The treatment of pregnant women with CML is difficult because of few available therapeutic options and limited data regarding the potential harm to the fetus. Conception should be planned and TKI therapy discontinued in female patients during pregnancy, and individual risks need to be considered when an unplanned pregnancy occurs.

Mutations in NPM1 are seen in approximately one-third of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are generally associated with good response to induction chemotherapy. However, the mechanisms underlying this chemosensitivity are still unknown. Recent studies have established that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation is a key response of leukemia cell to chemotherapy. In this study, we transfected human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells with the vector expressing NPM1 mutation variant (NPM1mA), and confirmed overexpression of NPM1mA at mRNA and protein levels by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The effects of NPM1 mutations on chemotherapeutical agents induced apoptosis, NF-kappaB activity and gene expression were examined using flow cytometry, luciferase reporter assays, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. We found that overexpression of NPM1mA in THP-1 cells sensitized these cells to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutical agents such as daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C). Moreover, we demonstrated that expression of NPM1 mA reduced the NF-kappaB transcription activity of THP-1 cells upon drug treatment. In addition, restoration of NF-kappaB activity via TNF-alpha stimulation could attenuate the effect of NPM1mA overexpression on DNR-and Ara-C-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, expression of NPM1mA could upregulate Bax and downregulate Bcl-2 at mRNA and protein levels in THP-1 cells when treated with DNR or Ara-C. We also demonstrated that restoration of NF-kappaB activity via TNF-alpha pre-treatment reversed the effect of NPM1mA on the Bax/Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, evaluation of gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset revealed that NPM1-mutated patients showed a higher expression of Bax and a lower expression of Bcl-2. These results suggest that the NPM1 gene mutations could confer increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, at least in part, by suppressing NF-kappaB activity and regulating Bax/Bcl-2 expression.",,"['Zhang, Shuaishuai', 'Qin, Fengxian', 'Yang, Liyuan', 'Xian, Jingrong', 'Zou, Qin', 'Jin, Hongjun', 'Wang, Lu', 'Zhang, Ling']","['Zhang S', 'Qin F', 'Yang L', 'Xian J', 'Zou Q', 'Jin H', 'Wang L', 'Zhang L']","['Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', ""Department of clinical laboratory, Liuzhou Worker's Hospital, Guangxi, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, College of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161125,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bax', 'Bcl-2', 'NF-kappaB', 'acute myeloid leukemia.', 'chemosensitivity', 'nucleophosmin, gene mutation']",2016/12/21 06:00,2016/12/21 06:01,['2016/12/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.16010 [doi]', 'jcav07p2270 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2016 Nov 25;7(15):2270-2279. doi: 10.7150/jca.16010. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,PMC5166537,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,

In assessing the effectiveness of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment, the conventional batch-cell transwell-migration assay may not indicate the intrinsic effect of the treatment on migration, since the treatment may also affect other cellular behavior, such as proliferation or death. In this study, the pN-level adhesion and traction forces between single leukemia cells and their microenvironment were directly measured using optical tweezers and traction-force microscopy. The effects of PMA on K562 and THP1 leukemia cells were studied, and the results showed that PMA treatment significantly increased cell adhesion with extracellular matrix proteins, bone marrow stromal cells, and human fibroblasts. PMA treatment also significantly increased the traction of THP1 cells on bovine serum albumin proteins, although the effect on K562 cells was insignificant.

However, the increasing need for integration of multiple data sets leads to a requirement for clustering methods applicable to mixed data types, where the straightforward application of standard methods is not necessarily the best approach. A particularly common problem involves clustering entities characterized by a mixture of binary data (e.g. presence/absence of mutations, binding, motifs and epigenetic marks) and continuous data (e.g. gene expression, protein abundance, metabolite levels). Here, we present a generic method based on a probabilistic model for clustering this type of data, and illustrate its application to genetic regulation and the clustering of cancer samples. We show that the resulting clusters lead to useful hypotheses: in the case of genetic regulation these concern regulation of groups of genes by specific sets of transcription factors and in the case of cancer samples combinations of gene mutations are related to patterns of gene expression. The clusters have potential mechanistic significance and in the latter case are significantly linked to survival.

METHODS: RNA was extracted from blood samples of 58 AML patients (39 adults and 19 children) and 20 age and sex matched controls. FLT3 ITD mutation, cMPL and EphA4 expression was studied using RT-PCR and correlated to the clinical and survival data of the patients. RESULTS: FLT3 ITD mutation, cMPL and EphA4 expression was positive in 35.9%, 76.9% and 56.4% of adult AML patients respectively and in 15.8%, 47.4% and 36.8% of pediatric AML patients respectively. 76.9% of adult and 89.5% of pediatric patients expressed CD33. 64.1 % of adults and 42.1% of children expressed CD34. CD34 expression was significantly associated with both FLT3 ITD mutation and cMPL expression. CD34, FLT3 and cMPL negative cases have significantly higher overall survival than positive cases. CONCLUSION: CD34 expression is significantly associated with both FLT3 ITD mutation and cMPL expression which could be used as a marker for low survival. Normal FLT3 and negative expression of CD34 and cMPL may predict a longer overall survival. Further studies are needed to investigate the mechanism that may correlate CD34 to both markers.","['(c) 2016 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Ebrahim, Eman K', 'Assem, Magda M', 'Amin, Ahmed I', 'Kamel, Mahmoud M', 'El Meligui, Yomna M', 'Metwally, Ayman M']","['Ebrahim EK', 'Assem MM', 'Amin AI', 'Kamel MM', 'El Meligui YM', 'Metwally AM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, 6 October, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, 6 October, Egypt.', 'Chemistry Department, Faculty of Science, Cairo University, 6 October, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, 6 October, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, 6 October, Egypt.', 'Technology of Medical Laboratory Department, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Misr University for Science and Technology, 6 October, Egypt ayman_doctor@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*genetics/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Receptor, EphA4/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CD34', 'EphA4', 'FLT3 ITD', 'cMPL', 'survival']",2016/12/21 06:00,2017/01/14 06:00,['2016/12/21 06:00'],"['2016/12/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['46/6/592 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2016 Dec;46(6):592-600.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A rational/personalized use of ATRA requires the development of predictive tools allowing identification of sensitive cancer types and responsive individuals. Materials and methods: RNA-sequencing data for 10 080 patients and 33 different tumor types were derived from the TCGA and Leucegene datasets and completely re-processed. The study was carried out using machine learning methods and network analysis. Results: We profiled a large panel of breast-cancer cell-lines for in vitro sensitivity to ATRA and exploited the associated basal gene-expression data to initially generate a model predicting ATRA-sensitivity in this disease. Starting from these results and using a network-guided approach, we developed a generalized model (ATRA-21) whose validity extends to tumor types other than breast cancer. ATRA-21 predictions correlate with experimentally determined sensitivity in a large panel of cell-lines representative of numerous tumor types. In patients, ATRA-21 correctly identifies APL as the most sensitive acute-myelogenous-leukemia subtype and indicates that uveal-melanoma and low-grade glioma are top-ranking diseases as for average predicted responsiveness to ATRA. There is a consistent number of tumor types for which higher ATRA-21 predictions are associated with better outcomes. Conclusions: In summary, we generated a tumor-type independent ATRA-sensitivity predictor which consists of a restricted number of genes and has the potential to be applied in the clinics. Identification of the tumor types that are likely to be generally sensitive to the action of ATRA paves the way to the design of clinical studies in the context of these diseases. In addition, ATRA-21 may represent an important diagnostic tool for the selection of individual patients who may benefit from ATRA-based therapeutic strategies also in tumors characterized by lower average sensitivity.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Certain isoforms and fragments of neuregulin have been found to be cardioprotective. The effects of a full-length neuregulin-1beta isoform, glial growth factor 2 (GGF2; USAN/INN; also called cimaglermin) were investigated in vitro. Various dosing regimens were then evaluated for their effects on left ventricular (LV) function in rats with surgically-induced myocardial infarction. In vitro, GGF2 bound with high affinity to erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene (ErbB) 4 receptors, potently promoted Akt phosphorylation, as well as reduced cell death following doxorubicin exposure in HL1 cells. Daily GGF2 treatment beginning 7-14 days after left anterior descending coronary artery ligation produced improvements in LV ejection fraction and other measures of LV function and morphology. The improvements in LV function (e.g. 10% point increase in absolute LV ejection fraction) with GGF2 were dose-dependent. LV performance was substantially improved when GGF2 treatment was delivered infrequently, despite a serum half-life of less than 2h and could be maintained for more than 10 months with treatment once weekly or once every 2 weeks. These studies confirm previous findings that GGF2 may improve contractile performance in the failing rat heart and that infrequent exposure to GGF2 may improve LV function and impact remodeling in the failing myocardium.

This study is to explore the selection of infectious ecosystems on dominant variants and their evolutionary dynamics of ALV-J between DF1 cells and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. High-throughput sequencing platforms provide an approach for detecting quasispecies diversity more fully. RESULTS: An average of about 20,000 valid reads were obtained from two variable regions of gp85 gene and LTR-U3 region from each sample in different infectious ecosystems. The top 10 dominant variants among ALV-J from chicken plasmas, DF1 cells and liver tumor were completely different from each other. Also there was a difference of shannon entropy and global selection pressure values (omega) in different infectious ecosystems. In the plasmas of two chickens, a large portion of quasispecies contained a 3-peptides ""LSD"" repeat insertion that was only less than 0.01% in DF1 cell culture supernatants. In parallel studies, the LTR-U3 region of ALV-J from the chicken plasmas demonstrated more variants with mutations in their transcription regulatory elements than those from DF1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data taken together suggest that the molecular epidemiology based on isolated ALV-J in cell culture may not represent the true evolution of virus in chicken flocks in the field.

OBJECTIVE: To quantify total and average years of life lost due to cancer in Colombia, and to investigate changes in this burden between 1997 and 2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained sex-specific data on age distribution, remaining life expectancy, deaths due to specific cancers and total number of deaths from the Colombian Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadisticas. We calculated years of life lost based on each individual s age at death and the remaining life expectancy at that age; as for average years of life, we divided these by the number of deaths due to specific cancers. RESULTS: The total number of cancer deaths increased by 33% between 1997 and 2012, comprising 15% of male and 20% of female deaths in the period 2010-2012. Total years of life lost due to cancer increased by 25.1% for males and 31.1% for females over the study period. The highest increases (>40%) were observed for colorectal, pancreas and kidney cancers in both sexes, for melanomas and bladder cancer in men, and for breast and ovarian cancer in women.

In the present study, an aptamer-based electrochemical biosensor for ultrasensitive and selective detection of leukemia cancer cells has been introduced. The thiolated sgc8c aptamer was immobilized on gold nanoparticles-coated magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Apt-GMNPs). Ethidium bromide (EB), intercalated into the stem of the aptamer hairpin, provides the read-out signal for the quantification of the leukemia cancer cells. After introduction of the leukemia cancer cells onto the Apt-GMNPs, the hairpin structure of the aptamer is disrupted and the intercalator molecules are released, resulting in a decrease of the electrochemical signal. The immobilization of nitrogen-doped graphene nanosheets on the electrode surface provides an excellent platform for amplifying the read-out signal. Under optimal conditions, the aptasensor exhibits a linear response over a wide dynamic range of leukemia cancer cells from 10 to 1x10(6)cellmL(-1). The present protocol provides a highly sensitive, selective, simple, and robust method for early stage detection of leukemia cancer. Furthermore, the fabricated aptasensor was successfully used for the detection of leukemia cancer cells in complex media such as human blood plasma, without any serious interference.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Given the changes in RA therapy over recent decades, this study was undertaken to assess whether lymphoma risk remains increased, and if so, to explore risk predictors and lymphoma subtypes. METHODS: We identified 12,656 cases of incident RA in the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register 1997-2012 and obtained information on therapy and inflammatory activity during the first year after diagnosis. Each patient was matched to 10 population comparator subjects. Through linkage to the Swedish Cancer Register, lymphomas, including subtypes, were identified. We assessed hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression. RESULTS: Overall, the HR for lymphoma was increased in RA, to 1.6 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.2-2.1). Taking RA duration into account, risks did not appear to have declined over successive calendar years of RA diagnosis. Neither use of methotrexate the first year after RA diagnosis nor ever use of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) increased lymphoma risk (HR 0.9 [95% CI 0.4-1.9]). Use of oral corticosteroids the first year after RA diagnosis was associated with a reduced risk (HR 0.5 [95% CI 0.3-0.9]). Inflammatory activity during the first year after RA diagnosis did not predict future lymphoma risk. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia occurred less frequently, and Hodgkin's lymphoma occurred more frequently, in RA patients than in the general population. CONCLUSION: The average lymphoma risk in recently diagnosed RA is similar in magnitude to that reported in historical cohorts. Standard antirheumatic treatment including TNFi did not predict future lymphoma risk. Distribution of lymphoma subtypes warrants further investigation.","['(c) 2016, American College of Rheumatology.']","['Hellgren, K', 'Baecklund, E', 'Backlin, C', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Smedby, K E', 'Askling, J']","['Hellgren K', 'Baecklund E', 'Backlin C', 'Sundstrom C', 'Smedby KE', 'Askling J']","['Karolinska Institutet at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,,United States,Arthritis Rheumatol,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",101623795,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,2016/12/20 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2016/12/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/art.40017 [doi]'],ppublish,Arthritis Rheumatol. 2017 Apr;69(4):700-708. doi: 10.1002/art.40017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report heterozygous variants in the gene KMT2B (also known as MLL4) in 27 unrelated individuals with a complex progressive childhood-onset dystonia, often associated with a typical facial appearance and characteristic brain magnetic resonance imaging findings. Over time, the majority of affected individuals developed prominent cervical, cranial and laryngeal dystonia.

During progression, the number of mutations, their diversity and clone sizes increased, with alterations frequently present in dominant clones with or without their sweeping previous clones. Enriched in secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML; in comparison to high-risk MDS), FLT3, PTPN11, WT1, IDH1, NPM1, IDH2 and NRAS mutations (type 1) tended to be newly acquired, and were associated with faster sAML progression and a shorter overall survival time. Significantly enriched in high-risk MDS (in comparison to low-risk MDS), TP53, GATA2, KRAS, RUNX1, STAG2, ASXL1, ZRSR2 and TET2 mutations (type 2) had a weaker impact on sAML progression and overall survival than type-1 mutations.

UTX-deficient iNKT cells exhibited impaired expression of iNKT cell signature genes due to a decrease in activation-associated H3K4me3 marks and an increase in repressive H3K27me3 marks within the promoters occupied by UTX. We found that JunB regulated iNKT cell development and that the expression of genes that were targets of both JunB and the iNKT cell master transcription factor PLZF was UTX dependent. We identified iNKT cell super-enhancers and demonstrated that UTX-mediated regulation of super-enhancer accessibility was a key mechanism for commitment to the iNKT cell lineage.

An inducible NRAS(V12)-driven AML mouse model has established a critical role for continued NRAS(V12) expression in leukemia maintenance. In this model genetic suppression of NRAS(V12) expression results in rapid leukemia remission, but some mice undergo spontaneous relapse with NRAS(V12)-independent (NRI) AMLs providing an opportunity to identify mechanisms that bypass the requirement for Ras oncogene activity and drive leukemia relapse. We found that relapsed NRI AMLs are devoid of NRAS(V12) expression and signaling through the major oncogenic Ras effector pathways, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, but express higher levels of an alternate Ras effector, Ralb, and exhibit NRI phosphorylation of the RALB effector TBK1, implicating RALB signaling in AML relapse. Functional studies confirmed that inhibiting CDK5-mediated RALB activation with a clinically relevant experimental drug, dinaciclib, led to potent RALB-dependent antileukemic effects in human AML cell lines, induced apoptosis in patient-derived AML samples in vitro and led to a 2-log reduction in the leukemic burden in patient-derived xenograft mice. Furthermore, dinaciclib potently suppressed the clonogenic potential of relapsed NRI AMLs in vitro and prevented the development of relapsed AML in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that Ras oncogene-independent activation of RALB signaling is a therapeutically targetable mechanism of escape from NRAS oncogene addiction in AML.",,"['Pomeroy, E J', 'Lee, L A', 'Lee, R D W', 'Schirm, D K', 'Temiz, N A', 'Ma, J', 'Gruber, T A', 'Diaz-Flores, E', 'Moriarity, B S', 'Downing, J R', 'Shannon, K M', 'Largaespada, D A', 'Eckfeldt, C E']","['Pomeroy EJ', 'Lee LA', 'Lee RDW', 'Schirm DK', 'Temiz NA', 'Ma J', 'Gruber TA', 'Diaz-Flores E', 'Moriarity BS', 'Downing JR', 'Shannon KM', 'Largaespada DA', 'Eckfeldt CE']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, University of Minnesota Medical School, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161219,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Oncogenes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'ral GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2016/12/20 06:00,2017/10/12 06:00,['2016/12/20 06:00'],"['2016/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016471 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.471 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jun 8;36(23):3263-3273. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.471.

They have been proposed to be useful anti-neoplastic targets for over two decades, especially in Ras-driven cancers. Until recently, however, few in vivo studies had been carried out to test this premise. Several recent mouse model studies have verified that Rac1, RhoA, and some of their effector proteins such as PAK and ROCK, are likely anti-cancer targets for treating K-Ras-driven tumours. Other seemingly contradictory studies have suggested that at least in certain instances inhibition of individual Rho GTPases may paradoxically result in pro-neoplastic effects. Significantly, both RhoA GTPase gain- and loss-of-function mutations have been discovered in primary leukemia/lymphoma and gastric cancer by human cancer genome sequencing efforts, suggesting both pro- and anti-neoplastic roles. In this review we summarize and integrate these unexpected findings and discuss the mechanistic implications in the design and application of Rho GTPase targeting strategies in future cancer therapies.",,"['Zandvakili, I', 'Lin, Y', 'Morris, J C', 'Zheng, Y']","['Zandvakili I', 'Lin Y', 'Morris JC', 'Zheng Y']","[""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Molecular and Developmental Biology Graduate Program, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Medical-Scientist Training Program, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', ""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio USA.', ""Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Molecular and Developmental Biology Graduate Program, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Medical-Scientist Training Program, College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161219,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2016/12/20 06:00,2017/10/12 06:00,['2016/12/20 06:00'],"['2016/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016473 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.473 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jun 8;36(23):3213-3222. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.473.

After cellular uptake, Ara-C is converted into its therapeutically active triphosphate metabolite, Ara-CTP, which exerts antileukemic effects, primarily by inhibiting DNA synthesis in proliferating cells. Currently, a substantial fraction of patients with AML fail to respond effectively to Ara-C therapy, and reliable biomarkers for predicting the therapeutic response to Ara-C are lacking. SAMHD1 is a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase that cleaves physiological dNTPs into deoxyribonucleosides and inorganic triphosphate. Although it has been postulated that SAMHD1 sensitizes cancer cells to nucleoside-analog derivatives through the depletion of competing dNTPs, we show here that SAMHD1 reduces Ara-C cytotoxicity in AML cells. Mechanistically, dGTP-activated SAMHD1 hydrolyzes Ara-CTP, which results in a drastic reduction of Ara-CTP in leukemic cells. Loss of SAMHD1 activity-through genetic depletion, mutational inactivation of its triphosphohydrolase activity or proteasomal degradation using specialized, virus-like particles-potentiates the cytotoxicity of Ara-C in AML cells. In mouse models of retroviral AML transplantation, as well as in retrospective analyses of adult patients with AML, the response to Ara-C-containing therapy was inversely correlated with SAMHD1 expression. These results identify SAMHD1 as a potential biomarker for the stratification of patients with AML who might best respond to Ara-C-based therapy and as a target for treating Ara-C-refractory

However, little is known about the impact of prior IFI on survival. Patients with pre-transplant IFI (cases; n=825) were compared with controls (n=10247). A subset analysis assessed outcomes in leukemia patients pre- and post 2001. Cases were older with lower performance status (KPS), more advanced disease, higher likelihood of AML and having received cord blood, reduced intensity conditioning, mold-active fungal prophylaxis and more recently transplanted. Aspergillus spp. and Candida spp. were the most commonly identified pathogens. 68% of patients had primarily pulmonary involvement. Univariate and multivariable analysis demonstrated inferior PFS and overall survival (OS) for cases. At 2 years, cases had higher mortality and shorter PFS with significant increases in non-relapse mortality (NRM) but no difference in relapse. One year probability of post-HSCT IFI was 24% (cases) and 17% (control, P<0.001). The predominant cause of death was underlying malignancy; infectious death was higher in cases (13% vs 9%). In the subset analysis, patients transplanted before 2001 had increased NRM with inferior OS and PFS compared with later cases. Pre-transplant IFI is associated with lower PFS and OS after allogeneic HSCT but significant survivorship was observed. Consequently, pre-transplant IFI should not be a contraindication to allogeneic HSCT in otherwise suitable candidates. Documented pre-transplant IFI is associated with lower PFS and OS after allogeneic HSCT. However, mortality post transplant is more influenced by advanced disease status than previous IFI.

To test this hypothesis, we treated 218 patients (median age 50.7 years, male/female 50/50%) with fludarabine 40 mg/m(2) once daily x4, each dose followed by IV Bu, randomized to 130 mg/m(2) (N=107) or PK-guided to average daily SE, AUC of 6000 muM min (N=111), stratified for remission status and allo-grafting from HLA-matched donors. Toxicity and GvHD rates in the groups were similar; the risk of relapse or treatment-related mortality remained higher in the fixed-dose group throughout the 80-month observation period. Further, PK-guidance yielded safer disease control, leading to improved overall and PFS, most prominently in MDS patients and in AML patients not in remission at allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We conclude that AML/MDS patients receiving pretransplant conditioning treatment with our 4-day regimen may benefit significantly from PK-guided Bu dosing.

METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Cochrane electronic databases to locate relevant papers from 2003 onward. Then, an initial meta-analysis of 14 studies involving 2184 patients was conducted to understand the effect of imatinib mesylate (IM) C0 on clinical outcome in CML patients. Subsequently, a series of meta-analyses were performed, including up to 23 studies with 2577 patients, on the effect of genetic polymorphisms of ABCB1 and ABCG2 on the clinical response to IM. RESULTS: Meta-analysis revealed that patients who achieved a major molecular response (MMR) have a significantly higher IM C0 than those who failed to achieve an MMR. We also found that the patients who achieved a complete cytogenic response (CCyR) have a significantly higher IM C0 than those who did not achieve a CCyR. However, no significant difference in IM C0 was found between the complete molecular response and non-complete molecular response groups. Additional analysis showed that ABCG2 421 variant A allele was significantly associated with a higher rate of MMR and overall response, especially in Asian patients. Meta-analysis did not reveal a correlation between ABCB1 C3435T and C1236T polymorphisms with any clinical response to IM. However, the G2677T/A polymorphism could play a role in IM response in the recessive model. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates that there was a significant correlation between the IM trough concentration and clinical responses, especially MMR and CCyR, in CML patients.

Constitutional mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A cause a recently identified Tatton-Brown-Rahman overgrowth syndrome (TBRS). Somatically acquired mutations in DNMT3A are causally associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and p.Arg882His represents the most prevalent hotspot. So far, no patients with TBRS have been reported to have subsequently developed AML. Here, we report a live birth and the survival of a female with the TBRS phenotype who had a heterozygous constitutional DNMT3A mutation at the AML somatic mutation hotspot p.Arg882His in her DNA from peripheral blood and buccal tissue. Her characteristic features at birth included hypotonia, narrow palpebral fissures, ventricular septal defect, umbilical hernia, sacral cyst, Chiari type I anomaly. At the age of 6 years, she exhibited overgrowth (> 3 SD) and round face and intellectual disability. This report represents the first documentation of the same variant (DNMT3A p.Arg882His) as both the constitutional mutation associated with TBRS and the somatic mutation hotspot of AML. The observation neither confirms nor denies the notion that mutations responsible for TBRS and those for AML might share the same mode of action. Larger data sets are required to determine whether TBRS patients with constitutional DNMT3A mutations are at an increased risk for AML.

Pathological alterations contribute to diseases such as hypertension, cancer, autoimmune disorders or neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, studying disease-related perturbations of the secretome and the secretome itself covers an important aspect of cellular physiology. We recently developed the secretome protein enrichment with click sugars (SPECS) method that enables the analysis of secretomes of in vitro cell cultures even in the presence of FCS with MS. So far, SPECS facilitated the identification of protease substrates of BACE1, SPPL3 and ADAM10. Though, the SPECS method has already enabled deep insights into secretome biology, we aimed to improve the SPECS protocol to obtain even more information from MS-based secretome analysis and reduce the amount of input material. Here, we optimised the reaction buffer, the pH and replaced Dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) PEG12-biotin with the more water-soluble variant DBCO-sulpho-biotin to finally provide an optimised protocol of the recently published SPECS protocol. Overall, the number of quantified glycoproteins and their average sequence coverage was increased by 1.6- and 2.4-fold, respectively. Thus, the opzimised SPECS protocol allows reducing the input material by half without losing information. These improvements make the SPECS method more sensitive and more universal applicable to cell types with limited availability.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

DIAGNOSIS: PV is defined by a JAK2 mutation, whose absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, makes the diagnosis unlikely. JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations are the mutually exclusive ""driver"" mutations in ET with respective incidences of 55%, 25%, and 3%; approximately 17% are triple-negative. However, the same molecular markers might also be present in prefibrotic myelofibrosis, whose morphological distinction from ET is prognostically relevant. SURVIVAL AND LEUKEMIC/FIBROTIC TRANSFORMATION: Median survivals are approximately 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET; the corresponding values for younger patients (age <60 years) are 24 and 33 years. Life-expectancy in ET is inferior to the control population. Driver mutational status has not been shown to affect survival in ET whereas the presence of JAK2/MPL mutations has been associated with higher risk of arterial thrombosis and that of MPL with higher risk of fibrotic progression. Risk factors for overall survival in both ET and PV include advanced age, leukocytosis and thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rates at 20 years are estimated at <10% for PV and 5% for ET; fibrotic transformation rates are slightly higher. Most recently, ASXL1, SRSF2, and IDH2 mutations have been associated with inferior overall, leukemia-free or fibrosis-free survival in PV; similarly adverse mutations in ET included SH2B3, SF3B1, U2AF1, TP53, IDH2, and EZH2. THROMBOSIS RISK STRATIFICATION: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of recurrent thrombosis. Accordingly, PV includes two risk categories: high-risk (age >60 years or thrombosis history) and low-risk (absence of both risk factors). In ET, risk stratification includes four categories: very low risk (age </=60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2/MPL un-mutated), low risk (age </=60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2/MPL mutated), intermediate risk (age >60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2/MPL un-mutated), and high risk (thrombosis history or age >60 years with JAK2/MPL mutation). In addition, presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelets >1000 x 10(9)/L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The main goal of therapy in PV and ET is to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. All patients with PV require phlebotomy to keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily aspirin (81 mg). In addition, high-risk patients with PV require cytoreductive therapy. Very low risk ET patients might not require any form of therapy while low-risk patients require at least once-daily aspirin therapy. Cytoreductive therapy is also recommended for high-risk ET patients but it is not mandatory for intermediate-risk patients. First-line drug of choice for cytoreductive therapy, in both ET and PV, is hydroxyurea and second-line drugs of choice are interferon-alpha and busulfan. We currently do not recommend treatment with ruxolutinib or other JAK2 inhibitors in PV or ET, unless in the presence of severe and protracted pruritus or marked splenomegaly that is not responding to the aforementioned drugs. Screening for AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin, in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis. Am. J. Hematol. 92:95-108, 2017.

Descriptive study conducted between January and May 2012. Mothers of 65 Puerto Rican children/adolescents undergoing cancer treatments responded to the Spanish versions of the TRSC-C, Symptom Alleviation: Self-Care Methods, and a Demographic and Health form. The children/adolescents' mean age was 9.2 (1-17) years; 62% were boys; 56 had chemotherapy; 9 had chemoradiotherapy. Children diagnoses were 35.4% leukemia, 24.6% solid tumors, 24.6% nervous system tumors, and 15.4% other. On the TRSC-C, the symptoms experienced by 70% or more of the children were: irritability (77%), nausea (75%), and hair loss (72%). On the Symptom Alleviation: Self-Care Methods, the most commonly reported symptom alleviation category was ""taking prescribed medicines."" Puerto Rican mothers reported the use of alleviation practices to treat their children experiencing symptoms during pediatric cancer treatments. Patients and caregivers need to be educated about treatment-induced side effects, and the life-threatening consequences of underreporting and undermanagement. Symptoms should always be addressed at the time of initiation of primary or adjuvant cancer therapy because pretreatment symptoms may persist or get worse across the trajectory of treatment. A continuous assessment and management of symptoms during the childhood cancer trajectory can optimize clinical care and improve quality of life of patients and families.","['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Gonzalez-Mercado, Velda J', 'Williams, Phoebe D', 'Williams, Arthur R', 'Pedro, Elsa', 'Colon, Gloria']","['Gonzalez-Mercado VJ', 'Williams PD', 'Williams AR', 'Pedro E', 'Colon G']","['College of Nursing, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'School of Nursing, University of Kansas, Kansas City, Kansas, USA.', 'Department of Health Administration and Policy, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus, San Juan, Puerto Rico.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine, San Juan, Puerto Rico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161219,Australia,Int J Nurs Pract,International journal of nursing practice,9613615,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mothers/*psychology', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prevalence', 'Puerto Rico', 'Quality of Life', 'Self Care']",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'cancer therapy', 'nursing', 'parent/caregiver care', 'pediatric', 'symptom monitoring']",2016/12/19 06:00,2018/04/10 06:00,['2016/12/20 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/13 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijn.12500 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Nurs Pract. 2017 Feb;23(1). doi: 10.1111/ijn.12500.

There are increasing reports of azole-resistant Aspergillus spp. This study assessed the epidemiology of IA and azole-resistant Aspergillus spp. in patients with acute leukaemia in Germany. A prospective multicentre cohort study was performed in German haematology/oncology centres. The incidence of probable and proven aspergillosis according to the revised EORTC/MSG criteria was assessed for all patients with acute leukaemia [acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)]. Cases were documented into a web-based case report form, and centres provided data on standards regarding prophylactic and diagnostic measures. Clinical isolates were screened centrally for azole resistance and, if applicable, underlying resistance mechanisms were analysed. Between September 2011 and December 2013, 179 cases of IA [6 proven (3.4%) and 173 probable (96.6%)] were diagnosed in 3067 patients with acute leukaemia. The incidence of IA was 6.4% among 2440 AML patients and 3.8% among 627 ALL patients. Mortality at Day 84 was 33.8% (49/145) and attributable mortality was 26.9% (39/145). At Day 84, 53 patients (29.6%) showed a complete response, 25 (14.0%) a partial response and 17 (9.5%) a deterioration or failure. A total of 77 clinical Aspergillus fumigatus isolates were collected during the study period. Two episodes of azole-resistant IA (1.1%) were caused by a TR/L98H mutation in the cyp51A gene. With only two cases of IA due to azole-resistant A. fumigatus, a change of antifungal treatment practices in Germany does not appear warranted currently.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and International Society of Chemotherapy.

However, little is known about its effect on human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, including imatinib-resistant CML cells. The objective of this study was to investigate whether CTD could overcome imatinib resistance in imatinib-resistant CML cells and to explore the possible underlying mechanisms associated with the effect. Our results showed that CTD strongly inhibited the growth of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. CTD induced cell cycle arrest at mitotic phase and triggered DNA damage in CML cells. The ATM/ATR inhibitor CGK733 abrogated CTD-induced mitotic arrest but promoted the cytotoxic effects of CTD. In addition, we demonstrated that CTD downregulated the expression of the BCR-ABL protein and suppressed its downstream signal transduction. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that CTD inhibited BCR-ABL at transcriptional level. Knockdown of BCR-ABL increased the cell-killing effects of CTD in K562 cells. These findings indicated that CTD overcomes imatinib resistance through depletion of BCR-ABL.

While the role of MEF conditioned media (MEFCM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in regulating mESC pluripotency has led to culturing of mESCs on LIF/MEFCM supplemented gelatin-coated substrates, the role of physical interactions between MEFs and mESCs in regulating mESC pluripotency remains to be fully understood. Here, we address this question by characterizing the physicochemical properties of MEF derived matrices (MEFDMs), and probing their role in regulating mESC fate. We show that MEFDM composition and stiffness-dictated by MEF contractility-regulates mESC pluripotency by modulating mESC contractility through integrin-mediated mechanoadaptation. While baseline mESC pluripotency is maintained at early time points, activation of mESC contractility by LPA leads to drop in pluripotency levels. In contrast, addition of blebbistatin and LIF independently increases pluripotency by suppressing mechanoadaptation, highlighting the role of mechanoadaptation in regulating pluripotency and illustrating the role of LIF as a mechano-inhibitor in mESCs. Long-term culture of mESCs on MEFDMs under LIF-free conditions triggers loss of pluripotency, and induces ligand-dependent expression of the osteogenic transcription factor Runx2. Maintenance of genomic integrity (euploidy) on MEFDMs but not on gelatin-coated substrates, combined with the ability of MEFDMs in supporting LIF-free expansion and differentiation of mESCs, illustrates the suitability of MEFDMs for clinical and regenerative medicine applications.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The chemical constituents and total coumarins content of TCHD were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and UV-vis spectrophotometry, respectively. MTT assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, and Annexin V-FITC/PI double labeling were applied to evaluate TCHD's efficacy on SKM-1 cells. Western blot analysis was also used to clarify the action mechanism of TCHD on protein expression level. RESULTS: Two compounds, p-coumaric acid and E-6-O-p-coumaroyl scandoside methyl ester, were identified in TCHD, and its total coumarins content reached 87.4%. By MTT assay, apoptosis-inducing effect of TCHD on SKM-1 cells was found in a dose-dependent manner after 24-48h treatment, with IC50 values of 104.48mug/ml and 100.66mug/ml, respectively. Morphological and flow cytometry observation also confirmed such effect of TCHD. Western blot analysis clarified its action mechanism associating with the activation of caspases and inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report regarding the apoptosis-inducing efficacy and mechanism of TCHD on SKM-1 cells, providing a promising candidate of TCM for MDS and AML therapy with fewer side effects.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, only a few prospective randomized trials have directly compared these regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this report, we retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 62 adult ALL patients treated with either hyper-CVAD (hyper fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone; n = 38) or a BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster)-like regimen (n = 24) between November 2000 and January 2016 at the American university of Beirut Medical Center in Lebanon. The feasibility of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for those patients was also evaluated. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 29 (range, 1-129) months. Fifteen (39%) and 10 (42%) patients underwent allo-SCT in the hyper-CVAD and BFM-like group, respectively. At the time of the last follow-up, 28 patients (74%) were in complete remission in the hyper-CVAD group versus 18 patients (75%) in the BFM-like group. Of those, 20 patients (53%) versus 11 patients (46%) were minimal residual disease-negative at the last follow-up, respectively. The 3-year overall survival rate (71.9% vs. 76.9%; P = .808) and 3-year disease-free survival (54.7% vs. 76.4%; P = .435) were similar in hyper-CVAD group compared with the BFM-like group, respectively. Both chemotherapies were relatively well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Overall, despite the older age and a greater number of patients with high-risk category (including Philadelphia chromosome-positive) in the hyper-CVAD group, this did not translate into a difference in survival outcome between the 2 groups. The hyper-CVAD regimen appears to be feasible for adult patients with ALL in terms of tolerability and efficacy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Malignant neoplasms often circumvent or subjugate these pathways by promoting RTK overactivation through mutation or chromosomal translocation. RTK translocations create a fusion protein containing a dimerizing partner fused to an RTK kinase domain, resulting in constitutive kinase domain activation, altered RTK cellular localization, upregulation of downstream signaling, and novel pathway activation. While RTK translocations in hematological malignancies are relatively rare, clinical evidence suggests that patients with these genetic abnormalities benefit from RTK-targeted inhibitors. Here, we present a timely review of an exciting field by examining RTK chromosomal translocations in hematological cancers, such as Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR), REarranged during Transfection (RET), Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R), and Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 3 (NTRK3) fusions, and discuss current therapeutic options.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Included were adult patients with a first unrelated bone marrow or peripheral blood HCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome that were reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research between 1999 and 2011. Our results showed that neither MICA mismatch nor MICA-129 polymorphism were associated with any transplantation outcome (P < .01), with the exception of a higher relapse in recipients of MICA-mismatched HLA 10/10 donors (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; P = .003). There was a suggestion of association between MICA mismatches and a higher risk of acute GVHD grades II to IV (HR, 1.4; P = .013) There were no significant interactions between MICA mismatches and HLA matching (9/10 versus 10/10).

The human olfactory bulb contains neural stem cells (NSCs) that are responsible for neurogenesis in the brain and the replacement of damaged cellular components throughout life. NSCs are capable of differentiating into neuronal and glial cells. We isolated NSCs from the olfactory bulb of brain-death donors and differentiated them into dopaminergic neurons. The olfactory bulb tissues obtained were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F12, B27 supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor. The NSCs and proliferation markers were assessed. The multipotentiality of olfactory bulb NSCs was demonstrated by their capacity to differentiate into neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. To generate dopaminergic neurons, olfactory bulb NSCs were differentiated in neurobasal medium, supplemented with B27, and treated with sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 8 and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor from the 7th to the 21st day, followed by detection of dopaminergic neuronal markers including tyrosine hydroxylase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase. The cells were expanded, established in continuous cell lines and differentiated into the two classical neuronal phenotypes. The percentage of co-positive cells (microtubule-associated protein 2 and tyrosine hydroxylase; aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase) in the treated cells was significantly higher than in the untreated cells. These results illustrate the existence of multipotent NSCs in the adult human olfactory bulb that are capable of differentiating toward putative dopaminergic neurons in the presence of trophic factors.

MATERIAL AND METHODS 57 ALL patients and 31 age and sex-matched children (control) were included in this study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed for the analysis of the genotype of FPGS rs1544105 and high-performance liquid chromatography for measurement of MTX plasma concentration after 24-h and 44-h treatment. Overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS No differences were observed between patients and controls regarding the distribution frequency of genotype and alleles of rs1544105. Patients carrying AA genotype had a significantly higher plasma concentration of MTX after 24 h than those carrying GG or GA (P<0.05) and no differences were found after 44 h. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a longer median survival time in patients with AA than other genotypes with significant difference in overall survival.

In fibroblast cells, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), through IGF1 signaling, was found to be the key protein for nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and MYC transcription activation. We herein investigated the IRS1/beta-catenin axis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Samples were obtained from 45 patients with ALL and 13 healthy donors. ALL cell lines were used. Gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR. Protein expression, associations, and cellular localization were evaluated by immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractionation, and confocal microscopy. Cells were submitted to IGF1 stimulation and/or IGF1R pharmacological inhibition (OSI-906). IRS1, beta-catenin, and MYC mRNA expression were significantly elevated in ALL patients, compared to normal controls. MYC mRNA expression positively correlated with beta-catenin and IRS1. Increased age and MYC expression negatively affected overall survival by univariate analysis. Total and phospho-IGF1R and IRS1, MYC and beta-catenin protein expression were higher in ALL cells, compared to normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). IRS1 and beta-catenin were found to be colocalized in the nuclei and the cytoplasm of ALL cell lines, whereas both proteins were only slightly detected in the cytoplasm of normal PBMC. In Jurkat cells, a constitutive IRS1 and beta-catenin protein interaction were observed; OSI-906 treatment decreased IGF1R tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS1 expression and phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, IRS1 and beta-catenin association, and MYC protein expression. In conclusion, the IRS1/beta-catenin axis is activated in ALL cells. J. Cell. Biochem. 118: 1774-1781, 2017.

The inferior outcomes in adults can be attributed mainly to adverse genetic features, as well as the inability-particularly of older adults-to tolerate chemotherapy. Modest improvements have been seen in outcomes for adolescents and young adults; these can largely be attributed to the use of pediatric-type combination chemotherapy regimens in patients aged 50 years or younger. In patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL, once a very-high-risk group, outcomes have markedly improved as a result of the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy. The persistence of minimal residual disease has emerged as the single most important prognostic factor for ALL and is increasingly being used to help make decisions regarding allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or novel salvage therapies. Relapsed/refractory ALL has had a dismal prognosis. In recent years, novel immune-based therapies have been developed that have shown impressive results and that have the potential to improve the outcome of relapsed ALL.

We found that primary BPDCN cells were dependent on the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 and were uniformly sensitive to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, as measured by direct cytotoxicity, apoptosis assays, and dynamic BH3 profiling. Animals bearing BPDCN patient-derived xenografts had disease responses and improved survival after venetoclax treatment in vivo Finally, we report on 2 patients with relapsed/refractory BPDCN who received venetoclax off-label and experienced significant disease responses. We propose that venetoclax or other BCL2 inhibitors undergo expedited clinical evaluation in BPDCN, alone or in combination with other therapies. In addition, these data illustrate an example of precision medicine to predict treatment response using ex vivo functional assessment of primary tumor tissue, without requiring a genetic biomarker. SIGNIFICANCE: Therapy for BPDCN is inadequate, and survival in patients with the disease is poor. We used primary tumor cell functional profiling to predict BCL2 antagonist sensitivity as a common feature of BPDCN, and demonstrated in vivo clinical activity of venetoclax in patient-derived xenografts and in 2 patients with relapsed chemotherapy-refractory disease.

After linking birth records and cancer registry data from California, we conducted a population-based case-control study to investigate the role of delivery by cesarean section (C-section) in the etiology of childhood ALL. This study included 5,081 cases and 18,927 matched controls born in 1978-2009; more detailed data were available on type of C-section (i.e., elective vs. emergency) for a subset of 1,552 cases and 5,688 controls. No association was observed between C-section overall and childhood ALL risk (<15 years of age), but elective C-section was associated with a significantly elevated risk of ALL (odds ratio (OR) = 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.36). At the peak ages of ALL incidence (2-4 years), C-section was associated with an 11% higher risk of ALL (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.22) compared with vaginal delivery, and the magnitude of the association was larger for elective C-section (OR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.70). Emergency C-section was not associated with childhood ALL. Because of design features minimizing nonparticipation and inaccurate recall, this record linkage-based study is less prone to bias. Our results suggest that delivery by elective C-section was associated with a higher risk of childhood ALL, especially at the peak ages of incidence.

Here we report a hitherto-unrecognized P. frutescens phytochemical that potently suppresses IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity reactions. Structural analysis reveals that the purified anti-allergic compound (Perilla-derived methoxyflavanone, PDMF) is identified as 8-hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone. PDMF significantly inhibits IgE-mediated histamine release from RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia cells as compared with those seen in known P. frutescens-derived anti-inflammatory polyphenols. We also show that oral administration of PDMF not only suppresses passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, but also prevents allergic rhinitis-like nasal symptoms in a murine model of Japanese cedar pollinosis. Mechanistically, PDMF negatively regulates Akt phosphorylation and intracellular Ca(2+) influx, both of which are essential for mast cell secretory granule translocation and its exocytosis upon high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) cross-linking.

However, one third of patients with ER(+) breast cancer exhibit endocrine therapy resistance, and many patients develop recurrence and die 5 to 10 years after diagnosis. In ER(+) breast cancer, a major problem is to distinguish those patients most likely to develop recurrence or metastatic disease within 10 years after diagnosis from those with a sufficiently good prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We downloaded the messenger RNA expression data and the clinical information for 401 patients with ER(+) breast cancer from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics. An information-theoretical approach was used to identify the prognostic factors for survival in patients with ER(+) breast cancer and to classify those patients according to the prognostic factors. RESULTS: The information-theoretical approach contributed to the identification of KMT2C and SLC20A1 as prognostic biomarkers in ER(+) breast cancer. We found that low KMT2C expression was associated with a poor outcome and high SLC20A1 expression was associated with a poor outcome. Both levels of KMT2C and SLC20A1 expression were significantly and strongly associated with the differentiation of survival. The 10-year survival rate for ER(+) patients with low KMT2C and high SLC20A1 expression was 0%. In contrast, for ER(+) patients with high KMT2C and low SLC20A1 expression, the 10-year survival rate was 86.78%. CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that clinical examination of the expression of both KMT2C and SLC20A1 in ER(+) breast cancer will be very useful for the determination of prognosis and therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Author(s).

METHODS: A decision tree with a time horizon of 30 days was built under colombian health system perspective including only direct costs. The costs of procedures and medications were taken from official sources and an institution of national reference of oncology services. The safety and effectiveness data were taken from the literature and two Colombian cohorts with patients older than 15 years. The unit of outcome was the proportion of deaths avoided. RESULTS: Base-case results on a clinical trial indicate that using factor is a dominant strategy. The variable that most impacted the outcome was the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Considering a threshold of $22.228 USD in 80% of cases using factor was cost effective. However, the use of factor is not cost-effective for the country for incidences of febrile neutropenia > 48%. It was not possible to establish cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim because no information was found. CONCLUSION: As per Colombian data, the use of prophylactic factor under chemotherapeutic induction in adults with ALL, turns out to be not cost effective. The difference in the results suggests the need of a careful extrapolation of information from clinical trials (ideal world) for developing economic evaluations in Colombia.","['Copyright (c) 2016 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes', 'Research (ISPOR).

We determined that TP53 mutations predicted complete response (CR), as 10 of 15 patients (66.7%) who possessed TP53 mutations achieved a CR. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that TP53 mutations are the only molecular signatures predictive of a CR to DAC in MDS. Among the ten patients with TP53 mutations who achieved a CR, nine presented with complex karyotypes due to abnormalities involving chromosome 5 and/or chromosome 7, and eight possessed monosomies. Although TP53 mutations were associated with a higher frequency of CRs, they were not associated with improved survival. Poor outcomes were attributed to early relapses and transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia after CR. Post-DAC therapy patient gene mutation profiles showed that most CR patients exhibited fewer gene mutations after achieving a CR. It seems that suppression of these gene mutations was facilitated by DAC, resulting in a CR. In summary, TP53 mutations might predict decitabine-induced complete responses in patients with MDS.

The impact of thrombocytosis on the risk of vascular events has also been investigated. Many clinicians consider an elevated platelet count to be a risk factor for thrombosis or, when extreme, bleeding and utilize this as a criterion to start cytoreductive therapy. However, the relationship between thrombocytosis and vascular events is controversial and solid evidence to support the use of cytoreductive therapy in ET patients who have no other risk factors is lacking.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether occupational exposure to styrene increases the risk of cancer, in particular lymphohematopoietic cancers. METHODS: We established a study population of 72,292 workers employed in 443 small and medium-sized companies producing reinforced plastics 1964-2007 by utilizing several national registries, expert assessment, and worker survey data. We identified incident cancer cases from 1968 to 2012 in the national Danish cancer registry and computed standardized incidence rate ratios (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) based on national rates. RESULTS: Increasing SIRs of Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloid leukemia, and cancer of nasal cavities and sinuses were inconsistently associated with increasing duration of employment, early year of first employment, or styrene exposure probability. No such trends were observed for cancer of the esophagus, pancreas, lung, kidney, or urinary bladder, which have previously been associated with styrene exposure. Lung cancer showed an overall increased risk that decreased by duration of employment. CONCLUSION: Occupational styrene exposure may be associated with Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloid leukemia, and cancer of nasal cavities and sinuses.

With the increasing diagnostic approach based on small biopsies, there is the need of specific immunomarkers that can help in the differential diagnosis among the different tumor histotypes to assure the patient a correct diagnosis for proper treatment. Based on our recent studies showing cyclin D1 overexpression in both Ewing sarcoma/primitive peripheral neuroectodermal tumor (EWS/pPNET) and peripheral neuroblastic tumors (neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma), we immunohistochemically assessed cyclin D1 immunoreactivity in 128 cases of SRBCTs in children and adolescents to establish its potential utility in the differential diagnosis. All cases of EWS/pPNET and the undifferentiated/poorly differentiated neuroblastomatous component of all peripheral neuroblastic tumors exhibited strong and diffuse nuclear staining (>50% of neoplastic cells) for cyclin D1. In contrast, this marker was absent from rhabdomyosarcoma (regardless of subtype) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (either B- or T-cell precursors), whereas it was only focally detected (<5% of neoplastic cells) in some cases of Wilms tumor (blastemal component) and desmoplastic small round cell tumor. Our findings suggest that cyclin D1 can be exploitable as a diagnostic adjunct to conventional markers in confirming the diagnosis of EWS/pPNET or neuroblastoma/ganglioneuroblastoma. Its use in routine practice may also be helpful for those cases of SRBCT with undifferentiated morphology that are difficult to diagnose after application of the conventional markers.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

These include but are not restricted to the following: a previously uncharacterized form of endocytosis, membrane penetration by a capsid protein, the use of retromer complexes for trafficking to the trans-Golgi network, the requirement for nuclear envelope breakdown and microtubule-mediated transport during mitosis for nuclear entry, the existence of membrane-bound intranuclear vesicles harboring HPV genome, and the requirement of PML protein for efficient transcription of incoming viral genome. The continued study of these pathways may reveal new roles in basic biological cellular processes.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, with no strong homology to other proteins of known function, the role of MLF proteins in the cell has remained elusive. Here, we describe a proteomics approach that identifies MLF as a member of a nuclear chaperone complex containing a DnaJ protein, BCL2-associated anthanogene 2, and Hsc70. This complex associates with chromatin and regulates the expression of target genes. The MLF complex is bound to sites of nucleosome depletion and sites containing active chromatin marks (e.g., H3K4me3 and H3K4me1). Hence, MLF binding is enriched at promoters and enhancers. Additionally, the MLF-chaperone complex functions to regulate transcription factor stability, including the RUNX transcription factor involved in hematopoiesis. Although Hsc70 and other co-chaperones have been shown to play a role in nuclear translocation of a variety of proteins including transcription factors, our findings suggest that MLF and the associated co-chaperones play a direct role in modulating gene transcription.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to correlate the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and age in a population of children and young adults with acute leukemia undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first complete remission (CR). METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 153 consecutive children (<15 years), AYAs (15-24 years), and adults (25-35 years) with lymphoblastic or myeloid acute leukemia in first CR who underwent HSCT with matched donors after myeloablative conditioning. GvHD prophylaxis was methotrexate and cyclosporine A (CsA) in all patients. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GvHD (aGvHD) was significantly higher in AYA patients than in children (subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR), 2.04, p = 0.005) or adults (SHR 1.59, p = 0.048). Both gut and skin aGvHD occurred more frequently in AYA patients. Increasing CsA blood levels with age could not fully account for this difference. No difference in terms of grade III-IV aGvHD was observed. Chronic GvHD was more frequent in AYAs (SHR 2.81, p = 0.007) and adults (SHR 2.31, p = 0.033) than in children. No difference in terms of nonrelated mortality and overall survival was observed among the age subgroups. CONCLUSION: Since GvHD occurrence is strongly correlated to quality of life, specific attention should be paid to AYAs undergoing HSCT. Further studies should investigate the reasons for the excess of GvHD observed in this population.",,"['Vignon, Marguerite', 'Andreoli, Annalisa', 'Dhedin, Nathalie', 'Lengline, Etienne', 'Masson, Emeline', 'Robin, Marie', 'Granier, Clemence', 'Larghero, Jerome', 'Schlageter, Marie-Helene', 'de Latour, Regis Peffault', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Boissel, Nicolas']","['Vignon M', 'Andreoli A', 'Dhedin N', 'Lengline E', 'Masson E', 'Robin M', 'Granier C', 'Larghero J', 'Schlageter MH', 'de Latour RP', 'Socie G', 'Boissel N']","[""1 Unite d'Hematologie-Adolescents et Jeunes Adultes, Hopital Saint-Louis, EA-3518, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France ."", ""1 Unite d'Hematologie-Adolescents et Jeunes Adultes, Hopital Saint-Louis, EA-3518, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France ."", ""1 Unite d'Hematologie-Adolescents et Jeunes Adultes, Hopital Saint-Louis, EA-3518, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France ."", ""1 Unite d'Hematologie-Adolescents et Jeunes Adultes, Hopital Saint-Louis, EA-3518, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France ."", ""2 Laboratoire d'Histocompatibilite, Hopital Saint-Louis , Paris, France ."", ""3 Service d'Hematologie-Greffe, INSERM U940, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France ."", ""2 Laboratoire d'Histocompatibilite, Hopital Saint-Louis , Paris, France ."", ""4 Unite de Therapie Cellulaire, Centre d'Investigation Clinique en Biotherapies CIC-BT501 , Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France ."", '5 Service de Medecine Nucleaire , Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France .', ""3 Service d'Hematologie-Greffe, INSERM U940, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France ."", ""3 Service d'Hematologie-Greffe, INSERM U940, Hopital Saint-Louis, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France ."", ""1 Unite d'Hematologie-Adolescents et Jeunes Adultes, Hopital Saint-Louis, EA-3518, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot , Paris, France .""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161216,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Intestinal Diseases/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Skin Diseases/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'graft-versus-host disease']",2016/12/17 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2016.0060 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2017 Jun;6(2):299-306. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2016.0060.

Herein, an enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) DNA biosensor was proposed based on dual-signal amplification via coupling inorganic-organic nanocomposites sensitization with lambda-exonuclease (lambda-Exo)-assisted target recycling. The short DNA sequence about chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML, type b3a2) was selected as target DNA (tDNA). ZnO nanoplates were deposited with CdS nanocrystals to form ZnO/CdS hetero-nanostructure, and it was used as PEC substrate for immobilizing hairpin DNA (hDNA). CdTe quantum dots (QDs) covalently linked with meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine (TCPP) to form CdTe/TCPP inorganic-organic nanocomposites, which were utilized as sensitization agents labeling at the terminal of probe DNA (pDNA). When the hDNA-modified sensing electrode was incubated with tDNA and lambda-Exo, hDNA hybridized with tDNA, and meanwhile it could be recognized and cleaved by lambda-Exo, resulting in the release of tDNA. The rest of nonhybridized hDNA would continuously hybridize with the released tDNA, cleave by lambda-Exo, and set free the tDNA again. After lambda-Exo-assisted tDNA recycling, more amounts of short DNA (sDNA) fragments coming from digestion of hDNA produced on the electrode and hybridized with CdTe/TCPP-labeled pDNA (pDNA-CdTe/TCPP conjugates). In this case, the sensitization of CdTe/TCPP inorganic-organic nanocomposites occurred, which evidently extend the absorption range and strengthened the absorption intensity of light energy, and accordingly the photocurrent signal significantly promoted. Through introducing the dual-signal amplification tactics, the developed PEC assay allowed a low calculated detection limit of 25.6 aM with a wide detection scope from 0.1 fM to 5 pM for sensitive and selective determination of tDNA.",,"['Shi, Xiao-Mei', 'Fan, Gao-Chao', 'Shen, Qingming', 'Zhu, Jun-Jie']","['Shi XM', 'Fan GC', 'Shen Q', 'Zhu JJ']","['Key Laboratory for Organic Electronics and Information Displays & Institute of Advanced Materials, Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications , Nanjing 210023, P.

For this reason, the changes in protein kinase activity induced by each drug candidate (the inhibitor in this case) need to be accurately determined. Here, an on-chip secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging technique of the peptides was developed for determining protein kinase activity and inhibitor screening without a matrix. In our method, cysteine-tethered peptides adsorbed onto a gold surface produced changes in the relative peak intensities of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated substrate peptides, which were quantitatively dependent on protein kinase activity. Using mass spectrometry imaging of multiple compartments on the gold surface in the presence of a peptide substrate, we screened 13,727 inhibitors, of which seven were initially found to have inhibitor efficiencies that surpassed 50%. Of these, we were able to identify a new breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL)(T315I) kinase inhibitor, henceforth referred to as KR135861. KR135861 showed no cytotoxicity and was subsequently confirmed to be superior to imatinib, a commercial drug marketed as Gleevec. Moreover, KR135861 exhibited a greater inhibitory effect on the BCR-ABL(T315I) tyrosine kinase, with an IC50 value as low as 1.3 muM. In in vitro experiments, KR135861 reduced the viability of both Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL and BCR-ABL(T315I), in contrast to imatinib's inhibitory effects only on Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL. Due to the surface sensitivity and selectivity of SIMS imaging, it is anticipated that our approach will make it easier to validate the small modifications of a substrate in relation to enzyme activity as well as for drug discovery. This mass spectrometry imaging analysis enables efficient screening for protein kinase inhibitors, thus permitting high-throughput drug screening with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.",,"['Cho, Young-Lai', 'Kim, Young-Pil', 'Son, Jin Gyeong', 'Son, Miyoung', 'Lee, Tae Geol']","['Cho YL', 'Kim YP', 'Son JG', 'Son M', 'Lee TG']","['Center for Nano-Bio Measurement, World Class Laboratory, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science , Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'Department of Life Science and Institute of Nano Science and Technology, Hanyang University , Seoul 04763, Korea.', 'Center for Nano-Bio Measurement, World Class Laboratory, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science , Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'Center for Nano-Bio Measurement, World Class Laboratory, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science , Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'Center for Nano-Bio Measurement, World Class Laboratory, Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science , Daejeon 34113, Korea.', 'Department of Nanoscience, University of Science and Technology , Daejeon 34113, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161216,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Peptides/*chemistry', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,,2016/12/17 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03557 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2017 Jan 3;89(1):799-806. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.6b03557.

Translating genomic information into clinical practice remained challenging with conflicting results regarding the impact of certain mutations on disease phenotype and overall survival (OS) especially when clinical variables are controlled for when interpreting the result. We sequenced the coding region for 62 genes in 468 patients with secondary AML (sAML) and primary AML (pAML). Overall, mutations in FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1 and IDH2 were more specific for pAML whereas UTAF1, STAG2, BCORL1, BCOR, EZH2, JAK2, CBL, PRPF8, SF3B1, ASXL1 and DHX29 were more specific for sAML.

Ongoing trials are evaluating venetoclax in combination with CD20 targeting monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab. The objective of this research was to characterize the relationship between venetoclax exposures and progression-free survival (PFS) and to evaluate the effect of rituximab coadministration on PFS in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). A total of 323 patients from 3 clinical studies of venetoclax, with and without rituximab coadministration, were pooled for the analyses. A time-variant relative risk survival model was used to relate plasma venetoclax concentrations and rituximab administration to PFS. Demographics and baseline disease characteristics were evaluated for their effect on PFS. A concentration-dependent effect of venetoclax on PFS and a prolonged synergistic effect of 6 cycles of concomitant rituximab were identified. The 17p deletion chromosomal aberration was not identified to affect the PFS of patients treated with venetoclax. A venetoclax dose of 400 mg daily QD was estimated to result in a substantial median PFS of 1.8 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-2.1), whereas the addition of 6 cycles of rituximab was estimated to increase the median PFS to 3.9 years (95% CI, 2.8-5.6). The analysis demonstrates a concentration-dependent effect of venetoclax on PFS and also a synergistic effect with rituximab. Combining venetoclax with the CD20 targeting monoclonal antibody rituximab in R/R CLL/SLL patients provides substantial synergistic benefit compared with increasing the venetoclax monotherapy dose.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Freise, Kevin J', 'Jones, Aksana K', 'Menon, Rajeev M', 'Verdugo, Maria E', 'Humerickhouse, Rod A', 'Awni, Walid M', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Freise KJ', 'Jones AK', 'Menon RM', 'Verdugo ME', 'Humerickhouse RA', 'Awni WM', 'Salem AH']","['Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,20161216,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'exposure response', 'progression-free survival', 'rituximab', 'synergy', 'venetoclax']",2016/12/17 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2373 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2017 Dec;35(4):679-684. doi: 10.1002/hon.2373.

Ublituximab was administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 followed by day 1 of cycles 2-6. Response assessments were completed at cycles 3 and 6; patients then continued on ibrutinib monotherapy per standard of care. Forty-one of 45 enrolled patients were evaluable for efficacy. Safety was consistent with prior experience for each drug, with infusion reactions the most prevalent adverse event. Combination therapy resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 88% at 6 months. In the 20 patients with high-risk features (17p or 11q deletions or TP53 mutation) and evaluable for efficacy, the ORR was 95%, with three patients (15%) achieving negative minimal residual disease. Median time to response was 8 weeks. Ublituximab in combination with ibrutinib resulted in rapid and high response rates.

We identify chromosome alterations 13q14-, 6q- and 12q+ in early cell clones, elimination of clonal populations following therapy, and subsequent appearance of a clone containing trisomy 12 and chromosome 10 copy-neutral loss of heterogeneity that marks a major population dominant at death.

METHODS: We compared flagging performance of Sysmex XE-5000 and XN analyzers in oncohematologic patients. Differential counts were performed by Cellavision digital system (100 cells) and a hematologist (another 100 cells). RESULTS: First, we included 292 samples (86 with blasts): 28 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 88 acute myeloid leukemia, 91 myelodysplastic syndromes, 45 chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, and 40 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Sensitivity, specificity and efficiency to detect blasts were 59.3%, 88.3%, and 79.8% for XE-5000 analyzer and 70.9%, 91.3%, and 85.2% for the XN analyzer. Then, we included 111 lymphoid malignancies. In 55 CLL XE-5000 flagged for Abn Lympho/L_Blasts?, XN flagged for Abn Lympho?. In one-third of 19 samples with splenic marginal lymphoma, none of the analyzers flagged. In 5 Sezary syndrome cases, XE-5000 triggered the Abn Lympho/L_Blasts? flag while the flagging in XN was less consistent: Abn Lympho? Blasts? and Atypical Lympho?. In 5 hairy cell leukemias, both analyzers only flagged one sample. In 13 myelomas, XE-5000 generated Atypical Lympho? flag; XN triggered more variable flags. In other lymphoid malignancies, flags were variable. XN analyzer generates less samples with false basophilia. CONCLUSION: XN analyzer has improved blast detection in oncohematologic patients. Operators cannot rely on the blast flag alone but have to consider other flags and hemogram data. In lymphoproliferative disorders, XN analyzer yields less samples with pseudobasophilia. Both analyzers must improve flagging for hairy cell leukemia.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Furundarena, J R', 'Sainz, M', 'Uranga, A', 'Cuevas, L', 'Lopez, I', 'Zubicaray, J', 'Bizjak, A', 'Robado, N', 'Araiz, M']","['Furundarena JR', 'Sainz M', 'Uranga A', 'Cuevas L', 'Lopez I', 'Zubicaray J', 'Bizjak A', 'Robado N', 'Araiz M']","['Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Donostia University Hospital, Donostia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,20161216,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Blast Crisis/*blood', 'Blood Cell Count/*instrumentation/methods', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*blood', 'Male']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematology analyzer', '*Sysmex', '*abnormal lymphocyte', '*atypical lymphocyte', '*blast', '*flag']",2016/12/17 06:00,2017/03/03 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12575 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2017 Feb;39(1):58-67. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12575.

Galectin-3 is a potent apoptosis-inducing protein that regulates diverse cellular activities. In the present study, we investigated whether galectin-3 could induce cell death in HIV-1-infected macrophages using HIV-1-infected THP1 monocytes (THP1-MNs) and THP1-derived macrophages (THP1-MPhis) as in vitro cellular models. We found that THP1-MPhis were more resistant than the THP1-MNs to HIV-1 infection-induced death, and that HIV-1 infection of the THP1-MPhis increased expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Additionally, galectin-3 but not FasL, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or TNF-alpha, could induce cell death in HIV-1-infected THP1-MPhis. A similar result was shown for primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Galectin-3-induced cell death was also significantly increased in macrophages obtained from SIVmac251-infected macaques compared to that of macrophages from healthy macaques. Furthermore, galectin-3-induced cell death in HIV-1-infected THP1-MPhis was caspase independent. Interestingly, endonuclease G (Endo G) was increased in the nucleus and decreased in the cytoplasm of galectin-3-treated cells; thus, galectin-3-induced cell death in HIV-1-infected THP1-MPhis is most likely related to the translocation of Endo G from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These findings suggest that galectin-3 may potentially aid in the eradication of HIV-1/SIV-infected macrophages.",['(c) 2016 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Xue, Jing', 'Fu,

Co-transplanted mature donor T cells mediate the desired Graft versus Tumor (GvT) effect required to destroy residual leukemic cells. The donor T cells very often, however, also attack healthy tissue of the patient inducing acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGvHD)-a potentially life-threatening complication. METHODS: Therefore, we used the well established C57BL/6 into BALB/c mouse aGvHD model to evaluate whether pharmacological inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) would protect the mice from aGvHD. RESULTS: Treatment of the BALB/c recipient mice from day 0 to +2 after allogeneic CD4(+) T cell transplantation with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(dimethylaminoethylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (DMAG) partially protected the mice from aGvHD. DMAG treatment was, however, insufficient to prolong overall survival of leukemia-bearing mice after transplantation of allogeneic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Ex vivo analyses and in vitro experiments revealed that DMAG primarily inhibits conventional CD4(+) T cells with a relative resistance of CD4(+) regulatory and CD8(+) T cells toward Hsp90 inhibition.

Although genetic studies have identified chromosomal aberrations or specific mutations, epigenetic changes have been poorly characterized in CLL. METHODS: We assessed ten-eleven translocations (TET) 1, 2, and 3, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1, and 2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression using real-time PCR on purified leukemic B cells from 214 CLL patients (median follow-up = 75 months, range 1-380), normal peripheral blood B cells (n = 20), and umbilical cord blood B cells (n = 21). The microenvironment influence was assessed after 24 h co-culture of CLL cells with bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC). Finally, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine level (%5-hmC) was assessed by ELISA in CLL cells alone or with microenvironment stimuli. RESULTS: TET 1 and 3 and IDH2 were decreased in CLL cells compared with healthy B cells (P = 0.0221, 0.0013, <0.0001, respectively), while IDH1 was overexpressed (P = 0.0037). TET2 and IDH1 were significantly correlated with treatment-free survival (TFS); patients with high TET2/IDH1 expression had a higher median TFS (111 months) than patients with low expression (78 months, P = 0.0071/0.0123). Moreover, TET1 expression decreased (P = 0.0371), while TET3 and IDH2 expression increased (P = 0.0273/0.0039) in co-cultures. However, %5-hmC was not correlated with clinical data and was unchanged following microenvironment stimuli. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a slight deregulation in CLL cells compared with normal B cells, we identified a significant association between TET/IDH gene expression and prognosis, suggesting that epigenetic changes could potentially be associated with disease progression. Moreover, despite an identical %5-hmC, TET gene expression was influenced by contact with BMSC confirming the crucial role of the microenvironment in CLL pathogenesis.",,"['Van Damme, Michael', 'Crompot, Emerence', 'Meuleman, Nathalie', 'Maerevoet, Marie', 'Mineur, Philippe', 'Bron, Dominique', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile']","['Van Damme M', 'Crompot E', 'Meuleman N', 'Maerevoet M', 'Mineur P', 'Bron D', 'Lagneaux L', 'Stamatopoulos B']","['Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB Cancer Research Center (U-CRC), Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Route de Lennik, 808, 1070 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB Cancer Research Center (U-CRC), Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Route de Lennik, 808, 1070 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology (U-CRC), Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology (U-CRC), Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, Grand Hopital de Charleroi, Gilly, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology (U-CRC), Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB Cancer Research Center (U-CRC), Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Route de Lennik, 808, 1070 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, ULB Cancer Research Center (U-CRC), Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Route de Lennik, 808, 1070 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161207,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*5-Hydroxymethylcytosine', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*IDH', '*Prognosis', '*TET']",2016/12/17 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-016-0298-y [doi]', '298 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2016 Dec 7;8:132. doi: 10.1186/s13148-016-0298-y. eCollection 2016.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.- (TET3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

Recent studies have implicated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cALL etiology, progression, and treatment response. However, barring some exceptions little is known about the functional impact of lncRNAs on cancer biology, which limits their potential as potential therapeutic targets. We wanted to investigate the functional role of lncRNAs identified as specifically overexpressed in pre-B cALL by whole-transcriptome sequencing. Here we report five lncRNAs specifically upregulated in pre-B cALL that had significant impacts on cancer hallmark traits such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and treatment response. In particular, silencing of the RP11-137H2.4 lncRNA effectively restored normal glucocorticoid (GC) response in a GC-resistant pre-B cALL cell line and specifically modulated expression of members of both the NRAS/BRAF/NF-kappaB MAPK cascade and cell cycle pathways. Since GC form the cornerstone of cALL chemotherapy and resistance in cALL confers a dismal prognosis, characterizing RP11-137H2.4'sexact role and function in this process will be critical to the development of new therapeutic approaches to overcome GC resistance in children treated for cALL.",,"['Ouimet, Manon', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Lajoie, Mathieu', 'Caron, Maxime', 'St-Onge, Pascal', 'Gioia, Romain', 'Richer, Chantal', 'Sinnett, Daniel']","['Ouimet M', 'Drouin S', 'Lajoie M', 'Caron M', 'St-Onge P', 'Gioia R', 'Richer C', 'Sinnett D']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection']",['NOTNLM'],"['RNASeq', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'glucocorticoids', 'long non-coding RNA', 'treatment resistance']",2016/12/17 06:00,2018/03/03 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['13936 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.13936 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 31;8(5):7477-7488. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13936.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long noncoding RNA RP11-137H2.4, human)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",,,,PMC5352336,,,,,,,,,

Among the receptors engaged by ATP, P2X7R is the most consistently expressed by tumors. P2X7R is an ATP-gated ion channel that could drive the opening of a non-selective pore, triggering cell-death signal. We previously demonstrated that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells express high level of P2X7R. Here, we show that P2X7R activation with high dose ATP induces AML blast cells apoptosis. Moreover, P2X7R is also expressed on leukemic stem/progenitor cells (LSCs) which are sensitive to ATP-mediated cytotoxicity. Conversely, this cytotoxic effect was not observed on normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs). Notably, the antileukemic activity of ATP was also observed in presence of bone marrow stromal cells and its addition to the culture medium enhanced cytosine arabinoside cytotoxicity despite stroma-induced chemoresistance. Xenotransplant experiments confirmed ATP antineoplastic activity in vivo.Overall, our results demonstrate that P2X7R stimulation by ATP induced a therapeutic response in AML at the LSC level while the normal stem cell compartment was not affected.

The expanded NK cells express high levels of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) specific for self-HLA and potently produce IFNgamma. However, it remains unknown whether similar events would occur after haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT). Here, we demonstrated that IFNgamma-producing NK cells were expanded in haplo-HSCT patients with CMV reactivation. We then identified these expanded cells as a subset of CD56dim NK cells that expressed higher levels of both NKG2C and KIR, but lower level of NKG2A. Functionally, the subset of NK cells expressing NKG2C and self-KIR in patients with CMV reactivation accounted for IFNgamma production in response to K562 cells. However, these phenomena were not observed in patients without CMV reactivation. We therefore characterized a subset of NK cells with the CD56dim, NKG2C+, and self-KIR+ phenotype that expanded and were responsible for IFNgamma production during CMV infection after haplo-HSCT. Together, these findings support a notion that CMV reactivation induces expansion of more mature NK cells with memory-like features, which contributes to long-term control of both CMV infection and leukemia relapse after haplo-HSCT.",,"['Jin, Fengyan', 'Lin, Hai', 'Gao, Sujun', 'Wang, Hengxiang', 'Yan, Hongmin', 'Guo, Jinglong', 'Hu, Zheng', 'Jin, Chunhui', 'Wang, Yongqi', 'Wang, Zhidong', 'Zhao, Yangzhi', 'Liu, Yu', 'Zheng, Xiaoli', 'Tan, Yehui', 'Li, Wei', 'Dai, Yun', 'Yang, Yanping']","['Jin F', 'Lin H', 'Gao S', 'Wang H', 'Yan H', 'Guo J', 'Hu Z', 'Jin C', 'Wang Y', 'Wang Z', 'Zhao Y', 'Liu Y', 'Zheng X', 'Tan Y', 'Li W', 'Dai Y', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'Institute of Translational Medicine, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Institute of Translational Medicine, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, the First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/genetics/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Virus Activation/immunology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['IFNgamma', 'KIR', 'NK cells', 'NKG2C', 'Pathology Section', 'cytomegalovirus']",2016/12/17 06:00,2018/03/06 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['13916 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.13916 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jan 3;8(1):51-63. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.13916.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,PMC5352173,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have shown that the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, as well as the proapoptotic protein Bim, are key elements to be modulated to kill ovarian cancer cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of Bcl-xL is possible by using BH3-mimetic molecules like ABT-737. However, inhibition of Mcl-1 and/or promotion of its BH3-only partners (including Bim, Puma, and Noxa) remains a challenge that may be achieved by modulating the signaling pathways upstream. This study sought whether AZD8055-induced mTOR inhibition and/or trametinib-induced MEK inhibition could modulate Mcl-1 and its partners to decrease the Mcl-1/BH3-only ratio and thus sensitize various ovarian cancer cell lines to ABT-737. AZD8055 treatment inhibited Mcl-1 and increased Puma expression but did not induce massive apoptosis in combination with ABT-737. In contrast, trametinib, which decreased the Mcl-1/BH3-only protein ratio by upregulating Puma and dephosphorylated active Bim, sensitized IGROV1-R10 and OVCAR3 cells to ABT-737. Adding AZD8055 to trametinib further reduced the Mcl-1/BH3-only protein ratio and triggered apoptosis without ABT-737 in IGROV1-R10 cells. Moreover, the AZD8055/trametinib association highly sensitized all cell lines including SKOV3 to ABT-737, the induced dephosphorylated Bim being crucial in this sensitization. Finally, the three-drug combination was also very efficient when replacing AZD8055 by the pan-Akt inhibitor MK-2206. This study thus proposes original multitargeted strategies and may have important implications for the design of novel approaches for ovarian cancer treatment. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(1); 102-15.

These drugs reprogram gene expression profiles, reactivate tumor suppressor genes (TSG) producing cancer cell differentiation and apoptosis. Epigenetic drugs have been shown to synergize with other epigenetic drugs or various anticancer drugs. To discover new molecular entities that enhance epigenetic therapy, we performed a high-throughput screening using FDA-approved libraries in combination with DNMTi or HDACi. As a screening model, we used YB5 system, a human colon cancer cell line, which contains an epigenetically silenced CMV-GFP locus, mimicking TSG silencing in cancer. CMV-GFP reactivation is triggered by DNMTi or HDACi and responds synergistically to DNMTi/HDACi combination, which phenocopies TSG reactivation upon epigenetic therapy. GFP fluorescence was used as a quantitative readout for epigenetic activity. We discovered that 45 FDA-approved drugs (4% of all drugs tested) in our FDA-approved libraries enhanced DNMTi and HDACi activity, mainly belonging to anticancer and antiarrhythmic drug classes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that combination of decitabine (DNMTi) with the antiarrhythmic proscillaridin A produced profound gene expression reprogramming, which was associated with downregulation of 153 epigenetic regulators, including two known oncogenes in colon cancer (SYMD3 and KDM8). Also, we identified about 85 FDA-approved drugs that antagonized DNMTi and HDACi activity through cytotoxic mechanisms, suggesting detrimental drug interactions for patients undergoing epigenetic therapy. Overall, our drug screening identified new combinations of epigenetic and FDA-approved drugs, which can be rapidly implemented into clinical trials. Mol Cancer Ther; 16(2); 397-407.

Quantitative monitoring of the percentage of the fusion transcript BCR-ABL1 (breakpoint cluster region-c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) BCR-ABL1(IS) (%BCR-ABL1(IS)) by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard strategy for evaluating patient response to TKIs and classification into prognostic subgroups. However, this approach can be challenging to perform in a reproducible manner. Reverse-transcription digital PCR (RT-dPCR) is an adaptation of this method that could provide the robust and standardized workflow needed for truly standardized patient stratification. METHODS: BCR-ABL1 and ABL1 transcript copy numbers were quantified in a total of 102 samples; 70 CML patients undergoing TKI therapy and 32 non-CML individuals. 3 commercially available digital PCR platforms (QS3D, QX200 and Raindrop) were compared with the platform routinely used in the clinic for RT-qPCR using the EAC (Europe Against Cancer) assay. RESULTS: Measurements on all instruments correlated well when the %BCR-ABL1(IS) was >/=0.1%. In patients with residual disease below this level, greater variations were measured both within and between instruments limiting comparable performance to a 4 log dynamic range. CONCLUSIONS: RT-dPCR was able to quantify low-level BCR-ABL1 transcript copies but was unable to improve sensitivity below the level of detection achieved by RT-qPCR. However, RT-dPCR was able to perform these sensitive measurements without use of a calibration curve. Adaptions to the protocol to increase the amount of RNA measured are likely to be necessary to improve the analytical sensitivity of BCR-ABL testing on a dPCR platform.",['(c) 2016 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.'],"['Alikian, Mary', 'Whale, Alexandra S', 'Akiki, Susanna', 'Piechocki, Kim', 'Torrado, Celia', 'Myint, Thet', 'Cowen, Simon', 'Griffiths, Michael', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Apperley, Jane', 'White, Helen', 'Huggett, Jim F', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Alikian M', 'Whale AS', 'Akiki S', 'Piechocki K', 'Torrado C', 'Myint T', 'Cowen S', 'Griffiths M', 'Reid AG', 'Apperley J', 'White H', 'Huggett JF', 'Foroni L']","['Imperial Molecular Pathology, Imperial Healthcare Trust, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK; m.alikian@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Molecular and Cell Biology Team, LGC, Queens Road, Teddington, UK.', ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratories, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratories, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", 'Imperial Molecular Pathology, Imperial Healthcare Trust, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.', 'Imperial Molecular Pathology, Imperial Healthcare Trust, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.', 'Statistics Team, LGC, Queens Road, Teddington, UK.', ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratories, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", 'Imperial Molecular Pathology, Imperial Healthcare Trust, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Clinical Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.', 'National Genetics Reference Laboratory (Wessex), Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'Molecular and Cell Biology Team, LGC, Queens Road, Teddington, UK.', 'School of Biosciences & Medicine, Faculty of Health & Medical Science, University of Surrey, Guildford, UK.', 'Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Clinical Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,20161215,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2016/12/17 06:00,2017/05/23 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2016.262824 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2016.262824 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2017 Feb;63(2):525-531. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2016.262824.

Recent studies have shown that heterozygous inactivating mutations in the histone acetyl transferase, CREBBP, are particularly frequent in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and associated with a hyperdiploid karyotype and KRAS mutations. To study the functional impact of CREBBP haploinsufficiency in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, RNA interference was used to knock down expression of CREBBP in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and various primagraft acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We demonstrate that attenuation of CREBBP results in reduced acetylation of histone 3 lysine 18, but has no significant impact on cAMP-dependent target gene expression. Impaired induction of glucocorticoid receptor targets was only seen in 1 of 4 CREBBP knockdown models, and there was no significant difference in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, sensitivity to other acute lymphoblastic leukemia chemotherapeutics or histone deacetylase inhibitors. Importantly, we show that CREBBP directly acetylates KRAS and that CREBBP knockdown enhances signaling of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in Ras pathway mutated acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, which are still sensitive to MEK inhibitors. Thus, CREBBP mutations might assist in enhancing oncogenic RAS signaling in acute lymphoblastic leukemia but do not alter response to MEK inhibitors.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Dixon, Zach A', 'Nicholson, Lindsay', 'Zeppetzauer, Martin', 'Matheson, Elizabeth', 'Sinclair, Paul', 'Harrison, Christine J', 'Irving, Julie A E']","['Dixon ZA', 'Nicholson L', 'Zeppetzauer M', 'Matheson E', 'Sinclair P', 'Harrison CJ', 'Irving JA']","['Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Academic Haematology, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), Leukemia Biology Group, Vienna, Austria."", 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Newcastle Cancer Centre at the Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK julie.irving@newcastle.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161215,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CREB-Binding Protein/*deficiency', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Treatment Outcome', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,,2016/12/17 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.145177 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.145177 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Apr;102(4):736-745. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.145177.

However, additional genetic events may either enhance or negate the effects of IKZF1 deletions on prognosis. In a large discovery cohort of 533 childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, we observed that single-copy losses of BTG1 were significantly enriched in IKZF1-deleted B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P=0.007). While BTG1 deletions alone had no impact on prognosis, the combined presence of BTG1 and IKZF1 deletions was associated with a significantly lower 5-year event-free survival (P=0.0003) and a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (P=0.005), when compared with IKZF1-deleted cases without BTG1 aberrations. In contrast, other copy number losses commonly observed in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, such as CDKN2A/B, PAX5, EBF1 or RB1, did not affect the outcome of IKZF1-deleted acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. To establish whether the combined loss of IKZF1 and BTG1 function cooperate in leukemogenesis, Btg1-deficient mice were crossed onto an Ikzf1 heterozygous background. We observed that loss of Btg1 increased the tumor incidence of Ikzf1(+/-) mice in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, murine B cells deficient for Btg1 and Ikzf1(+/-) displayed increased resistance to glucocorticoids, but not to other chemotherapeutic drugs. Together, our results identify BTG1 as a tumor suppressor in leukemia that, when deleted, strongly enhances the risk of relapse in IKZF1-deleted B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and augments the glucocorticoid resistance phenotype mediated by the loss of IKZF1 function.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Scheijen, Blanca', 'Boer, Judith M', 'Marke, Rene', 'Tijchon, Esther', 'van Ingen Schenau, Dorette', 'Waanders, Esme', 'van Emst, Liesbeth', 'van der Meer, Laurens T', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Horstmann, Martin A', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Venn, Nicola', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Dalla-Pozza, Luciano', 'Kuiper, Roland P', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'van Leeuwen, Frank N']","['Scheijen B', 'Boer JM', 'Marke R', 'Tijchon E', 'van Ingen Schenau D', 'Waanders E', 'van Emst L', 'van der Meer LT', 'Pieters R', 'Escherich G', 'Horstmann MA', 'Sonneveld E', 'Venn N', 'Sutton R', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Kuiper RP', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'den Boer ML', 'van Leeuwen FN']","['Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands blanca.scheijen@radboudumc.nl.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center and Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany."", ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center and Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, the Netherlands.', ""Australian and New Zealand Children's Oncology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Australian and New Zealand Children's Oncology Group, Children's Cancer Institute Australia, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia."", ""Oncology Unit, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, Australia."", 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands."", 'Laboratory of Pediatric Oncology, Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,20161215,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Epistasis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2016/12/17 06:00,2017/07/08 06:00,['2016/12/17 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2016/12/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.153023 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.153023 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Mar;102(3):541-551. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.153023.
