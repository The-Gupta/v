Epub 2018 Nov 5.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by clonal proliferation and progressive accumulation of mature B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, lymphoid tissues, and bone marrow. CLL is characterized by profound immune defects leading to severe infectious complications. T cells are numerically, phenotypically, and functionally highly abnormal in CLL, with only limited ability to exert antitumor immune responses. Exhaustion of T cells has also been suggested to play an important role in antitumor responses. CLL-mediated T cell exhaustion is achieved by the aberrant expression of several inhibitory molecules on CLL cells and their microenvironment, prominently the programmed cell death ligand 1/programmed cell death 1 (PD-L1/PD-1) receptors. Previously, we showed that CD84, a member of the SLAM family of receptors, bridges between CLL cells and their microenvironment. In the current study, we followed CD84 regulation of T cell function. We showed that cell-cell interaction mediated through human and mouse CD84 upregulates PD-L1 expression on CLL cells and in their microenvironment and PD-1 expression on T cells. This resulted in suppression of T cell responses and activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our results demonstrate a role for CD84 in the regulation of immune checkpoints by leukemia cells and identify CD84 blockade as a therapeutic strategy to reverse tumor-induced immune suppression.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cellular immune response', '*Immunology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we analyzed 132 patients with largely primary refractory or first-time relapsed AML treated according to the FLAG-Ida protocol. The overall complete remission rate (CR + CRi) was 56% with a median overall survival of 15 months (95% CI, 5.7-25.1). The median disease-free survival for CR/CRi-patients was not reached.

Epub 2018 Oct 2.,"Myeloablative doses of busulfan (Bu) with fludarabine (Flu) have reduced toxicity, however, limited by an increased relapse rate. We aimed to improve outcome of Flu-Bu regimen by augmentation with thiotepa (TT) (10 mg/kg). Eighty-nine patients with AML, 44 patients conditioned with Flu-Bu (group 1), and 45 patients augmented with TT (Flu-Bu-TT, group 2), were retrospectively analyzed. Primary objectives were toxicity and outcomes. Major toxicities were comparable: mucositis (p = 1.0), sepsis (p = .7), severe venocclusive disease of liver (VOD) (p = 1.0), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) (22 vs. 22%, p = .7). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in group 2 compared to group 1 (62 vs. 38%, p = .02). Five-year overall survival (OS) showed trend toward benefit in group 2 (62 vs. 42%, p = .06). Lower relapse rate in group 2 (14 vs. 46%, p = .005) contributed to better outcomes. Augmented regimen has better disease-free survival (DFS) (mainly due to reduced relapse rate) and similar toxicities as compared to Flu-Bu. Key points Assessing the addition of TT to myeloablative conditioning (Flu, Bu) in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplant for acute myeloid leukemia with regard to relapse rate, disease-free survival and toxicity. Addition of thiotepa improves disease-free survival and shows trend toward benefit in overall survival, by reducing relapses without additional toxicity.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Augmented conditioning', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*transplant toxicity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our previous study using low-dose lenalidomide in treatment-naive CLL, TLS was averted but TF remained frequent and complete responses (CR) were rare, despite treatment to progression. The addition of dexamethasone may mitigate TF and enable lenalidomide dose escalation, achieving durable response without long-term use. In this phase 2 trial, 31 treatment-naive CLL patients received lenalidomide (target 25mg daily) plus dexamethasone for a finite 18 cycles. No patients developed TLS and TF was infrequent. Overall responses were 74.2% (CR 9.7%) and median progression-free survival 27 months. Cereblon-binding proteins IKZF1 and IKZF3 were largely downregulated, with associated increased IRF4 levels. We therefore report that lenalidomide plus dexamethasone can achieve durable responses in a subset of patients without continuing therapy until progression. Upregulation of IRF4 may contribute to anti-CLL activity of immunomodulatory agents.

However, it is still unknown which specific cognitive domains are at greater risk of impairment in females. The aim of this study was to explore differences between male and female children in distinct domains of cognitive functioning, in order to deepen knowledge on the topic. METHODS: The cognitive performance of 100 males and 71 females aged 6-16 years was assessed by Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III). Differences between males and females were tested not only on intellectual quotients, but also on WISC-III subtests, which allow the evaluation of different cognitive domains. Analyses were performed in the whole sample and dividing children based on the supratentorial vs. infratentorial location of the tumor. RESULTS: Gender was the only predictor of VIQ in the whole group and in children with supratentorial tumor. Female children with supratentorial tumor performed significantly worse than males in four out of six verbal subtests. However, even among children with infratentorial tumor, females performed worse than males on two verbal subtests. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings of this study suggest that females may have more difficulties than males at manipulating verbal oral material. A possible explanation of these findings could be that females present a greater vulnerability to white matter damage due to the illness and post-adjuvant therapies, in line with reports of the literature on female children with lymphoblastic leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Neuropsychological functioning', '*Pediatric oncology', '*Rehabilitation', '*Sex']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1466-3182'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 1.,"CXCR5 is a serpentine receptor implicated in cell migration in lymphocytes and differentiation in leukocytes. It causes MAPK pathway activation and has known membrane partners for signaling. CXCR5 mRNA is reportedly expressed in neutrophils following isolation, but its role in this cellular context is unknown. CXCR5 is also expressed in HL-60 cells, a human acute myeloid leukemia line, following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, which induces differentiation toward a neutrophil-like state. CXCR5 is necessary for this process; differentiation was crippled in CXCR5 knockout cells and enhanced in cells ectopically expressing it. Since CXCR5 has various membrane protein partners, we investigated whether CXCR5-driven all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation depends on its association with such partners. Pursuing this, we generated HL-60 cells overexpressing the protein. We found that CXCR5 drove migration toward its ligand, CXCL13, and probed for interactions with several candidates using flow cytometry-based Forster resonance energy transfer. Surprisingly, we did not detect interactions with any candidates, including three reported in other cellular contexts. Additionally, we observed no significant changes in all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation; this may be due to the stoichiometry of CXCR5 and partner receptors or CXCL13. The anticipated membrane partnerings were surprisingly apparently unnecessary for downstream CXCR5 signaling and all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation.",['NOTNLM'],"['All-trans retinoic acid', 'CXCR5', 'Differentiation', 'Leukemia']",,,,['In Vitro Cell Dev Biol Anim. 2020 Oct;56(9):825.

Methods: Peritoneal washings, serum samples, and endometrial tissues were collected from endometriosis patients and control subjects. Endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were isolated from endometrial tissue, and conditioned medium was prepared by treating ESCs with or without various concentrations of interleukin- (IL-) 6, estrogen, or progestin. The frequencies of CD86+ and CD163+ cells and expression levels of these markers as well as the cytokines IL-12 and IL-10 were measured in THP-1- (human monocytic leukemia cell) derived macrophages. Results: There was a decrease in the percentage of CD86+ macrophages in the peritoneal wash solution of patients with endometriosis. Ectopic endometrial homogenates could promote M1 to M2 macrophage polarization in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as evidenced by the increased percentage of CD163+ macrophages and increased IL-10 expression as well as a decreased percentage of CD86+ cells and lower IL-12 expression. In contrast, addition of serum from women with endometriosis to THP-1 cells resulted in the polarization of macrophages towards both M1 and M2 phenotypes. Upregulation of Smad2/Smad3 in macrophages upon exposure to eutopic and ectopic endometrial homogenates as well as serum of women with endometriosis was observed, and blockage of Smad2/Smad3 with their inhibitor SB431542 could reverse the macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. Conditioned medium induced by IL-6, but neither estrogen nor progestin, could facilitate M2 polarization. Neutralization of IL-6 diminished macrophage M2 polarization in endometriosis. Conclusion: This study provides detailed evidence supporting alterations in M1 to M2 macrophage polarization that may contribute to the initiation as well as progression of endometriosis.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7620-5796'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent work has placed significant focus on understanding the role of gene lesions involving the spliceosomal machinery in leukemogeneis. SRSF2 is a gene encoding critical spliceosomal proteins. SRSF2 mutations appear to play an important role in pathogenesis of MMOS, particularly in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Inhibition of splicing may be a new therapeutic approach. E7107, a spliceosome inhibitor, has been shown to differentially inhibit splicing more in SRSF2-mutant cells leading to decreased leukemia burden in mice. H3B-8800 is a small molecule modulator of spliceosome complex and has been shown to lower leukemia burden in SRSF2-P95H mutant mice. This review focuses on the incidence of mutant SRSF2 across various MMOS as well as recent clinical development of spliceosome inhibitors.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4502-4949'],,,,"['This is not applicableThis is not applicableThe authors declare that they have no', 'competing interests.Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional', 'claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 1.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease, and the pathogenesis of SLE has not been fully elucidated. The E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 has been well characterized in cancer as a tumor suppressor that can promote the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of various oncoproteins; however, the potential role of FBXW7 in autoimmune diseases is unclear. In the present study, we identified that FBXW7 is a crucial exacerbating factor for SLE development and progression in a mouse model induced by 2, 6, 10, 14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD). Myeloid cell-specific FBXW7-deficient (Lysm(+)FBXW7(f/f)) C57BL/6 mice showed decreased immune complex accumulation, glomerulonephritis, glomerular mesangial cell proliferation, and base-membrane thickness in the kidney. Lysm(+)FBXW7(f/f) mice produced fewer anti-Sm/RNP and anti-ANA autoantibodies and showed a decreased MHC II expression in B cells. In Lysm(+)FBXW7(f/f) mice, we observed that cell apoptosis was reduced and that fewer CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi) inflammatory monocytes were recruited to the peritoneal cavity. Consistently, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (DPH) was also decreased in Lysm(+)FBXW7(f/f) mice. Mechanistically, we clarified that FBXW7 promoted TMPD-induced cell apoptosis by catalyzing MCL1 degradation through K48-linked ubiquitination. Our work revealed that FBXW7 expression in myeloid cells played a crucial role in TMPD-induced SLE progression in mice, which may provide novel ideas and theoretical support for understanding the pathogenesis of SLE.",['NOTNLM'],"['*FBXW7', '*MCL1', '*Systemic lupus erythematosus', '*apoptosis', '*ubiquitination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were centrally randomized (1:1) between S-HAM (2nd chemotherapy cycle starting on day 8 = ""dose-dense"") and double induction with TAD-HAM or HAM(-HAM) (2nd cycle starting on day 21 = ""standard""). 387 evaluable patients were randomly assigned to S-HAM (N = 203) and to standard double induction (N = 184). The primary endpoint overall response rate (ORR) consisting of complete remission (CR) and incomplete remission (CRi) was not significantly different (P = 0.202) between S-HAM (77%) and double induction (72%). The median overall survival was 35 months after S-HAM and 25 months after double induction (P = 0.323). Duration of critical leukopenia was significantly reduced after S-HAM (median 29 days) versus double induction (median 44 days)-P < 0.001. This translated into a significantly shortened duration of hospitalization after S-HAM (median 37 days) as compared to standard induction (median 49 days)-P < 0.001. In conclusion, dose-dense induction therapy with the S-HAM regimen shows favorable trends but no significant differences in ORR and OS compared to standard double induction.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are particularly susceptible to genotoxic stress, and accumulation of damage can lead to HSC dysfunction and oncogenesis. Our group recently demonstrated that aging human HSCs accumulate microsatellite instability coincident with loss of MLH1, a DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein, which could reasonably predispose to radiation-induced HSC malignancies. Therefore, in an effort to reduce risk uncertainty for cancer development during deep space travel, we employed an Mlh1(+/-) mouse model to study the effects high-LET (56)Fe ion space-like radiation. Irradiated Mlh1(+/-) mice showed a significantly higher incidence of lymphomagenesis with (56)Fe ions compared to gamma-rays and unirradiated mice, and malignancy correlated with increased MSI in the tumors. In addition, whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed high SNVs and INDELs in lymphomas being driven by loss of Mlh1 and frequently mutated genes had a strong correlation with human leukemias. Therefore, the data suggest that age-related MMR deficiencies could lead to HSC malignancies after space radiation, and that countermeasure strategies will be required to adequately protect the astronaut population on the journey to Mars.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9701-1851'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are limitations, including inability to manufacture CAR-T cells from the patient's own T cells, disease progression and death prior to return of engineered cells. T cell dysfunction is known to occur in cancer patients, and several groups have recently described differences in CAR-T cells generated from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients compared with those from a healthy donor. This is thought to contribute to the low response rate in this disease group. Healthy donor, gene-edited CAR-T cells which do not require human leucocyte antigen (HLA) matching have the potential to provide an 'off the shelf' product, overcoming the manufacturing difficulties of producing CAR-T cells for each individual patient. They may also provide a more functional, potent product for malignancies such as CLL, where T cell dysfunction is common and frequently cannot be fully reversed during the manufacturing process.

Mutation in the genes of stem cells is required for benign (normal) prostate to develop into prostatic adenocarcinoma. Stem/basal cells survive androgen deprivation therapy in humans and castrated mice to repopulate glandular cells by proliferation when stimulated by androgen. We hypothesized that using different embedding and staining methods, it would be possible to identify two types of stem cells in human prostate by localization of CD133. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prostate biopsy or prostatectomy pieces from 13 untreated and eight diethylstilbestrol-treated men with prostate cancer were sectioned, stained by methylene blue and CD133 was localized by immunogold technique. RESULTS: Methylene blue stained basic proteins in dark basal cells, but not in light cells. Light basal cells expressed androgen receptors and dark cells estrogen receptors. Light and dark cells expressed CD133, indicating them to be stem cells. Light stem cells produced the lineage of columnar/cuboidal cells. Estrogen-dependent dark cells produced a lineage of columnar/cuboidal cells, that also expressed estrogen receptors. CONCLUSION: Our analysis indicates that stem/basal cells are privileged cells in the basal compartment. Stem cells are not under the regulation of steroid hormones, whereas their lineage of cuboidal/columnar cells are. The lineage of androgen-dependent cells are columnar/cuboidal cells and the lineage of estrogen-dependent cells are also columnar/cuboidal cells. Epon-embedding and methylene blue staining showed two types of CD133-positive stem cells in prostate. Paraffin sections did not show two types of stem cells in prostate and bone marrow leukemia cells. Our study indicates the continuity of embryonic stem cells into adult prostate as organ-specific stem cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify two types of stem cells in human prostate.",['NOTNLM'],"['CD133 localization', 'Stem cells', 'androgen-dependent', 'columnar/cuboidal cells', 'estrogen-dependent', 'glandular cells', 'immunogold techniques', 'methylene blue', 'mutation', 'proliferation', 'stem cell lineage']",,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 1.,"The CD33-targeting bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) AMG 330 proved to be highly efficient in mediating cytolysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vitro and in mouse models. Yet, T-cell activation is correlated with upregulation of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and other inhibitory checkpoints on AML cells that confer adaptive immune resistance. PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking agents may counteract T-cell dysfunction, however, at the expense of broadly distributed immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We developed a bifunctional checkpoint inhibitory T cell-engaging (CiTE) antibody that combines T-cell redirection to CD33 on AML cells with locally restricted immune checkpoint blockade. This is accomplished by fusing the extracellular domain of PD-1 (PD-1ex), which naturally holds a low affinity to PD-L1, to an alphaCD3.alphaCD33 BiTE-like scaffold. By a synergistic effect of checkpoint blockade and avidity-dependent binding, the PD-1ex attachment increases T-cell activation (3.3-fold elevation of interferon-gamma) and leads to efficient and highly selective cytotoxicity against CD33(+)PD-L1(+) cell lines (50% effective concentration = 2.3-26.9 pM) as well as patient-derived AML cells (n = 8). In a murine xenograft model, the CiTE induces complete AML eradication without initial signs of irAEs as measured by body weight loss. We conclude that our molecule preferentially targets AML cells, whereas high-affinity blockers, such as clinically approved anticancer agents, also address PD-L1(+) non-AML cells. By combining the high efficacy of T-cell engagers with immune checkpoint blockade in a single molecule, we expect to minimize irAEs associated with the systemic application of immune checkpoint inhibitors and suggest high therapeutic potential, particularly for patients with relapsed/ refractory AML.",,,,,['Blood. 2018 Dec 6;132(23):2425-2427.

Overexpression of KDM6B has been reported in BM HSPCs of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Whether the overexpression of KDM6B contributes to the pathogenesis of these diseases remains to be elucidated. To study this, we generated a Vav-KDM6B mouse model, which overexpresses KDM6B in the hematopoietic compartment. KDM6B overexpression alone led to mild hematopoietic phenotype, and chronic innate immune stimulation of Vav-KDM6B mice with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligand lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in significant hematopoietic defects. These defects recapitulated features of MDS and CMML, including leukopenia, dysplasia, and compromised repopulating function of BM HSPCs. Transcriptome studies indicated that KDM6B overexpression alone could lead to activation of disease-relevant genes such as S100a9 in BM HSPCs, and when combined with innate immune stimulation, KDM6B overexpression resulted in more profound overexpression of innate immune and disease-relevant genes, indicating that KDM6B was involved in the activation of innate immune signaling in BM HSPCs. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of KDM6B with the small molecule inhibitor GSK-J4 ameliorated the ineffective hematopoiesis observed in Vav-KDM6B mice.

AMPK is one of the major sensors of energy status in mammalian cells and as such plays essential roles in the regulation of cellular homeostasis, metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and autophagy. AMPK is activated by two upstream kinases, the tumor suppressor liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) through phosphorylation of the kinase on Thr172, leading to its activation. In addition, AMPK inhibits the mTOR pathway through phosphorylation and activation of tuberous sclerosis protein 2 (TSC2) and causes direct activation of unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) via phosphorylation of Ser555, thus promoting initiation of autophagy. Although it is well established that AMPK can control the differentiation of different cell lineages, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitors, and mature hematopoietic cells, the role of AMPK regarding myeloid cell differentiation is less documented. The differentiation of monocytes into macrophages triggered by colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), a process during which both caspase activation (independently of apoptosis induction) and AMPK-dependent stimulation of autophagy are necessary, is one noticeable example of the involvement of AMPK in the physiological differentiation of myeloid cells. The present review focuses on the role of AMPK in the regulation of the physiological and pathological differentiation of myeloid cells. The mechanisms of autophagy induction by AMPK will also be addressed, as autophagy has been shown to be important for differentiation of hematopoietic cells. In addition, myeloid malignancies (myeloid leukemia or dysplasia) are characterized by profound defects in the establishment of proper differentiation programs. Reinduction of a normal differentiation process in myeloid malignancies has thus emerged as a valuable and promising therapeutic strategy. As AMPK seems to exert a key role in the differentiation of myeloid cells, notably through induction of autophagy, we will also discuss the potential to target this pathway as a pro-differentiating and anti-leukemic strategy in myeloid malignancies.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AMPK', 'CML', 'CMML', 'MDS', 'autophagy', 'differentiation', 'macrophages', 'monocytes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important tool in monitoring post-transplantation evolution is represented by the percentage of donor's blood cells found in recipient's blood, known as chimersim. This is useful in predicting the graft rejection and the risk of disease relapse. In this study, we present the importance of multiplex STR markers in chimerism monitoring of a 8 year old girl diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: In the pre-transplant stage, saliva on buccal swabs and blood samples in EDTA were collected from the donor and recipient and used as reference samples. The DNA extraction from saliva and blood samples was done using the Pure Link Genomic DNA kit (Invitrogen, USA). For the DNA quantification, the Quantifiler Human DNA kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) was used on an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). Amplification of the STR markers was performed using the AmpFLSTR NGM SElect kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) on a ProFlex PCR System. The PCR products were separated and detected on an ABI 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosytems, USA). RESULTS: One month post-transplantation of HSC, a mixed chimerism (MC) containing 38% of donor's cells was obtained from a bone marrow aspiration sample. On the 45th day, a new transplantation was performed. On the 15th day after 2nd transplantation, a MC with 91% donor's cells was obtained. On the 21st day after the 2nd transplantation, a complete chimerism (CC) with 100% donor's cells was obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Chimerism monitoring is useful in identifying those patients in risk for relapse or graft rejection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and cancers. We studied MIF gene expression behavior to investigate its prognostic impact in childish patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: MIF expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time (QRT) PCR. Patients are classified into two groups, high and low MIF expressers, according to median MIF gene expression. RESULTS: We did not find any significant difference between both groups as regards the clinical and hematological picture. However, high MIF expressers had significantly lower incidence of CR (25.8% vs. 72.4%, p = 0.001), higher incidence of refractory (51.6% vs. 24.1, p = 0.029), relapse rates (19.4% vs. 10.3%, p = 0.32), and higher mortality rate (54.8% vs. 20.7, p = 0.007) than lower MIF expressers. In addition, high MIF expressers show significantly shorter DFS (12.48 vs. 25.11 months, cumulative survival 38.7% vs. 72.2%, p < 0.01) and inferior overall survival (20.61 vs. 29.74 months, cumulative survival 45.2% vs. 79.3%, p < 0.001) than low MIF expressers. Multivariate cox-regression analysis adjustment confirmed that high MIF expression was the only independent prognostic factor in ALL patients for OS and DFS in our study (p = 0.004, p = 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We found that MIF expression is an important prognostic factor in ALL patients with normal karyotype, and its incorporation into novel risk-adapted therapeutic strategies will improve the current cure rates for this group of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alteration of circulating vitamin D (VD) and its carrier vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) have been reported in certain types of cancers and may play a role in the course of the disease. Understanding of the status of serum VD and VDBP, as well as the acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in pre- and post-treatment of acute leukemia patients, may be helpful in the management of acute leukemia. METHODS: Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay, and immunofluorescent assay were used to analyze the 25(OH) vitamin D (25(OH)D), VDBP, and CRP in the serum of a cohort of leukemia patients. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D levels in patients (pre- and post-treatment) were significantly lower than in control subjects. There was no significant difference in 25(OH)D levels between pre- and post-treatment. Serum VDBP level was raised in both pre- and post-treatment of acute leukemia patients, with that of pre-treatment being higher. The average serum VDBP was reduced in post-treatment; however, no significant difference was found. Elevated serum CRP levels in both pre- and post-treatment patient groups have been observed but were reduced significantly after treatment. Results also revealed that serum VDBP levels in acute myeloid leukemia patients were significantly higher than in acute lymphoid leukemia patients, while 25(OH)D levels in acute myeloid leukemia were significantly lower than in acute lymphoid leukemia. No significant difference between the serum CRP levels of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Serum 25(OH)D, VDBP, and CRP may be used together and could be potential indicators of the disease course of acute leukemia and assist in its management which merits further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies show that enhanced ability of DNA damage repair (DDR) in cancer cells plays a key role in chemotherapy resistance. Here, we suggest that defect in DDR related genes might be a promising target to destroy the genome stability of tumor cells. METHODS: Since KU70 is highly expressed in Jurkat cells, one of the most representative cell lines of ATL, we knocked down KU70 by shRNA and analyzed the impact of KU70 deficiency in Jurkat cells as well as in NOD-SCID animal models by western blot, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and measuring DNA repair efficiency. RESULTS: It is observed that silencing of KU70 resulted in accumulated DNA damage and impaired DDR in Jurkat cells, resulting in more apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest. DNA damage leads to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are processed by either non-homologous end joining(NHEJ) or homologous recombination(HR). In our study, both NHEJ and HR are impaired because of KU70 defect, accompanied with increased protein level of SHP-1, a dephosphorylation enzyme. In turn, SHP-1 led to dephosphorylation of SIRT1, which further impaired HR repair efficiency. Moreover, KU70 deficiency prolonged survival of Jurkat-xenografted mice. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that targeting KU70 is a promising target for ATL and might overcome the existing difficulties in chemotherapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA damage repair', '*Ku70', '*Non-homologous end joining Homologous recombination', '*SHP-1', '*SIRT1']",,,,['Cell Physiol Biochem. 2019;52(6):1588.

By applying a statistical model, which corrects for position-specific errors, a limit of detection for single nucleotide variations of variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.02% was achieved. The assay was linear in MRD range (0.03% to 1%) with good precision [CV, 4.1% (2.2% to 5.7%) at VAF 1% and 13.3% (8.8% to 19.4%) at VAF 0.1%], and low relative bias [7.9% (2.5% to 15.3%) at VAF 1%]. When applied to six childhood AML cases and compared with multiparameter flow cytometry for MRD analysis, deep sequencing showed concordance and superior sensitivity. Further high concordance was found with expression of fusion transcripts RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and KMT2A-MLLT10. The deep sequencing assay also detected mutations in blood when VAF in bone marrow exceeded 0.1% (n = 19). In conclusion, deep sequencing enables reliable detection of low levels of residual leukemic cells. Introduction of this method in patient care will allow for highly sensitive MRD surveillance in virtually every patient with AML.",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"Structural chromosomal rearrangements leading to gene fusions are strong driver mutations in a variety of tumors. Identification of specific gene fusions can be essential for distinguishing benign from malignant conditions and for recognizing specific subtypes of neoplasms that can have different management and prognosis. Rapid identification of gene fusions is particularly critical for patients with acute leukemia who cannot wait more than a few days before initiating treatment and for whom treatment can be dramatically different depending on the leukemia subtype. We have developed an assay for rapid detection of oncogenic gene fusions (within 24 hours) that takes advantage of the long reads and real-time data generation of the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing system. By using a modification of the anchored multiplex PCR method for library construction, we confidently identified BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts, with >100 reads within 15 minutes of sequencing. By using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens routinely tested in our clinical molecular laboratory, fusions were successfully identified within 5 hours from acquisition of Illumina-ready libraries and 30 minutes of sequencing initiation, including cases diluted to a tumor fraction of 5%. In conclusion, we have developed a nanopore-based sequencing assay that can decrease turnaround time for detection of fusion oncogenes and may be a valid approach for laboratories with low specimen volume and for cases in need of rapid results.",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

While STLV-1, as HTLV-1, causes Adult T-cell Leukemia/lymphoma, SFV infection is asymptomatic. Both retroviruses can be transmitted from NHPs to humans through bites that allow contact between infected saliva and recipient blood. Because both viruses infect CD4+ T-cells, they might interfere with each other replication, and this might impact viral transmission. Impact of STLV-1 co-infection on SFV replication was analyzed in 18 SFV-positive/STLV-1-negative and 18 naturally SFV/STLV-1 co-infected Papio anubis. Even if 9 animals were found STLV-1-positive in saliva, STLV-1 PVL was much higher in the blood. SFV proviruses were detected in the saliva of all animals. Interestingly, SFV proviral load was much higher in the blood of STLV-1/SFV co-infected animals, compared to STLV-1-negative animals. Given that soluble Tax protein can enter uninfected cells, we tested its effect on foamy virus promoter and we show that Tax protein can transactivate the foamy LTR. This demonstrates that true STLV-1 co-infection or Tax only has an impact on SFV replication and may influence the ability of the virus to be zoonotically transmitted as well as its ability to promote hematological abnormalities.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-5177-2471', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5129-6804']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary and secondary testicular involvement is extremely uncommon in neuroblastoma. PROCEDURE: All children with neuroblastoma treated with the Turkish Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG)-Neuroblastoma (NB) Study and who had testis involvement either at diagnosis or at relapse were retrospectively evaluated. A review of all cases with neuroblastoma and testis involvement in the literature was done. RESULTS: There were 3 children with NB documented to have involvement of the testis, 2 at diagnosis, 1 at recurrence, within the 559 cases (0.5%) treated with the Turkish Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG)-Neuroblastoma Protocol. All had advanced stage. Two were infants. A total of 57 cases of testicular or paratesticular neuroblastoma have been reported in children, and most cases represent metastases as in the 3 cases in our series. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroblastoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of testicular mass and work-up for neuroblastoma should be done before orchiectomy. Scrotal ultrasonography should be used as the first diagnostic tool and abdominal ultrasonography shall be done additionally. Testis examination should be performed at diagnosis and regularly during follow-up for boys diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Testes may be sanctuary sites when neuroblastoma is metastatic, as is the case in leukemia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 16.,"Molecular monitoring is indispensable for the clinical management of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the gold standard for the quantitative assessment of BCR-ABL transcript levels, which are critical in clinical decision-making. However, the frequent recurrence of the disease after drug discontinuation for 60% of patients has necessitated more sensitive and specific techniques to detect residual BCR-ABL transcripts. Here, we describe a quantification method for the detection of BCR-ABL targets at very low concentrations (<10 copies/sample) in the presence of a million copies of normal BCR and ABL genes. In this method, a fully modified locked nucleic acid (LNA) and a LNA/DNA chimera were used as capture probes, and the quantitative imaging mode of atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed. Targets with one of the major breakpoints (found in more than 95% of CML patients), b3a2 and b2a2, were quantified. The BCR-ABL target captured on a miniaturized LNA-probe spot was scanned at nanometric resolution, and the samples containing one to ten copies of the BCR-ABL genes were examined. It was observed that the highest sensitivity, i.e., the detection of a single copy of the target gene, could be achieved through multiple runs, and the observed cluster number was well correlative (adjusted R(2) = 0.999) to the target copy number in the sample solution. This observation clearly demonstrates that the LNA-based platform is effective in quantifying BCR-ABL targets with extremely low copy numbers, highlighting the potential applicability of AFM for use in the direct quantification of such targets without amplification or labeling.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-1432-3161'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"To study glycolysis/glycogenesis-related genes expression in childhood B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL), we performed a microarray-based analysis using published gene expression profiles. We found that SLC2A5, which encodes solute carrier family 2 member 5 (SLC2A5, previously termed GLUT5) that facilitates cell fructose uptake, was up-regulated in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ALL). Microarray-based analyses also suggested that SLC2A5 expression was significantly down-regulated in childhood B-ALL with t(1;19) or 11q23 mutation. High SLC2A5 expression was found in patients who had disease recurrence within 3 years, early relapse, shortened complete remission duration and positive minimal residue disease (MRD) status after treatment. SLC2A5 overexpression at both the mRNA and protein level in Ph+ALL was confirmed in a validation cohort of childhood B-ALL. We also validated the correlation of SLC2A5 expression and MRD status. A mechanistic study using a human Ph+ALL cell line showed that BCR-ABL1 kinase might regulate SLC2A5 expression via MYC. The tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib and dasatinib repressed SLC2A5 expression and the cell uptake of fructose. Fructose protected the tumour cells from nutrition deficiency and drug-induced cell death. Overall, our findings showed that SLC2A5 was up-regulated in childhood Ph+ALL. SLC2A5 expression correlated with childhood B-ALL clinical factors, such as MRD status. Given that TKIs could inhibit SLC2A5 expression, repression of fructose utility after TKI treatment contributes to TKI-induced Ph+ALL cytotoxicity. Targeting SLC2A5 might be promising in B-ALL treatment, especially for Ph+ALL patients with high SLC2A5 expression.",['NOTNLM'],"['* SLC2A5', '*Philadelphia chromosome', '*childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*fructose']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5855-4343'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a retrospective case report documenting ocular and systemic findings, imaging, pathology and management of 2 patients with T8mS. RESULTS: An 11-month-old white male infant and a 4-week-old Asian female were initially seen for unilateral and bilateral CCOs, respectively. Corneal examination revealed para-axial anterior stromal opacities with blood vessels. Superficial irregular opacities were seen on OCT, and specular microscopy revealed normal endothelial cell morphology. One eye required superficial keratectomy to clear the visual axis and developed steroid-induced glaucoma in the early postoperative period, successfully treated with goniotomy. Both patients had hyperopia, anisometropia, and amblyopia, which was managed with glasses and patching. Cytogenetic testing (through microarray and fluorescence in situ hybridization) later diagnosed T8mS in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: T8mS should be considered in the differential diagnosis for superficial CCOs with blood vessels. Anterior segment OCT can guide management and cytogenetics performed to confirm diagnosis. Systemic associations and, in particular, risk of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes warrant prompt diagnosis of this condition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 1.,"The identification of large numbers of genetic mutations in immature myeloid cells has made it difficult to identify specific targets for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Although current pharmacological targets for controlling cancer are focused on identifying genetic mutations, it is hard to develop the specific drugs to achieve complete remission due to complex and variable genetic mutations. To overcome the failure of the genetic mutation theory, the present study targeted mitochondrial metabolism as a strategy for inducing antileukemic activity, based on evidence that AML cells have an abnormally high amount of mitochondria and that somatic mutations can alter metabolic flux in cancer. It was found that Ldeprenyl, which is clinically available for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, exerts antimitochondria activity in KG1alpha cells, as assessed by detection of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification (ECAR) using XF analyzer, respectively. Using a luciferase assay for detecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, it was found that suppression of mitochondrial activity led to ATP depletion and was associated with potent cytotoxic activity. Ldeprenyl is known to target monoamine oxidaseB (MAOB) on the outer membrane of mitochondria, therefore, the activity of MAOA and B was measured based on the fluorometric detection of H2O2 produced by the enzyme reaction. Notably, MAOA and -B activity was low in AML cells and the present findings suggested that the anticancer effect of Ldeprenyl was independent of MAOB. Change of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysisrelated gene expression levels were measured by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction. Consistent with the aforementioned results, treatment with Ldeprenyl reduced the mRNA level of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysisrelated genes. Collectively, the present results identify Ldeprenyl as a novel candidate for the treatment of AML through inhibition of mitochondrial respiration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are currently no specific anticancer therapies targeting JMML, and the underlying gene expression changes have not been revealed. To define molecular targets and possible biomarkers for early diagnosis, optimal treatment, and prognosis, we conducted microarray data analysis using the Gene Expression Omnibus, and constructed proteinprotein interaction networks of all differentially expressed genes. Modular bioinformatics analysis revealed four core functional modules for JMML. We analyzed the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway functions associated with these modules. Using the CMap database, nine potential anticancer drugs were identified that modulate expression levels of many JMMLassociated genes. In addition, we identified possible miRNAs and transcription factors regulating these differentially expressed genes.

We recently identified a genetic variant in the 3'UTR of the TNFSF13B gene, encoding the cytokine BAFF (B-cell-activating factor), that generates an alternative polyadenylation site yielding a shorter, more actively translated variant, BAFF-var mRNA. Accordingly, individuals bearing the TNFSF13B variant had higher circulating BAFF and elevated risk of developing autoimmune diseases. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms controlling the enhanced translation of BAFF-var mRNA. We identified nuclear factor 90 (NF90, also known as ILF3) as an RNA-binding protein that bound preferentially the wild-type (BAFF-WT mRNA) but not BAFF-var mRNA in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. NF90 selectively suppressed BAFF translation by recruiting miR-15a to the 3'UTR of BAFF-WT mRNA. Our results uncover a paradigm whereby an autoimmunity-causing BAFF polymorphism prevents NF90-mediated recruitment of microRNAs to suppress BAFF translation, raising the levels of disease-associated BAFF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large number of high-quality cell spheres of uniform size and shape are required for basic studies and therapeutic applications. Conventional approaches, including the hanging drop method and suspension culture, are used for cell sphere production. However, these methods are time consuming, cell spheres cannot be harvested easily, and it is difficult to control the size and geometry of cell spheres. To resolve these problems, a novel multiple-funnel cell culture insert was designed for size controlling, easy harvesting, and scale-up production of cell spheres. Methods: The culture substrate has 680 micro-funnels with a 1-mm width top, 0.89 mm depth, and 0.5 mm square bottom. Mouse embryonic stem cells were used to test the newly developed device. The seeded embryonic stem cells settled at the downward medium surface toward the bottom opening and aggregated as embryoid bodies (EBs). For cell sphere harvest, the bottom of the culture insert was put in contact with the medium surface in another culture dish, and the medium in the device flowed down with cell spheres by hydrostatic pressure. Results: Compact cell spheres with uniform size and shape were collected easily. The diameter of the spheres could be controlled by adjusting the seeding cell density. Spontaneous neural differentiation (nestin and Tju1) and retinoic acid-induced endodermal differentiation (Pdx-1 and insulin I) were improved in the EBs produced using the new insert compared to those in EBs produced by suspension culture. Conclusions: This novel cell culture insert shall improve future studies of cell spheres and benefit clinical applications of cell therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell culture insert', 'Cell sphere', ""DMEM, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium"", 'EBs, embryoid bodies', 'ES cells, embryonic stem cells', 'Embryoid body', 'GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase', 'Hanging drop', 'LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor', 'MEFs, mouse embryonic fibroblasts', 'MSC, mesenchymal stem cell', 'Mouse embryonic stem cell', 'PBS, phosphate buffered saline', 'PCR, polymerase chain reaction', 'Pdx-1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1', 'RA, retinoic acid', 'RPMI, Roswell Park Memorial Institute', 'RT-PCR, real time polymerase chain reaction', 'SD, standard deviation', 'Spheroid', 'Tuj1, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow evaluation indicated a chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), confirmed by molecular testing. Imaging of the chest for persistent dyspnea revealed supraclavicular and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Biopsy of the cervical node showed expanded lymphoid follicles with atypical germinal centers that were positive for CD10, BCL-2, and BCL-6, consistent with follicular lymphoma (FL). Nodal PCR demonstrated clonal IGH and IGK gene rearrangements, and FISH analysis was positive for IGH-BCL-2 fusion. Together, these tests supported the diagnosis of FL. Additionally, the lymph node showed paracortical expansion by maturing pan-hematopoietic elements, no blastic groups, and positive RT-PCR analysis for BCR-ABL1, indicating concomitant involvement by chronic phase-CML.

We detected jumping translocations of 1q in three patients with initial diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and later progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Review of literature found jumping translocations of 1q in 30 reported cases of MDS and AML. The cytogenetic findings from these 33 cases showed that seven cases had a stemline clone and 26 cases had de novo jumping translocations of 1q in which 5% of cell lineages had additional structural rearrangements. In 75% of cases, the 1q donor jumped to the short arm of recipient acrocentric chromosomes. Approximately 82% of the fusions occurred in the telomeric regions of short and long arms and 18% occurred in the pericentric or interstitial regions of recipient chromosomes. Hypomethylation of the donor 1q pericentromeric region and shortened telomeres in recipient chromosomes were associated with the formation of jumping translocations. Jumping translocations of 1q as an indication of chromosomal instability pose high risk for progression of MDS to AML and a poor prognosis.

Epub 2018 Jul 2.,"The present study retrospectively analyzed 96 newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients with low-intermediate mortality risk to identify the optimum timing to initiate cytotoxic chemotherapy following all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) administration. Based on white blood cell (WBC) at chemotherapy initiation, the patients were divided into three groups: low WBC (WBC count </=4x10(9)/l), intermediate WBC (WBC count >4x10(9)/l and <15x10(9)/l) and high WBC group (WBC count >/=15x10(9)/l). According to the period from ATRA commencement to chemotherapy, 96 patients were further divided into two groups: </=3 days group (chemotherapy within 3 days of ATRA) and >3 days group (chemotherapy >3 days after ATRA). Clinical effects were compared by univariate analysis and multivariate analyses. The incidence rate of differentiation syndrome (DS; also termed retinoic acid syndrome) was 0.0, 11.1 and 40.0% in the low, intermediate and high WBC groups, respectively (P<0.001); complete remission (CR) rate was 90.5, 100.0 and 73.3%, respectively (P<0.001); and the rate of early mortality (defined as fatality during induction treatment) was 4.8, 0.0 and 26.7%, respectively (P<0.001). No differences were identified in clinicolaboratory parameters between the </=3 days and >3 days groups, except in time to achieve CR (P=0.004) and rate of bleeding related to chemotherapy (P=0.009), both being higher in the >3 days group. Multivariate analyses indicated WBC count at chemotherapy was the only independent risk factor for the occurrence of DS [P=0.002; odds ratio (OR) =1.058, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.021-1.095] and early mortality (P=0.036; OR =1.036, 95% CI =1.002-1.070). For newly diagnosed APL patients with low-intermediate risk, chemotherapy initiation should be recommended until WBC count rises to between 4x10(9)/l and 15x10(9)/l during induction treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'induction treatment', 'initiation time', 'low-intermediate risk', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual subsets vary in antigen specificity and origin, but the impact of antigenic pressure on the CLL BCR repertoire remains unknown. Here, we employed IgH.TEmu mice that spontaneously develop CLL, expressing mostly unmutated BCRs of which ~35% harbor VH11-2/Vkappa14-126 and recognize phosphatidylcholine. Proportions of VH11/Vkappa14-expressing CLL were increased in the absence of functional germinal centers in IgH.TEmu mice deficient for CD40L or activation-induced cytidine deaminase. Conversely, in vivo T cell-dependent immunization decreased the proportions of VH11/Vkappa14-expressing CLL. Furthermore, CLL onset was accelerated by enhanced BCR signaling in Siglec-G (-/-) mice or in mice expressing constitutively active Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Transcriptional profiling revealed that VH11 and non-VH11 CLL differed in the upregulation of specific pathways implicated in cell signaling and metabolism. Interestingly, principal component analyses using the 148 differentially expressed genes revealed that VH11 and non-VH11 CLL clustered with BCR-stimulated and anti-CD40-stimulated B cells, respectively. We identified an expression signature consisting of 13 genes that were differentially expressed in a larger panel of T cell-dependent non-VH11 CLL compared with T cell-independent VH11/Vkappa14 or mutated IgH.TEmu CLL. Parallel differences in the expression of these 13 signature genes were observed between heterogeneous and stereotypic human unmutated CLL. Our findings provide evidence for two distinct unmutated CLL subsets with a specific transcriptional signature: one is T cell-independent and B-1 cell-derived while the other arises upon antigen stimulation in the context of T-cell help.",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell receptors', '*BCR signaling', ""*Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", '*T cell help', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether lenalidomide leads to a significant improvement in treatment response and overall survival (OS) in cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains controversial. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in the treatment of AML. Methods: Clinical studies were identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Efficacy outcomes included overall response rate (ORR), complete remission (CR), and OS. Safety was evaluated based on the incidence of grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Results: Eleven studies were included in our meta-analysis; collectively these studies featured 407 AML patients.

Some studies have identified prognostic factors capable of predicting ED, whereas no risk rating system for ED has been reported in the literature. In this study, a risk classification system was built to identify subgroup at high risk of ED among patients with APL. Methods: Totally, 364 consecutive APL patients who received arsenic trioxide as induction therapy were included. Ten baseline clinical characteristics were selected for analysis, and they were de novo/relapse, age, sex, white blood cell count, platelet count, serum fibrinogen, creatinine, uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, and albumin. Using a training cohort (N=275), a multivariable logistic regression model was constructed, which was internally validated by the bootstrap method and externally validated using an independent cohort (N=89). Based on the model, a risk classification system was designed. Then, all patients were regrouped into de novo (N=285) and relapse (N=79) cohorts and the model and risk classification system were applied to both cohorts. Results: The constructed model included 8 variables without platelet count and sex. The model had excellent discriminatory ability (optimism-corrected area under the receiver operator characteristic curve=0.816+/-0.028 in the training cohort and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve=0.798 in the independent cohort) and fit well for both the training and independent data sets (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P=0.718 and 0.25, respectively). The optimism-corrected calibration slope was 0.817+/-0.12. The risk classification system could identify a subgroup comprising ~25% of patients at high risk of ED in both the training and independent cohorts (OR=0.140, P<0.001 and OR=0.224, P=0.027, respectively). The risk classification system could effectively identify patient subgroups at high risk of ED in not only de novo but also relapse cohorts (OR=0.233, P<0.001 and OR=0.105, P=0.001, respectively). Conclusion: All the results highlight the high practical value of the risk classification system.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'early death', 'relapse', 'risk classification system']",,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 30.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer cachexia is a metabolic wasting syndrome that is strongly associated with a poor prognosis. The initiating factors causing fat and muscle loss are largely unknown. Previously, we found that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) secreted by C26 colon carcinoma cells was responsible for atrophy in treated myotubes. In the present study, we tested whether C26 tumour-derived LIF is required for cancer cachexia in mice by knockout of Lif in C26 cells. METHODS: A C26 Lif null tumour cell line was made using CRISPR-Cas9. Measurements of cachexia were compared in mice inoculated with C26 vs. C26(Lif-/-) tumour cells, and atrophy was compared in myotubes treated with medium from C26 vs. C26(Lif-/-) tumour cells. Levels of 25 cytokines/chemokines were compared in serum of mice bearing C26 vs. C26(Lif-/-) tumours and in the medium from these tumour cell lines. RESULTS: At study endpoint, C26 mice showed outward signs of sickness while mice with C26(Lif-/-) tumours appeared healthy. Mice with C26(Lif-/-) tumours showed a 55-75% amelioration of body weight loss, muscle loss, fat loss, and splenomegaly compared with mice with C26 tumours (P < 0.05). The heart was not affected by LIF levels because the loss of cardiac mass was the same in C26 and C26(Lif-/-) tumour-bearing mice. LIF levels in mouse serum was entirely dependent on secretion from the tumour cells. Serum levels of interleukin-6 and G-CSF were increased by 79-fold and 68-fold, respectively, in C26 mice but only by five-fold and two-fold, respectively, in C26(Lif-/-) mice, suggesting that interleukin-6 and G-CSF increases are dependent on tumour-derived LIF. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the first use of CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of a candidate cachexia factor in tumour cells. The results provide direct evidence for LIF as a major cachexia initiating factor for the C26 tumour in vivo. Tumour-derived LIF was also a regulator of multiple cytokines in C26 tumour cells and in C26 tumour-bearing mice. The identification of tumour-derived factors such as LIF that initiate the cachectic process is immediately applicable to the development of therapeutics to treat cachexia.

We conducted reevaluation of autologous HSCT (AHSCT) to compare myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens for pediatric AML without the need for consideration of toxicities caused by allogeneic immune reactions. PROCEDURE: This retrospective study analyzed the clinical outcomes of 220 children with AML who underwent consecutive AHSCT between 1989 and 2002 in Japan by the national prospective registry. The transplantation outcomes of various conditioning regimens were compared. RESULTS: The median follow-up period of the survivors was 160 months. The clinical outcomes of busulfan + cyclophosphamide +/- etoposide or busulfan + melphalan regimens were significantly superior compared with other busulfan-based and total body irradiation-based regimens (leukemia-free survival [LFS]: 68% vs 42% and 55%, P = 0.001; overall survival [OS]: 74% vs 49% and 61%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that busulfan + cyclophosphamide +/- etoposide and busulfan + melphalan regimens were independent favorable factors for LFS (hazard ratio: 0.46; P < 0.001) and OS (hazard ratio: 0.40; P < 0.001) compared with the other busulfan-based regimen, and both age 2 years or older and advanced stage at AHSCT were independent poor predictors for LFS and OS, simultaneously.

Epub 2018 Sep 30.,"BACKGROUND: Pediatric cancer is a life-changing, stressful experience for children and their families. Although most children adjust well, psychologically, a significant subset report posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), with nearly 75% reexperiencing traumatic parts of cancer and/or its treatment. However, little research has examined the effects of pediatric cancer and related PTSS on emotional processing, and on functional properties of key emotional centers in the brain (e.g., amygdala). PROCEDURE: We examined cancer-related PTSS, behavioral responses during an emotion-processing task, and resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala in 17 pediatric cancer survivors (ages 6-11) and 17 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: Cancer survivors, relative to controls, were more likely to rate ambiguous (i.e., neutral) faces as negative (i.e., ""negativity bias""). Higher reexperiencing PTSS was associated with faster responses to neutral faces. Although there were no group differences in amygdala centrality, within survivors, both higher reexperiencing PTSS and faster reaction times were associated with increased centrality of the amygdala-a functional property associated with hubs of information processing in the brain. In an exploratory mediation analysis, we found that amygdala centrality mediated the link between reaction time and PTSS, suggesting that changes in the brain may be a proximal marker of the expression of emotion-related symptomology. CONCLUSIONS: Negativity bias in cancer survivors may reflect their stressful experiences with cancer and/or its treatment. This negativity bias may represent a susceptibility to changes in emotion-related brain functioning, which may, in turn, lead to PTSS.",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*amygdala', '*chemotherapy', '*childhood cancer', '*functional connectivity']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0771-6795'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 30.,"BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer are at risk for poor psychosocial outcomes, perhaps because they have not acquired skills to navigate the adversities of illness. In a recent phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT), the ""Promoting Resilience in Stress Management"" (PRISM) intervention was associated with improved patient-reported resilience, quality of life, and distress. In this planned analysis of secondary aims, we hypothesized PRISM would also improve targeted coping skills of hopeful thinking, benefit finding, and goal setting. METHODS: We conducted this parallel RCT at Seattle Children's Hospital from January 2015 to October 2016. English-speaking AYAs (12-25 years old) with cancer were randomized one-to-one to PRISM or usual care (UC). PRISM teaches stress-management, goal-setting, cognitive-reframing, and meaning-making skills in four sessions delivered in-person every other week. Participants completed surveys at enrollment and 6 months later. Mixed effects linear regression models evaluated associations between PRISM and benefit finding (Benefit-Finding Scale for Children), hopeful thinking (Hope Scale), and an exploratory outcome of goal setting (queried with open-ended items about participant's goals, measured qualitatively by three blinded reviewers). RESULTS: Of N = 92 AYAs (48 PRISM, 44 UC), 73% were 12-17 years old, 43% female, and 62% diagnosed with leukemia or lymphoma. PRISM was associated with improved benefit finding and hope with moderate-to-large effect sizes-benefit finding: +3.1 points, 95% CI 0.0, 6.2, d = 0.4, and P = 0.05; and hope: +3.6 points, 95% CI 0.7, 6.4, d = 0.6, and P = 0.01. We did not detect changes in goal setting (-0.5 points, 95% CI -1.2, 0.3, d = -0.3, P = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: PRISM was associated with improvements in benefit finding and hopeful thinking, two adaptive coping skills which may mitigate long-term psychosocial risk.",['NOTNLM'],"['*RCT', '*adolescent/young adult', '*cancer', '*health services', '*intervention', '*palliative care', '*patient-reported outcomes', '*positive psychology', '*quality of life', '*resilience']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7608-607X'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although cytogenetic characterization classically involves conventional chromosome and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays, limitations of these techniques include poor resolution and the inability to precisely identify breakpoints. METHOD: We evaluated whether an NGS-based methodology that detects structural abnormalities and copy number changes using mate pair sequencing (MPseq) can enhance the diagnostic yield for patients with AML. RESULTS: Using 68 known abnormal and 20 karyotypically normal AML samples, each recurrent primary AML-specific abnormality previously identified in the abnormal samples was confirmed using MPseq. Importantly, in eight cases with abnormalities that could not be resolved by conventional cytogenetic studies, MPseq was utilized to molecularly define eight recurrent AML-fusion events. In addition, MPseq uncovered two cryptic abnormalities that were missed by conventional cytogenetic studies. Thus, MPseq improved the diagnostic yield in the detection of AML-specific structural rearrangements in 10/88 (11%) of cases analyzed. CONCLUSION: Utilization of MPseq represents a precise, molecular-based technique that can be used as an alternative to conventional cytogenetic studies for newly diagnosed AML patients with the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis of hematologic malignancies.",['NOTNLM'],"['MPseq', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'molecular cytogenetics']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2226-6163'],,,,,,"['(c)2018 The Authors.

Additionally, impaired NOX2 function entails hyperactive lymphocytes and autoimmunity in humans and in murine models. The impact of NOX2 and ROS on cancer development is only partly explored. Recent research published in the Journal of Pathology showed that genetic depletion of any of the NOX2 subunits Cyba, Cybb, Ncf1, Ncf2 and Ncf4 reduced the formation of lung metastases following intravenous injection of murine tumor cells. These findings, together with the role of NOX2 in maintaining self-tolerance, imply that NOX2 is a targetable immune checkpoint in cancer. In particular, the possibility of modulating NOX2 to improve lymphocyte-mediated control of metastatic cells merits further investigation. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Here, we employed leukemia models and human leukemia samples to document a form of adaptive homeostasis, where malignant cells alter systemic physiology through impairment of both host insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion to provide tumors with increased glucose. Mechanistically, tumor cells induce high-level production of IGFBP1 from adipose tissue to mediate insulin sensitivity. Further, leukemia-induced gut dysbiosis, serotonin loss, and incretin inactivation combine to suppress insulin secretion. Importantly, attenuated disease progression and prolonged survival are achieved through disruption of the leukemia-induced adaptive homeostasis.

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,Aberrant expression of HOXA9 is a prominent feature of acute leukemia driven by diverse oncogenes. Here we show that HOXA9 overexpression in myeloid and B progenitor cells leads to significant enhancer reorganizations with prominent emergence of leukemia-specific de novo enhancers. Alterations in the enhancer landscape lead to activation of an ectopic embryonic gene program. We show that HOXA9 functions as a pioneer factor at de novo enhancers and recruits CEBPalpha and the MLL3/MLL4 complex. Genetic deletion of MLL3/MLL4 blocks histone H3K4 methylation at de novo enhancers and inhibits HOXA9/MEIS1-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo. These results suggest that therapeutic targeting of HOXA9-dependent enhancer reorganization can be an effective therapeutic strategy in acute leukemia with HOXA9 overexpression.,['NOTNLM'],"['*HOXA9', '*KMT2', '*MLL', '*acute leukemia', '*de novo enhancer', '*epigenetics', '*histone methylation', '*pioneer factor', '*transcription factor']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We sought here to explore the possibility that changes in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells during development might alter the biology of leukemias arising from this tissue compartment. Using a mouse model of acute T cell leukemia, we found that leukemias generated from fetal liver (FL) and adult bone marrow (BM) differed dramatically in their leukemia stem cell activity with FL leukemias showing markedly reduced serial transplantability as compared to BM leukemias. We present evidence that this difference is due to NOTCH1-driven autocrine IGF1 signaling, which is active in FL cells but restrained in BM cells by EZH2-dependent H3K27 trimethylation. Further, we confirmed this mechanism is operative in human disease and show that enforced IGF1 signaling effectively limits leukemia stem cell activity.

OBJECTIVES: To examine mortality patterns of a prospective cohort of men from the rubber and cable manufacturing industries in Great Britain. METHODS: SMRs were calculated for males aged 35+ years at start of follow-up in 1967-2015 using the population of England and Wales as the external comparator. Tests for homogeneity and trends in SMRs were also completed. RESULTS: For all causes, all malignant neoplasms, non-malignant respiratory diseases and circulatory diseases, SMRs were significantly elevated, and also particularly for cancers of the stomach (SMR=1.26,95% CI 1.18 to 1.36), lung (1.25,95% CI 1.21 to 1.29) and bladder (1.16,95% CI 1.05 to 1.28). However, the observed deaths for leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma were as expected. Bladder cancer risks were elevated only in workers exposed to antioxidants containing 1-naphthylamine and 2-naphthylamine. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of excess risks in the rubber industry for some non-cancer diseases and supports IARC's conclusions in relation to risks for cancers of the bladder, lung and stomach, but not for leukaemia, NHL or multiple myeloma.",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*industrial cohort study', '*mortality', '*rubber and cable industry']",,,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Various studies have shown that toxicities resulting from the treatment are influenced by pharmacogenetic variants. Most of this research has focused on relatively homogeneous populations, and the influence of these variants in highly admixed populations, such as that of Brazil, is still poorly understood. The present study investigated the association between pharmacogenetic variants and severe toxicities in pediatric B-cell ALL patients from an admixed population of the Brazilian Amazon. The rs2306283 (of SLCO1B1) mutant allele increased the risk of neurotoxicity threefold, and the homozygous mutant rs9895420 (of ABCC3) genotype was associated with a fivefold increase in protection against severe gastrointestinal toxicity. This indicates that the rs2306283 and rs9895420 polymorphisms may be relevant to the prediction of severe toxicity in pediatric ALL patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABCC3', '*ALL', '*Pediatrics', '*Pharmacogenetics', '*SLCO1B1']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Sep 22.,"miR-150 functions as a tumor suppressor in malignancies of the lymphocyte lineage and its expression is significantly reduced in these cells. However, the mechanism of miR-150 repression is unknown and so are pharmacological interventions that can reverse it. Here, we report that reduced expression of miR-150 in human Jurkat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells is mediated by constitutive mTOR signaling, a common characteristic of T-ALL cell lines and clinical isolates. Activating mTOR signaling in non-malignant T cells also resulted in a significant miR-150 down-regulation. Conversely, treatment with a pharmacological mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, increased miR-150 expression in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells, as well as in other leukemia cells. Interestingly, ectopic over-expression of miR-150 acted in a feed-forward loop and further sensitized Jurkat cells to a rapamycin-induced cell cycle arrest by targeting a large network of cell cycle genes. These findings suggest that miR-150 is normally expressed in quiescent T lymphocytes to reinforce an anti-proliferative state, and that mTOR signaling promotes cell proliferation in part by inhibiting miR-150 expression. Restoration of the miR-150-dependent anti-proliferative loop constitutes a novel mechanism underlying the efficacy of rapamycin in a T-ALL cell line. Further investigation of this mechanism in clinical isolates of T-ALL and other hematopoietic malignancies could help better guide development of targeted therapies.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Cell cycle', '*Gene network', '*Jurkat', '*Proliferation', '*Rapamycin', '*mTOR', '*miR-150', '*microRNA']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"BACKGROUND: The role that pesticides in the domestic environment might play in the etiology of childhood leukemia remains a subject of controversy. Recent studies often reached inconsistent conclusions. OBJECTIVE: To update our earlier systematic review on the association between residential/household/domestic exposure to pesticides and childhood leukemia, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity not previously assessed. METHODS: A systematic search of studies published in English between January 2009 and June 2018 was conducted in MEDLINE, and a ""snowball searching"" was performed from the reference list of identified publications and from Web of Science citations. Risk estimates were extracted from 15 case-control studies published between 1987 and 2018. The quality of the publications was assessed by using a modified version of the Downs and Black (1998) checklist. A random-effect meta-analysis model was used to calculate summary odds ratios (SOR) and separate analyses were conducted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), unspecified AL/leukemia and any leukemia types. Stratification by critical exposure period, exposure location, pesticide biocide category, child age at diagnosis, study quality, specific exposures, type of pest treated, and geographic location were performed. RESULTS: A statistically significant association between residential pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia was observed by combining all studies (SOR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.27-1.95) without evidence of publication bias. Statistically significant increased risks were observed for all types of leukemia, and specifically for exposure during pregnancy, indoor exposure, prenatal exposure to insecticides and whatever the age at diagnosis. Statistical significance was also reached for high quality studies, pet treatments, professional pest control treatment and use of insect repellants, mosquito treatment and for studies from USA/Canada or International. The highest increased risks were observed for AML among children aged 2 years or less, as well as for unspecified leukemia type observed after prenatal indoor exposure. CONCLUSIONS: A positive association between domestic pesticide exposure and childhood leukemia is confirmed. Although the literature provides moderate to low-quality of evidence, these new results further justify the need of limiting the use of household pesticides during pregnancy and childhood.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Child', '*Household', '*Leukemia', '*Meta-analysis', '*Pesticides', '*Systematic review']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Epub 2018 Aug 29.,"BACKGROUND: The optimal number of high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) consolidation cycles before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for acute myeloid leukemia is not fully standardized. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study evaluated the impact of HDAC consolidation cycles before allogeneic HCT in 194 patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission between 1998 and 2014. The patients were reclassified into 3 groups-no consolidation (C0, n = 20), 1 consolidation (C1, n = 115), and >/= 2 consolidations (C2, n = 59)-by pre-HCT consolidation cycle. RESULTS: The 3-year relapse-free survival rates was 45.9%, 66.9%, and 73.3% for the C0, C1, and C2 groups, respectively (P = .064), while the 3-year overall survival rates were 35.0%, 55.2%, and 67.5%, respectively (P = .106). The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was higher in the C2 group (38.7%) than in the C0 (22.2%) or C1 (17.7%) group (P = .018). However, the incidence of chronic GVHD showed no difference between the groups. Multivariate analysis for overall survival revealed the following independent factors: adverse cytogenetic risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.84, P = .046), C2 versus C0 (HR = 0.41, P = .037), pre-HCT status beyond CR1 versus CR1 (HR = 5.78, P < .001), and presence of chronic GVHD (HR = 0.45, P = .004). CONCLUSION: One or two cycles of HDAC consolidation therapy led to better subsequent HCT outcomes compared to the no-consolidation therapy group.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelogenous leukemia', '*Consolidation chemotherapy', '*Cytarabine', '*Graft-versus-host disease', '*Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"Targeting the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 holds a promise to improve therapy of multiple types of Mcl-1 dependent cancers but raises concerns of on-target cardiotoxicity due to the presence and reported role of Mcl-1 in heart. Herein, we investigated the importance of Mcl-1 in the survival and contractile function of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes in culture. Effective knockdown of Mcl-1 with siRNAs reproducibly resulted in early (measured at Day 3) marginal alterations in caspase 3/7 activity, LDH leakage, ATP content and cellular impedance. After 14days of Mcl-1 knockdown, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, deteriorating effects on mitochondrial ultrastructure, and alterations in beat rate and amplitude were revealed. Inhibition of Bcl-xL by siRNA-mediated knockdown or selective inhibitors did not cause any overt cellular responses except for a minimal increase in caspase 3/7 activity; however, loss of Mcl-1 concomitant with down-regulated Bcl-xL activated apoptosis and caused extensive cell death as reflected by an 80% loss in cell index, activation of caspase-3 with associated PARP cleavage, and a decrease in beat amplitude and mitochondrial membrane potential after 3days of Mcl-1/Bcl-xL knockdown., Together, these findings suggest that Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL provide duplicate safeguard measures in maintaining structural and functional integrity of cardiomyocytes. Hence, BH3-mimetic drugs targeting Mcl-1 may be well tolerated in the presence of intact Bcl-xL.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Bcl-xL', '*Cardio-oncology', '*Mcl-1', '*Mitochondria', '*hiPSC-cardiomyocyte']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is defined by the presence of a monoclonal B-cell population in the peripheral blood (PB) at a concentration of <5x10(9)/l and no signs or symptoms of a lymphoproliferative disorder. In around 75% of cases, the immunophenotype of the clonal B-cell expansions is superimposable to that of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), thus defined ""CLL-like"". Other cases may coexpress CD19, CD5, bright CD20, and lack CD23 (""atypical CLL""), while others are CD5-negative (""non-CLL""). Beside the immunophenotypic profile, a key distinction is based on the B-cell count, stratifying the MBL category in low (<0.5x10(9)/l) or high-count (>/=0.5x10(9)/l). Low-count (LC) MBL is recognized in general population studies and it is not associated with lymphocytosis. High-count (HC) MBL is identified during the clinical work-up for lymphocytosis and carries a risk of progression to CLL requiring therapy of 1-2% per year in most series, warranting clinical monitoring over time. At the time of MBL diagnosis, the key point is the careful evaluation and exclusion of differential diagnoses. After the initial workup, the follow-up at a referral center by a hematologist would be desirable as, in addition to the obvious risk of progression to clinically relevant CLL, the appropriate management of MBL individuals should take into account the risk of developing infections, other cancers and autoimmune disorders. For those cases who indeed bear a risk, though limited, of clinical consequences, such as the majority of HC-MBL cases, current evidences suggest that they may benefit from a tailored and specialized approach.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*MBL', '*Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*high-count', '*low-count']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 European Federation of Internal Medicine.

This study assessed the incidence and impact of select DNA-damaging therapy exposure on risk of secondary MDS and AML in patients with ovarian cancer (OC) or breast cancer (BC). METHODS: Adults with a first observed OC or BC diagnosis (index date) between 1/1/2000 and 6/30/2014 were identified from MarketScan(R) Commercial and Medicare databases. Patients had >/=12 months of pre-index and >/=1 month of post-index continuous health plan enrollment. Incidence of MDS/AML was evaluated over a variable-length period following the index date for each cancer cohort. Risk factors for secondary MDS/AML, including duration of DNA-damaging therapy exposure, were assessed using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Study selection criteria identified 23,862 patients with OC and 281,473 patients with BC (mean [SD] follow-up: 35.8 [31.4] and 46.0 [37.2] months, respectively). Incidence of MDS/AML was 2.77 and 1.44 per 1000 person-years among patients with OC and BC, respectively. Within both cohorts, incidence of MDS and AML was higher among patients exposed than those not exposed to select DNA-damaging therapy (alkylating agents, antimetabolites, platinum-based antineoplastic agents, and topoisomerase inhibitors). Duration of exposure to DNA-damaging therapy was a significant risk factor for developing MDS/AML during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that there is likely a background risk of secondary MDS/AML associated with use of DNA-damaging therapies in earlier lines of chemotherapy and it is elevated in subcohorts exposed to select DNA-damaging therapies.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Breast cancer', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*Olaparib', '*Ovarian cancer', '*Real world']",,,['Gynecol Oncol. 2018 Nov;151(2):187-189.

Previously, we reported a split-luciferase-based biosensor that can detect VDR ligands and assess their affinity for the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the VDR in a short time. However, a further increase in its sensitivity was required to detect plasma levels of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs. In this study, a novel type of biosensor called LXXLL + LBD was successfully developed. Here, the split luciferase forms a functional complex based on the intermolecular interaction between the LXXLL motif and the ligand-bound form of the LBD. This biosensor has an approximately 10-fold increase in the light intensity compared to the previous versions.

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"BACKGROUND: Dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) overproduce progranulin (PGRN), an endogenous antagonist of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, due to the deficiency of transcription factor Fli1. Fli1 expression is also decreased in dermal fibroblasts derived from patients with localized scleroderma (LSc). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression levels of PGRN and its contribution to the induction of pro-fibrotic phenotype in LSc dermal fibroblasts. METHODS: PGRN expression levels were determined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR in the skin of human subjects. The role of PGRN in fibroblast activation was examined with gene silencing technique. The involvement of c-Abl/protein kinase C (PKC)-delta/Fli1 pathway in the regulation of PGRN expression was investigated by immunoblotting. RESULTS: The expression levels of PGRN and TNF-alpha were elevated in LSc skin lesions compared with healthy control skin. LSc dermal fibroblasts were less responsive to the anti-fibrotic effect of TNF-alpha than normal dermal fibroblasts. Importantly, gene silencing of PGRN reversed the response to TNF-alpha in LSc dermal fibroblasts. Similar to SSc dermal fibroblasts, the inhibition of c-Abl/PKC-delta/Fli1 pathway by gene silencing of ABL1 or PRKCD significantly suppressed PGRN expression in LSc dermal fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: PGRN overproduction due to constitutively activated c-Abl/PKC-delta/Fli1 pathway may contribute to the resistance of LSc dermal fibroblasts to the anti-fibrotic effect of TNF-alpha, which may be involved in maintaining their pro-fibrotic phenotype under the pro-inflammatory condition, as is the case with SSc.",['NOTNLM'],"['Fibroblasts', 'Friend leukemia virus integration 1', 'Localized scleroderma', 'Progranulin', 'Tumor necrosis factor-alpha']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

We present the first case, to our knowledge, of chronic myeloid leukemia with 2 cryptic insertional events resulting in BCR/ABL1 fusion on the derivative chromosome 9 and FNBP1/BCR fusion on the derivative chromosome 22. These insertional events were misinterpreted as a typical balanced BCR/ABL1 translocation by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization studies and were cryptic by conventional chromosome analysis, resulting in a ""normal"" karyotype. Mate-pair sequencing, a novel next-generation sequencing technology that can detect and characterize structural variants with significantly higher resolution and precision compared with traditional cytogenetic methodologies, identified 2 insertional events and resolved the seemingly discrepant chromosome and fluorescence in situ hybridization results. This case demonstrates the complexities of genetic abnormalities unappreciable by traditional cytogenetic methodologies and highlights the clinical utility of mate-pair sequencing.",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR/ABL1', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', '*Conventional chromosome analysis', '*Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)', '*Mate-pair sequencing (MPseq)', '*t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a rare disease in children for which pediatric evidence-based guidelines are lacking. We designed an anonymous survey for practicing pediatric oncologists and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) physicians to assess their willingness to recommend BMT for a patient with CML based on various clinical scenarios. A total of 274 physicians responded to the survey (13.4% response rate). Nearly all pediatric oncologists and BMT physicians recommended against BMT at time of diagnosis of CML in the chronic phase, with only 8.0% and 1.9% recommending BMT if a matched sibling donor (MSD) and a matched unrelated donor (MUD), respectively, was available. Similarly, after a first poor response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy or hematologic relapse, physicians continued to recommend against BMT (39.5% and 23.3% recommended BMT in patients with a matched sibling donor and matched unrelated donor, respectively). However, 81.7% and 69.8% of respondents would recommend BMT after 2 hematologic relapses on TKI therapy, if an MSD and an MUD, respectively, were available. In addition, there was great interest in developing a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of stopping TKIs in children with CML who achieve and maintain a deep molecular response, with 86.7% of respondents stating they would offer such a trial to their pediatric patients. This survey highlights the need for evidence-based, pediatric-specific guidelines for the management of children and adolescents with CML.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow transplantation', '*Chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*Pediatric', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Flow cytometry is the gold standard method of peripheral blood immune cell profiling. However, the requirement for viable cells can limit its applicability, especially in studies of retrospective clinical cohorts. We aimed to determine if gene expression, analysed using the NanoString platform, could be used to quantify the immune populations present in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Cell abundance scores derived from gene expression analysis were significantly correlated with the population frequency quantified by flow cytometry for all subsets analysed, including T cells, NK cells and Monocytes. This study demonstrates that gene expression analysis can be applied to cryopreserved PBMC and provides a concordant and complementary understanding of the immune profile to flow cytometry.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2018 Nov 22.,"OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Pediatric-inspired regimens have been adopted by several groups as the treatment strategy for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Whether subsequent modifications of these protocols have led to an improvement in the outcome of patients is uncertain, especially in T-cell ALL. We analyzed 169 patients with high-risk T-cell ALL included in two consecutive trials of the PETHEMA Group (HR-ALL03 [n = 104] and the more contemporary HR-ALL11 [n = 65]). RESULTS: Patients and disease characteristics were balanced between both groups. Regarding efficacy, we observed a similar complete remission (CR) rate, relapse and disease-free survival (DFS) between both protocols. Patients included in the HR-ALL11 trial had better 2-year overall survival (OS) compared with the HR-ALL03 (65% [95% CI 51%-79%] vs 44% [95% CI 34%-54%], P = 0.026). Regarding toxicity, we observed a better safety profile in the HR-11 protocol. Irrespective of the protocol, patients with good measurable residual disease (MRD) clearance had a promising outcome without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in CR1, with 2-year OS of 67%. CONCLUSION: Patients with T-cell ALL included in the HR-11 trial showed better OS than patients in the HR-03, mostly driven by a reduction of NRM.",['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell ALL', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'pediatric-inspired']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1038-5197'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2018 Sep 29.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite advances in diagnostic techniques, many cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain underdiagnosed in remote centers unequipped with these technologies. We hypothesized that the automated cellular indices with scatter plots and flags may aid in rapid and cost-effective screening of AML. METHODS: Cell population data (CPD) parameters from 100 de novo AML samples were analyzed by Coulter LH 780 automated analyzer and were compared with 100 age-matched controls. Similar parameters were also compared with 100 and 50 reactive cases of neutrophilia and monocytosis, respectively. System-generated flags and scatter plot patterns were also analyzed. RESULTS: Results were compared between AML cases and normal controls; AML FAB M2, M3, M4 vs reactive neutrophilia; AML FAB M4, M5 vs reactive monocytosis. Significant parameters were selected from all comparison groups. Using appropriate statistical tools, we calculated the cutoff values of these parameters and were able to screen out AML cases with 94% sensitivity and 95% specificity. Three statistical equations were generated using two of the most significant parameters which improved the sensitivity to 98% and specificity to 99%. Five hypothetical scatter plot patterns were devised and were classified according to FAB categories of AML. Most common pattern was selected in AML which was seen in 56% of the cases. Output was analyzed combining these patterns and flags with CPD parameters. CONCLUSION: CPD either alone or in the form of statistical equations along with scatter plots and flags can provide rapid and economic tool in preliminary diagnosis of AML in cost-constrained settings.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'VCS parameters', 'automated analysers', 'monocytosis', 'neutrophilia']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1170-5976'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although hypomethylating agents have survival benefit and are the current standard of care, many MDS patients will not garner a response from therapy. For those who do respond, most responses are not durable, and the only hope for a cure is allogeneic stem cell transplant. New therapies to improve outcomes are urgently needed. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials combining standard hypomethylating agents with novel experimental agents are underway in an effort to improve clinical outcomes in MDS patients. Several of these small molecules have demonstrated the ability to augment the response rates of hypomethylating agents alone, including complete remission rates, in both the front line and refractory settings. Combination approaches utilizing hypomethylating agents and novel-targeted therapies have demonstrated the ability to improve response rates in MDS patients in both the front line and salvage settings, and thus may change the standard of care.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Hypomethylating agents', '*Immunotherapy', '*Isocitrate dehydrogenase', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*Pevonedistat']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"PURPOSE: Therapy with [(177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotate is effective in patients with grade I/II metastasized and/or inoperable bronchial neuroendocrine tumour (NET) or gastroenteropancreatic NET (GEP-NET). In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of salvage treatment with [(177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotate. METHODS: Patients with progressive bronchial NET or GEP-NET were selected for re-(re)treatment if they had benefited from initial peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (I-PRRT) with a minimal progression-free survival (PFS) of 18 months. Patients received an additional cumulative dose of 14.8 GBq of [(177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotate over two cycles per retreatment with PRRT (R-PRRT) or re-retreatment with PRRT (RR-PRRT). RESULTS: The safety and efficacy analyses included 181 patients and 168 patients, respectively, with bronchial NET or GEP-NET. Overall median follow-up was 88.6 months (95% CI 79.0-98.2). Median cumulative doses were 44.7 GBq (range 26.3-46.4 GBq) during R-PRRT (168 patients) and 59.7 GBq (range 55.2-</=60.5 GBq) during RR-PRRT (13 patients). Objective response and stable disease, as best response, were observed in 26 patients (15.5%) and 100 patients (59.5%) following R-PRRT, and in 5 patients (38.5%) and 7 patients (53.8%) following RR-PRRT, respectively. Median PFS was 14.6 months (95% CI 12.4-16.9) following R-PRRT and 14.2 months (95% CI 9.8-18.5) following RR-PRRT. Combined overall survival (OS) after I-PRRT plus R-PRRT and RR-PRRT was 80.8 months (95% CI 66.0-95.6). Grade III/IV bone marrow toxicity occurred in 6.6% and 7.7% of patients after R-PRRT and RR-PRRT, respectively. Salvage therapy resulted in a significantly longer OS in patients with bronchial NET, GEP-NET and midgut NET than in a nonrandomized control group. The total incidence of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was 2.2%. No PRRT-related grade III/IV nephrotoxicity was observed. CONCLUSION: A cumulative dose of up to 60.5 GBq salvage PRRT with [(177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotate is safe and effective in patients with progressive disease (relapse-PD) following I-PRRT with [(177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotate.

We report the use of InO in 51 children with relapsed/refractory ALL treated in the compassionate use program. In this heavily pretreated cohort, complete remission was achieved in 67% of patients with overt marrow disease. The majority (71%) of responders were negative for minimal residual disease. Responses were observed irrespective of cytogenetic subtype or number or type of prior treatment regimens. InO was well-tolerated; grade 3 hepatic transaminitis or hyperbilirubinemia were noted in 6 (12%) and grade 3/4 infections in 11 (22%) patients. No patient developed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) during InO therapy; however, 11 of 21 (52%) patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following InO developed SOS. Downregulation of surface CD22 was detected as a possible escape mechanism in three patients who developed a subsequent relapse after InO. We conclude that InO is a well-tolerated, effective therapy for children with relapsed ALL and prospective studies are warranted. Identification of risk factors for developing post-HSCT SOS and strategies to mitigate this risk are ongoing.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7559-7927'],,,['Leukemia. 2019 Mar 7;:.

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with substantial alterations in T-cell composition and function. However, the role of T-cells in CLL remains largely controversial. Here, we utilized the Emicro-TCL1 mouse model of CLL as well as blood and lymph node samples of CLL patients to investigate the existence of anti-tumoral immune responses in CLL, and to characterize involved immune cell populations. Thereby, we identified an oligoclonal CD8(+) effector T-cell population that expands along with CLL progression and controls disease development. We further show that a higher percentage of CD8(+) effector T-cells produces IFNgamma, and demonstrate that neutralization of IFNgamma results in faster CLL progression in mice. Phenotypical and functional analyses of expanded CD8(+) effector T-cells show significant differences in disease-affected tissues in mice, with cells in secondary lymphoid organs harboring hallmarks of activation-induced T-cell exhaustion. Notably, we further describe a respective population of exhausted CD8(+) T-cells that specifically accumulate in lymph nodes, but not in peripheral blood of CLL patients. Collectively, these data emphasize the non-redundant role of CD8(+) T-cells in suppressing CLL progression and highlight their dysfunction that can be exploited as target of immunotherapy in this malignancy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"High-frequency relapse remains a clinical hurdle for complete remission of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients, with heterogeneous dysregulated signaling profiles-including of Raf-MEK-ERK and Akt-mTORC1-S6K signaling pathways-recently being implicated in disease outcomes. Here we report that GM-CSF/IL-3/IL-5 receptor common beta-chain-associated protein (CBAP) is highly expressed in human T-ALL cell lines and many primary tumor tissues and is required to bolster leukemia cell proliferation in tissue culture and for in vivo leukemogenesis in a xenograft mouse model. Downregulation of CBAP markedly restrains expansion of leukemia cells and alleviates disease aggravation of leukemic mice. Transcriptomic profiling and molecular biological analyses suggest that CBAP acts upstream of Ras and Rac1, and functions as a modulator of both Raf-MEK-ERK and Akt-mTORC1 signaling pathways to control leukemia cell growth. Specifically, CBAP facilitated Akt-dependent TSC2 phosphorylation in cell-based assays and in vitro analysis, decreased lysosomal localization of TSC2, and elevated Rheb-GTP loading and subsequent activation of mTORC1 signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel oncogenic contribution of CBAP in T-ALL leukemic cells, in addition to its original pro-apoptotic function in cytokine-dependent cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells, by demonstrating its functional role in the regulation of Akt-TSC2-mTORC1 signaling for leukemia cell proliferation. Thus, CBAP represents a novel therapeutic target for many types of cancers and metabolic diseases linked to PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One important obstacle to progress for this patient population is the lack of immunocompetent models that faithfully recapitulate the short latency and aggressiveness of this disease. Recent whole-genome sequencing of MLL-AF4 B-ALL samples revealed a high frequency of activating RAS mutations; however, single-agent targeting of downstream effectors of the RAS pathway in these mutated MLL-r B-ALLs has demonstrated limited and nondurable antileukemic effects. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of activating mutant N-Ras (G12D) cooperates with Mll-Af4 to generate a highly aggressive serially transplantable B-ALL in mice. We used our novel mouse model to test the sensitivity of Mll-Af4/N-Ras (G12D) leukemia to small molecule inhibitors and found potent and synergistic preclinical efficacy of dual targeting of the Mek and Atr pathways in mouse- and patient-derived xenografts with both mutations in vivo, suggesting this combination as an attractive therapeutic opportunity that might be used to treat patients with these mutations. Our studies indicate that this mouse model of Mll-Af4/N-Ras B-ALL is a powerful tool to explore the molecular and genetic pathogenesis of this disease subtype, as well as a preclinical discovery platform for novel therapeutic strategies.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1723-8520'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptome analysis in the murine MRP8-PML/RARA APL model has demonstrated modest alterations in gene expression accompanied by expansion of the promyelocyte compartment. Of particular interest, mice expressing PML/RARA showed downregulation of the transcription factor Irf8 mRNA. Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8) is a known regulator of hematopoiesis. Previous research had implicated IRF8 as a tumor suppressor for myeloid neoplasia, and mice lacking IRF8 develop a well-differentiated myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by expansion of neutrophilic lineage cells. We hypothesized that PML/RARA-mediated downregulation of Irf8 transcript levels contributes to the initiation of APL. We observed significant downregulation of IRF8 protein levels in highly purified promyelocyte populations of PML/RARA transgenic mice. We also found that loss of IRF8 results in expansion of promyelocytes in vivo, partially phenocopying the impact of PML/RARA expression. Moreover, survival experiments showed that complete loss of IRF8 leads to acceleration of APL onset in our PML/RARA mice. Collectively, these data identify IRF8 downregulation as an important factor in APL initiation and highlight a tumor-suppressor role for IRF8 in this acute leukemia.",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"Deletion of chromosome 6q is a well-recognized abnormality found in poor-prognosis T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Using integrated genomic approaches, we identified two candidate haploinsufficient genes contiguous at 6q14, SYNCRIP (encoding hnRNP-Q) and SNHG5 (that hosts snoRNAs), both involved in regulating RNA maturation and translation. Combined silencing of both genes, but not of either gene alone, accelerated leukemogeneis in a Tal1/Lmo1/Notch1-driven mouse model, demonstrating the tumor-suppressive nature of the two-gene region. Proteomic and translational profiling of cells in which we engineered a short 6q deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing indicated decreased ribosome and mitochondrial activities, suggesting that the resulting metabolic changes may regulate tumor progression. Indeed, xenograft experiments showed an increased leukemia-initiating cell activity of primary human leukemic cells upon coextinction of SYNCRIP and SNHG5. Our findings not only elucidate the nature of 6q deletion but also highlight the role of ribosomes and mitochondria in T-ALL tumor progression. SIGNIFICANCE: The oncogenic role of 6q deletion in T-ALL has remained elusive since this chromosomal abnormality was first identified more than 40 years ago. We combined genomic analysis and functional models to show that the codeletion of two contiguous genes at 6q14 enhances malignancy through deregulation of a ribosome-mitochondria axis, suggesting the potential for therapeutic intervention.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1494.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-5657-4842', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8255-9091', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7575-2085', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7914-4319', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1113-4472']",,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"Aurora kinase A and B have essential and non-overlapping roles in mitosis, with elevated expression in a subset of human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, pan-aurora kinase inhibitor (AKI) AMG 900 distinguishes itself as an anti-leukemic agent that is more uniformly potent against a panel of AML cell lines than are isoform-selective AKIs and classic AML drugs. AMG 900 inhibited AML cell growth by inducing polyploidization and/or apoptosis. AMG 900 and aurora-B-selective inhibitor AZD1152-hQPA showed comparable cellular effects on AML lines that do not harbor a FLT3-ITD mutation. AMG 900 was active against P-glycoprotein-expressing AML cells resistant to AZD1152-hQPA and was effective at inducing expression of megakaryocyte-lineage markers (CD41, CD42) on human CHRF-288-11 cells and mouse Jak2 (V617F) cells. In MOLM-13 cells, inhibition of p-histone H3 by AMG 900 was associated with polyploidy, extra centrosomes, accumulation of p53 protein, apoptosis, and cleavage of Bcl-2 protein. Co-administration of cytarabine (Ara-C) with AMG 900 potentiated cell killing in a subset of AML lines, with evidence of attenuated polyploidization. AMG 900 inhibited the proliferation of primary human bone marrow cells in culture, with a better proliferation recovery profile relative to classic antimitotic drug docetaxel. In vivo, AMG 900 significantly reduced tumor burden in a systemic MOLM-13 xenograft model where we demonstrate the utility of 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine [(18)F]FLT positron emission tomographic (PET)-CT imaging to measure the antiproliferative effects of AMG 900 in skeletal tissues in mice.",,,,,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A key transcriptional factor for undifferentiated spermatogonia, Plzf, was proven as a direct target of miR-26b. When undifferentiated spermatogonia were treated with Retinoic acid (RA), miR-26b was increased, further promoting RA-induced differentiation of spermatogonia. In addition, miR-26b could repress 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) via repression of Tet3 in spermatogonia.

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"IgM plasma cell myeloma (PCM) is a rare subtype of myeloma, and its response to novel therapies has not been fully characterized. We describe clinicopathological features and outcome of 17 patients with IgM PCM (11 men and 6 women) with a median age of 63 years. Patients presented with serum hyperviscosity (77%), bone lesions (71%), anemia (65%), renal dysfunction (53%), and hypercalcemia (35%). Median serum IgM level was 6.4 g/dL (0.7-12.1 g/dL). Bone marrow plasma cells (median, 80%; range, 20%-90%) were frequently of lymphoplasmacytic type (8/17; 47%). Immunophenotypically, the myeloma cells were positive for CD38, CD138, CD20 (5/16; 31%), CD56 (4/16; 25%), and CD117 (2/12; 17%); negative for CD19; and decreased or absent CD27 and CD81 in all cases. Seven (41%) patients had a complex karyotype, and fluorescence in situ hybridization showed CCND1-IGH (13/16; 81%), and deletions of 17p13/TP53 (29%) and 13q14/RB1 (38%). No MYD88 L265P mutation was detected. Most patients (94%) received proteasome inhibitor with or without immunomodulatory drug, 62% of patients required multiple regimens because of refractory disease, and 11 (65%) of 17 patients underwent autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). The median OS was 67 months. After a median follow-up of 38 months (range, 3-106 months), only 5 patients achieved complete remission, 5 had persistent disease, and 7 died (2 progressed to plasma cell leukemia and 1 to blastic variant). In summary, IgM PCM is highly associated with t(11;14) and lymphoplasmacytic morphology. Patients are refractory to novel therapy and progression to high-risk myeloma is common, suggesting a need for alternative novel therapies.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Clinicopathological features', '*High-risk', '*IgM myeloma', '*Immunophenotype', '*MYD88 L265P mutation', '*Outcome', '*Plasma cell leukemia']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 Nov 8.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many cancer cells depend on anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins for their survival. Bcl-2 antagonism through Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) mimetics has emerged as a novel anti-cancer therapy. ABT-199 (Venetoclax), a recently developed BH3 mimetic that selectively inhibits Bcl-2, was introduced into the clinic for treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Early generations of Bcl-2 inhibitors evoked sustained Ca(2+) responses in pancreatic acinar cells (PACs) inducing cell death. Therefore, BH3 mimetics could potentially be toxic for the pancreas when used to treat cancer. Although ABT-199 was shown to kill Bcl-2-dependent cancer cells without affecting intracellular Ca(2+) signalling, its effects on PACs have not yet been determined. Hence, it is essential and timely to assess whether this recently approved anti-leukaemic drug might potentially have pancreatotoxic effects. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Single-cell Ca(2+) measurements and cell death analysis were performed on isolated mouse PACs. KEY RESULTS: Inhibition of Bcl-2 via ABT-199 did not elicit intracellular Ca(2+) signalling on its own or potentiate Ca(2+) signalling induced by physiological/pathophysiological stimuli in PACs. Although ABT-199 did not affect cell death in PACs, under conditions that killed ABT-199-sensitive cancer cells, cytosolic Ca(2+) extrusion was slightly enhanced in the presence of ABT-199. In contrast, inhibition of Bcl-xL potentiated pathophysiological Ca(2+) responses in PACs, without exacerbating cell death. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results demonstrate that apart from having a modest effect on cytosolic Ca(2+) extrusion, ABT-199 does not substantially alter intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in normal PACs and should be safe for the pancreas during cancer treatment.

Among the five SERINC genes found in humans, SERINC5 was shown to act as a powerful inhibitor of retroviruses. It is efficiently incorporated into virions and blocks the penetration of the viral core into target cells, by impairing the fusion process with a yet unclear mechanism. SERINC5 was also found to promote human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) virion neutralization by antibodies, indicating a pleiotropic activity, which remains mostly unexplored. Counteracting factors have emerged independently in at least three retrovirus lineages, underscoring their fundamental importance during retrovirus evolution. Nef and S2 of primate and equine lentiviruses, and glycoGag of gammaretroviruses, act similarly by targeting SERINC5 to endosomes and excluding it from virions. Here, we discuss the features that distinguish SERINC5 from other known restriction factors, delineating a yet unique class of antiviral inhibitors.",['NOTNLM'],"['*SERINC5', '*antiviral', '*neutralization', '*restriction factor', '*retrovirus', '*virus evolution']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 3.,"Optical nanoprobes, designed to emit or collect light in the close proximity of a sample, have been extensively used to sense and image at nanometer resolution. However, the available nanoprobes, constructed from artificial materials, are incompatible and invasive when interfacing with biological systems. In this work, we report a fully biocompatible nanoprobe for subwavelength probing of localized fluorescence from leukemia single-cells in human blood. The bioprobe is built on a tapered fiber tip apex by optical trapping of a yeast cell (1.4 mum radius) and a chain of Lactobacillus acidophilus cells (2 mum length and 200 nm radius), which act as a high-aspect-ratio nanospear. Light propagating along the bionanospear can be focused into a spot with a full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 190 nm on the surface of single cells. Fluorescence signals are detected in real time at subwavelength spatial resolution. These noninvasive and biocompatible optical probes will find applications in imaging and manipulation of biospecimens.",['NOTNLM'],"['*near field', '*optical probe', '*optical trapping', '*single cells', '*subwavelength']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8436-1342', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7939-5302', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1411-5648', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6605-500X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 28.,"PROBLEM: Cytokines, mediators of the immune response, are involved in the regulation of female reproductive processes during the estrous cycle and pregnancy. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of selected peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands on the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and selected cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, -4, -6, -8, -10, and the leukemia inhibitory factor, in the porcine endometrium on days 10-12 and 14-16 of the estrous cycle (mid- and late luteal phase, respectively) or pregnancy (maternal recognition of pregnancy and beginning of implantation, respectively). METHOD OF STUDY: Endometrial slices were incubated in vitro in the presence of PPARgamma agonists, 15-deoxy-Delta12, 14-prostaglandin J2 or rosiglitazone, and PPARgamma antagonist T0070907. mRNA and protein levels in tissues were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: On days 10-12 of the estrous cycle and days 14-16 of pregnancy, PPARgamma ligands enhanced the expression of NF-kappaB, mRNA cytokines, and/or proteins. During the late luteal phase of the estrous cycle (days 14-16) and maternal recognition of pregnancy (days 10-12), PPARgamma ligands inhibited the expression of NF-kappaB, and they differentially affected the expression of mRNA and proteins of cytokines. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that PPARgamma is engaged in the endometrial synthesis of NF-kappaB and selected cytokines in pigs. The influence of PPARgamma ligands on the tested components of the immune system varied subject to the physiological status of females, and it could be associated with differences in endometrial receptivity.",['NOTNLM'],"['*PPARgamma', '*cytokines', '*endometrium', '*estrous cycle', '*pig', '*pregnancy']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3054-0123'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"INTRODUCTION: The translocation t(8;21) is one of the most frequent chromosome translocations in AML. Molecular (cyto)genetics is regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis. However, due to the complicated variety of AML-related genetic abnormalities, comprehensive screening for all of these abnormalities may not be cost-effective. Therefore, a flow cytometric (FC) scoring system was generated in this study for rapid screening and diagnosis of t(8;21)AML. METHODS: The immunophenotypic characteristics of leukemic cells and neutrophils in cases with t(8;21) AML or other subtypes of AML were analyzed to find a method for the flow diagnosis of t(8;21) AML. RESULTS: In this study, we picked six FC features pointing to the diagnosis of t(8;21) AML: The blasts show high-intensity expression of CD34; aberrant expression of CD19, cCD79a, and CD56 in myeloblasts; co-expression of CD56 in neutrophils, especially in immature neutrophils; and a maturity disturbance in granulocytes. A six-point score was devised using these features. By ROC analysis, the AUC was 0.952, and the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 0.86, 0.90. 0.91, and 0.84 when the score was >/=3 points. The score was then prospectively validated on an independent cohort, and the AUC of the ROC curve for the validation cohort was 0.975.

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"INTRODUCTION: Venetoclax, a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have received at least one prior therapy. This study evaluated the effect of azithromycin, a commonly used antibiotic in cancer patients and a P-gp inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax. METHODS: In this single-center, open-label, nonfasting, two-period study, 12 healthy female subjects received a single 100 mg dose of venetoclax on day 1 of period 1 and day 3 of period 2. Subjects received azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg once daily on days 2 through 5. Serial blood samples for the determination of venetoclax concentrations were collected after dosing in both periods. Safety was evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: Following coadministration of venetoclax with multiple doses of azithromycin, venetoclax maximum concentration and area under the curve to infinite time were 25% and 35% lower, respectively, compared to venetoclax administered alone. Venetoclax half-life and time to maximum concentration remained relatively unchanged when administered with azithromycin. Venetoclax was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. CONCLUSIONS: The modest changes in venetoclax exposures when given with azithromycin indicate that no dose adjustment would be needed when venetoclax is coadministered with azithromycin or other drugs with P-gp inhibitory potential. Azithromycin represents an alternative to other antimicrobial agents with higher potential to alter venetoclax pharmacokinetics such as clarithromycin, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin.

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Accurate risk assessment to determine the eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL) is necessary to improve survival outcomes. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score predicts prognosis in several tumors; however, the prognostic significance of the CONUT score in ATL remains unclear. The present study investigated the correlation between the CONUT score and the survival outcomes of transplant-eligible ATL patients. Mogamulizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against C-C chemokine receptor 4, was recently identified as a promising salvage chemotherapy agent for transplant-ineligible ATL patients. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of mogamulizumab in transplant-ineligible ATL patients. Patients diagnosed with aggressive ATL (acute lymphoma of unfavorable chronic type) between January 2008 and March 2017 at Saga University Hospital, Japan, were retrospectively enrolled. Of 54 patients, 25 were < 70 years of age and 14 received allo-HCT. The median overall survival (OS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate at 1 year among patients receiving allo-HCT were 1685.5 days and 30% in those with a CONUT score 0-3 (n = 10) and 184.5 days and 100% in those with a score >/= 4 (n = 4) (p = 0.017, OS; p = 0.064, NRM). Older patients who received mogamulizumab had a significantly longer OS (n = 12, median 432 days) than those who did not receive mogamulizumab (n = 17, median 199 days) (p = 0.018). The CONUT score was identified as a prognostic tool for transplant-eligible ATL patients, and mogamulizumab improved OS in transplant-ineligible ATL patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Allogenic stem cell transplantation', 'Mogamulizumab', 'The controlling nutritional status score', 'Transplant-eligibility']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5034-3699'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike the phosphorylation of STAT3, little is known about the acetylation of STAT3 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. Because acetylation activates STAT3 transcription, we sought to study the acetylation status of STAT3 in CLL cells. Using Western immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry we found that, apart from its constitutive serine phosphorylation, STAT3 is constitutively acetylated on lysine 685 residues. Because the acetyltransferase p300 was found to acetylate STAT3 on lysine 685 residues, we wondered whether p300 acetylates STAT3 in CLL cells. Using Western immunoblotting we detected high levels of p300 protein in CLL but not normal B cells. Transfection of CLL cells with p300 small-interfering (si) RNA downregulated p300 transcripts as well as p300 and acetyl-STAT3 protein levels. In addition, p300 siRNA attenuated STAT3-DNA binding and downregulated mRNA levels of STAT3-regulated genes. Furthermore, transfection of CLL cells with p300-siRNA induced a 3-fold increase in the rate of spontaneous apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that in CLL cells STAT3 p300 induces constitutive acetylation and activation of STAT3. Whether inhibition of STAT3 acetylation might provide clinical benefit in patients with CLL remains to be determined.",['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'STAT3', 'acetylation']",,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST All authors report no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, only 20-30% Oesophageal Adenocarinoma (OAC) patients show a beneficial response to neoadjuvant therapy (neoCT). Inflammation influences OAC given the increased risk of cancer development and poor outcome for obese patients where altered secretion of adipokines and cytokines from adipose tissue contributes a pro-tumourigenic environment. We carried out a large proteomics screen of 184 proteins to compare the inflammatory and oncogenic profiles of an isogenic radioresistant in-vitro model of OAC. We found that leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 type cytokine, was significantly elevated in radioresistant OAC cells (p=0.007). Furthermore, significantly higher circulating levels of LIF were present in the serum from treatment-naive OAC patients who had a subsequent poor pathological response to neo-adjuvant therapy, (p=0.037). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed expression of LIF receptor (LIFR) may function as a predictive indicator of response to neo-adjuvant chemoradiation therapy in OAC. LIF was demonstrated to be actively secreted from human OAC treatment-naive biopsies and significantly correlated with the secretion of bFGF, VEGF-A and IL-8 (p<0.05, R=1), (p<0.05, R=0.9429), and (p<0.05, R=1) respectively. Importantly, LIF secretion negatively correlated with tumour infiltrating lymphocytes in pre-treatment OAC patient biopsies, (r=-0.8783, p=0.033). Elevated circulating LIF is a marker of poor response to neo-adjuvant treatment in OAC and secretion of this chemokine from the tumour is tightly linked with pro-tumourigenic mediators including bFGF, VEGF-A and IL-8. Targeting this pathway may be a novel mechanism enhance neoadjuvant treatment responses in OAC.",['NOTNLM'],"['LIF', 'LIFR', 'oesophageal cancer', 'radiation', 'treatment resistance']",,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumour cells commonly achieve MDR phenotype through overexpression and/or increased activity of ABC transporters. P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp, ABCB1) is a major cause of MDR and therefore represents a valuable target for MDR reversal. Several naturally occurring potassium ionophores (e.g. salinomycin) were shown to inhibit P-gp effectively. We have previously shown antitumour activity of a number of 18-crown-6 ether compounds that transport potassium ions across membranes. Here we present data on P-gp inhibitory activity of 16 adamantane-substituted monoaza- and diaza-18-crown-6 ether compounds, and their effect on MDR reversal in model cell lines. We show that crown ether activity depends on their lipophilicity as well as on the linker to adamantane moiety. The most active crown ethers were shown to be more effective in sensitising MDR cells to paclitaxel and adriamycin than verapamil, a well-known P-gp inhibitor. Altogether our data demonstrate a novel use of crown ethers for inhibition of P-gp and reversal of MDR phenotype.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By performing whole exome sequencing, we present the genetic landscape of primary tumors from TCL1 mice and of TCL1 tumors serially transplanted into wild-type recipients to mimic clonal evolution. We show that similar to CLL patients, mutations in mice are frequently subclonal and heterogenous among different primary TCL1 mice. We further describe that this molecular heterogeneity mirrors heterogenous disease characteristics such as organ infiltration or CLL dependent T cell skewing. Similar to human CLL, we further observed the occurrence of novel mutations and structural variations during clonal evolution and found plasticity in the expansion of B cell receptor specific subclones. Thus, our results uncover that the genetic complexity, pathway dependence and clonal dynamics in mouse CLL are in relevant agreement to human CLL, and they are important to consider in future research using the TCL1 mouse for studying CLL.",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5676-7604', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0648-4416']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

cancer therapy is followed by a resurgence of more aggressive tumors derived from immature cells. One example is acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where an accumulation of immature cells is responsible for relapse following treatment. We previously demonstrated in chronic myeloid leukemia that the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) pathway is involved in stem cell fate and contributes to transformation, expansion, and persistence of leukemic stem cells. Here, we have identified intrinsic and extrinsic dysregulations of the BMP pathway in AML patients at diagnosis. BMP2 and BMP4 protein concentrations are elevated within patients' bone marrow with a BMP4-dominant availability. This overproduction likely depends on the bone marrow microenvironment, since MNCs do not overexpress BMP4 transcripts. Intrinsically, the receptor BMPR1A transcript is increased in leukemic samples with more cells presenting this receptor at the membrane. This high expression of BMPR1A is further increased upon BMP4 exposure, specifically in AML cells. Downstream analysis demonstrated that BMP4 controls the expression of the survival factor DeltaNp73 through its binding to BMPR1A. At the functional level, this results in the direct induction of NANOG expression and an increase of stem-like features in leukemic cells, as shown by ALDH and functional assays. In addition, we identified for the first time a strong correlation between DeltaNp73, BMPR1A and NANOG expression with patient outcome. These results highlight a new signaling cascade initiated by tumor environment alterations leading to stem-cell features and poor patients' outcome.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7320-4256'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They serve as critical cell signaling molecules that regulate the activity of various enzymes including tyrosine phosphatases. ROS can induce inactivation of tyrosine phosphatases, which counteract the effects of tyrosine kinases. ROS increase phosphorylation of many proteins including signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT5) via Janus kinases (JAKs). STAT5 is aberrantly activated through phosphorylation in many types of cancer and this constitutive activation is associated with cell survival, proliferation, and self-renewal. Such leukemic activation of STAT5 is rarely caused by mutation of the STAT5 gene itself but instead by overactive mutant receptors with tyrosine kinase activity as well as JAK, SRC family protein tyrosine kinases (SFKs), and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ABL) kinases. Interestingly, STAT5 suppresses transcription of several genes encoding antioxidant enzymes while simultaneously enhancing transcription of NADPH oxidase. By doing so, STAT5 activation promotes an overall elevation of ROS level, which acts as a feed-forward loop, especially in high risk Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutant leukemia. Therefore, efforts have been made recently to target ROS in cancer cells. Drugs that are able to either quench ROS production or inversely augment ROS-related signaling pathways both have potential as cancer therapies and may afford some selectivity by activating feedback inhibition of the ROS-STAT5 kinome. This review summarizes the cooperative relationship between ROS and STAT5 and explores the pros and cons of emerging ROS-targeting therapies that are selective for leukemia characterized by persistent STAT5 phosphorylation.",['NOTNLM'],"['STAT5', 'leukemogenesis', 'molecular targeted drug therapy', 'reactive oxygen species', 'signal transducer and activator of transcription']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite excellent efficacy, a significant number of patients on IM therapy develop resistance to IM. Currently, great focus has been laid on the effect of interindividual pharmacogenetic variability on IM treatment responses. IM uptake is mediated by the hOCT1 protein encoded by the solute carrier 22 gene (SLC22A1). The current study investigated the impact of few single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of SLC22A1 on mediating resistance and/or good response to IM among 278 Malaysian CML patients (146 IM-resistant group and 132 IM good response group) undergoing IM therapy on 400 mg daily. Our results showed that the allelic frequencies of heterozygous (CG) and homozygous variant (GG) genotypes of SLC22A1 C480G were significantly higher in the IM-resistant group compared with the IM good response group (41.8% versus 30.3% and 10.9% versus 4.5% with P values of 0.047 and 0.048, respectively). On evaluating the association of genotypes with risk of IM resistance development, heterozygous (CG) and homozygous (GG) variant genotypes showed significantly higher risk for developing resistance to IM treatment with odds ratio (OR): 1.901 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.142-3.163, P = 0.013) and 3.324 (95% CI: 1.235-8.947, P = 0.017), respectively. Two SNPs and two insertions/deletions were detected in exon 7 of SLC22A1. For exon 7, 1222AA carriers together with the presence of both the 8-bp insertion and 3-bp deletion, and M420del alleles showed higher possibility of developing resistance towards IMtreatment. Our results warrant the need of genotyping this SNP in terms of modulating IM treatment in CML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outcomes improve with matching at HLAs, but other factors are required to explain residual risk of GVHD. In an effort to identify genetic associations outside the major histocompatibility complex, we conducted a genome-wide clinical outcomes study on 205 acute myeloid leukemia patients and their fully HLA-A-, HLA-B-, HLA-C-, HLA-DRB1-, and HLA-DQB1-matched (10/10) unrelated donors. HLA-DPB1 T-cell epitope permissibility mismatches were observed in less than half (45%) of acute GVHD cases, motivating a broader search for genetic factors affecting clinical outcomes. A novel bioinformatics workflow adapted from neoantigen discovery found no associations between acute GVHD and known, HLA-restricted minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs). These results were confirmed with microarray data from an additional 988 samples. On the other hand, Y-chromosome-encoded single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 4 genes (PCDH11Y, USP9Y, UTY, and NLGN4Y) did associate with acute GVHD in male patients with female donors. Males in this category with acute GVHD had more Y-encoded variant peptides per patient with higher predicted HLA-binding affinity than males without GVHD who matched X-paralogous alleles in their female donors. Methods and results described here have an immediate impact for allo-HCT, warranting further development and larger genomic studies where MiHAs are clinically relevant, including cancer immunotherapy, solid organ transplant, and pregnancy.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3093-2274', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4384-3804', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0198-2064']",,,,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Background: Adolescents and young adults (AYA: 15-39 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have inferior survival when compared with children (1-14 years). An approach is lacking that includes both patients enrolled and not enrolled in clinical trials, and includes the contribution of health care delivery, treatment, and clinical prognosticators.Methods: We assembled a retrospective cohort of ALL patients diagnosed between 1-39 years (AYA: n = 93; child: n = 91) and treated at a single institution between 1990 and 2010, irrespective of clinical trial enrollment. We modeled relapse risk (i) during therapy and (ii) after completing therapy.Results: On-therapy relapse: AYA experienced an increased risk of on-therapy relapse versus children (HR, 10.5; P = 0.004). In multivariable analysis restricted to AYA, independent predictors of relapse included lack of clinical trial enrollment (HR, 2.6, P = 0.04) and nonwhite race/ethnicity (HR, 2.2; P = 0.05). Relapse after completing therapy: When compared with children, AYA experienced an increased risk of relapse after completing therapy (HR, 7.7; P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis restricted to AYA, longer therapy (months of maintenance: HR, 0.7; P < 0.001; months of consolidation: HR, 0.8; P = 0.03) protected against relapse.Conclusions: Among AYA, aspects of health care delivery (clinical trial enrollment, nonwhite race/ethnicity) are associated with relapse during therapy, and aspects of treatment (shorter duration of maintenance and consolidation) are associated with relapse after completing therapy.Impact: These findings highlight the importance of clinical trial enrollment and therapy duration (maintenance, consolidation) in ensuring durable remissions in AYA ALL.

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Thromboembolism is a serious complication of induction therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic interventions in the consecutive leukemia trials ALL-BFM 2000 and AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009. Patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=949, age 1 to 18 years) were randomized to receive low-dose unfractionated heparin, prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) or activity-adapted antithrombin throughout induction therapy. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether enoxaparin or antithrombin reduces the incidence of thromboembolism as compared to unfractionated heparin. The principal safety outcome was hemorrhage; leukemia outcome was a secondary endpoint. Thromboembolism occurred in 42 patients (4.4%). Patients assigned to unfractionated heparin had a higher risk of thromboembolism (8.0%) compared with those randomized to enoxaparin (3.5%; P=0.011) or antithrombin (1.9%; P<0.001). The proportion of patients who refused antithrombotic treatment as allocated was 3% in the unfractionated heparin or antithrombin arms, and 33% in the enoxaparin arm. Major hemorrhage occurred in eight patients (no differences between the groups). The 5-year event-free survival was 80.9+/-2.2% among patients assigned to antithrombin compared to 85.9+/-2.0% in the unfractionated heparin group (P=0.06), and 86.2+/-2.0% in the enoxaparin group (P=0.10). In conclusion, prophylactic use of antithrombin or enoxaparin significantly reduced thromboembolism. Despite the considerable number of patients rejecting the assigned treatment with subcutaneous injections, the result remains unambiguous. Thromboprophylaxis - for the present time primarily with enoxaparin - can be recommended for children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during induction therapy. Whether and how antithrombin may affect leukemia outcome remains to be determined.",,,,,['Haematologica. 2019 Apr;104(4):644-645.

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Mutations in genes of the RAS-BRAF-MAPK-ERK pathway have not been fully explored in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We, therefore, analyzed the clinical and biological characteristics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with mutations in this pathway and investigated the in vitro response of primary cells to BRAF and ERK inhibitors. Putative damaging mutations were found in 25 of 452 patients (5.5%). Among these, BRAF was mutated in nine patients (2.0%), genes upstream of BRAF (KITLG, KIT, PTPN11, GNB1, KRAS and NRAS) were mutated in 12 patients (2.6%), and genes downstream of BRAF (MAPK2K1, MAPK2K2, and MAPK1) were mutated in five patients (1.1%). The most frequent mutations were missense, subclonal and mutually exclusive. Patients with these mutations more frequently had increased lactate dehydrogenase levels, high expression of ZAP-70, CD49d, CD38, trisomy 12 and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region genes and had a worse 5-year time to first treatment (hazard ratio 1.8, P=0.025). Gene expression analysis showed upregulation of genes of the MAPK pathway in the group carrying RAS-BRAF-MAPK-ERK pathway mutations. The BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib were not able to inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, the downstream effector of the pathway, in primary cells. In contrast, ulixertinib, a pan-ERK inhibitor, decreased phospho-ERK levels. In conclusion, although larger series of patients are needed to corroborate these findings, our results suggest that the RAS-BRAF-MAPK-ERK pathway is one of the core cellular processes affected by novel mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, is associated with adverse clinical features and could be pharmacologically inhibited.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with differential somatic hypermutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable genes, namely mutated or unmutated, display fundamental clinico-biological differences. Considering this, we assessed prognosis separately within mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated (U-CLL) CLL in 3015 patients, hypothesizing that the relative significance of relevant indicators may differ between these two categories. Within Binet A M-CLL patients, besides TP53 abnormalities, trisomy 12 and stereotyped subset #2 membership were equivalently associated with the shortest time-to-first-treatment and a treatment probability at five and ten years after diagnosis of 40% and 55%, respectively; the remaining cases exhibited 5-year and 10-year treatment probability of 12% and 25%, respectively. Within Binet A U-CLL patients, besides TP53 abnormalities, del(11q) and/or SF3B1 mutations were associated with the shortest time-to-first-treatment (5- and 10-year treatment probability: 78% and 98%, respectively); in the remaining cases, males had a significantly worse prognosis than females. In conclusion, the relative weight of indicators that can accurately risk stratify early-stage CLL patients differs depending on the somatic hypermutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable genes of each patient. This finding highlights the fact that compartmentalized approaches based on immunogenetic features are necessary to refine and tailor prognostication in CLL.",,,,,,,,['European Research Initiative on CLL (ERIC)'],['Copyright (c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"B-cell precursor-acute lymphoblastic leukemia modulates the bone marrow (BM) niche to become leukemia-supporting and chemo-protective by reprogramming the stromal microenvironment. New therapies targeting the interplay between leukemia and stroma can help improve disease outcome. We identified ActivinA, a TGF-beta family member with a well-described role in promoting several solid malignancies, as a factor favoring leukemia that could represent a new potential target for therapy. ActivinA resulted over-expressed in the leukemic BM and its production was strongly induced in mesenchymal stromal cells after culture with leukemic cells. Moreover, MSCs isolated from BM of leukemic patients showed an intrinsic ability to secrete higher amounts of ActivinA compared to their normal counterparts. The pro-inflammatory leukemic BM microenvironment synergized with leukemic cells to induce stromal-derived ActivinA. Gene expression analysis of ActivinA-treated leukemic cells showed that this protein was able to significantly influence motility-associated pathways. Interestingly, ActivinA promoted random motility and CXCL12-driven migration of leukemic cells, even at suboptimal chemokine concentrations, characterizing the leukemic niche. Conversely, ActivinA severely impaired CXCL12-induced migration of healthy CD34(+) cells. This opposite effect can be explained by the ability of ActivinA to increase intracellular calcium only in leukemic cells, boosting cytoskeleton dynamics through a higher rate of actin polymerization. Moreover, by stimulating the invasiveness of the leukemic cells, ActivinA was found to be a leukemia-promoting factor. Importantly, the ability of ActivinA to enhance BM engraftment and the metastatic potential of leukemic cells was confirmed in a xenograft mouse model of the disease. Overall, ActivinA was seen to be a key factor in conferring a migratory advantage to leukemic cells over healthy hematopoiesis within the leukemic niche.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Hematopoietic stem cells constitute a unique subpopulation of blood cells that can give rise to all types of mature cells in response to physiological demands. However, the intrinsic molecular machinery that regulates this transformative property remains elusive. In this paper, we demonstrate that small GTPase Rheb1 is a critical regulator of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells in vivo Rheb1 deletion led to increased phenotypic hematopoietic stem cell/hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation under a steady state condition. Over-proliferating Rheb1-deficient hematopoietic stem cells were severely impaired in functional repopulation assays, and they failed to regenerate the blood system when challenged with hematopoietic ablation by sublethal irradiation. In addition, it was discovered that Rheb1 loss resulted in a lack of maturation of neutrophils / caused neutrophil immaturation by reducing mTORC1 activity, and that activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway by mTOR activator 3BDO partially restored the maturation of Rheb1-deficient neutrophils. Rheb1 deficiency led to a progressive enlargement of the hematopoietic stem cell population and an eventual excessive myeloproliferation in vivo, including an overproduction of peripheral neutrophils and an excessive expansion of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Moreover, low RHEB expression was correlated with poor survival in acute myeloid leukemia patients with normal karyotype. Our results, therefore, demonstrate a critical and unique role for Rheb1 in maintaining proper hematopoiesis and myeloid differentiation.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Dasatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but its efficacy is limited by resistance. Recent preclinical studies suggest that dasatinib may be a candidate therapy in additional ALL subtypes including pre-BCR(+) ALL. Here we utilized shRNA library screening and global transcriptomic analysis to identify several novel genes and pathways that may enhance dasatinib efficacy or mitigate potential resistance in human pre-BCR(+) ALL. Depletion of the transcriptional coactivator CBP increased dasatinib sensitivity by downregulating transcription of the pre-BCR signaling pathway previously associated with dasatinib sensitivity. Acquired resistance was due, in part, to upregulation of alternative pathways including WNT through a mechanism, suggesting transcriptional plasticity. Small molecules that disrupt CBP interactions with the CREB KID domain or beta-catenin showed promising preclinical efficacy in combination with dasatinib. These findings highlight novel modulators of sensitivity to targeted therapies in human pre-BCR(+) ALL, which can be reversed by small-molecule inhibitors. They also identify promising therapeutic approaches to ameliorate dasatinib sensitivity and prevent resistance in ALL.Significance: These findings reveal mechanisms that modulate sensitivity to dasatinib and suggest therapeutic strategies to improve the outcome of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/22/6497/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(22); 6497-508.

Although some very well validated scores delineate the risk of VTE by cancer subtype and other risk factors, hematologic malignancies are underrepresented in these models. This subgroup represents a unique entity that undergoes therapy that can be thrombogenic. The overall risk of VTE in patients with leukemia depends on the use of L-asparaginase treatment, older age, comorbidities and central venous catheters. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are at particularly high risk of VTE but also have an increased risk of bleeding. Patients with aggressive lymphomas have a high incidence of VTE, roughly 10%. Patients with multiple myeloma at highest risk of VTE are those receiving immunomodulatory agents such as thalidomide or lenalidomide. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation carries a risk of thrombosis, particularly in patients developing graft versus host disease. This review summarizes the incidence of VTE in leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma and stem cell transplantation and provides practical guidance for preventing and managing VTE in patients with hematologic malignancies.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Deep vein thrombosis', '*Hematologic neoplasms', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma', '*Myeloma', '*Pulmonary embolism', '*Transplantation', '*Venous thrombosis']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

We recently overexpressed erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) in rat central glia-4 (CG4) oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to study the mechanisms mediating the pro-myelinating effects of erythropoietin (EPO). In this study, we investigated the effect of co-treatment with EPO and LIF. METHODS: Gene expression in undifferentiated and differentiating CG4 cells in response to EPO and LIF was analysed by DNA microarrays and by RT-qPCR. Experiments were performed in biological replicates of N >/= 4. Functional annotation and biological term enrichment was performed using DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery). The gene-gene interaction network was visualised using STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes). RESULTS: In CG4 cells treated with 10 ng/ml of EPO and 10 ng/ml of LIF, EPO-induced myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) expression, measured at day 3 of differentiation, was inhibited >/=4-fold (N = 5, P < 0.001). Inhibition of EPO-induced MOG was also observed with OSM and CNTF. Analysis of the gene expression profile of CG4 differentiating cells treated for 20 h with EPO and LIF revealed LIF inhibition of EPO-induced genes involved in lipid transport and metabolism, previously identified as positive regulators of myelination in this system. In addition, among the genes induced by LIF, and not by differentiation or by EPO, the role of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) as negative regulators of myelination was further explored. LIF-induced SOCS3 was associated with MOG inhibition; Pam3, an agonist of TLR2, inhibited EPO-induced MOG expression, suggesting that TLR2 is functional and its activation decreases myelination. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokines of the gp130 family may have negative effects on myelination, depending on the cytokine environment.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Central glia-4', '*Multiple sclerosis', '*Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein', '*SOCS3', '*TLR2']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0911-8358'],,,['Mol Med. 2020 Jun 25;26(1):62.

We deployed deep convolutional neural network for automated detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and classification of its subtypes into 4 classes, that is, L1, L2, L3, and Normal which were mostly neglected in previous literature. In contrary to the training from scratch, we deployed pretrained AlexNet which was fine-tuned on our data set. Last layers of the pretrained network were replaced with new layers which can classify the input images into 4 classes. To reduce overtraining, data augmentation technique was used. We also compared the data sets with different color models to check the performance over different color images. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia detection, we achieved a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 98.11%, and accuracy of 99.50%; and for acute lymphoblastic leukemia subtype classification the sensitivity was 96.74%, specificity was 99.03%, and accuracy was 96.06%.

In this study, we generated anti-CD19 single-chain variable fragments (scFv) from immunized chickens by phage display technology. After constructing a scFv antibody library with 2.5 x 10(8) compositional diversity for panning, one representative scFv clone S2 which can specifically recognize to the CD19 protein was isolated and characterized. The binding reactivity of the scFv S2 to the endogenous CD19 protein of the ARH-77 leukemia cancer cell was verified through flow cytometry and the binding affinity of scFv S2 is 6.9 x 10(-8) M determined by the surface plasmon resonance system. Compared with the chicken germline, hyper mutation in the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) suggested that scFv S2 could be generated through an antigen-driven humoral response. By molecular modeling, the possible CDR configurations of scFv S2 were constructed rationally. Furthermore, the characteristics of chicken antibodies of a protein database were investigated. The findings in this study contribute to antibody development and engineering because they reveal the geometric structures and properties of the CDRs in chicken antibodies.",['NOTNLM'],"['Human cluster of differentiation 19', 'leukemia', 'molecular modeling', 'phage display technology', 'single chain variable fragment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood cancer caused by pathological kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein, currently treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as Imatinib (IM). However, resistance to TKIs persists in a number of patients and HO-1 overexpression has been linked with the induction of chemoresistance in CML. With this in mind, in this study, we designed and synthesized the first series of hybrid compounds obtained by combining the structures of IM, as BCR-ABL inhibitor, with imidazole-based HO-1 inhibitors.

Epub 2018 Sep 24.,"After initially successful chemotherapy, relapse frequently jeopardizes the outcome of patients with acute leukemia. Because of their adverse characteristics of self-renewal and dormancy, leukemia stem cells have been hypothesized to play a critical role in resistance to antiproliferative chemotherapy and the development of relapse. The high abundance of stem-like cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however, suggests that not all leukemia-initiating cells carry these adverse characteristics, complicating the biological characterization of relapse-inducing cells in this malignancy. Here, we review sources of therapy resistance and relapse in acute leukemias, which include tumor cell plasticity and reversible characteristics. We discuss the development of patient-derived mouse models that are genetically engineered to mimic long-term dormancy and minimal residual disease in patients. These models allow the tracking and functional characterization of patient-derived ALL blasts that combine the properties of long-term dormancy, treatment resistance, and stemness. Finally, we discuss possible therapeutic avenues to target the functional plasticity of leukemia-initiating cells in ALL.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) progression and chemotherapy insensitivity have been associated with aberrant PI3K/mTOR/MEK signalling. However, cell death responses activated by inhibitors of these pathways can differ - contextually varying with tumour genetic background. Here, we demonstrate that combining the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PF5212384 (PF384) and MEK inhibitor PD325901 (PD901) more effectively induces apoptosis compared with either agent alone, independent of KRAS mutational status in PDAC cell lines. Additionally, a non-caspase dependent decrease in cell viability upon PF384 treatment was observed, and may be attributed to autophagy and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Using reverse phase protein arrays, we identify key molecular events associated with the conversion of cytostatic responses (elicited by single inhibitor treatments) into a complete cell death response when PF384 and PD901 are combined. This response was also independent of KRAS mutation, occurring in both BxPC3 (KRAS wildtype) and MIA-PaCa-2 (KRAS(G12C) mutated) cells. In both cell lines, Bim expression increased in response to PF384/PD901 treatment (by 60% and 48%, respectively), while siRNA-mediated silencing of Bim attenuated the apoptosis induced by combination treatment. In parallel, Mcl-1 levels decreased by 36% in BxPC3, and 30% in MIA-PaCa-2 cells. This is consistent with a functional role for Mcl-1, and siRNA-mediated silencing enhanced apoptosis in PF384/PD901-treated MIA-PaCa-2 cells, whilst Mcl-1 overexpression decreased apoptosis induction by 24%. Moreover, a novel role was identified for PDCD4 loss in driving the apoptotic response to PF384/PD901 in BxPC3 and MIA-PaCa-2 cell lines. Overall, our data indicates PF384/PD901 co-treatment activates the same apoptotic mechanism in wild-type or KRAS mutant PDAC cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bim', '*MEK', '*Mcl-1', '*PDCD4', '*PI3K', '*combination chemotherapy', '*mTOR', '*pancreatic cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the roles of BCL2 proteins in the induction of apoptosis in cells upon infection with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus and Zika virus. We showed that survival of the infected cells depends on BCLXL, a pro-survival BCL2 protein due to suppression of the expression of another pro-survival protein, MCL1. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors, as well as deficient BCLXL gene expression, induced BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviviruses. Flavivirus infection attenuates cellular protein synthesis, which confers reduction of short-half-life proteins like MCL1. Inhibition of BCLXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, thereby suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. Furthermore, we examined the roles of BCLXL in the death of JEV-infected cells during in vivo infection. Haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene, as well as administration of BH3 mimetic compounds, increased survival rate after challenge of JEV infection and suppressed inflammation. These results suggest that BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, and that BCLXL may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress propagation of the family of Flaviviridae viruses.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9859-6217', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7860-6916', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5458-7298', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3101-4873', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9091-8285']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, salvage of this zone is a major subject of focus in burn research. The beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the survival of the zone of stasis have been previously documented. However, many gaps still exist in our knowledge regarding the underlying protective mechanisms. Hence, this study was designed to evaluate the pathophysiological basis of MSCs in the prevention of burn wound progression. METHODS: Wistar rats received thermal trauma on the back according to the ""comb burn"" model. Animals were randomly divided into sham, control, and stem cell groups with sacrifice and analysis at 72 hours after the burn. The stasis zones were evaluated using histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction assay, and scintigraphy to evaluate the underlying mechanisms. RESULTS: Gross evaluation of burn wounds revealed that vital tissue percentage of the zone of stasis was significantly higher in the stem cell group. Semiquantitative grading of the histopathologic findings showed that MSCs alleviated burn-induced histomorphological alterations in the zone of stasis. According to CC3a staining and expression analysis of Bax (B-cell leukemia 2-associated X) and Bcl-2 (B-cell leukemia 2) genes, MSCs attenuated increases in apoptosis postburn. In addition, these transplants showed an immunomodulatory effect that involves reduced neutrophilic infiltration, down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta [IL-1beta], and IL-6), and up-regulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the zone of stasis. Burn-induced oxidative stress was significantly relieved with MSCs, as shown by increased levels of malondialdehyde, whereas the expression and activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase were increased. Finally, MSC-treated interspaces had enhanced vascular density with higher expression levels for vascular endothelial growth factor A, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor beta. Gamma camera images documented better tissue perfusion in animals treated with MSCs. CONCLUSIONS: The protective effects of MSCs are mediated by the inhibition of apoptosis through immunomodulatory, antioxidative, and angiogenic actions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"PURPOSE: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in elderly patients has a poor prognosis. In an attempt to improve outcome for these patients, the prospective open-label phase III LAM-SA 2007 (Adding Lomustine to Chemotherapy in Older Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and Allogeneic Transplantation for Patients From 60 to 65 Years Old) trial randomly assigned patients to a standard induction regimen with lomustine added or to a consolidation regimen with cytarabine and idarubicin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults age 60 years or older with previously untreated AML who were fit to receive intensive chemotherapy and who were without unfavorable cytogenetics received standard chemotherapy with lomustine (idarubicin, cytarabine, and lomustine [ICL]) or without (idarubicin and cytarabine [IC]). The primary objective of the study was overall survival (OS); secondary objectives were response rate, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), event-free survival (EFS), and safety. RESULTS: From February 2008 to December 2011, 459 patients were enrolled. Comparing patients in the IC and ICL arms, complete response or complete response with incomplete recovery was achieved in 74.9% versus 84.7% (P = .01). The proportional hazards assumption was rejected for OS (P = .02), which led us to consider two separate time intervals: during and after induction. There was no significant difference between the two arms during induction, although induction deaths were 3.7% versus 7.7%, respectively (P = .11). However, significantly better results were observed after induction with an improved 2-year OS of 56% in the ICL arm versus 48% in the IC arm (P = .02). At 2 years, EFS was improved at 41% in the ICL arm versus 26% in the IC arm (P = .01). The CIR at 2 years was 41.2% in the ICL arm versus 60.9% in the IC arm (P = .003).

Epub 2018 Sep 27.,"DNA lesions induce recruitment and accumulation of various repair factors, resulting in formation of discrete nuclear foci. Using superresolution fluorescence microscopy as well as live cell and quantitative imaging, we demonstrate that X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 (XRCC1), a key factor in single-strand break and base excision repair, is recruited into nuclear bodies formed in response to replication-related single-strand breaks. Intriguingly, these bodies are assembled immediately in the vicinity of these breaks and never fully colocalize with replication foci. They are structurally organized, containing canonical promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear body protein SP100 concentrated in a peripheral layer, and XRCC1 in the center. They also contain other factors, including PML, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), ligase IIIalpha, and origin recognition complex subunit 5. The breast cancer 1 and -2 C terminus domains of XRCC1 are essential for formation of these repair foci. These results reveal that XRCC1-contaning foci constitute newly recognized PML-like nuclear bodies that accrete and locally deliver essential factors for repair of single-strand DNA breaks in replication regions.-Kordon, M.

Notably, PLK1 was expressed at high levels in DHL, correlated with MYC expression, and connoted poor outcome. Further, PLK1 signaling augmented MYC protein stability, and in turn, MYC directly induced PLK1 transcription, establishing a feed-forward MYC-PLK1 circuit in DHL. Finally, inhibition of PLK1 triggered degradation of MYC and of the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1, and PLK1 inhibitors showed synergy with BCL-2 antagonists in blocking DHL cell growth, survival, and tumorigenicity, supporting clinical targeting of PLK1 in DHL.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Hematology', '*Lymphomas', '*Molecular biology', '*Oncology']",,,['J Clin Invest. 2018 Dec 3;128(12):5206-5208.

Ruxolitinib is a powerful Janus tyrosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor that is used for myelofibrosis treatment. DNA-histone connection mediates a wide range of genes that code methylation, demethylation, acetylation, deacetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation enzymes. Epigenetic modifications regulate chromatin compactness, which plays pivotal roles in critical biological processes including the transcriptional activity and cell proliferation as well as various pathological mechanisms, including CML. This study is aimed to determine the alterations of the expression levels of epigenetic modification-related genes after ruxolitinib treatment. Total RNA was isolated from K-562 cells treated with the IC50 value of ruxolitinib and untreated K-562 control cells. A reverse transcription procedure was performed for complementary DNA synthesis, and gene expressions were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction compared with the untreated cells. Ruxolitinib treatment caused a significant alteration in the expression levels of epigenetic regulation-related genes in K-562 cells. Our novel results suggested that ruxolitinib has inhibitor effects on epigenetic modification-regulator genes.",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*epigenetic regulation', '*ruxolitinib']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2748-3124', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5714-7455', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9890-3256', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8646-1673', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6593-3237']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Pathogenic germline mutations in approximately a dozen genes predispose to HHMs, and many more genes are likely to be involved. Many of these HHM genes have only been identified recently. HHM phenotypes are diverse, but may be categorized as ""purely"" myeloid syndromes, syndromes with abnormal platelet number/function, and HHMs with additional organ system involvement. A number of questions remain unanswered in this emerging field, including the ideal diagnostic approach for patients at risk for HHMs, the optimal surveillance of unaffected carriers, and how to personalize care for individuals with HHMs. The field of HHMs is evolving rapidly.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of blinatumomab in adult Korean patients with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia-negative B cell precursor ALL. A total of 50 patients received blinatumomab treatment between June 2016 and August 2017 in Korea. The median number of prior therapy was one (range, 1-4). Among the 49 evaluable patients, 22 (44.9%) achieved complete response (CR) or CR with incomplete blood count recovery, and 16 of whom subsequently underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation. Although no statistically significant differences were observed, patients with extramedullary disease and poor performance status had lower responses to blinatumomab treatment. In addition, the use of high-dose dexamethasone prior to blinatumomab treatment did not affect the response to blinatumomab. The median event-free survival and overall survival of the responders were 7.5 and 8.1 months, respectively. For non-hematologic toxicities, the most common toxicity was infection. The incidences of severe cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity each was 4%. In conclusion, blinatumomab was an effective and tolerable therapy in adult Korean patients with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia-negative B cell precursor ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Blinatumomab', 'Predictor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We quantitatively examined changes in choroidal blood flow velocity and choroidal thickness at the macula by using laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) and enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) in a patient with leukemic retinopathy. Observations: A 15-year-old boy presented with sudden central vision loss of his right eye. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity was 0.09 OD and 1.2 OS. Funduscopy revealed a sub-inner limiting membrane hemorrhage at the macula, intra-retinal hemorrhages with Roth spots, and dilatation and tortuosity of retinal veins OU. Leukocytosis with the Philadelphia chromosome was found in the peripheral blood, which led to a diagnosis of retinopathy associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. Retinal hemorrhages resolved after chemotherapy. Macular mean blur rates on LSFG increased by 24-38% OD and 13-26% OS, while macular choroidal thicknesses on EDI-OCT decreased by 7-60 mum OD and 8-46 mum OS during the 3-month follow-up period after the start of treatment. Conclusion and importance: These results suggest that choroidal blood flow velocity decreased and choroidal thickness increased sub-clinically in the acute stage of a patient with leukemic retinopathy. LSFG and EDI-OCT may be useful to non-invasively evaluate the activity of choroidal involvement in leukemic retinopathy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Choroidal blood flow velocity', 'Choroidal thickness', 'Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography', 'Laser speckle flowgraphy', 'Leukemic retinopathy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, inconsistencies exist as NEAT1 can also function as a tumor suppressor in certain types of cancer, such as acute promyelocytic leukemia. Here we systematically describe our current understanding of NEAT1 in tumor initiation and progression. First, we analyzed the expression patterns of NEAT1 in various normal tissues and malignant cancers using data from public data portals, the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), together with recent progress in the study of NEAT1 in various types of cancer. Second, we discussed the functions and mechanisms of NEAT1 in modulating tumor activity. Then, the upstream transcription factors and downstream microRNA targets of NEAT1 in the transcription cascade of cancers were also summarized. These data highlight the emerging role of NEAT1 in tumorigenesis, and present promising targetable pathways and clinical opportunities for tumor prevention and classifications.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Long non-coding RNA', 'NEAT1', 'Pan-cancer analysis', 'Regulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lethality of HCC accounts for many reasons. One of them, the lack of reliable diagnostic markers at the early stage, in this context, serum miRNAs became promising diagnostic biomarkers. Herein, we aimed to identify the predictive value of two miRNAs (miR-122 and miR-224) in plasma of patients with HCC preceded by chronic HCV infection. Taqman miRNA assays specific for hsa-miR-122 and hsa-miR-224 were used to assess the expression levels of the chosen miRNAs in plasma samples collected from three groups; 40 patients with HCC related to HCV, 40 with CHC patients and 20 healthy volunteers. This study revealed that the mean plasma values of miRNA-122 were significantly lower among HCC group when compared to CHC and control groups (P < 0.001). Whereas, miR-224 mean plasma values were significantly higher among HCC group when compared to both CHC group and control group. Moreover, it was found that miR-122 can predict development of HCC at cut-off value <0.67 (RQ) and (AUC = 0.98, P < 0.001). As regards miR-224, it can predict development of HCC at cut-off value >1.2 (RQ) and (AUC = 0.93, P < 0.001), while the accuracy of AFP to diagnose HCC was (AUC: 0.619; P = 0.06).

Exploring the drug-drug interactions might be beneficial to find active substances and develop new targeted drugs. This study aimed at exploring the change of arsenic concentration in mice and across MDCK-MDR1 cells and the cytotoxicity on K562 cells when realgar and indigo naturalis were combined. In the presence or absence of indigo naturalis, pharmacokinetics and cell-based permeability assays were used to evaluate the change of arsenic concentration, and K562 cell line was applied to evaluate the change of cytotoxicity. The drug concentration-time profiles exhibited that the combination medication group generated higher AUC, thalf, and longer MRT for arsenic, compared with the single administration of realgar. The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of bidirectional transport in MDCK-MDR1 cell permeability experiments showed that arsenic permeability obviously went up when indigo naturalis was incubated together. The combination medication significantly decreased the cell viability of K562 cells when both the concentration of realgar and the concentration of indigo naturalis were nontoxic. The pharmacokinetic research, the MDCK-MDR1 based permeability study, and the K562 cytotoxicity study were united together to verify the combination medication of realgar and indigo naturalis enhanced the absorption and the permeability across cells for arsenic and effectively inhibited the proliferation of K562 cell line. The molecular binding of As4S4 and indirubin was analyzed by computational study. It is predicted that the formation of the complex [As4S4 (...)Indirubin] involves noncovalent interaction that changes the concentration of arsenic.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3759-969X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1974-044X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) has become a well-established treatment option for many patients suffering from malignant and non-malignant diseases. In the past decade, high-resolution HLA-typing, remission surveillance, pre-emptive immune intervention, and standardisation in supportive care measures have substantially improved transplant outcomes. This retrospective study evaluated transplant procedures in 162 paediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 124) or acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 38) who received their first alloHSCT in our institution over an 11-year period. We observed a significant reduction in risk of non-relapse mortality (NRM) over time (HR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.12-0.98; P = 0.05), the 4-year NRM estimate decreased from 20% in 2005-2008 to 7% in 2012-2016 (P = 0.02) and an increase in survival after relapse. There was no significant difference in patients who received a graft from a sibling, haplo, or an unrelated donor with regard to their overall survival (P = 0.45), event-free survival (P = 0.61), and non-relapse mortality (P = 0.19). Our data suggest that a specific transplant infrastructure with a highly experienced team in an accredited transplant centre likely contributes to better transplant outcomes for acute leukaemia patients in complete remission regardless of donor type.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"Outcomes after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (AHSCT) are influenced by both disease- and patient-related factors. Here, we developed a novel prognostic model, hematopoietic cell transplant-composite risk (HCT-CR), by combining the refined disease risk index (DRI-R) and hematopoietic stem-cell transplant comorbidity/age index (HCT-CI/Age) to predict post-transplant survival for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The analysis included 942 AML/MDS patients treated with AHSCT. Patients were stratified into 4 HCT-CR risk groups: Low-risk-patients with low/intermediate DRI-R and HCT-CI/Age </=3 (N = 272); Intermediate-risk-patients with low/intermediate DRI-R and HCT-CI/Age >3 (N = 168); High-risk-patients with high/very high DRI-R and HCT-CI/Age </=3 (N = 284); and Very high-risk-patients with high/very high DRI-R and HCT-CI/Age >3 (N = 184). Compared with the low-risk group, intermediate, high, and very high-risk groups had a significantly increased risk of death [adjusted HR of 1.37 (P < 0.04), 2.08 (P < 0.001), and 2.92 (P < 0.001), respectively]. The concordance test showed that the HCT-CR model provided better discriminative capacity for OS prediction compared with all prior models independently, including cytogenetic risk group, DRI-R, and HCT-CI/Age model (C-indices: 0.62, 0.55, 0.60, and 0.54, respectively) (P < 0.001). In conclusion, combining disease- and patient-related factors provides better survival stratification for patients with AML/MDS receiving AHSCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human CMV (HCMV) infection expresses IE1 that deSUMOylates PML to result in dispersion of ND10. It has been demonstrated that HSV ICP0 degraded only the SUMOylated PML, so we hypothesized that HCMV IE1 can protect PML from degradation by ICP0. HCMV IE1-expressing cell lines (U-251 MG-IE1 and HELF-IE1) were used for infection of HSV-1 or transfection of ICP0-expressing plasmid. Multilabeling by immunocytochemistry assay and protein examination by Western blot assay were performed to determine the resultant fate of PML caused by ICP0 in the presence or absence of HCMV IE1. Here, we report that deSUMOylation of human PML (hPML) by HCMV IE1 was incomplete, as mono-SUMOylated PML remained in the IE1-expressing cells, which is consistent with the report by E. M. Schilling, M. Scherer, N. Reuter, J. Schweininger, et al. (J Virol 91:e02049-16, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02049-16). As expected, we found that IE1 protected PML from degradation by ICP0 or HSV-1 infection. An in vitro study found that IE1 with mutation of L174P failed to deSUMOylate PML and did not protect PML from degradation by ICP0; hence, we conclude that the deSUMOylation of PML is important for IE1 to protect PML from degradation by ICP0. In addition, we revealed that murine CMV failed to deSUMOylate and to protect the HSV-mediated degradation of hPML, and that HCMV failed to deSUMOylate and protect the HSV-mediated degradation of mouse PML. However, IE1-expressing cells did not enhance wild-type HSV-1 replication but significantly increased ICP0-defective HSV-1 replication at a low multiplicity of infection. Therefore, our results uncovered a host-virus functional interaction at the posttranslational level.IMPORTANCE Our finding that HCMV IE1 protected hPML from degradation by HSV ICP0 is important, because the PML body (aka ND10) is believed to be the first line of host intrinsic defense against herpesviral infection. How the infected viruses overcome the nuclear defensive structure (PML body) has not been fully understood. Herpesviral proteins, ICP0 of HSV and IE1 of CMV, have been identified to interact with PML. Here, we report that HCMV IE1 incompletely deSUMOylated PML, resulting in the mono-SUMOylated PML, which is consistent with the report of Schilling et al. (J Virol 91:e02049-16, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02049-16). The mono-SUMOylated PML was subjected to degradation by HSV ICP0. However, it was protected by IE1 from degradation by ICP0 or HSV-1 infection. In contrast, IE1 with L174P mutation lost the function of deSUMOylating PML and failed to protect the degradation of the mono-SUMOylated PML. Whether the mono-SUMOylated PML has any defensive function against viral infection will be further investigated.",['NOTNLM'],"['*HSV-1', '*SUMOylation', '*cytomegalovirus (CMV)', '*herpes simplex virus (HSV)', '*immediate-early protein 1 (IE1)', '*infected cellular protein (ICP0)', '*nuclear domain 10 (ND10)', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML)']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9545-9062', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9352-0643']",,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Print 2018 Dec 15.,"Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is a highly aggressive T-cell malignancy induced by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays a critical role in the development and progression of multiple human cancers. However, the function of lncRNA in HTLV-1-induced oncogenesis has not been elucidated. In the present study, we show that the expression level of the lncRNA ANRIL was elevated in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and clinical ATL samples. E2F1 induced ANRIL transcription by enhancing its promoter activity. Knockdown of ANRIL in ATL cells repressed cellular proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro and in vivo As a mechanism for these actions, we found that ANRIL targeted EZH2 and activated the NF-kappaB pathway in ATL cells. This activation was independent of the histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity of EZH2 but required the formation of an ANRIL/EZH2/p65 ternary complex. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that ANRIL/EZH2 enhanced p65 DNA binding capability. In addition, we observed that the ANRIL/EZH2 complex repressed p21/CDKN1A transcription through H3K27 trimethylation of the p21/CDKN1A promoter. Taken together, our results implicate that the lncRNA ANRIL, by cooperating with EZH2, supports the proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells, which is thought to be critical for oncogenesis.IMPORTANCE Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the pathogen that causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), which is a unique malignancy of CD4(+) T cells. A role for long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in HTLV-1-mediated cellular transformation has not been described. In this study, we demonstrated that the lncRNA ANRIL was important for maintaining the proliferation of ATL cells in vitro and in vivo ANRIL was shown to activate NF-kappaB signaling through forming a ternary complex with EZH2 and p65. Furthermore, epigenetic inactivation of p21/CDKN1A was involved in the oncogenic function of ANRIL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the regulatory role of the lncRNA ANRIL in ATL and provides an important clue to prevent or treat HTLV-1-associated human diseases.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ANRIL', '*ATL', '*EZH2', '*HTLV-1', '*NF-kappaB', '*adult T-cell leukemia', '*human T-cell leukemia virus']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Microbiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"PAX5 is a well-known haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene in human B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and is involved in various chromosomal translocations that fuse a part of PAX5 with other partners. However, the role of PAX5 fusion proteins in B-ALL initiation and transformation is ill-known. We previously reported a new recurrent t(7;9)(q11;p13) chromosomal translocation in human B-ALL that juxtaposed PAX5 to the coding sequence of elastin (ELN). To study the function of the resulting PAX5-ELN fusion protein in B-ALL development, we generated a knockin mouse model in which the PAX5-ELN transgene is expressed specifically in B cells. PAX5-ELN-expressing mice efficiently developed B-ALL with an incidence of 80%. Leukemic transformation was associated with recurrent secondary mutations on Ptpn11, Kras, Pax5, and Jak3 genes affecting key signaling pathways required for cell proliferation. Our functional studies demonstrate that PAX5-ELN affected B-cell development in vitro and in vivo featuring an aberrant expansion of the pro-B cell compartment at the preleukemic stage. Finally, our molecular and computational approaches identified PAX5-ELN-regulated gene candidates that establish the molecular bases of the preleukemic state to drive B-ALL initiation. Hence, our study provides a new in vivo model of human B-ALL and strongly implicates PAX5 fusion proteins as potent oncoproteins in leukemia development.",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*PAX5 fusion proteins', '*engineered mouse models', '*leukemia initiation', '*oncogenic transformation']",,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"The intestinal microbiota in allogeneic bone marrow transplant (allo-BMT) recipients modulates graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a systemic inflammatory state initiated by donor T cells that leads to colitis, a key determinant of GVHD severity. Indole or indole derivatives produced by tryptophan metabolism in the intestinal microbiota limit intestinal inflammation caused by diverse stressors, so we tested their capacity to protect against GVHD in murine major histocompatibility complex-mismatched models of allo-BMT. Indole effects were assessed by colonization of allo-BMT recipient mice with tryptophanase positive or negative strains of Escherichia coli, or, alternatively, by exogenous administration of indole-3-carboxaldehyde (ICA), an indole derivative. Treatment with ICA limited gut epithelial damage, reduced transepithelial bacterial translocation, and decreased inflammatory cytokine production, reducing GVHD pathology and GVHD mortality, but did not compromise donor T-cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia responses. ICA treatment also led to recipient-strain-specific tolerance of engrafted T cells. Transcriptional profiling and gene ontology analysis indicated that ICA administration upregulated genes associated with the type I interferon (IFN1) response, which has been shown to protect against radiation-induced intestinal damage and reduce subsequent GVHD pathology. Accordingly, protective effects of ICA following radiation exposure were abrogated in mice lacking IFN1 signaling. Taken together, these data indicate that indole metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiota act via type I IFNs to limit intestinal inflammation and damage associated with myeloablative chemotherapy or radiation exposure and acute GVHD, but preserve antitumor responses, and may provide a therapeutic option for BMT patients at risk for GVHD.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-3281-2081'],,['Blood. 2018 Dec 6;132(23):2429-2430.

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is a member of the arginine methyltransferase protein family that critically mediates the symmetric dimethylation of Arg-3 at histone H4 (H4R3me2s) and is involved in many key cellular processes, including hematopoiesis. However, the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PRMT5 that may affect its biological functions remain less well-understood. In this study, using MS analyses, we found that PRMT5 itself is methylated in human erythroleukemia Lys-562 cells. Biochemical assays revealed that coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) interacts directly with and methylates PRMT5 at Arg-505 both in vivo and in vitro. Substitutions at Arg-505 significantly reduced PRMT5's methyltransferase activity, decreased H4R3me2s enrichment at the gamma-globin gene promoter, and increased the expression of the gamma-globin gene in Lys-562 cells. Moreover, CARM1 knockdown consistently reduced PRMT5 activity and activated gamma-globin gene expression. Importantly, we show that CARM1-mediated methylation of PRMT5 is essential for the intracellular homodimerization of PRMT5 to its active form. These results thus reveal a critical PTM of PRMT5 that represses human gamma-globin gene expression. We conclude that CARM1-mediated asymmetric methylation of PRMT5 is critical for its dimerization and methyltransferase activity leading to the repression of gamma-globin expression. Given PRMT5's crucial role in diverse cellular processes, these findings may inform strategies for manipulating its methyltransferase activity for managing hemoglobinopathy or cancer.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CARM1', '*gene expression', '*hemoglobin', '*histone methylation', '*protein arginine N-methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)', '*protein methylation']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8533-1938'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 Nie et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the relevance of DIXDC1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression status and potential biological function of DIXDC1 in AML. Our results showed that DIXDC1 expression was highly upregulated in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts compared with normal blasts. Knockdown of DIXDC1 by siRNA-mediated gene silencing significantly inhibited proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest, and promoted apoptosis of AML cells in vitro. By contrast, DIXDC1 overexpression promoted proliferation, accelerated cell cycle progression, and reduced apoptosis of AML cells. Moreover, we found that DIXDC1 knockdown decreased the expression of beta-catenin and restricted the activation of Wnt signaling. In addition, DIXDC1 knockdown decreased the expression of Wnt/beta-catenin target genes, including cyclin D1 and c-myc, while DIXDC1 overexpression had the opposite effect. Notably, beta-catenin knockdown partially reversed the oncogenic effect of DIXDC1 in AML cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that DIXDC1 promotes the growth of AML cells, possibly through upregulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Our study suggests that DIXDC1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'DIXDC1', 'Wnt/beta-catenin']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Little is known on the effect of volatile anesthetics on tumour progression. In this study, we show that sevoflurane, a volatile anesthetic, negatively affects chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) CD34 stem/progenitor cells' biological properties. Sevoflurane significantly inhibits the growth of a panel of CML cell lines in a dose-dependent manner without affecting their survival. It also inhibits proliferation, differentiation and self-renewal capacities but not survival of CML CD34 cells. In addition, sevoflurane significantly augments dasatinib's efficacy in CML cell lines and stem/progenitors. Mechanistically, sevoflurane dose-dependently decreases levels of beta-catenin and c-Myc but not phospho-P38 MAPK in K562 and CML CD34 cells. The decreased Wnt/ beta-catenin activity and the reduced levels of Wnt/beta-catenin-targeted transcriptions are observed in CML cells exposed to sevoflurane. The complete rescue of the inhibitory effects of sevoflurane in K562 and CML CD34 cells by beta-catenin stabilization using both genetic and pharmacological approaches further demonstrates that sevoflurane acts on CML cells via a beta-catenin-dependent manner. Our results clearly show the direct and negative effects of sevoflurane on the leukemia cell lines as well as leukemia stem/progenitors.

Epub 2018 Aug 24.,"The treatment for leukemic malignancies remains a challenge despite the wide use of conventional chemotherapies. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are highly demanded. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) represents a targeted therapy against cancer because it induces apoptosis only in tumor cells. TRAIL is currently under investigation for the treatment of leukemia. Preclinical studies evaluated the potential therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL on cell lines and clinical samples and showed promising results. However, like most anti-cancer drugs, resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis may limit its clinical efficacy. It is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms of TRAIL. Therefore, rational therapeutic drug combinations for clinical trials of TRAIL-based therapies might be achieved. In a variety of leukemic cells, overexpression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a negative regulator of apoptosis pathway, has been discovered. Implication of XIAP in the ineffective induction of cell death by TRAIL in leukemia has been explored in several resistant cell lines. XIAP inhibitors restored TRAIL sensitivity in resistant cells and primary leukemic blasts. Moreover, TRAIL resistance in leukemic cells could be overcome by the effects of several anti-leukemic agents via the mechanisms of XIAP downregulation. Here, we discuss targeting XIAP, a strategy to restore TRAIL sensitivity in leukemia to acquire more insights into the mechanisms of TRAIL resistance. The concluding remarks may lead to identify putative ways to resensitize tumors.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Drug resistance', 'Leukemia', 'TRAIL', 'XIAP']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here, we performed a genome-wide methylation analysis by high-density array in 14 newly diagnosed pPCL patients along with 60 MMs, and 5 patients affected by monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS). Our analysis revealed a global hypomethylation profile associated with pPCL. Additionally, differential methylation patterns were found related to distinct chromosomal aberrations and DIS3 mutations, affecting genes with roles in bone metabolism, cell migration, transcription regulation or DNA damage response. When compared with MM patients, pPCL showed a distinct methylation profile mostly characterized by hypomethylated probes specific for genes involved in several processes like cell adhesion and migration. Furthermore, decreasing methylation levels were evidenced for genes significantly modulated in the progressive phases of plasma cell dyscrasias, from MGUS to MM and pPCL. Overall, our data provide new insights into the molecular characterization of pPCL, thus being potentially useful in the prognostic stratification or identification of novel molecular targets.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gene expression', '*Methylation', '*Microarray profiling', '*Plasma cell leukemia']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of thymic microenvironmental cells and stromal factors in thymocyte malignant transformation and T-ALL development remains little explored. Here, using the TEL-JAK2 transgenic (TJ2-Tg) mouse model of T-ALL/LBL, which is driven by constitutive JAK/STAT signaling and characterized by the acquisition of Notch1 mutations, we sought to identify stromal cell alterations associated with thymic leukemogenesis. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that thymic lymphomas presented epithelial areas characterized by keratin (Krt) 5 and Krt8 expression, adjacently to epithelial-free areas negative for Krt expression. Both areas contained abundant laminin (extracellular matrix) and ER-TR7+ (fibroblasts) CD31+ (endothelial) and CD11c+ (dendritic) cells. Besides Krt5, Krt-positive areas harbored medullary thymic epithelial cells (TECs) labeled by Ulex europaeus agglutinin-1. By performing flow cytometry and RNA sequencing analyses of thymic lymphomas, we observed an enrichment in medullary TEC markers in detriment of cortical TEC markers. To assess whether TECs are important for T-ALL/LBL development, we generated TJ2-Tg mice heterozygous for the FoxN1 transcription factor nude null mutation (Foxn1+/nu). Strikingly, in TJ2-Tg;Foxn1+/nu compound mice, both emergence of malignant cells in preleukemic thymi and overt T-ALL onset were significantly delayed. Moreover, in transplantation assays, leukemic cell expansion within the thymus of recipient Foxn1+/nu mice was reduced as compared with control littermates. Since thymopoesis is largely normal in Foxn1+/nu mice, these results indicate that FoxN1 haploinsufficiency in TECs has a more profound impact in thymic leukemogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"BACKGROUND: Stagnant outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) 15-39 years of age with cancer are partly attributed to poor enrollment onto clinical trials. Initiatives have focused on increasing accrual, but changes at the population-level are unknown. We examined patterns of clinical trial participation over time in AYA patients with cancer. PROCEDURE: We utilized medical record data from AYAs in two population-based National Cancer Institute Patterns of Care Studies identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program. Among 3135 AYAs diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and sarcoma, we used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate patient and provider characteristics associated with clinical trial enrollment. Interaction terms evaluated variation in clinical trial enrollment across patient and provider characteristics by year of diagnosis. RESULTS: From 2006 to 2012-2013, clinical trial participation increased from 14.8% to 17.9% (P < 0.01). Adjusting for patient and provider characteristics, we found lower clinical trial enrollment among those who were older at diagnosis, diagnosed with NHL vs ALL, treated by adult hematologist/oncologists only (vs pediatric hematologist/oncologists), and of non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic White) (P < 0.05 for all). Interaction analyses indicate improved clinical trial enrollment from 2006 to 2012-2013 among young adults 25-29 years of age and the uninsured.

Epub 2018 Sep 7.,"Resistance towards imatinib (IM) remains troublesome in treating many chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is a key enzyme of antioxidative metabolism in association with cell resistance to apoptosis. Our previous studies have shown that overexpression of HO-1 resulted in resistance development to IM in CML cells, while the mechanism remains unclear. In the current study, the IM-resistant CML cells K562R indicated upregulation of some of the histone deacetylases (HDACs) compared with K562 cells. Therefore, we herein postulated HO-1 was associated with HDACs. Silencing HO-1 expression in K562R cells inhibited the expression of some HDACs, and the sensitivity to IM was increased. K562 cells transfected with HO-1 resisted IM and underwent obvious some HDACs. These findings related to the inhibitory effects of high HO-1 expression on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway that negatively regulated HDACs. Increased expression of HO-1 activated HDACs by inhibiting ROS production. In summary, HO-1, which is involved in the development of drug resistance in CML cells by regulating the expression of HDACs, is probably a novel target for improving CML therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['*AR-42', '*HDACs', '*HO-1', '*ROS', '*chronic myeloid leukemia']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0966-1289'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We attempted to explore the unique barriers that might prevent adult male cancer patients from accessing sperm cryopreservation in Pakistan. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews of male cancer patients aged 18-45 years were audio-recorded in Urdu and translated to English and were transcribed ad verbatim. The topics included information regarding risk of infertility following chemotherapy, future reproductive choices, and barriers to sperm cryopreservation. Questionnaire to physicians containing four content domains of knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers to sperm banking was also delivered. Data were entered and analyzed on SPSS. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients interviewed, there were 10 cases of leukemia, 3 cases of lymphoma, 2 cases each of colorectal carcinoma and multiple myeloma, 1 case each of neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma, and solitary cases involving the lung, breast, thymus, brain, jaw, and testis. Four patients knew about the risk of infertility. All patients were aware of the option of sperm cryopreservation. Two patients had their sperm preserved before the initiation of chemotherapy. Perceived treatment-related expenses appeared to be the major barrier to sperm cryopreservation in nine patients. This was followed by lack of information, which was cited by eight patients, and religious reasons (n = 2 patients). Other barriers were female gender of the doctor and patient's preferences. Four patients stated no barriers. Nine physicians responded to the questionnaire. Seventy-eight percent of physicians agreed that cancer treatment increases the risk of infertility. 33.3% strongly agreed and 55.6% agreed that infertility can have an adverse impact on QoL. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant lack of awareness among male cancer patients regarding infertility following cancer treatment. It is imperative that physicians inform them of this and discuss treatment options, along with addressing potential barriers.",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer', '*infertility', '*sperm banking']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic variation ofMDR1 in ALL patients is increasingly recognized as a factor influencing response to treatment. Aim: To investigate the possible role of MDR-1 gene polymorphisms (C3435T, C1236T and C4125A) as risk factors for the development and clinical outcome of ALL in Egyptian children. Materials and Methods: Genotyping of MDR-1 C3435T, C1236T and C4125A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was accomplished using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) assay with 120 childhood ALL patients and 100 healthy controls. Results: Homozygous T with the C3435T SNP showed a protective effect as compared to homozygous C (OR=0.748) while heterozygous CT correlated with a poor outcome (high risk, drug unresponsiveness, relapse and high percentage of death). Additionally, the T allele of the C1236T SNP showed a significant relation with ALL risk (OR=1.6). However, there were no significant differences in the genotype and allele frequencies of MDR-1 SNPs between patients and controls. Only one genotype (CC) and one allele of MDR-1 (C4125A) were seen. Neither CA/AA genotypes nor A alleles were present in ALL patients and normal controls. TC was the predominant haplotype in both groups, while CT proved to be minor. The cumulative incidence of relapse was higher with the CC genotype of C1236T as compared with TT. Conclusion: From our preliminary data, the CT genotype of C3435T is associated with a poor ALL outcome while the CC genotype of C1236T is related with an increased incidence of relapse. Although our results provide assistance for oncologist choice of individual therapeutic strategy taking the patient genetic repertoire into consideration, further investigations with larger sample size should be conducted to validate our results.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*MDR-1', '*polymorphism', '*Egyptian']",,,,,,,['Creative Commons Attribution License'],,,,,,,,,,,,

New treatments have been approved based on the results of randomized multicenter trials for first line and for salvage therapy, and the results of numerous ongoing clinical trials are permanently providing new answers and further refining of therapeutic strategies. This is paralleled by substantial increase in understanding the disease genetics due to major advances in the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. We define current position of the Croatian Cooperative Group for Hematologic Disease on diagnosis and treatment of CLL in the transition from chemo-immunotherapy paradigm into a new one that is based on new diagnostic stratification and unprecedented therapeutic results of B-cell receptor inhibitors (BRI) and Bcl-2 antagonists. This is a rapidly evolving field as a great number of ongoing clinical trials con-stantly accumulate and provide new knowledge.

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the possible risk factors and clinical features. CASE PRESENTATION: A 19y old male with relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was admitted under haematology with pyrexia of unknown origin. At the time of his admission, he reported bilateral and sequential visual impairment for 2 days. On examination, there was bilateral profound retinopathy across the posterior poles. This was symmetrical and with associated macular oedema. Infective aetiology was excluded and cyclosporine was stopped. Although no definitive treatment was initiated the visual acuity improved whilst macular oedema fluctuated. CONCLUSION: BMT and chemotherapy can cause ocular complications but these are usually confined to the anterior segment. Posterior segment complications in the form of retinopathy is very rare.

After treating adult T-cell leukemia cell lines with different concentrations of celastrol, we analyzed the cell proliferation by MTT and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was conducted to detect cell apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Western blotting and dual-luciferase reporter assay were done to study the mechanism how celastrol suppressed the growth of adult T-cell leukemia cells. Celastrol could significantly inhibit the proliferation of adult T-cell leukemia cells, and induce apoptosis of ATL cells. With the increase of the concentration of celastrol, the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein was up-regulated. The Caspase-3/7 protein was cleaved and activated after treatment with celastrol. Moreover, the expression of HTLV-1-encoded viral protein Tax was significantly inhibited in the celastrol treated cells. Taken together, these results indicated that celastrol effectively inhibited the proliferation of adult T-cell leukemia cells by regulating the expression of Bcl-2 family protein, and induced cell apoptosis by activating Caspase dependent pathway. In addition, celastrol could inhibit the expression of viral protein Tax.

Here, we sought to further characterize the performance of PBFC for pediatric leukemia and highlight the exceptions when PBFC can result in misdiagnosis. METHODS: An institutional database was searched between 2012 and 2016 for cases of acute leukemia with concurrent PBFC and BM evaluation. Immunophenotyping results from the peripheral blood and BM using four or eight color flow cytometry, as well as BM cytochemical staining and immunohistochemistry, were compared. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety PBFC samples with concurrent BM evaluation were identified. Based on the final immunophenotypic classification, the cases were distributed as follows: 108 B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 57 T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), 116 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 9 mixed-phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). Among all cases, five had a diagnostically significant discrepancy between PBFC and BM evaluation. In three cases, the immunophenotype by PBFC was consistent with early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL), whereas BM evaluation demonstrated MPAL. Two cases were suspicious for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) and MPAL, T/myeloid by PBFC but were diagnosed as B-ALL and T-ALL in the BM. CONCLUSION: Immunophenotypic classification by PBFC is accurate (>98%) in almost all cases of pediatric leukemia with the rare exceptions of suspected ETP-ALL, MPAL, and AMKL. These PBFC diagnoses should be confirmed with BM immunophenotyping.",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*mixed-phenotype acute leukemia', '*pediatric leukemia', '*peripheral blood flow cytometry']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4463-0835'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"BACKGROUND: Fanconi anemia is an inherited bone marrow failure disorder associated with a high incidence of leukemia and solid tumors. Currently, no interventions to prevent or delay the formation of solid tumors are available. PROCEDURE: Two of the most important hallmarks of Fanconi anemia are inflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we administrated the antioxidant atorvastatin and the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib to cohorts of Fancd2(-/-) /Trp53(+/-) mice, a model of Fanconi anemia. Treatment started at weaning and continued until the mice developed a palpable mass or suffered from >20% weight loss. Tumor samples and selected tissues were subjected to histopathological examination. chi(2) test was performed to analyze tumor incidence, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were evaluated with log-rank test. In addition, a small cohort of mice was monitored for the safety of the drugs. RESULTS: The combined oral administration of both drugs significantly delayed tumor onset in Fancd2(-/-) /Trp53(+/-) mice. Specifically, the treatment delayed the onset of ovarian tumors in Fancd2(-/-) /Trp53(+/-) mice and increased the mean ovarian tumor-free survival time by 17%, whereas this combinatorial drug regimen did not have a significant effect on other tumor types. In addition, no detrimental effects on hematopoiesis from the drug treatment were observed during a 12-month safety monitoring.

It is of particular interest to identify drugs to overcome these resistances. In this study, we found that PRPS1 mutant ALL cells specifically showed more chemosensitivity to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) than control cells, attributed to increased apoptosis of PRPS1 mutant cells by 5-FU. Mechanistically, PRPS1 mutants increase the level of intracellular phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which causes the apt conversion of 5-FU to FUMP and FUTP in Reh cells, to promote 5-FU-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Our study not only provides mechanistic rationale for re-targeting drug resistant cells in ALL, but also implicates that ALL patients who harbor relapse-specific mutations of PRPS1 might benefit from 5-FU-based chemotherapy in clinical settings.",['NOTNLM'],"['*5-FU', '*PRPP', '*PRPS1', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*nucleotide metabolism']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2860-694X'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

METHODS: One hundred eight females between age 6 and (median age 24) 35 were referred for possible ovary tissue cryopreservation over a 20-year period, with either slow freeze or vitrification. Thus far 13 patients returned up to 18 years later to have their tissue transplanted back. RESULTS: All 13 patients had return of ovarian function 5 months post transplant with regular menstrual cycling. AMH rose to very high levels as the FSH declined to normal. Four months later, the AMH again declined to very low levels. Nonetheless, the grafts remained functional for up to 5 years or longer. Ten of the 13 (77%) became spontaneously pregnant at least once, resulting in 13 healthy babies. A total of 24 healthy babies have been born 11 from fresh transplanted ovarian tissue and 13 from cryopreserved transplanted ovarian tissue. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Ovary tissue cryopreservation is a robust method for preserving a woman's fertility. (2) Cortical tissue pressure may be a key regulator of primordial follicle arrest, recruitment, and ovarian longevity.

Targeted therapy with FLT3 inhibitors in AML shows modest promising results in current ongoing clinical trials suggesting the complexity of FLT3 targeting in therapeutics. Importantly, resistance to FLT3 inhibitors may explain the lack of overwhelming response and could obstruct the successful treatment for AML.

We describe the referral patterns of inpatient palliative care consultations(IPCC) in advanced cancer patients in a tertiary care center. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of IPCC for cancer patients from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014. Descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: IPCCs were requested for 245 cancer inpatients, of which 130 were male (53.1%) and 115 (46.9%) were female; 128 (52.2%) were Caucasian, 114 (46.5%) were African American, and 3 (1.2%) were another race. Of the 245 patients, 79 (32.2%) were newly diagnosed during the current admission, and the remaining 146 (67.8%) had been diagnosed previously. Fifty-seven (23.3%) patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) during hospitalization. Of the 39 patients (15.9%) who died during their hospital stay, 34 (87.0%) had an ICU stay during the hospitalization or died in the ICU. The most common malignancies were lung (71; 29.0%), pancreatic-biliary (33; 13.4%), lymphoma and leukemia (22; 8.9%), hepatocellular (18; 7.3%), head and neck (16; 6.5%), and upper gastrointestinal tract(GI) (16; 6.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that 15.9% of terminally ill cancer patients with IPCC died in the hospital, the majority of whom died in the ICU. This was likely due to delays in the initiation of outpatient palliative care consultation, leading to an increased strain on tertiary referral centers.

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"Mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from bone marrow (BM) to peripheral blood (PB) by cytokine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or the chemical antagonist of CXCR4, AMD3100, is important in the treatment of blood diseases. Due to clinical conditions of each application, there is a need for continued improvement of HSC mobilization regimens. Previous studies have shown that genetic ablation of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 in HSCs results in their mobilization without affecting survival. Here we rationally identified a Cdc42 activity-specific inhibitor (CASIN) that can bind to Cdc42 with submicromolar affinity and competitively interfere with guanine nucleotide exchange activity. CASIN inhibits intracellular Cdc42 activity specifically and transiently to induce murine hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell egress from the BM by suppressing actin polymerization, adhesion, and directional migration of stem/progenitor cells, conferring Cdc42 knockout phenotypes. We further show that, although, CASIN administration to mice mobilizes similar number of phenotypic HSCs as AMD3100, it produces HSCs with better long-term reconstitution potential than that by AMD3100. Our work validates a specific small molecule inhibitor for Cdc42, and demonstrates that signaling molecules downstream of cytokines and chemokines, such as Cdc42, constitute a useful target for long-term stem cell mobilization.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3669-537X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membership of this cytokine family is defined by usage of common beta-receptor signalling subunits, which activate various intracellular signalling pathways. Each IL-6 family member elicits responses essential to the physiological control of immune homeostasis, haematopoiesis, inflammation, development and metabolism. Accordingly, distortion of these cytokine activities often promotes chronic disease and cancer; the pathological importance of this is exemplified by the successful treatment of certain autoimmune conditions with drugs that target the IL-6 pathway.

Combined myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), either synchronous or metachronous, rarely occur in the same patient. This report is of a 67-year-old man with a synchronous diagnosis of both bone marrow chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), which a peripheral low-grade B-cell NHL. CASE REPORT A 67-year-old Caucasian man, who was a long-term cigarette smoker, presented with a five-year history of leukocytosis and cervical lymphadenopathy. He had no symptoms of night sweats, fever, or weight loss. Review of his medical records showed a progressively increasing leukocytosis with a peak of 58x109/L. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest and abdomen showed lymphadenopathy, including enlarged cervical, axillary, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Bone marrow biopsy and histology showed CMML. Lymph node biopsy and histology showed NMZL. The patient was treated for NMZL with weekly intravenous rituximab infusions. Although his CMML was stable, the patient requested an evaluation for treatment with hematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). At the time of this report, the patient remains asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS The synchronous occurrence of bone marrow CMML and NMZL in a single patient is rare and may be attributed to a genetic mutation common to both. There are no current treatment guidelines for this group of patients, and treatment strategies should be individualized to provide an optimum outcome or symptomatic improvement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"BRCA1 is an established breast and ovarian tumor suppressor gene that encodes multiple protein products whose individual contributions to human cancer suppression are poorly understood. BRCA1-IRIS (also known as ""IRIS""), an alternatively spliced BRCA1 product and a chromatin-bound replication and transcription regulator, is overexpressed in various primary human cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and certain other carcinomas. Its naturally occurring overexpression can promote the metastasis of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells and other human cancer cells in mouse models. The IRIS-driven metastatic mechanism results from IRIS-dependent suppression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) transcription, which in turn perturbs the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta pathway leading to prolyl hydroxylase-independent HIF-1alpha stabilization and activation in a normoxic environment. Thus, despite the tumor-suppressing genetic origin of IRIS, its properties more closely resemble those of an oncoprotein that, when spontaneously overexpressed, can, paradoxically, drive human tumor progression.",['NOTNLM'],"['*BRCA1-IRIS', '*HIF-1alpha', '*PTEN', '*metastasis']",,,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: D.M.L. is a grantee of and consultant to the', 'Novartis Institute of Biomedical Research.

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"Ibrutinib is highly efficacious and used at 420 mg/d for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We previously demonstrated a decline in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) protein levels in CLL cells after 1 cycle of ibrutinib, suggesting ibrutinib dose could be lowered after the first cycle without loss of biological effect. To test this postulate, a pilot study (NCT02801578) was designed to systematically reduce ibrutinib dosing within the same patient with CLL over the course of three 28-day cycles. After an initial cycle of 420 mg/d, the dose was reduced to 280 mg/d in cycle 2, and then to 140 mg/d in cycle 3. Eleven patients began study treatment, and 9 completed the 3 cycles. Plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics (PK), BTK occupancy, and pharmacodynamic (PD) response at different doses of ibrutinib were compared. Plasma and intracellular levels of ibrutinib were dose-dependent, and even the lowest dose was sufficient to occupy, on average, more than 95% of BTK protein. In concert, BTK downstream signaling inhibition was maintained with 140 mg/d ibrutinib in cycle 3, and there were comparable reductions in total and phospho-BTK (Tyr223) protein levels across 3 cycles. Reductions of plasma chemokine CCL3 and CCL4 levels, considered to be biomarkers of ibrutinib response, were similar during the 3 cycles. These PK/PD data demonstrate that after 1 cycle of ibrutinib at the standard 420 mg/d dose, the dose can be reduced without losing biological activity. Clinical efficacy of lower doses needs to be systematically evaluated. Such dose reductions would lower drug cost, lessen untoward toxicity, and facilitate rationale-based combinations.

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"The prosurvival BCL2 family member MCL1 is frequently dysregulated in cancer. To overcome the significant challenges associated with inhibition of MCL1 protein-protein interactions, we rigorously applied small-molecule conformational restriction, which culminated in the discovery of AMG 176, the first selective MCL1 inhibitor to be studied in humans. We demonstrate that MCL1 inhibition induces a rapid and committed step toward apoptosis in subsets of hematologic cancer cell lines, tumor xenograft models, and primary patient samples. With the use of a human MCL1 knock-in mouse, we demonstrate that MCL1 inhibition at active doses of AMG 176 is tolerated and correlates with clear pharmacodynamic effects, demonstrated by reductions in B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. Furthermore, the combination of AMG 176 and venetoclax is synergistic in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumor models and in primary patient samples at tolerated doses. These results highlight the therapeutic promise of AMG 176 and the potential for combinations with other BH3 mimetics. SIGNIFICANCE: AMG 176 is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable MCL1 inhibitor that induces a rapid commitment to apoptosis in models of hematologic malignancies. The synergistic combination of AMG 176 and venetoclax demonstrates robust activity in models of AML at tolerated doses, highlighting the promise of BH3-mimetic combinations in hematologic cancers.See related commentary by Leber et al., p. 1511.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1494.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8218-002X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8218-002X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3101-4873', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5742-4056', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0863-0328', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9110-7695', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8751-9707', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7341-5720', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3101-4873']",,['Cancer Discov. 2018 Dec;8(12):1511-1514.

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"BH3 mimetic drugs, which inhibit prosurvival BCL2 family proteins, have limited single-agent activity in solid tumor models. The potential of BH3 mimetics for these cancers may depend on their ability to potentiate the apoptotic response to chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Using a novel class of potent and selective MCL1 inhibitors, we demonstrate that concurrent MEK + MCL1 inhibition induces apoptosis and tumor regression in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) models, which respond poorly to MEK inhibition alone. Susceptibility to BH3 mimetics that target either MCL1 or BCL-xL was determined by the differential binding of proapoptotic BCL2 proteins to MCL1 or BCL-xL, respectively. The efficacy of dual MEK + MCL1 blockade was augmented by prior transient exposure to BCL-xL inhibitors, which promotes the binding of proapoptotic BCL2 proteins to MCL1. This suggests a novel strategy for integrating BH3 mimetics that target different BCL2 family proteins for KRAS-mutant NSCLC. SIGNIFICANCE: Defining the molecular basis for MCL1 versus BCL-xL dependency will be essential for effective prioritization of BH3 mimetic combination therapies in the clinic. We discover a novel strategy for integrating BCL-xL and MCL1 inhibitors to drive and subsequently exploit apoptotic dependencies of KRAS-mutant NSCLCs treated with MEK inhibitors.See related commentary by Leber et al., p. 1511.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1494.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8965-6991', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8218-002X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8751-9707']",,['Cancer Discov. 2018 Dec;8(12):1511-1514.

Blinatumomab is a CD3xCD19 bispecific antibody approved previously for the treatment of relapsed or refractory BCP ALL. The basis for this accelerated approval was a single-arm trial. For the 86 patients in first and second complete remission with MRD >/= 0.1%, conversion to MRD < 0.01% was achieved after one cycle of blinatumomab by 85.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 73.8%, 93.0%] and 72.0% (95% CI: 50.6%, 87.9%), respectively, and the estimated median hematologic relapse-free survivals (RFS) were 35.2 months (95% CI: 0.4-53.5) and 12.3 months (95% CI: 0.7-42.3), respectively. Hematologic RFS was considered substantial independent of whether patients underwent subsequent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The safety profile for blinatumomab was established in prior studies, and no new safety signals were observed in the new population. Cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity remain significant risks.

Tribbles 2 (TRIB2) is a cancer-associated pseudokinase with a diverse interactome, including the canonical AKT signaling module. There is substantial evidence that human TRIB2 promotes survival and drug resistance in solid tumors and blood cancers and therefore is of interest as a therapeutic target. The unusual TRIB2 pseudokinase domain contains a unique cysteine-rich C-helix and interacts with a conserved peptide motif in its own carboxyl-terminal tail, which also supports its interaction with E3 ubiquitin ligases. We found that TRIB2 is a target of previously described small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors, which were originally designed to inhibit the canonical kinase domains of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase family members. Using a thermal shift assay, we discovered TRIB2-binding compounds within the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) and used a drug repurposing approach to classify compounds that either stabilized or destabilized TRIB2 in vitro. TRIB2 destabilizing agents, including the covalent drug afatinib, led to rapid TRIB2 degradation in human AML cancer cells, eliciting tractable effects on signaling and survival. Our data reveal new drug leads for the development of TRIB2-degrading compounds, which will also be invaluable for unraveling the cellular mechanisms of TRIB2-based signaling. Our study highlights that small molecule-induced protein down-regulation through drug ""off-targets"" might be relevant for other inhibitors that serendipitously target pseudokinases.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3892-5784', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2523-4984', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9417-2246', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3223-5926', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7266-0890', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4799-6792', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5973-5798', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9836-0068', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9220-2966']",,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Exercises, particularly resistance-based exercises that may counteract this decline are restricted by therapy-related side effects. Since whole body vibration (WBV) is known to efficiently stimulate the neuromuscular system without significantly raising blood pressure, we hypothesize that especially WBV is particularly feasible even during intensive or high-dose chemotherapy (primary endpoint) and thus induces beneficial functional adaptations. METHODS: Twenty hospitalized patients with hematological malignancies scheduled for intensive or high-dose chemotherapy were randomly allocated to an intervention group (IG) undergoing WBV, or an active control group (CG) cycling. Feasibility was determined by comparing the IG's and CG's training compliance. Furthermore, to assess feasibility, WBV-induced changes in chemotherapy-related side effects, blood pressure, and heart rate immediately after exercising were documented. To assess patients' functional performance, we measured jump height (cm), the duration (sec) of performing the chair rising- (CRT) and timed-up-and-go test (TUG), maximum power output during jumping and CRT (watt/kg) as well as sway path (mm) during balance tasks. RESULTS: Training compliance was similar between groups (IG: median 62%, range 39-77; CG: 67%, 58-100; p = 0.315). Moreover, we observed neither the IG's reported side effects worsening, nor any increase in blood pressure after WBV. IG's jump height (+ 2.3 cm, 95%CI 0.1-4.4, p = 0.028) and TUG performance (- 1.3 s, 95%CI -2.53 - -0.65, p = 0.027) improved significantly, while sway paths in semi-tandem stance were augmented after the intervention (eyes open: + 60 mm, 95%CI 2-236, p = 0.046; eyes closed: + 88 mm, 95%CI 49-214, p = 0.028). The CG's performances did not change over time. Maximum power output during CMJ and CRT and time during CRT did not change. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first proving the feasibility of WBV during intensive/high-dose chemotherapy of hospitalized cancer patients. Additionally, WBV-induced neuromuscular adaptations resulted in functional benefits relevant to patients' autonomy. We believe that WBV can be implemented as an alternative training method during intensive chemotherapy, although the relative benefit compared to conventional resistance training requires more evaluation in future studies.

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"Midostaurin is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3-positive acute myeloid leukemia in combination with standard daunorubicin and cytarabine induction and high-dose cytarabine consolidation. The pharmacokinetics of midostaurin in the setting of severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] 15-29 mL/min utilizing Cockcroft-Gault method) and end-stage renal disease are unknown. Midostaurin is primarily metabolized by the liver through the CYP3A4 enzyme with fecal excretion accounting for 95% of the dose (4% recovered as unchanged drug). Only 5% of the parent drug is found in the urine. This is the first case report documenting the administration of midostaurin in two patients with end-stage renal disease on HD. Given the limited excretion of both active and inactive metabolites of midostaurin in the urine, one does not expect an increase in toxicity related to impaired drug excretion. Although this report describes the likely successful utilization of midostaurin, caution should be exercised when administering in patient populations with end organ disease. Medical history, concomitant comorbidities, and goals of therapy should be taken into account.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3', 'end-stage renal disease', 'hemodialysis', 'midostaurin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the risk of clonal evolution of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in acquired aplastic anemia (AA), and whether the use of G-CSF increases the occurrence of secondary malignant neoplasms, mainly myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). METHODS: Data were gathered from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effect of G-CSF versus no G-CSF at the risk of developing the clonal complications of acquired AA. Electronic searches in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were performed to identify studies up to 1 January 2017. Only RCTs performed on patients who were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF or not to receive G-CSF were included. RESULTS: Four relevant trials that met the inclusion criteria were identified. In a pooled analysis, the G-CSF groups of AA patients were not associated with a statistically significant higher occurrence of secondary malignant neoplasm, mainly MDS and AML (relative risk [RR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34-2.19; 4 trials). No significant heterogeneity was found (p = 0.67, I2 = 0%). There was no statistically significant higher occurrence of PNH in the G-CSF groups with AA (RR 1.17; 95% CI 0.51-2.71; 4 trials) and no significant heterogeneity was found (p = 0.42, I2 = 0%).

Epub 2018 Sep 25.,"BACKGROUND: The second-generation CD19-chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T co-stimulatory domain that is commonly used in clinical practice is CD28 or 4-1BB. Previous studies have shown that the persistence of CAR-T in the 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain appears to be longer. METHODS: The expression profile data of GSE65856 were obtained from GEO database. After data preprocessing, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the mock CAR versus CD19-28z CAR T cells and mock CAR versus CD19-BBz CAR T cells were identified using the limma package. Subsequently, functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using the DAVID tool. Then, the protein-protein international (PPI) network of these DEGs was visualized by Cytoscape, and the miRNA-target gene-disease regulatory networks were predicted using Webgestal. RESULTS: A total of 18 common DEGs, 6 CD19-28z specific DEGs and 206 CD19-BBz specific DEGs were identified. Among CD19-28z specific DEGs, down-regulated PAX5 might be an important node in the PPI network and could be targeted by miR-496. In CD19-BBz group, JUN was a hub node in the PPI network and involved in the regulations of miR520D - early growth response gene 3 (EGR3)-JUN and mi-R489-AT-rich interaction domain 5A (ARID5A)-JUN networks. CONCLUSION: The 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain might play in important role in the treatment of CAR-T via miR-520D-EGR3-JUN and miR489-ARID5A-JUN regulation network, while CD28 had a negative effect on CAR-T treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD19-28z', '*Differentially expressed genes', '*GD2.BBz', '*Protein-protein interaction']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 S.

In addition, it also displayed high selectivity over other 468 kinases/mutants (KINOMEscan S score(1)=0.01). Compound 40 displayed potent antiproliferative effects against melanoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoma, colon cancer, lung cancer as well as leukemia cell lines. It could dose-dependently inhibit the phosphorylation of RNA Pol II, suppress the expression of MCL-1 and c-Myc, arrest the cell cycle and induce the apoptosis in the leukemia cells. In the MV4-11 cell-inoculated xenograft mouse model, 10mg/kg dosage of 40 could almost completely suppress the tumor progression. The high selectivity and good in vivo PK/PD profile suggested that 40 would be a good pharmacological tool to study CDK9-mediated physiology and pathology as well as a potential drug candidate for leukemia and other cancers.",['NOTNLM'],"['1,2-Dimethoxyethane', '4-Dimethylaminopyridine', 'AML', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CDK', 'CDK9', 'CLL', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase', 'DCM', 'DIAD', 'DIPEA', 'DMAP', 'DME', 'DMF', 'DMSO', 'Diisopropyl azodicarboxylate', 'Dimethyl chloride', 'Dimethyl sulfoxide', 'Kinase inhibitor', 'LDA', 'Leukemia', 'Lithium diisopropylamide', 'MCL', 'Mantle cell lymphoma', 'N', 'N-bromobutanimide', 'N-diisopropylethylamine', 'N-dimethylformamide', 'NBS', 'SAR', 'Structure-activity relationship']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2018 Sep 22.,"Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is an immune-mediated reaction that can occur after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in which donor T cells recognize the host antigens as foreign, destroying host tissues. Establishment of a tolerogenic immune environment while preserving the immune response to infectious agents is required for successful bone marrow transplantation. Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1 (PSG1), which is secreted by the human placenta into the maternal circulation throughout pregnancy, likely plays a role in maintaining immunotolerance to prevent rejection of the fetus by the maternal immune system. We have previously shown that PSG1 activates the latent form of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta), a cytokine essential for the differentiation of tolerance-inducing CD4(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs). Consistent with this observation, treatment of naive murine T cells with PSG1 resulted in a significant increase in FoxP3(+) cells that was blocked by a TGF-beta receptor I inhibitor. We also show here that PSG1 can increase the availability of active TGF-beta in vivo. As the role of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) cells in the prevention of aGVHD is well established, we tested whether PSG1 has beneficial effects in a murine aGHVD transplantation model. PSG1-treated mice had reduced numbers of tissue-infiltrating inflammatory CD3(+) T cells and had increased expression of FoxP3 in T cells compared with vehicle-treated mice. In addition, administration of PSG1 significantly inhibited aGVHD-associated weight loss and mortality. On the other hand, administration of PSG1 was less effective in managing aGVHD in the presence of an alloimmune reaction against a malignancy in a graft-versus-leukemia experimental model. Combined, this data strongly suggests that PSG1 could be a promising treatment option for patients with aGVHD following bone marrow transplantation for a nonmalignant condition, such as an autoimmune disorder or a genetic immunodeficiency.",['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*Immunotolerance', '*Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein', '*Regulatory T cell', '*TGF-beta1']",,,,,,,['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptomic analysis of stem and progenitor populations in MDS and AML demonstrated overexpression of STAT3 that was validated in an independent cohort. STAT3 overexpression was predictive of a shorter survival and worse clinical features in a large MDS cohort. High STAT3 expression signature in MDS CD34+ cells was similar to known preleukemic gene signatures. Functionally, STAT3 inhibition by a clinical, antisense oligonucleotide, AZD9150, led to reduced viability and increased apoptosis in leukemic cell lines. AZD9150 was rapidly incorporated by primary MDS/AML stem and progenitor cells and led to increased hematopoietic differentiation. STAT3 knockdown also impaired leukemic growth in vivo and led to decreased expression of MCL1 and other oncogenic genes in malignant cells. These studies demonstrate that STAT3 is an adverse prognostic factor in MDS/AML and provide a preclinical rationale for studies using AZD9150 in these diseases.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematology', '*Hematopoietic stem cells', '*Signal transduction', '*Stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In practice, this is reflected by an increase in hemoglobin levels, or hematocrit, over what is considered physiologic for that age and gender. The standard RBC mass does not usually exceed 36 ml/kg in males and 32 ml/kg in females. The reference ranges for normal hemoglobin levels and hematocrits vary depending on altitude, from ethnicity to ethnicity and country to country.[1] However, as a frame of reference, the hemoglobin, and hematocrit of a healthy adult male are 16 g/dL plus or minus 2 gm/dl and 47% plus or minus 6%, respectively. The hemoglobin and hematocrit of a menstruating adult female are usually 13 g/dL plus or minus 2 gm/dl and 40% plus or minus 6%, respectively. Polycythemia in the newborn is defined as a central venous hematocrit over 65% or a hemoglobin value above 22 g/dL. Polycythemia vera is a sub-type of polycythemia. Often referred to colloquially as simply "" polycythemia,"" it is an acquired, Philadelphia-chromosome negative,[2], myeloproliferative disorder. This condition is associated with overproduction of all 3 cell lines but with a notable prominence of red blood cells. The clinical significance of erythrocytosis, due to any cause, lies in the associated risk of thrombotic events due to hyperviscosity of blood.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether vitamin D receptor (VDR) Fok1 and collagen protein Col1A1 Sp1-binding site gene polymorphisms, which are important in bone mineral and matrix formation, have effects on the development of bone abnormalities in childhood ALL survivors. Materials and Methods: Fifty children with ALL who were treated with the ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster-95 protocol between 1998 and 2008 and were followed for at least 7 years were enrolled. The control group consisted of 96 healthy children. VDR Fok1 and Col1A1 Sp1-binding site gene polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Bone mineral density (BMD) and markers of bone metabolism were all noted. All patients who presented with pain in the joints were examined for bone pathologies while on chemotherapy or during long-term follow-up. Results: Low BMD (16%), osteoporosis (12%), and osteonecrosis (8%) were present in a total of 18 patients (36%). The frequency of osteonecrosis and total bone abnormalities was significantly higher in children aged >/=10 years (p=0.001). The risk of low BMD and osteonecrosis was higher in those with vitamin D deficiency. Only the Col1A1 Sp1-binding site gene polymorphism showed a significant association in ALL patients with osteonecrosis. Conclusion: The development of therapy-induced bone mineral loss and osteonecrosis in children with ALL is frequent and the risk is especially higher in children aged >/=10 years and with vitamin D deficiency. The association between Col1A1 Sp1-binding site gene polymorphisms and osteonecrosis has to be assessed in a larger group of ALL survivors.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Bone mineral density', '*Genetic polymorphism', '*Osteonecrosis', '*Osteoporosis']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4273-7951', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0721-1025', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7939-5153', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7874-3734', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6269-187X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2696-0195', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5760-8007']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be an underlying cause of these inevitable drug resistance and tumor regrowth, but how CSCs are regulated is largely unknown. We demonstrate here for the first time the existence of CSC-like subpopulations that are modulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in MCL cell lines and patient-derived primary cells in an inverse correlation with bortezomib (BTZ) sensitivity. Using various known donors and inhibitors of cellular superoxide (O2(-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radical (OH), we unveil their distinct roles in the regulation of CSC-like subpopulations and thus MCL response to BTZ. O2(-) inhibits CSC-like cells and sensitizes BTZ-induced apoptosis, whereas H2O2 conversely enriches CSC-like cells and protects against apoptosis and OH has minimal effects. We further observed that an anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and a transcription factor Zeb-1 are favorable targets of O2(-) and H2O2, respectively. Using small molecule inhibition, ectopic expression and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene manipulation, we verified the roles of Mcl-1 and Zeb-1 in CSC and apoptosis regulation by O2(-) and H2O2. Our findings provide a novel mechanistic insight into the significance of redox status of MCL cells in determining their drug response via CSC-like subpopulations, which are imperative to a better understanding of therapeutic resistance and relapse.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bortezomib', '*Cancer stem cells', '*Mantle cell lymphoma', '*Mcl-1', '*Reactive oxygen species', '*Zeb-1']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2018 Aug 24.,"Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in women worldwide. Bharangin is a diterpenoid quinonemethide that has demonstrated therapeutic potential against leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma cells. Whether this diterpenoid exhibit activities against breast cancer cells and the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Herein, we provide evidence that bharangin suppresses the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468 and T-47D breast cancer cells. As examined by AO/PI staining, DAPI staining, sub-G1 analysis, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase activation, DNA laddering, and poly-ADP ribose polymerase cleavage, the diterpenoid induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The growth inhibitory effect of bharangin on breast cancer cells was further confirmed from colony-formation assay. Furthermore, the cancer cell migration was also suppressed by the diterpenoid. Mechanistically, bharangin was found to modulate multiple cancer related cell signalling pathways in breast cancer cells. Bharangin suppressed the expression of cell survival and invasive proteins, and induced Bax and mitochondrial depolarization in breast cancer cells. The diterpenoid also suppressed the activation of pro-inflammatory transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB induced by okadaic acid. Finally, the diterpenoid induced the expression of tumor suppressor lncRNAs (MEG-3, GAS-5), while down-regulating oncogenic H19 expression. Overall, these results suggest that bharangin exhibits anti-carcinogenic, anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory activities against breast cancer cells. The modulation of lncRNA expression and inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by bharangin may contribute to its anti-carcinogenic activities.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2018 Oct 24.,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Diabetes is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic disease. The initiating factor of atherosclerosis is local endothelial cell injury. The arachidonic acid metabolite, 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12[S]-HETE), might be involved in this process. In recent years, some studies have discussed the effect of 12(S)-HETE on vascular endothelial cell function. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 12(S)-HETE on vascular endothelial cell function in high-glucose conditions and the mechanisms involved. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in conventional M199 medium and high-glucose M199 medium. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with 12(S)-HETE and cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxy-alpha-cyanocinnamate (a 12/15-lipoxygenases inhibitor). A type 1 diabetes mellitus model was established in C57BL/6 or 12/15-lipoxygenases knockout mice with streptozotocin. Aortic tissue was harvested for subsequent testing. The transmembrane transport of dextran and human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1) cells was measured. The adherens junction protein, IkBalpha, nuclear factor kappa Bp65 (P65), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 expression and phosphorylation, and the binding/dissociation of endothelial cell components were observed. RESULTS: Transendothelial migration of dextran and THP-1 cells was significantly increased by stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers with high glucose and 12(S)-HETE (P < 0.05). High glucose and 12(S)-HETE altered the vascular endothelial cadherin and beta-catenin phosphorylation level, and promoted the dissociation of beta-catenin and vascular endothelial cadherin. Expression levels of P-Ikbalpha, P-P65, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 were elevated in high glucose and 12(S)-HETE treated cells and diabetic mice compared with controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The lipoxygenases metabolite, 12(S)-HETE, can impair vascular endothelial permeability by altering adherens junction phosphorylation levels, and affecting the binding and dissociation of its components in high-glucose conditions.",['NOTNLM'],"['12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid', 'Endothelial permeability', 'High glucose']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5284-2213'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

ASXL2 and ZBTB7A genes were sequenced using bone marrow samples of 41 AML patients with t(8;21) and 14 with inv(16). The relative expression levels of AE9a were quantified using the real-time PCR assay in 23 AML patients with t(8;21). We identified ASXL2 (34.1%) and ZBTB7A (9.8%) mutations in only AML patients with t(8;21). ASXL2-mutated patients had a significantly higher WBC count at diagnosis (P = 0.04) and a lower frequency of sex chromosome loss than wild-type patients (33 vs. 76%, respectively, P = 0.01). KIT mutations were the most frequently accompanied with both ASXL2 (36%) and ZBTB7A (75%) mutations. Neither ASXL2 nor ZBTB7A mutations had an impact on overall or event-free survival. Patients harboring cohesin complex gene mutations expressed significantly higher levels of AE9a than unmutated patients (P = 0.03). In conclusion, ASXL2 and ZBTB7A mutations were frequently identified in Japanese AML patients with t(8;21), but not in those with inv(16). Further analysis is required to clarify the detailed biological mechanism of AE9a regulation of the cohesin complex.",['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1/2', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Core-binding factor', 'RUNX1-RUX1T1 transcript', 'ZBTB7A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6382-9498'],,,,,['Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies that met our inclusion criteria were reviewed on methodological quality, while the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for evidence synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 2644 articles were identified from the database search. After screening based on the eligibility (abstracts) and inclusion (full texts) criteria, 49 articles remained. Even though the risk-of-bias scores in the studies were generally low, yet the results from those with high-quality studies revealed that poor fitness levels were prevalent in individuals with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, brain tumor, and mixed cancer histories, compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: A global glance at CCS shows poor levels of fitness that is continuous and life-long even after active cancer treatment has ended. Nevertheless, the results presented in this review were based on a limited number of high-quality studies suggesting the need to for additional clinical trials in the topic area.",['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer survivor', 'Exercise capacity', 'Physical fitness', 'Survivor']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1559-1793'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monotherapy with selective FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown transient and limited efficacy due to the development of resistance. Arsenic trioxide (ATO, As2O3) has been proven effective in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and has shown activity in some cases of refractory and relapsed AML and other hematologic malignances. We explored the feasibility of combining FLT3 TKIs with ATO in the treatment of FLT3/ITD+ leukemias. The combination of FLT3 TKIs with ATO showed synergistic effects in reducing proliferation, viability and colony forming ability, and increased apoptosis in FLT3/ITD+ cells and primary patient samples. In contrast, no cooperativity was observed against wild-type FLT3 leukemia cells. ATO reduced expression of FLT3 RNA and its upstream transcriptional regulators (HOXA9, MEIS1), and induced poly-ubiquitination and degradation of the FLT3 protein, partly through reducing its binding with USP10. ATO also synergizes with FLT3 TKIs to inactivate FLT3 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of its downstream signaling targets, including STAT5, AKT and ERK. Furthermore, ATO combined with sorafenib, a FLT3 TKI, in vivo reduced growth of FLT3/ITD+ leukemia cells in NSG recipients. In conclusion, these results suggest that ATO is a potential candidate to study in clinical trials in combination with FLT3 TKIs to improve the treatment of FLT3/ITD+ leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide', 'internal tandem duplication', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST Conflict-of-interest disclosure: The authors declare no', 'competing financial interests.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 10.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy affecting pediatric and adult populations. Although the outcomes of ALL in children have improved markedly in previous years, limited treatment strategies are available at present for adult patients with ALL. Wee1 is a crucial cell cycle checkpoint kinase of G2/M that regulates cell cycle progression and maintains chromatin integrity. MK-1775, a selective inhibitor of Wee1 has recently been identified to be able to induce apoptosis of tumor cells by abrogating G2/M checkpoint. The present study investigated the anti-leukemic activity of MK-1775 alone and in combination with doxorubicin (Adriamycin((R)); ADM) in various human ALL cell lines. MK-1775 treatment induced apoptosis of ALL cells, accompanied by unscheduled mitotic entry and downregulation of Notch pathway. The anti-leukemic activity of MK-1775 was in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The data also indicated that it decreased the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ADM compared with the control group. The combination of MK-1775 and ADM induced an increased apoptotic rate compared with each agent alone. In addition, the human bone marrow stromal cell HS-5 cell line was detected to exhibit an increased IC50 value of MK-1775 treatment in contrast to ALL cell lines.

For therapeutic applications, substantial attention has been focused recently on the blockade of the IgE interaction with FcepsilonRIalpha. While exploring better options for preventing allergic diseases, we found that the Fab fragment of the rat anti-murine IgE antibody (Fab-6HD5) strongly inhibited passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in vivo, as well as spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) activity and beta-hexosaminidase release from basophilic leukemia cells in vitro. The in vivo effects of Fab-6HD5 pre-administration were maintained over a long period of time for at least 10 days. Using flow cytometry analysis, we also found that Fab-6HD5 did not recognize the IgE Cepsilon3 domain containing specific binding sites for FcepsilonRIalpha. Furthermore, deletion-mapping studies revealed that Fab-6HD5 recognized conformational epitopes on the Cepsilon2 domain of IgE. Given that the Cepsilon2 domain plays a key role in stabilizing the interaction of IgE with FcRIalpha, our results suggest that the specific binding of Fab-6HD5 to the Cepsilon2 domain prevents allergic reactions through destabilizing the preformed IgE-FcepsilonRIalpha complex on rat mast cells. Although the present study was performed using animal models, these findings support the idea that a certain antibody directed against IgE CH domains may contribute to preventing allergic diseases through interacting with IgE-FcepsilonRIalpha complex.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most tumor-relevant IDH1 mutations are deficient in the normal oxidization of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG), but gain the neomorphic activity of reducing alphaKG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), which drives tumorigenesis. We found previously that IDH1 mutants exhibit one of two reactivities: deficient alphaKG and moderate D2HG production (including commonly observed R132H and R132C) or moderate alphaKG and high D2HG production (R132Q). Here, we identify a third type of reactivity, deficient alphaKG and high D2HG production (R132L). We show that R132Q IDH1 has unique structural features and distinct reactivities towards mutant IDH1 inhibitors. Biochemical and cell-based assays demonstrate that while most tumor-relevant mutations were effectively inhibited by mutant IDH1 inhibitors, R132Q IDH1 had up to a 16 300-fold increase in IC50 versus R132H IDH1. Only compounds that inhibited wild-type (WT) IDH1 were effective against R132Q. This suggests that patients with a R132Q mutation may have a poor response to mutant IDH1 therapies. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that near the NADP(+)/NADPH-binding site in R132Q IDH1, a pair of alpha-helices switches between conformations that are more wild-type-like or more mutant-like, highlighting mechanisms for preserved WT activity. Dihedral angle changes in the dimer interface and buried surface area charges highlight possible mechanisms for loss of inhibitor affinity against R132Q. This work provides a platform for predicting a patient's therapeutic response and identifies a potential resistance mutation that may arise upon treatment with mutant IDH inhibitors.",['NOTNLM'],"['*IDH1', '*cancer metabolism', '*enzyme inhibitor', '*enzyme kinetics', '*enzyme mutation', '*molecular dynamics']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1334-1763', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8048-0205']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"Interleukin 7 (IL-7) and its receptor (IL-7R, a heterodimer of IL-7Ralpha and gammac) are essential for normal lymphoid development. In their absence, severe combined immunodeficiency occurs. By contrast, excessive IL-7/IL-7R-mediated signaling can drive lymphoid leukemia development, disease acceleration and resistance to chemotherapy. IL-7 and IL-7R activate three main pathways: STAT5, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/Erk, ultimately leading to the promotion of leukemia cell viability, cell cycle progression and growth. However, the contribution of each of these pathways towards particular functional outcomes is still not completely known and appears to differ between normal and malignant states. For example, IL-7 upregulates Bcl-2 in a PI3K/Akt/mTOR-dependent and STAT5-independent manner in T-ALL cells. This is a 'symmetric image' of what apparently happens in normal lymphoid cells, where PI3K/Akt/mTOR does not impact on Bcl-2 and regulates proliferation rather than survival. In this review, we provide an updated summary of the knowledge on IL-7/IL-7R-mediated signaling in the context of cancer, focusing mainly on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where this axis has been more extensively studied.",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*IL-7R', '*Interleukin 7', '*JAK/STAT pathway', '*PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway', '*T-ALL', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients with acute myeloid leukemia who received ASCT between 2001 and 2018 were included in the study. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 25 (23%) patients received one course of HiDAC, 42 (38%) patients received two courses of HiDAC, 34 (31%) patients received three courses of HiDAC and 9 (8%) patients received four courses of HiDAC. Median follow-up for survivors was 71 months (range 4-186) for all patients. The 3-year overall survival for patients who received one course of HiDAC and patients who received more than one course of HiDAC were 49% and 70%, respectively (p = 0.29). The 3-year disease free survival (DFS) for patients who received one course of HiDAC and patients who received more than one course of HiDAC were 38% and 66%, respectively (p = 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in OS between patients who received one or more than one consolidation chemotherapy. But there was nearly a statistically significant difference between patients who received one or more than one consolidation chemotherapy in DFS. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the administration of more than one consolidation chemotherapy may provide longer DFS, however the number of consolidation chemotherapy is not associated with statistically significant differences in overall outcomes.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'High-Dose cytarabine']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Aug 18.,"BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib compared with ofatumumab significantly improves progression-free and overall survival in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measures of well-being were assessed in RESONATE, where previously treated patients with CLL/SLL were randomized to receive ibrutinib 420 mg/day (n = 195) or ofatumumab (n = 196) for up to 24 weeks. Endpoints included hematologic function, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), disease-related symptoms, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), and medical resource utilization. RESULTS: With up to 24 months' follow-up (median, 16.4 months), 79% of cytopenic patients showed sustained hematologic improvement (82% with improved platelet count, 69% with improved hemoglobin) on ibrutinib versus 43% on ofatumumab (P < .0001). Higher rates of clinically meaningful improvement were demonstrated with ibrutinib versus ofatumumab for FACIT-F and EORTC global health. Greater improvement was observed in disease-related weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and abdominal discomfort with ibrutinib versus ofatumumab. Hospitalizations in the first 30 days occurred less frequently with ibrutinib than ofatumumab (0.087 vs. 0.184 events/patient; P = .0198). New-onset diarrhea was infrequent with ibrutinib after the first 6 months (47% at </=6 months vs. 5% at 12-18 months). With ibrutinib, grade >/= 3 hypertension occurred in 6%, grade >/= 3 atrial fibrillation in 4%, major hemorrhage in 2%, and tumor lysis syndrome in 1% of patients. CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib led to significant improvements in hematologic function and disease symptomatology versus ofatumumab, and can restore quality of life while prolonging survival in relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL.",['NOTNLM'],"[""*Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", '*Disease-related symptoms', '*Fatigue', '*Quality of life', '*Relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that addition of a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor (HPI) to ruxolitinib might improve response. Vismodegib is an HPI approved for treatment of locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma. The MYLIE study assessed the safety and efficacy of combining ruxolitinib with vismodegib in ruxolitinib-naive patients with MF and characterized the pharmacokinetics (PK) of vismodegib in this setting. METHODS: In this phase Ib study, ten patients with intermediate- or high-risk primary or secondary MF received open-label vismodegib (150 mg/day orally) and ruxolitinib (15 or 20 mg orally twice daily, depending on baseline platelet count) for up to 48 weeks, or until withdrawal or discontinuation. PK samples were collected throughout the study for comparison with other patient populations. Efficacy outcomes at week 24 included spleen response (>/= 35% reduction in volume by imaging) and improvement in bone marrow fibrosis by central and investigator assessment, symptom response (>/= 50% reduction in Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form Total Symptom score), and anemia response (per International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment revised response criteria). RESULTS: As of November 17, 2017, eight patients had completed 48 weeks of treatment with vismodegib and ruxolitinib; two discontinued treatment early. At week 24 (+/- 1 week), three patients experienced a spleen response by central review and no patients showed a 1-grade improvement in bone marrow fibrosis by central review. Five patients experienced symptom response at week 24, and no patients experienced an anemia response. The most common adverse events were muscle spasm (100% of patients), alopecia (70%), dysgeusia (50%), thrombocytopenia (50%), and nausea (40%); these events were predominantly grade 1/2. Three patients experienced a total of six serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of vismodegib and ruxolitinib was tolerable and no new safety signals were seen, but there was no evidence that the addition of vismodegib to ruxolitinib improved any of the efficacy outcome measures assessed. Further evaluation of this combination will not be pursued. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02593760 .

Monoclonal antibodies against cancer antigens have been successful strategies for only a handful of cancer types due to many reasons including lack of antibody specificity and complex nature of tumor milieu which interfere with antibody efficacy. Polyspecific antibodies are promising class of anti-cancer agents which can be directed at multiple tumor antigens to eradicate tumor cells more precisely and effectively. They may overcome some of these limitations and have already changed treatment landscape for some malignancies such as B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pre-clinical studies and early phase clinical trials have demonstrated that this approach may be an effective strategy even for solid tumors. This review focuses on the development of bispecific and trispecific antibody therapy for the treatment of solid tumor malignancies and highlights the potential they hold for future therapies to come.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bispecific antibody', '*Immunotherapy', '*Solid tumor', '*Trispecific antibody']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3282-7622'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can be regarded as an anticancer agent and used for combined therapy, owing to its oncostatic, antioxidant, and immunoregulatory activities. Retinoic acid is widely used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia; however, it has adverse effects on the human organism. We investigated the effect of melatonin and reduced concentrations of retinoic acid on the activation of proliferation in acute promyelocytic leukemiaon a cell model HL-60. The combined effect of these compounds leads to a reduction in the number of cells by 70% and the index of mitotic activity by 64%. Combined treatment with melatonin and retinoic acid decreased the expression of the Bcl-2. The mitochondrial isoform VDAC1 can be a target in the treatment of different tumors. The combined effect of and retinoic acid at a low concentration (10 nM) decreased VDAC1 expression. Melatonin in combination with retinoic acid produced a similar effect on the expression of the translocator protein. The coprecipitation of VDAC with 2',3'-cyclonucleotide-3'-phosphodiesterase implies a possible role of its in cancer development. The combined effect of retinoic acid and melatonin decreased the activity of the electron transport chain complexes. The changes in the activation of proliferation in HL-60 cells, the mitotic index, and Bcl-2 expression under combined effect of retinoic acid (10 nM) with melatonin (1 mM) are similar to changes that are induced by 1 muM retinoic acid.

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"BACKGROUND: Male sex is associated with an increased risk of childhood cancer as is high birthweight. Given that sex determination precedes birthweight we conducted a mediation analysis to estimate the direct effect of sex in association with childhood cancer tumor type with birthweight as the mediator. METHODS: Cases (n = 12,632) and controls (n = 64,439) (ages 0-14 years) were identified from population-based cancer and birth registries in Minnesota, New York, and Washington states (1970-2014). An inverse odds weighting (IOW) mediation analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) as the measure of association between sex and cancer. RESULTS: A significant indirect effect was observed for sex and lymphoid leukemia, mediated by birthweight (indirectOR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.04). We observed significant direct effects for male sex and lymphoid leukemia (directOR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.08-1.25), Hodgkin lymphoma (directOR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.22-1.81), Burkitt lymphoma (directOR: 5.02; 95% CI: 3.40-7.42), other non-Hodgkin lymphoma (directOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.18-1.70), intracranial embryonal tumors (directOR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.26-1.76), hepatoblastoma (directOR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.40-2.59), and rhabdomyosarcoma (directOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.19-1.81). There were also inverse associations for extracranial GCTs (directOR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26-0.63) and thyroid carcinoma (directOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.25-0.50). CONCLUSION: Significant direct effects for sex and numerous childhood cancer types suggests sex-specific factors such as differences in gene expression from the autosomes or the X chromosome, rather than birthweight, may underlie sex differences in tumor risk.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Birthweight', '*Childhood cancer', '*Mediation analysis', '*Sex-disparity']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Sep 22.,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the combinatorial effects of IM and a novel HDAC inhibitor AR-42 on the proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, migration and invasion of CML cells, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. MAIN METHODS: We assessed the ability of the pan-HDAC inhibitor AR-42 and IM, to synergistically kill CML cells by survival, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration and invasion assays in vitro. We also assessed the HDAC1 expression by Western blot and real-time PCR. Synergy was calculated using combinatorial indices as determined by CalcuSyn. KEY FINDINGS: We found that Combining AR-42 with IM synergistically inhibited CML cell proliferation, enhanced cell apoptosis, induced cell cycle arrest, and decreased migration and invasion. The expression of HDAC1 in K562R cells was higher than that in K562 cells. AR-42 enhanced IM-induced HDAC1 expression inhibition in K562 and K562R cells. Importantly, HDAC1 overexpression partly reversed the apoptosis, G2/M phase arrest, migration and invasion of K562 cells induced by the combination of IM with AR-42. Moreover, HDAC1 knockdown partly promoted K562R cell apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest, migration and invasion induced by IM in combination with AR-42. SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, AR-42 may increase the sensitivity of CML cells to IM and reverse IM resistance by regulating HDAC1 expression. This study provides new insights into the effects of combined therapy using IM and pan-HDAC inhibitor AR-42, paving the way for overcoming IM resistance in clinical practice.",['NOTNLM'],"['AR-42', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Combination therapy', 'HDAC1', 'Imatinib']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The tumour-like tissue samples were closely examined for common oncogenic avian viruses in cell culture and further analysed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During 2010-2012, Marek's disease virus (MDV) mono-infection was found to be the dominant cause of the tumour incidences (52.4%, 11/21) followed by co-infection of MDV+ALVs (19.1%, 4/21). Starting from the year 2013 the mono-infection of avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) became the dominant agent of the tumour cases (83.3%, 5/6). During the most recent four years (2014-2017), co-infections involving ALV-J and MDV or between ALV subgroups have increased (23.4% and 18.5%, respectively), but each of the co-infections was still slightly lower than the ALV-J mono-infection incidence (33.3%). In contrast to the dominant MDV mono-infection cases before 2013, more recently, the emerging ALV-J mono-infection and ALV-J co-infections were largely responsible for the occurrence of avian virus-induced tumour incidences in the commercial local Yellow breeds of chickens in southern China.

UC were detected in 23/191 patients (12%). The composition of UC showed great variability. The only recurrent combination of abnormalities was del(5q) and + 8 in 8 of 23 patients (35%). In patients with clonal evolution, the clone size of the primary and secondary clone varied: Patients with -7 and + 8 in the primary clone showed a larger primary and a smaller secondary clone (-7: median 74% vs 10%; +8 73% vs 18%) while patients with del(5q) in the primary clone showed a smaller primary and a larger secondary clone (33% vs 61%). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no significant differences regarding overall or AML-free survival between the clonal subtypes. Only the subtype 3C (3 abnormalities and clonal evolution) was an independent risk factor for developing AML (Hazard Ratio 5.5 as compared to subtype 2A, P < .05).

In vitro studies demonstrated the anticancer potential of these compounds at lower concentrations than those of other clinically used chemotherapeutics, such as melphalan and chlorambucil. In particular, compound 10, bearing an amino acid ester chain, is selectively cytotoxic toward breast cancer and leukemia cells that have inherently high levels of reactive oxygen species. Importantly, 10 was 10-14-fold more efficacious than melphalan and chlorambucil for triple-negative breast-cancer (TNBC) cells. Similarly, 10 is more toxic toward primary chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia cells than either chlorambucil or the lead compound, 9. The introduction of an amino acid side chain improved the solubility and permeability of 10. Furthermore, 10 inhibited the growth of TNBC tumors in xenografted mice without obvious signs of general toxicity, making this compound an ideal drug candidate for clinical development.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1411-1572', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5627-0606']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 3.,"The unique bone marrow microenvironment is created by stromal cells and such physical conditions as hypoxia. Both hypoxia and interactions with stromal cells have a significant impact on the biology of leukemia cells, changing their sensitivity to antileukemic therapies. Thus, it is crucial to introduce biological systems, which enable the investigation of leukemia-stroma cross-talk and verification of novel therapies effectiveness under such bone marrow niche-mimicking conditions. Here, we have established an experimental setup based on the hypoxic co-culture of stromal cells with different cell lines derived from various leukemia patients. Flow cytometry enables simultaneous fluorescent tracking of viable cells and analysis of fundamental cellular processes, also to monitor the basal vital state of cells in the hypoxic co-culture. This is critically important, as the stromal cells deliver a big variability of signals to protect leukemia cells and provide drug resistance. Therefore, keeping stromal cells at the healthy state is crucial during experimental procedures. In the proposed studies, viability, apoptosis, proliferation, ROS production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were monitored in both cell types, which were separated on the basis of the fluorescence of a cell tracker. We have shown that the proposed hypoxic co-culture conditions do not affect basal live parameters of stromal cells, indicating the relevance of proposed model. Finally, we utilized this experimental setup to monitor the stroma-mediated protection of leukemia cells from the imatinib-induced cell death, which contributes to the leukemia progression and development of therapy resistance. Altogether, we recommend such flow cytometric strategy as an elementary screen of the vital state of stromal cells, which should be performed when using the co-culture hypoxic models. The proposed approach can also be broadly used for other studies of the leukemia-stroma cross-talk and of the part played by the leukemic microenvironment in drug screening studies.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ROS', '*apoptosis', '*cell tracking', '*co-culture', '*hypoxia', '*leukemia microenvironment', '*mitochondrial membrane potential', '*proliferation dye', '*stromal cells', '*viability']",,,,,,,['(c) 2018 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Children with ALL treated without cranial radiation therapy (n = 160; median age, 5.1 years; 58.1% male) were followed prospectively for 6 years. Spinal deformity index (SDI) was used to quantify VF status. Results: Baseline height z score +/- SD was 0.3 +/- 1.2. It fell by 0.5 +/- 0.4 in the first 6 months for boys and by 0.4 +/- 0.4 in the first 12 months for girls (P < 0.01 for both) and then subsequently recovered. The prevalence of VF peaked at 1 year (17.6%). Among those with VF, median SDI rose from 2 [interquartile range (IQR): 1, 7] at baseline to 8 (IQR: 1, 8) at 1 year. A mixed model for repeated measures showed that height z score declined by 0.13 (95% CI: 0.02 to 0.24; P = 0.02) for each 5-unit increase in SDI during the previous 12 months. Every 10 mg/m2 increase in average daily GC dose (prednisone equivalent) in the previous 12 months was associated with a height z score decrement of 0.26 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.32; P < 0.01). Conclusions: GC likely plays a major role in the observed height decline during therapy for ALL. Because only a minority of children had VF, fractures could not have contributed significantly to the height deficit in the entire cohort but may have been important among the subset with VF.",,,,,,,,['Canadian STOPP Consortium'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) is an IL-6 family cytokine with cytoprotective properties. This preclinical study in rats tested whether CT-1 mitigates cold renal ischemia-reperfusion injury in the context of the transplantation of long-time preserved kidneys. METHODS: Kidneys were flushed with cold (4 degrees C) University of Wisconsin solution containing 0.2 mug/mL CT-1 and stored for several periods of time at 4 degrees C in the same solution. In a second approach, kidneys were first cold-preserved for 6 hours and then were perfused with University of Wisconsin solution containing CT-1 (0, 16, 32, or 64 mug/mL) and further cold-preserved. Organ damage markers were measured in the kidneys at the end of the storage period. For renal transplantation, recipient consanguineous Fischer rats underwent bilateral nephrectomy and received a previously cold-preserved (24 hours) kidney as described above. Survival and creatinine clearance were monitored over 30 days. RESULTS: Cardiotrophin-1 in perfusion and preservation fluids reduced oxidative stress markers (superoxide anion and inducible nitric oxide synthase), inflammation markers (NF-kappaB and tumor necrosis factor-alpha), and vascular damage (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) and activated leukemia inhibitory factor receptor and STAT-3 survival signaling. Transplantation of kidneys cold-preserved with CT-1 increased rat survival and renal function (ie, lower plasma creatinine and higher creatinine clearance) and improved kidney damage markers after transplantation (ie, lower superoxide anion, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and higher NF-kappaB). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiotrophin-1 represents a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce ischemia-reperfusion and cold preservation injury to rescue suboptimal kidneys and, consequently, to improve the clinical outcomes of renal transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These approaches have generated contradictory results. We compare these approaches using observed and simulated data. METHODS: We generated 10,000 simulated regions using the correlation structure and distributions from a United Kingdom dataset. We simulated cases using a Poisson distribution with the incidence rate set to the national average assuming the null hypothesis that only population size drives the number of cases. Selection of areas within each simulated region was based on characteristics considered responsible for elevated infection rates (population density and inward migration) and/or elevated leukemia rates. We calculated effect estimates for 10,000 simulations and compared results to corresponding observed data analyses. RESULTS: When the selection of areas for analysis is based on apparent clusters of childhood leukemia, biased assessments occur; the estimated 5-year incidence of childhood leukemia ranged between zero and eight per 10,000 children in contrast to the simulated two cases per 10,000 children, similar to the observed data. Performing analyses on region-wide data avoids these biases. CONCLUSIONS: Studies using nonrandom selection to investigate the association between childhood leukemia and population mixing are likely to have generated biased findings. Future studies can avoid such bias using a region-wide analytical strategy. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B431.",,,,,['Epidemiology. 2019 Jul;30(4):e26.

MATERIAL AND METHODS K562 leukemia cells were treated with various concentrations of DFO (10, 50, and 100 micromol/l) with or without 10 micromol/l ferric chloride for 12 h. Then, total cellular iron was detected. CCK-8 kit and flow cytometry were used for cell viability and apoptosis detection. In addition, expression of apoptosis-related genes was determined by Western blotting and qRT-PCR, respectively. RESULTS The results suggested that DFO significantly inhibited K562 cell viability and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that the protein and mRNA levels of Bax, p53, and Fas dose-dependently increased in DFO-treated K562 cells, while the level of Bcl-2 markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the findings showed that ferric chloride eliminated these effects on K562 cells caused by DFO treatment. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that DFO plays a protective role in leukemia via inhibiting leukemia cell viability and inducing cell apoptosis by the regulation of apoptosis-related genes expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Xerostomia commonly occurs as an adverse effect of drugs in asthma and leukemia, which alter the composition and flow of saliva and systemic diseases, including diabetes. It decreases the oral pH and significantly increases the development of plaque and dental caries. Aim: This study aims to evaluate and compare the dental caries status and salivary properties of children aged 5-14 years undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and asthma - in vivo. Materials and Methods: The study was divided into two parts: Part I: Oral examination was performed and dental caries status Decayed, Missing, Filled Teeth/ decayed, extraction, filled teeth (DMFT/deft) was noted and Part II: Salivary analysis was performed by GC Saliva-Check BUFFER kit to check for hydration, viscosity, pH of saliva, salivary flow, and buffering capacity. Statistical Analysis: All statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 21 statistical software version. Inferential statistics were performed using Chi-square test and ANOVA. Post hoc pairwise comparison was done using Post hoc Tukey's test. Results: The prevalence of mean DMFT/deft with regard to salivary properties was highest in leukemic patients followed in descending order by diabetic and asthmatic patients. Conclusions: Leukemic patients had significantly higher caries and decreased salivary properties while asthmatic patients showed the least caries prevalence and best salivary properties.",['NOTNLM'],"['Asthma', 'caries', 'diabetes mellitus', 'leukemia', 'salivary properties', 'xerostomia']",,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: HTLV-1 infection was screened using particle agglutination assay and confirmed via western blotting in 365 RA patients. Twenty-three HTLV-1-positive RA patients were included in the study cohort. Blood samples were obtained from these patients at each observation time point. The values of HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL) and serum soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL2-R), which are risk factors for ATL development, were measured using real-time PCR and enzyme immunoassay, respectively. Results: The study cohort comprised 79 person-years. The median HTLV-1 PVL and sIL2-R values of the HTLV-1-positive RA patients were 0.44 copies per 100 white blood cells (WBCs) and 406 U/mL, respectively. Three HTLV-1-positive RA patients showed a high PVL value. No remarkable changes were observed in the PVL and sIL2-R values during the observation period. However, one elderly HTLV-1-positive RA patient who had a high PVL value developed ATL during treatment with methotrexate and infliximab.

Epub 2018 Sep 23.,"OBJECTIVES: Erwinia asparaginase is used as a second-line formulation after a neutralizing hypersensitivity reaction to the first-line formulation of asparaginase. Here, we have performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of Erwinia asparaginase treatment. METHODS: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology ALL-10 or ALL-11 protocol were included and initially treated with PEGasparaginase in the intensification phase. The total treatment costs of this treatment phase, quality of life (QoL), and life years saved (LYS) were studied for two scenarios: (a) patients were switched to Erwinia asparaginase treatment after a hypersensitivity reaction, or (b) asparaginase would have been permanently stopped. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients were included. There was no difference in QoL between patients with and without a hypersensitivity reaction. The mean costs of the intensification phase per patient were $40,925 if PEGasparaginase could be continued, $175,632 if patients had to switch to Erwinia asparaginase, and $21,190 if asparaginase would have been permanently stopped. An extrapolation of the literature suggests that the 5-year event-free survival would be 10.3% lower without intensive asparaginase treatment if asparaginase is stopped after a reaction. Thus, the costs per LYS were $1892 for scenario 1 and $872 for scenario 2. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to Erwinia asparaginase increases the costs per LYS by $1020, which is modest in view of the total costs. Moreover, when asparaginase treatment can be completed by switching to Erwinia asparaginase, relapses-and consequential costs-will be avoided. Therefore, from a cost perspective, we recommend a switch to Erwinia asparaginase to complete asparaginase treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['*asparaginase', '*cost-effectiveness analysis', '*pediatric ALL']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7162-3243'],,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jan;66(1):e27497.

To test this hypothesis, the mice underwent transverse aortic constriction (3 weeks) were developed and the morphological evidence showed obvious interstitial fibrosis with TGF-beta1, Pin1 upregulation, and increase in PML SUMOylation. In neonatal mouse cardiac fi broblasts (NMCFs), we found that exogenous TGF-beta1 induced the upregulation of TGF-beta1 itself in a time- and dose-dependent manner, and also triggered the PML SUMOylation and the formation of PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), and consequently recruited Pin1 into nuclear to colocalize with PML. Pharmacological inhibition of TGF-beta signal or Pin1 with LY364947 (3 muM) or Juglone (3 muM), the TGF-beta1-induced PML SUMOylation was reduced significantly with downregulation of the messenger RNA and protein for TGF-beta1 and Pin1.

Microarray analysis was used to screen differentially expressed lncRNAs/miRNAs/mRNAs in primary AML cells. The expression of nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), miR-23a-3p, and structural maintenance of chromosome 1 alpha (SMC1A) in primary AML cells and THP-1 cells were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to analyze proliferation. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual-luciferase assays were performed to determine the correlation between miR-23a-3p and NEAT1 or SMC1A. The qRT-PCR illustrated that NEAT1 and SMC1A expression was decreased but that miR-23a-3p expression was increased in primary AML cells and THP-1 cells compared with that in normal cells. The RIP assay and dual-luciferase assay revealed the targeting relationship between miR-23a-3p and NEAT1 or SMC1A. The CCK-8 assay showed that the overexpression of NEAT1 and SMC1A or repression of miR-23a-3p inhibited cell proliferation. Flow cytometry showed that the upregulation of NEAT1 and SMC1A or repression of miR-23a-3p promoted apoptosis and affected the cell cycle. NEAT1 repressed the expression of miR-23a-3p, and therefore promoted SMC1A, which in turn suppressed myeloid leukemia cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis.",['NOTNLM'],"['*NEAT1', '*SMC1A', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*long noncoding RNA', '*miR-23a-3p']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6707-7916'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 24.,"BACKGROUND: Osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is the principal stage during the restoration and regeneration of bone tissue. Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation play a key role in the differentiation process of stem cells. In this study, the methylation status of the promoter region of ZBTB16 and Twist1 genes and their role in controlling osteoblastic differentiation in MSCs was investigated during the osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs. METHODS: The MSCs were cultured under standard conditions and differentiated into the osteoblasts. We had three treatment groups including 5-azacytidine (methylation inhibitor), metformin (Twist-inhibitor), and procaine (Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitor) and a non-treated group (control). Methylation level of DNA in the promoter regions was monitored by methylation specific-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Also, the mRNA levels of key genes in osteoblastic differentiation were measured using real-time PCR. RESULTS: ZBTB16 gene expression was upregulated, and promoter methylation was decreased. For Twist1 messenger RNA (mRNA) level decreased and promoter methylation increased during osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs. 5-Azacytidine caused a significant reduction in methylation and increased the mRNA expression of ZBTB16 and Twist1. Metformin repressed the Twist1 expression, and therefore osteoblastic differentiation was increased. On the opposite side, procaine could block the WNT/beta-catenin signaling pathway, as a consequence the gene expression of key genes involved in osteoblastic differentiation was declined. CONCLUSION: We found that methylation of DNA in the promoter region of ZBTB16 and Twist1 genes might be one of the main mechanisms that controlling the gene expression during osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs. Also, we could find an association between regulation of Twist1 and ZBTB16 genes and osteoblastic differentiation in MSCs by showing the relation between their expression and some key genes involved in osteoblastic differentiation. In addition, we found a connection between the Twist1 expression level and osteoblastic differentiation by using a Twist-inhibitor (metformin).",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*Twist1', '*ZBTB16', '*mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)', '*osteoblastic differentiation']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8110-7808', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6487-3551', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5847-3594', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7347-4272']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to grow, tumor cells require large quantities of nutrients involved in metabolic processes, and an increase in iron levels is known to contribute to cancer proliferation. Iron plays an important role in the active site of a number of proteins involved in energy metabolism, DNA synthesis and repair, such as ribonucleotide reductase, which induce G0/S phase arrest and exert a marked antineoplastic effect, particularly in leukemia and neuroblastoma. Iron-depletion strategies using iron chelators have been shown to result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Deferoxamine (DFO) was the first FDA-approved drug for the treatment of iron overload pathologies, and has also been recognized as having anticancer properties. The high cost, low permeability and short plasma half-life of DFO led to the development of other iron-chelating drugs. Pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) and its analogs chelate cellular iron by tridentate binding, and inhibit DNA synthesis more robustly than DFO, demonstrating an effective antiproliferative activity. Here, we investigated the biological effects of a PIH derivative, 3-chloro-N'-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)benzohydrazide (CHBH), known to be a lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A inhibitor. We showed that CHBH is able to induce cell proliferation arrest in several human cancer cell lines, including lung, colon, pancreas and breast cancer, at micromolar levels. Our findings indicate that CHBH exerts a dual anticancer action by strongly impairing iron metabolism and modulating chromatin structure and function.",['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'chromatin remodeling', 'epigenetics', 'iron chelating agent', 'novel therapies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is mutated in various myeloid neoplasms including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially at the Arg882 and associated with inferior outcomes. Here, we report that the DNMT3A-Arg882His/Cys (R882H/C) mutations led to inactivation of apoptosis through DNA damage signaling following the impairment of differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. Gene expression profiling analysis revealed aberrant expression of several cell-cycle and apoptosis-related genes, and the DNA methylation assay identified both hypo- and hypermethylation features in different regions throughout the whole genome of DNMT3A mutants-transduced myeloid cells. We found that DNMT3A-R882H/C mutations upregulated the expression of an antioxidant protein, pyroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2), at the mRNA and protein levels with decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Augmentation of ROS generation by ROS accumulating agent or by knockdown of PRDX2 from myeloid cells effectively increased drug sensitivity and apoptosis as a consequence of reduced cell proliferation. DNMT3A-R882C/H mutations decreased apoptosis induction in part by increasing the antioxidant capacity of the cell owing to upregulation of PRDX2. Molecularly, both DNMT3A-WT and R882H/C mutants interacted with PRDX2; and R882C/H mutation-induced hypomethylation increased PRDX2 expression which enhanced cell proliferation and growth with impairment of apoptosis, thereby contributing to leukemogenesis.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Sep 12.,"The microenvironment within the bone marrow (BM) contains support cells that promote leukemia cell survival and suppress host anti-tumor defenses. Galectins are a family of beta-galactoside binding proteins that are critical components in the tumor microenvironment. Galectin 1 (LGALS1) and Galectin 3 (LGALS3) as regulators of RAS signaling intracellularly and as inhibitors of immune cells extracellularly are perhaps the best studied members for their role in leukemia biology. Interest in Galectin 9 (LGALS9) is growing as this galectin has been identified as an immune checkpoint molecule. LGALS9 also supports leukemia stem cells (LSCs) though a mechanism of action is not clear. LGALS1 and LGALS3 each participate in a diverse number of survival pathways that promote drug resistance by supporting pro-tumor molecules such BCL2, MCL-1, and MYC and blocking tumor suppressors like p53. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have protein signatures that differ from healthy donor MSC. Elevated LGALS3 protein in AML MSC is associated with refractory disease/relapse demonstrating that MSC derived galectin impacts patient survival. LGALS3 is a critical determining factor whether MSC differentiate into adipocytes or osteoblasts so the galectin influences the cellular composition of the leukemia niche. Both LGALS3 and LGALS1 when secreted can suppress immune function. Both galectins can induce apoptosis of T cells. LGALS3 also modulates T cell receptor endocytosis and impairs interferon mediated chemokine production by binding glycosylated interferon. LGALS3 as a TIM3 binding partner acts to suppress T cell function. Galectins also impact leukemia cell mobilization and may participate in homing mechanisms. LGALS3 participates in transport mechanism of integrins, receptors, and other molecules that control cell adhesion and cell:cell interactions. The diversity of these various functions demonstrate the importance of these galectins in the leukemia niche. This review will cover the role of LGALS1, LGALS3, and LGALS9 in the various processes that are critical for maintaining leukemia cells in the tumor microenvironment.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

To identify new druggable targets alternative to BCR/ABL, we investigated the role of the MEK5/ERK5 pathway in LSC maintenance in low oxygen, a feature of bone marrow stem cell niches. We found that MEK5/ERK5 pathway inhibition reduced the growth of CML patient-derived cells and cell lines in vitro and the number of leukemic cells in vivo. Treatment in vitro of primary CML cells with MEK5/ERK5 inhibitors, but not TKi, strikingly reduced culture repopulation ability (CRA), serial colony formation ability, long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs), and CD26-expressing cells. Importantly, MEK5/ERK5 inhibition was effective on CML cells regardless of the presence or absence of imatinib, and did not reduce CRA or LTC-ICs of normal CD34+ cells. Thus, targeting MEK/ERK5 may represent an innovative therapeutic approach to suppress CML progenitor/stem cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*ERK5/MAPK', '*MAP2K5', '*MAPK7', '*combination therapy', '*hypoxia', '*leukemia stem cells', '*microenvironment', '*stem cell niche', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors/TKi']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Sep 14.,"Therapeutic options for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who have failed prior therapies are limited particularly after hypomethylating agent. Several studies have indicated that deregulation of innate immunity signaling is critical in the pathogenesis of MDS. This process involves Toll-like receptor stimulation, cytokine overexpression, and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation. Since ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, suppresses NF-kB expression, we conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study to determine the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation. Nineteen patients, 8 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 11 with MDS, were enrolled. No dose limiting toxicity was observed and the maximum tolerated dose was 20 mg twice daily. Responses were restricted to MDS patients with an overall response rate of 22% [hematological improvement in platelets (HI-P) = 2, hematological improvement in erythrocytes (HI-E) = 1, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) = 1]. Of these patients, 2 relapsed (HI-P and PCyR) and 2 continue to be in HI-P and HI-E, respectively, with ongoing therapy. Meaningful improvement in bone marrow dysplasia was only seen in a patient who achieved HI-E. Phosphorylated p65 (pp65) decreased in 6 of 15 patients (40%) including the 2 patients with continued response to treatment and increased in a patient who relapsed after a short-lived HI-P. This suggests potential correlation between reduction in pp65 expression and response duration. In conclusion, ruxolitinib was well-tolerated in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation and resulted in low but significant frequency of responses.

By combining proteomic, metabolomic, and bioergenetic analyses, we identify two molecular subgroups, low- and high-OXPHOS. While low-OXPHOS exhibit a glycolytic metabolism, high-OXPHOS HGSOCs rely on oxidative phosphorylation, supported by glutamine and fatty acid oxidation, and show chronic oxidative stress. We identify an important role for the PML-PGC-1alpha axis in the metabolic features of high-OXPHOS HGSOC. In high-OXPHOS tumors, chronic oxidative stress promotes aggregation of PML-nuclear bodies, resulting in activation of the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha. Active PGC-1alpha increases synthesis of electron transport chain complexes, thereby promoting mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, high-OXPHOS HGSOCs exhibit increased response to conventional chemotherapies, in which increased oxidative stress, PML, and potentially ferroptosis play key functions. Collectively, our data establish a stress-mediated PML-PGC-1alpha-dependent mechanism that promotes OXPHOS metabolism and chemosensitivity in ovarian cancer.",['NOTNLM'],"['*OXPHOS', '*PGC-1alpha', '*chemoresistance', '*ferroptosis', '*ovarian cancer', '*oxidative stress', '*peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein', '*reactive oxygen species', '*response to treatment']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Nov 12.,"The expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) is thought to be an essential molecular basis of neuronal plasticity for higher brain function. Many IEGs contain serum response element in their transcriptional regulatory regions and their expression is controlled by serum response factor (SRF). SRF is known to play a role in concert with transcriptional cofactors. However, little is known about how SRF cofactors regulate IEG expression during the process of neuronal plasticity. We hypothesized that one of the SRF-regulated neuronal IEGs, activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc; also termed Arg3.1), is regulated by an SRF coactivator, megakaryoblastic leukemia (MKL). To test this hypothesis, we initially investigated which binding site of the transcription factor or SRF cofactor contributes to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-induced Arc gene transcription in cultured cortical neurons using transfection and reporter assays. We found that BDNF caused robust induction of Arc gene transcription through a cAMP response element, binding site of myocyte enhancer factor 2, and binding site of SRF in an Arc enhancer, the synaptic activity-responsive element (SARE). Regardless of the requirement for the SRF-binding site, the binding site of a ternary complex factor, another SRF cofactor, did not affect BDNF-mediated Arc gene transcription. In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed occupation of MKL at the SARE. Furthermore, knockdown of MKL2, but not MKL1, significantly decreased BDNF-mediated activation of the SARE. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel mechanism by which MKL2 controls the Arc SARE in response to BDNF stimulation.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Arc', '*BDNF', '*MKL', '*SARE', '*SRF', '*TCF']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6315-9594', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8168-3410']",,,,,,['(c) 2018 International Society for Neurochemistry.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients in 2 groups based on DRI, to assess the impact of conditioning intensity on overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), relapse, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). A total of 380 patients with either high/very high (n = 148) or low/intermediate DRI (n=232) myeloid malignancy (AML, n = 278; MDS, n=102) were included in the analysis. Median follow-up for survivors was 35 months. Median age was 58years (range, 18 to 75). Patient and transplant-related characteristics were 41% reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC), 59% myeloablative conditioning (MAC), 13% bone marrow graft, 29% matched related donor, 49% matched unrelated donor, 22% haploidentical donor, and 52% HCT-specific comorbidity index >/= 3. Among patients with high/very high DRI, there was no difference in OS, DFS, relapse, and NRM between RIC and MAC conditioning groups. For low/intermediate risk DRI recipients of MAC had better 3-year OS estimate (69% versus 57%, P = .001), DFS (65% versus 51%, P = .003), and lower relapse (3-year cumulative incidence, 17% versus 32%; P = .01) but similar NRM (19% versus 17%, P = .04) to RIC recipients. On multivariable analysis MAC was associated with better DFS (hazard ratio [HR], .58; 95% confidence interval [CI], .39-.88; P = .01), lower relapse (HR, .56; 95% CI, .32 to .97; P = .038), and similar NRM (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, .54 to 2.26; P = .781) compared with RIC in the low/intermediate DRI group. Intensity had no impact on HCT outcomes in the high/very high DRI group. MAC improves DFS and relapse compared with RIC among AML/MDS patients with low/intermediate DRI. The finding of no such benefit in high/very high DRI needs to be further explored in a larger cohort with a longer follow-up.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Conditioning', '*DRI', '*Intensity', '*Myeloid']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a high-risk treatment option for patients with hematologic malignancies. Advanced age and obesity can impact outcomes after allo-HCT. Previous registry studies of all age groups found that obesity does not affect outcomes. However, obesity can accelerate age-related decline in physical function and exacerbate comorbid conditions in older patients. Studies evaluating the effect of obesity on elderly patients undergoing allo-HCT are lacking. We performed a retrospective analysis of 86 nonobese (body mass index [BMI] <30) and obese (BMI >/=30) patients age >/=60 years who underwent allo-HCT for myeloid malignancies between January 2010 and June 2015. We found no significant between-group differences in mean age, sex, comorbid conditions, cytogenetic risk, disease indication for transplantation, or donor type. The median overall survival (OS) was 36 months for the BMI <30 group and 24 months for the BMI >/=30 group (P=.55). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.1 months in the BMI <30 group and 13.6 months in the BMI >/=30 group (P=.93). There were no significant between-group differences in acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 1 year post-transplantation. Among patients admitted for transplantation, the mean length of stay was 25 days in the BMI <30 group and 26 days in the BMI >/=30 group (P=.64). The rate of readmission within 30 days of discharge was significantly higher in the BMI >/=30 group (34% versus 16%; P=.045). Our data reveal that in these elderly patients with myeloid malignancies undergoing allo-HCT, clinical outcomes, including OS, PFS, and GVHD, were not affected by obesity. Thus, in elderly patients, obesity should not preclude consideration for curative allo-HCT and does not portend worse outcomes after allo-HCT.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic transplantation', '*Myeloid malignancy', '*Obesity']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"Children with acute leukemia who relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have few therapeutic options. We studied 251 children and young adults with acute myelogenous or lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent a second HCT for relapse after their first HCT. The median age at second HCT was 11 years, and the median interval between first and second HCT was 17 months. Most of the patients (n=187; 75%) were in remission, received a myeloablative conditioning regimen (n=157; 63%), and underwent unrelated donor HCT (n=230; 92%). The 2-year probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 33% after transplantation in patients in remission, compared with 19% after transplantation in patients not in remission (P=.02). The corresponding 8-year probabilities were 24% and 10% (P=.003). A higher rate of relapse contributed to the difference in LFS. The 2-year probability of relapse after transplantation was 42% in patients in remission and 56% in those in relapse (P=.05). The corresponding 8-year probabilities were 49% and 64% (P=.04). These data extend the findings of others showing that patients with a low disease burden are more likely to benefit from a second transplantation. Late relapse led to a 10% decrement in LFS beyond the second year after second HCT. This differs from first HCT, in which most relapses occur within 2 years after HCT.",['NOTNLM'],['*relapse acute leukemia second transplant'],,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Sep 20.,"Minimal residual disease (MRD) is widely used in oncohematology. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), it can be measured by flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction and is getting a greater place, owing to the dramatic therapeutic advances in the management this disease. As MRD decrease after chemoimmunotherapy is associated with improved progression free and overall survivals, its measure is now recommended as a surrogate marker for cytotoxic drugs licensures. This association is independent from treatment received and raises a few questions, such as sequential MRD measures to stop treatment in case of an early deep response and on the opposite, treatment continuation until reaching undetectable MRD (with the possible use of maintenance therapy). Furthermore, following MRD after a cytotoxic treatment could lead clinical trials investigators to propose pre-emptive treatments in case of MRD re-growth, to avoid overt relaspe. MRD re-growth kinetics and CD4 count after treatment completion can improve MRD-based survival predictions. On the other hand, BCR inhibitors do not lead to undetectable MRD, but their association with chemoimmunotherapy increases the proportion of patients reaching that goal. Moreover, BCL2 inhibitors do lead to deep response including in the relapse/refractory setting, giving to MRD a central place in currently investigated treatments evaluation.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chemoimmunotherapy', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Immunochimiotherapie', 'Leucemie lymphoide chronique', 'Maladie residuelle minime', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Target therapy', 'Therapie ciblee']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 Societe Francaise du Cancer.

Epub 2018 Oct 25.,"Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare hematologic disease characterized by intravascular hemolysis, thrombophilia, and marrow failure. Its phenotype is due to absent or reduced expression of GPI-linked complement regulators and subsequent sensitivity of hematopoietic cells to complement-mediated damage and lysis. Introduction of the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab drastically improved outcomes in PNH patients; however, despite this improvement, there remain several challenges faced by PNH patients and physicians who care for them. One of the most important is increasing awareness of the heterogeneity with which patients can present, which can lead to significant delays in recognition. Data from the Canadian PNH Registry are presented to demonstrate the variety of presenting symptoms. In Canada, geography precludes consolidation of care to just a few centers, so management is distributed across academic hospitals, linked together as the Canadian PNH Network. The Network over the last several years has developed educational programs and clinical checklists and has worked to standardize access to diagnostics across the country. Herein, we address some of the common diagnostic and therapeutic challenges faced by PNH physicians and give our recommendations. Gaps in knowledge are also addressed, and where appropriate, consensus opinion is provided.",['NOTNLM'],"['aplastic anemia and bone marrow failure', 'bone marrow transplantation', 'coagulation disorders', 'red cell disorders']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2089-8650', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1483-5546']",,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: A total of 48 women were included in this clinical study. Thepatients were allocated to two groups: study group consisted of 28 patients with myoma uteri and control group consisted of 20 patients without myoma uteri. Endometrial sampling was performed during the proliferative phase. The biopsies obtained from the patients with myoma uteri were taken from the place where the fibroids were localized. HOXA-10, HOXA-11, and LIF expressions were measured in the endometrial sampling material. Demographic data of the patients such as age, obstetric and gynecologic history, medical conditions, medications, surgical history, last menstrual period were recorded. Also, the number, size, localization, and type of the myoma were registered. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 42.07 and 38.17, respectively. HOXA-11 levels in the study and control groups were 0.004 +/- 0.001 and 0.010 +/- 0.001, respectively ( P < 0.90). Paradoxically, HOXA-10 levels were found to be higher in the study group than the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant ( P < 0.25). LIF levels were significantly lower in the study group ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Our results showed that myoma uteri might lead to a decrease in implantation rate by diminishing LIF gene expressions. However, there were no differences between the two groups in terms of HOXA-10 and HOXA-11 levels.",['NOTNLM'],"['*HOXA-10', '*HOXA-11', '*LIF', '*infertility', '*myoma uteri']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2282-6850'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 22.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematologic malignancy with significant molecular heterogeneity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in AML diagnosis, pathogenesis, and prognosis of AML. Little has been done to identify a miRNA signature in pediatric and adolescent patients for predicting overall survival. This study aims to identify a panel of miRNA signature that could predict the prognosis of all younger AML patients with all subtypes of AML by analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 229 patients under 23 years with miRNA data and corresponding clinical data from TCGA database were enrolled in this study. Through conducting multivariate analysis in the training test, it was identified that the high expression of hsa-miR-509 and hsa-miR-542 were independent poor prognostic factors, whereas that of hsa-miR-146a and hsa-miR-3667 had a trend to be favorable factors. A 4-miRNA signature was constructed by these miRNAs considering the weight of each. In testing group and all 229 patients' cohort as well as 59 cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients' cohort, higher risk score was associated with shorter overall survival (OS). All results were confidential by using powerful statistical analysis. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were carried out to further develop leukemia-relevant mechanisms supporting the model. The results indicate that the 4-miRNA-based signature is a reliable prognostic biomarker for pediatric and adolescent AML patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['*a 4-miRNA signature', '*pediatric and adolescent AML', '*prognosis']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2815-4568'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 9.,"Tyrosine kinases are checkpoints for multiple cellular pathways and dysregulation induces malignancies, most notably chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Inhibition of Abl-tyrosine kinases has evolved as a new concept for the treatment of CML and other malignant diseases. Due to the multiple immune-modulatory pathways controlled by tyrosine kinases, treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) will not only affect the biology of malignant cells but also modulate physiological immune functions. To understand the effects of TKIs on host defense against intracellular bacteria, we investigated the immunological impact of the dual Abl/Src TKI dasatinib on the cellular immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Our results demonstrate that dasatinib impaired proliferation, cytokine release (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF), expression of granulysin and degranulation of cytotoxic effector molecules of human Mtb-specific T-lymphocytes by inhibition of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) phosphorylation. Despite this profound inhibition of T-cell function, dasatinib suppressed growth of virulent Mtb in human macrophages co-cultured with autologous Mtb-specific T-cells (49+/-15%). Functional analysis suggested that growth inhibition is due to dasatinib-triggered lysosomal acidification in Mtb-infected macrophages. These results highlight the significance of innate immune responses, i.e. acidification of lysosomes, which control the multiplication of intracellular bacteria despite the lack of efficient T-cell support.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Human primary cells', '*T-cells', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitor', '*infection immunology', '*tuberculosis']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5471-0807'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

of patients through somatic mutations. Here we describe alternative, microenvironment-dependent mechanisms of Wnt activation in malignant B cells. We show that tumour cells specifically induce Notch2 activity in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) required for the transcription of the complement factor C1q. MSC-derived C1q in turn inhibits Gsk3-beta mediated degradation of beta-catenin in CLL cells. Additionally, stromal Notch2 activity regulates N-cadherin expression in CLL cells, which interacts with and further stabilises beta-catenin. Together, these stroma Notch2-dependent mechanisms induce strong activation of canonical Wnt signalling in CLL cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the Wnt pathway impairs microenvironment-mediated survival of tumour cells.

We compared health-related outcomes in childhood AML survivors treated according to the NOPHO-AML protocols either with or without allo-HSCT at age < 21 years. Out of the 147 eligible AML survivors treated with allo-HSCT, 95 (65%) and 53 (75%) of their eligible siblings completed a questionnaire. Their data were compared to corresponding data collected previously from NOPHO-AML survivors treated with chemotherapy only (CT) (n = 101). The median follow-up was 12 (range 2-28) years after allo-HSCT and 47% had received total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning. Allo-HSCT survivors reported significantly more physical health limitations (39% vs 7%, p < 0.005), medications for cardiovascular disease (10% vs 1%, p < 0.05) and use of analgesics (32% vs 11%, p < 0.01) than CT survivors. Health problems prevented 16% of the allo-HSCT survivors from attending school or managing a job vs. 3% among CT survivors (p < 0.05). Among 73 allo-HSCT survivors (age >/= 15 years), seven females reported natural pregnancies and three males reported unassisted conceptions in partners.

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"The hematopoietic system represents an organ system with an exceptional capacity for the production of mature blood cells from a small and mostly quiescent pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This extraordinary capacity includes self-renewal but also the propensity to rapidly respond to extrinsic needs, such as acute infections, severe inflammation, and wound healing. In recent years, it became clear that inflammatory signals such as cytokines, chemokine and danger signals from pathogens (PAMPs) or dying cells (DAMPs) impact on HSCs, shaping their proliferation status, lineage bias, and repopulating ability and subsequently increasing the output of mature effector cells. However, inflammatory danger signals negatively impact on the capacity of HSCs to self-renew and to maintain their stem cell capabilities. This is evidenced in conditions of chronic inflammation where bone marrow failure may originate from HSC exhaustion. Even in hematopoietic cancers, inflammatory signals shape the phenotype of the malignant clone as exemplified by necrosome-dependent inflammation elicited during malignant transformation in acute myeloid leukemia. Accordingly, understanding the contribution of inflammatory signals, and specifically necroinflammation, to HSC integrity, HSC long-term functionality, and malignant transformation has attracted substantial research and clinical interest. In this review, we highlight recent developments and open questions at the interplay between inflammation, regulated necrosis, and HSC biology in the context of blood cell development, acute and chronic inflammation, and hematopoietic cancer.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2454-0362'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS The liver cancer group (N=56) included patients with available tissue samples of histologically confirmed liver cancer. The control group (N=24) included histologically confirmed normal liver tissue samples. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot were used to detect and compare protein expression of Bmi-1 and WWOX in liver tissues in the liver cancer group and the control group. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect and compare mRNA expression of BMI-1 and WWOX in liver tissues in the liver cancer group and the control group. Expression levels of the protein and mRNA levels and the clinicopathological features including patient prognosis in liver cancer were evaluated statistically using analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS There were significant differences in the expression levels of protein and mRNA of BMI-1 and WWOX between the liver cancer group and the control group. BMI-1 mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased, and WWOX mRNA and protein expression were significantly reduced in liver cancer tissue, compared with normal liver tissue (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS In liver cancer tissue compared with normal liver, the expression of BMI-1 and WWOX mRNA and their protein products were upregulated and down-regulated, respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Richter syndrome (RS) is a lethal complication in CLL patients that results in aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and there are no tests to predict its occurrence. Because alterations in microRNA expression can predict the development and progression of several cancers, we investigated whether dysregulation of specific microRNAs can predict RS in CLL patients. Thus, we compared microRNA expression levels in samples from 49 CLL patients who later developed RS with samples from 59 CLL patients who did not. We found that high expression of miR-125a-5p or low expression of miR -34a-5p can predict approximately 50% of RS with a false positive rate of approximately 9%. We found that CLL patients predicted to develop RS show either an increase of miR-125a-5p expression ( approximately 20-fold) or a decrease of miR-34a-5p expression ( approximately 21-fold) compared with CLL patients that are not predicted to develop RS. Thus, miR-125a-5p and miR-34a-5p can be valuable predictor markers of RS and have the potential to provide physicians with information that can indicate the best therapeutic strategy for CLL patients.",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"CD8(+) induced regulatory T cells (iTregs) have been identified to suppress alloreactive immune responses and expressed regulatory T cell (Treg) ontological markers as similar as CD4(+) iTregs. However, adoptive transfer of CD8(+) iTreg-based therapy is hampered by the instability of Treg specific-transcription factor, Foxp3. As CD8(+) iTregs were previously demonstrated to possess superior tumor-killing ability to CD4(+) iTregs, adoptive transfer of stabilized CD8(+) iTregs would be a potential therapy to prevent tumor relapse during graft-versus-leukemia disease (GVHD) treatment. In the current study, we generated alloantigen reactive CD8(+) iTregs from JAK2(-/-) T cells and adoptively transferred them to MHC-mismatched and haploidentical murine models of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. JAK2(-/-) CD8(+) iTregs not only attenuated GVHD but also preserved graft-versus-leukemia effect. Mechanistic analysis revealed that JAK2(-/-) CD8(+) iTregs upregulated natural Treg marker (neuropilin-1), and augmented DNA demethylation of CNS2 region within Foxp3 gene. These properties licensed JAK2(-/-) CD8(+) iTregs to retain high Foxp3 expression resulting in less conversion to type 1 CTLs; as a result, JAK2(-/-) CD8(+) iTregs were able to maintain their suppressive and cytolytic function.

Epub 2018 Aug 22.,"BACKGROUND: The 2 main formulations of anthracycline used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) induction therapy are idarubicin (IDA) and daunorubicin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present systematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy and toxicity between IDA and high-dose daunorubicin (HDD) for induction therapy for adult AML. Relevant studies reported before June 2018 were searched from the Medline and Embase databases. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies with 1809 participants (3 randomized controlled studies and 2 retrospective cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The patients in the IDA arm for induction therapy had a significantly greater complete response rate after the first course of induction therapy compared with those in the HDD arm (66.7% vs. 61.1%, respectively; odds ratio, 1.23; P = .04; I(2) = 0%). A significantly lower rate of refractory AML was also observed in the IDA group than in the HDD group (16.8% vs. 20.7%, respectively; odds ratio, 0.77; P = .04; I(2) = 0%). However, no difference was found in the long-term overall survival between the 2 groups. Also, the induction mortality rate, febrile neutropenia rate, and cardiotoxicity rate were not significantly different between the 2 groups. The major limitation was the relatively small number of included studies, which could have limited the power of the meta-analysis to demonstrate significant long-term benefits. CONCLUSION: The complete response rate after the first course of induction therapy was significantly greater among adult patients with AML who had received IDA as part of induction therapy compared with those who had received HDD.",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Anthracycline', '*Complete remission', '*Idarubicin', '*Refractory']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Real-time PCR analysis revealed the expression of ENT1 and ENT2 mRNAs, but not of CNTs, in L5178Y-R cells and rat's PBMCs. In L5178Y-R cells, the uptake of MZR was suppressed by adenosine, a substrate for ENT1 and ENT2, but not by 5-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (0.1 muM), an ENT1 inhibitor. Saturable metabolism of MZR to MZRP was observed. In rats, peak plasma concentrations of MZR and peak concentrations of MZR and MZRP in PBMCs were observed 3 h after oral administration. MZR disappeared from PBMCs in parallel with plasma MZR, but the disappearance of MZRP from PBMCs appeared to be slow. In KTRs, the mean plasma concentration of MZR 3-4 h after ingestion was 3.14 mug/ml and the mean MZRP concentration in PBMCs was 16.8% of MZR, reflecting the involvement of ENT in the uptake of MZR. A linear relationship was observed between plasma MZR concentrations ranging from 1 to 6 mug/ml and PBMC's MZRP concentrations ranging from 90 to 200 ng/ml.",['NOTNLM'],"['Kidney transplant patients', 'L5178Y-R mouse lymphoma cells', 'Mizoribine', ""Mizoribine-5'-monophosphate"", 'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)', 'mRNA expression of ENTs']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 The Japanese Society for the Study of Xenobiotics.

This study estimated utilities for treatment-related health states of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and disutilities of severe adverse events (SAEs) using a representative sample of adults from the general population in the United States (US). METHODS: Treatment-related AML health states, defined based on literature and interviews with clinicians, included complete remission (CR), no CR, relapse, stem cell transplant (SCT), and post SCT short-term recovery. Six attributes with varying levels, including fever, lack of energy, problems with daily function, anxiety/depression, blood transfusions, and hospitalization, were used to define health states. An online survey using discrete choice experiment methodology was designed to capture preferences for health status scenarios including the identified attributes and key grade 3/4 chemotherapy-related SAEs. Health state utilities and SAE disutilities were generated from a conditional logistic regression with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Of the 300 survey participants, the demographic distributions were within a 3% margin of those in the 2010 US Census. CR had the highest utility value (0.875), followed by post-SCT short-term recovery (0.398), relapse (0.355), no CR (0.262), and SCT (0.158). Of the SAEs, serious infection had the highest decline in utility (0.218), followed by severe diarrhea (0.176), abnormally low blood cell counts (0.100), and severe redness/skin peeling (0.060). CONCLUSIONS: AML and treatments can result in reduced quality of life and impaired ability to perform daily activities. Findings of this study underline the value that society places on treatment-related AML health states and SAEs.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Discrete choice experiment', 'Health state', 'Preference valuation', 'Utility']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10.1186/s12885-018-4782-y.,"BACKGROUND: The combination of chemotherapy and L-asparaginase (L-ASP) treatment significantly increased survival rate in an adult patient with extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL). However, hypersensitivity reactions of L-ASP in some patients limited its application. Polyethylene glycol-conjugated asparaginase (PEG-ASP) has a lower immunogenicity and longer circulating half-life than unconjugated L-ASP, and has been reported to be effective and well-tolerated in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), oncovin (vincristine), and prednisolone (CHOP) is the most common chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this report, we sought to study the efficacy and safety of PEG-L- CHOP in NKTCL in adult Chinese patients. METHODS: Our study is a prospective, multi-center, open-label clinical trial. Patients with newly diagnosed adult NKTCL and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 were eligible for enrollment. Treatment included six cycles of PEG-L-CHOP regimen. Radiotherapy was scheduled after 2-4 cycles of PEG-L-CHOP regimen, depending on the stage and primary anatomic site. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 33 eligible patients. All 33 patients completed 170 cycles of chemotherapy combined with radical radiotherapy. The overall response rate was 96.9% (32/33) with 75.8% (25/33) achieving complete responses and 21.2% (7/33) achieving partial responses. The overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, 3-year were 100, 90.61 and 80.54%, respectively. The major adverse effects were bone marrow suppression, reduction of fibrinogen level, liver dysfunction, and digestive tract toxicities. No allergic reaction and no treatment-related mortality or severe complications were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-L-CHOP chemotherapy in combination radiotherapy is safe and durably effective treatment for adult extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma with fewer allergic reactions. This study was approved by the Peking University Beijing Cancer Hospital Ethics Review Committee (reference number: 2011101104).

This is particularly important when miRNAs are considered as candidate diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. Universal endogenous controls are lacking, thus candidate normalizers must be evaluated individually for each experiment. Here we present a strategy that we applied to the identification of optimal control miRNAs for RT-qPCR profiling of miRNA expression in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and in normal cells of T-lineage. First, using NormFinder for an iterative analysis of miRNA stability in our miRNA-seq data, we established the number of control miRNAs to be used in RT-qPCR. Then, we identified optimal control miRNAs by a comprehensive analysis of miRNA stability in miRNA-seq data and in RT-qPCR by analysis of RT-qPCR amplification efficiency and expression across a variety of T-lineage samples and T-ALL cell line culture conditions. We then showed the utility of the combination of three miRNAs as endogenous normalizers (hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-25-3p, and hsa-let-7a-5p). These miRNAs might serve as first-line candidate endogenous controls for RT-qPCR analysis of miRNAs in different types of T-lineage samples: T-ALL patient samples, T-ALL cell lines, normal immature thymocytes, and mature T-lymphocytes. The strategy we present is universal and can be transferred to other RT-qPCR experiments.",['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)', 'cell lines', 'endogenous controls', 'miRNA (microRNA)', 'normalization of miRNA expression in RT-qPCR', 'reference genes', 'tissue analysis']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1671-9071', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2879-1671', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3951-8013', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1866-6380', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3486-6577']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there is incomplete information on pediatric cancer incidence, diagnosis distribution, and treatment outcomes in Africa. Since 2007, a pediatric hematology-oncology program has been operating in Botswana through a partnership between the Botswana government, Baylor College of Medicine, and Texas Children's Hospital. METHODS: To better understand patient characteristics and outcomes at Botswana's only pediatric cancer program, a hospital-based data base-the Botswana Pediatric Oncology Database-was established in 2014. Children younger than 18 years of age at the time of diagnosis who presented between 2008 and 2015 were included. Data for this study were extracted in February 2016. RESULTS: Of the 240 potential enrollees, 185 (77%) children met eligibility for this study. The median age was 6.4 years, and 50.8% were male. Leukemia was the most common malignancy representing 18.9% of the cohort and 88.1% of the total cohort had a histopathologic diagnosis. HIV seropositivity was confirmed in 13.5%. The 2-year overall survival of all pediatric cancer diagnoses was 52.4%. Abandonment of treatment occurred in 3.8% of patients. CONCLUSION: In the first 9 years of the program, capacity has been developed through a longstanding partnership between Botswana and Baylor College of Medicine/Texas Children's Hospital that has led to children receiving care for cancer and blood disorders. Although continued improvements are necessary, outcomes to date indicate that children with cancer in Botswana can be successfully diagnosed and treated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A population-based cancer registry has been used in Addis Ababa (the capital city) since 2011. Availability of up-to-date estimates on cancer incidence is important in guiding the national cancer control program in Ethiopia. METHODS: We obtained primary data on 8,539 patients from the Addis Ababa population-based cancer registry and supplemented by data on 1,648 cancer cases collected from six Ethiopian regions. We estimated the number of the commonest forms of cancer diagnosed among males and females in Ethiopia and computed crude and age-standardized incidence rates. RESULTS: For 2015 in Ethiopia, we estimated that 21,563 (95% CI, 17,416 to 25,660) and 42,722 (95% CI, 37,412 to 48,040) incident cancer cases were diagnosed in males and females, respectively. The most common adult cancers were: cancers of the breast and cervix, colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and cancers of the prostate, thyroid, lung, stomach, and liver. Leukemia was the leading cancer diagnosis in the pediatric age group (age 0 to 14 years). Breast cancer was by far the commonest cancer, constituting 33% of the cancers in women and 23% of all cancers identified from the Addis Ababa cancer registry. It was also the commonest cancer in four of the six Ethiopian regions included in the analysis. Colorectal cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were the commonest malignancies in men. CONCLUSION: Cancer, and more prominently breast cancer, poses a substantial public health threat in Ethiopia. The fight against cancer calls for expansion of population-based registry sites to improve quantifying the cancer burden in Ethiopia and requires both increased investment and application of existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the Ethiopian population.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessing outcomes is essential for designing effective strategies to improve outcomes equally worldwide. We implemented a real-time surveillance system, VIGICANCER, embedded in a population-based cancer registry (PBCR) to assess childhood cancer outcomes. METHODS: VIGICANCER was established in 2009 as an integral part of Cali's PBCR to collect real-time data on outcomes of patients (age < 19 years) with a new diagnosis of cancer treated in pediatric oncology units in Cali, Colombia. Baseline and follow-up data (death, relapse, treatment abandonment, second neoplasms) were collected from medical records, hospital discharge logs, pathology reports, death certificates, and the National Public Health Insurance database. A quality assurance process was implemented for the system. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2013, data from 1,242 patients were included in VIGICANCER: 32% of patients were younger than 5 years, 55% were male, and 15% were Afro-descendants. International Classification of Childhood Cancer group I diagnoses predominated in all age groups except children younger than 1 year old, in whom CNS tumors predominated. Five-year overall survival for all cancers was 51.7% (95% CI, 47.9% to 55.4%) for children (< 15 years), and 39.4% (95% CI, 29.8% to 50.5%) for adolescents (15 to 18.9 years). Five-year overall survival for acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 55.6% (95% CI, 48.5% to 62.2%). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing a real-time childhood cancer outcomes surveillance system embedded in a PBCR that can guide interventions to improve clinical outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.",,,,,,,,['VIGICANCER Working Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Avascular necrosis of the femoral head (AVNFH) is one such adverse effect. A need exists for a therapy that ameliorates discomfort, provides a productive life, is cost effective, and is joint preservative. We conducted the current study to evaluate the response to bisphosphonate in the nonsurgical management of AVNFH in adolescents and young adults (AYA) who receive treatment for ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study of 20 AYA patients-34 affected hips-who received zolendronic acid 5 mg intravenously each year along with oral alendronate 70 mg weekly for 3 years. Clinical evaluation was performed by using the Visual Analog Scale and the Harris Hip Score. Radiographs were used to classify the Ficat-Arlet stage, monitor radiologic collapse, and evaluate the rate of progression. RESULTS: Pain relief with a drop in the Visual Analog Scale score was observed at a mean duration of 5.2 weeks (range, 3 weeks to 11 weeks) after the start of therapy. Radiologic progression by one grade was observed in 12 hips (35.3%), and only one hip (2.94%) showed progression by two grades. At a mean follow-up of 50.3 months, 31 affected hips (91.1%) had a satisfactory clinical outcome and had not required any surgical intervention. The proportion of hips that required total hip arthroplasty were 0%, 5%, and 22.2% in Ficat-Arlet stage I, II, and III, respectively. CONCLUSION: The combination of intravenous zolendronic acid and oral alendronate provides a pragmatic solution for the management of AVNFH after therapy for ALL in AYA patients. This therapy is safe, effective, and well tolerated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Mar 24.,"PURPOSE: The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors has transformed the care of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, with survival approaching that of healthy individuals. Current-day challenges in chronic myeloid leukemia care include adherence to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. We studied adherence from resource-constrained settings and tried to analyze the factors responsible for nonadherence in these individuals. We also correlated adherence to current molecular status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, cross-sectional, observational study from north India. It consisted of a questionnaire-based survey in which a one-to-one interview technique was used by trained nursing staff administering the Modified Morisky Adherence Scale (MMAS-9) questionnaire. Adherence was also measured on the basis of physician's assessment. JMP 13.0.0 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 333 patients with a median age of 42 years were included in the study. The median BCR-ABL/ABL ratio (IS) was 0.175 (0.0 to 98.0). The mean MMAS-9 score was 11 +/- 2. Adherence was seen in 54.95% on the basis of MMAS-9, whereas physician's assessment reported adherence in 90.39% of patients. Using the chi(2) test, no relationship was found between the two assessment techniques. There was a significant relationship between major molecular response status and adherence by physician's assessment and MMAS-9 ( P < .001). Bivariate analysis by logistic fit showed a good relation between the MMAS-9 score and the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio (IS), chi(2) (1,220) = 135.45 ( P < .001). On multivariate analysis, enrolment in the Novartis Oncology Access program (a patient assistance program) was significantly associated with adherence ( P = .012). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the lack of adherence in real-world settings and the various factors responsible. Such studies are important from a public health services perspective in various settings around the world because they may lead to corrective action being taken at the institutional level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to study the role of GM-CSF gene expression, its protein, and antibodies in patients with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndromes (AML/MDS) and their correlation to disease behavior and treatment outcome. The study included 50 Egyptian patients with AML/MDS in addition to 20 healthy volunteers as control subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Assessment of GM-CSF gene expression was performed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. GM-CSF proteins and antibodies were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: There was significant decrease in GM-CSF gene expression ( P = .008), increase in serum level of GM-CSF protein ( P = .0001), and increase in anti-GM-CSF antibodies ( P = .001) in patients with AML/MDS compared with healthy control subjects. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between serum levels of GM-CSF protein and initial peripheral blood blasts, percentage as well as response to therapy. CONCLUSION: Any alteration in GM-CSF gene expression could have implications in leukemogenesis. In addition, GM-CSF protein serum levels could be used to predict outcome of therapy.

Epub 2017 Oct 30.,"PURPOSE: Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in low-income countries have disproportionately lower cure rates than those in high-income countries. At Butaro Cancer Center of Excellence (BCCOE), physicians treated patients with ALL with the first arm of the Hunger Protocol, a graduated-intensity method tailored for resource-limited settings. This article provides the first published outcomes, to our knowledge, of patients with ALL treated with this protocol. METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study of patients with ALL enrolled at BCCOE from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2014; data were collected through December 31, 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to calculate patient demographics, disease characteristics, and outcomes; event-free survival was assessed at 2 years using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Forty-two consecutive patients with ALL were included. At the end of the study period, 19% (eight) were alive without evidence of relapse: three completed treatment and five were continuing treatment. Among the remaining patients, 71% (30) had died and 10% (four) were lost to follow-up. A total of 83% (25) of the deaths were disease related, 3% (one) treatment-related, and 13% (four) unclear. Event-free survival was 22% (95% CI, 11% to 36%), considering lost to follow-up as an event, and 26% (95% CI, 13% to 41%) if lost to follow-up is censored. CONCLUSION: As expected, relapse was the major cause of failure with this low-intensity regimen. However, toxicity was acceptably low, and BCCOE has decided to advance to intensity level 2. These results reflect the necessity of a data-driven approach and a continual improvement process to care for complex patients in resource-constrained settings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Dec 4.,"PURPOSE: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is associated with a range of medical conditions and medications. In this retrospective analysis, we present 19 pediatric patients with PRES who had undergone chemotherapy. METHODS: We identified four female and 15 male patients diagnosed with PRES on the basis of clinical and radiologic features. Patient charts were reviewed from January 2013 to June 2016 after authorization from the institutional review board. RESULTS: The average age of patients with PRES was 7 years. Primary diagnoses were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 9), acute pre-B-cell leukemia (n = 5), relapsed pre-B-cell leukemia (n = 2), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2), and Ewing sarcoma (n = 1). PRES occurred during induction chemotherapy in 12 patients. Sixteen patients had hypertension when they developed PRES. Most of these patients (n = 13) were receiving corticosteroids on diagnosis of PRES. Common clinical features were hypertension, seizures, and altered mental status. With the exclusion of three patients, all others required antiepileptic therapy. Ten of these patients underwent additional magnetic resonance imaging. Ten patients are still alive. CONCLUSION: In patients who presented to our center with signs and symptoms of hypertension, seizures, visual loss, or altered mental status, PRES was mostly seen in those who were undergoing systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. Approximately 40% of the patients had reversal of clinical and radiologic findings. Antiepileptic medications were discontinued after being seizure free for approximately 6 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 18.,"BACKGROUND: Current evidence suggests that childhood leukaemia can be associated with residential traffic exposure; nevertheless, more results are needed to support this conclusion. OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the possible effects of residential proximity to road traffic on childhood leukaemia, taking into account traffic density, road proximity and the type of leukaemia (acute lymphoid leukaemia or acute myeloid leukaemia). METHODS: We conducted a population-based case-control study of childhood leukaemia in Spain, covering the period 1990-2011. It included 1061 incidence cases gathered from the Spanish National Childhood Cancer Registry and those Autonomous Regions with 100% coverage, and 6447 controls, individually matched by year of birth, sex and autonomous region of residence. Distances were computed from the respective participant's residential locations to the different types of roads and four different buffers. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs), were calculated for four different categories of distance to roads. RESULTS: Cases of childhood leukaemia had more than three-fold increased odds of living at <50m of the busiest motorways compared to controls (OR=2.90; 95%CI=1.30-6.49). The estimates for acute lymphoid leukaemia (ALL) were slightly higher (OR=2.95; 95%CI=1.22-7.14), while estimates for cases with the same address at birth and at diagnosis were lower (OR=2.40; 95%CI=0.70-8.30). CONCLUSIONS: Our study agrees with the literature and furnishes some evidence that living near a busy motorway could be a risk factor for childhood leukaemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Case-control study', '*Childhood leukaemia', '*Residential proximity', '*Traffic density']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Jun 19.,"Circular RNAs constitute a unique class of RNAs whose precise functions remain to be elucidated. In particular, cancer-associated chromosomal translocations can give rise to fusion circular RNAs that play a role in leukemia progression. However, how and when fusion circular RNAs are formed and whether they are being selected in cancer cells remains unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate physiological translocation models of NPM1-ALK fusion gene. We showed that, in addition to generating fusion proteins and activating specific oncogenic pathways, chromosomal translocation induced by CRISPR/Cas9 led to the formation of de novo fusion circular RNAs. Specifically, we could recover different classes of circular RNAs composed of different circularization junctions, mainly back-spliced species. In addition, we identified fusion circular RNAs identical to those found in related patient tumor cells providing evidence that fusion circular RNAs arise early after chromosomal formation and are not just a consequence of the oncogenesis process.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Sep 18.,"OBJECTIVE: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, yet surprisingly, very few studies have reported the treatment outcomes and the relapse rate of patients from low/middle-income countries. METHOD: This study was a 5-year retrospective cohort study. It was conducted at Oncology Center of Mansoura University in Egypt and aimed to estimate the treatment outcomes and the relapse rates of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. RESULTS: Two hundred children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied; forty-six patients (23%) died during induction and most of those deaths were related to infection. Forty-one patients (27%) relapsed out of the 152 patients who achieved complete remission. The most common site of relapse was the bone marrow, followed by the isolated central nervous system, 53.7% and 31.7%, respectively. Seventy-eight percent of relapses occurred very early/early rather than later. The majority of relapse patients' deaths were related to infection and disease progression. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients was 63.1% (82.1% for non-relapsed compared to 36.6% for relapsed patients). CONCLUSION: There was a high incidence of induction deaths related to infection and high percentages of very early/early relapses, with high mortalities and low 5-year overall survival rates. These findings suggest the urgent need for modification of chemotherapy regimens to be suitable for the local conditions, including implementation of supportive care and infection control policies. There is also a requirement for antimicrobial prophylaxis during induction period combined with the necessary increase in government healthcare spending to improve the survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in Egyptian children.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chemotherapy modification', 'Desfecho de tratamento', 'Leucemia linfoblastica aguda', 'Middle-income developing countries', 'Modificacao quimioterapica', 'Overall survival', 'Paises em desenvolvimento de renda media', 'Relapse rate', 'Sobrevida global', 'Taxa de recidiva', 'Treatment outcome']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria.

When translated to the adult setting, modern pediatric-type regimens improve the survival to approximately 60% in young adults. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors for patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease and the measurement of minimal residual disease to guide risk stratification and postremission approaches has led to additional improvements in outcomes. Relapsed disease and treatment toxicity-sparing no patient but representing a major concern especially in the elderly-are the most critical current issues awaiting further therapeutic advancement. Recently, there has been considerable progress in understanding the disease biology, specifically the Philadelphia-like signature, as well as other high-risk subgroups. In addition, there are several new agents that will undoubtedly contribute to additional improvement in the current outcomes. The most promising agents are monoclonal antibodies, immunomodulators, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and, to a lesser extent, several new drugs targeting key molecular pathways involved in leukemic cell growth and proliferation. This review examines the evidence supporting the increasing role of the new therapeutic tools and treatment options in different disease subgroups, including frontline and relapsed or refractory disease.

Epub 2018 Oct 3.,"Determining the target proteins of new anticancer compounds is a very important task in Medicinal Chemistry. In this sense, chemists carry out preclinical assays with a high number of combinations of experimental conditions (c j). In fact, ChEMBL database contains outcomes of 65534 different anticancer activity preclinical assays for 35565 different chemical compounds (1.84 assays per compound). These assays cover different combinations of c j formed from >70 different biological activity parameters ( c0), >300 different drug targets ( c1), >230 cell lines ( c2), and 5 organisms of assay ( c3) or organisms of the target ( c4). It include a total of 45833 assays in leukemia, 6227 assays in breast cancer, 2499 assays in ovarian cancer, 3499 in colon cancer, 3159 in lung cancer, 2750 in prostate cancer, 601 in melanoma, etc. This is a very complex data set with multiple Big Data features. This data is hard to be rationalized by researchers to extract useful relationships and predict new compounds. In this context, we propose to combine perturbation theory (PT) ideas and machine learning (ML) modeling to solve this combinatorial-like problem. In this work, we report a PTML (PT + ML) model for ChEMBL data set of preclinical assays of anticancer compounds. This is a simple linear model with only three variables. The model presented values of area under receiver operating curve = AUROC = 0.872, specificity = Sp(%) = 90.2, sensitivity = Sn(%) = 70.6, and overall accuracy = Ac(%) = 87.7 in training series. The model also have Sp(%) = 90.1, Sn(%) = 71.4, and Ac(%) = 87.8 in external validation series. The model use PT operators based on multicondition moving averages to capture all the complexity of the data set. We also compared the model with nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) models obtaining similar results. This confirms the hypothesis of a linear relationship between the PT operators and the classification as anticancer compounds in different combinations of assay conditions. Last, we compared the model with other PTML models reported in the literature concluding that this is the only one PTML model able to predict activity against multiple types of cancer. This model is a simple but versatile tool for the prediction of the targets of anticancer compounds taking into consideration multiple combinations of experimental conditions in preclinical assays.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ChEMBL', '*anticancer compounds', '*artificial neural networks', '*big data', '*machine learning', '*multitarget models', '*perturbation theory']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2601-5959', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9392-2797']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSCs are known to be damaged phenotypically and functionally by chemotherapy; however, to the best our knowledge, the persistence of genotoxic effects of chemotherapy on the BM micro-environment has not been studied. We therefore aimed to evaluate genotoxic effects of chemotherapy on the BM both in vitro and in vivo, using the comet and micronucleus assays, focussing on the persistence of DNA lesions that may contribute to complications in the patient. The MSC cell line (HS-5) and primary cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMNCs: a source of undamaged DNA) were exposed to the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (CY) within a physiologically relevant in vitro model. CY treatment resulted in significant increases in CBMNC DNA damage at all time points tested (3-48 h exposure). Similarly, HS-5 cells exposed to CY exhibited significant increases in DNA damage as measured by the comet assay, with increased numbers of abnormal cells visible in the micronucleus assay. In addition, even 48 h after removal of 48-h CY treatment, DNA damage remains significantly increased in treated cells relative to controls. In patients treated with chemotherapy for haematological malignancy, highly significant increases in damaged DNA were seen in BM cells isolated from one individual 1 year after completion of therapy for acute leukaemia compared with pretreatment (P < 0.001). Similarly, two individuals treated 7 and 17 years previously with chemotherapy exhibited significant increases of damaged DNA in MSC compared with untreated age- and sex-matched controls (P < 0.05). Unlike haematopoietic cells, MSCs are not replaced following a stem cell transplant. Therefore, long-term damage to MSC may impact on engraftment of either allogeneic or autologous transplants. In addition, persistence of DNA lesions may lead to genetic instability, correlating with the significant number of chemotherapy-treated individuals who have therapy-related malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: We reveal that although the PICMI is transcriptionally similar to the hESC profile and distinct from ICM, it exhibits upregulation of primordial germ cell (PGC) markers, dependence on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling, upregulation of naive pluripotency-specific signaling networks and appears to be an intermediate switching point from naive to primed pluripotency. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: It is currently known that the PICMI exhibits markers of early and late-epiblast stage. It is suggested that hESCs acquire primed pluripotency features due to the upregulation of post-implantation genes in the PICMI which renders them predisposed towards differentiation cues. Despite this current knowledge, the transcriptional landscape changes during hESC derivation from ICM to hESC and the effect of PICMI on pluripotent state is still not well defined. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To gain insight into the signaling mechanisms that may govern the ICM to PICMI to hESC transition, comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was performed on preimplantation ICMs, PICMIs and hESCs in biological and technical triplicates (n = 3). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, AND METHODS: Primed hESCs (XX) were maintained in feeder-free culture conditions on Matrigel for two passages and approximately 50 cells were collected in biological and technical triplicates (n = 3). For ICM sample collection, Day 3, frozen-thawed human embryos were cultured up to day five blastocyst stage and only good quality blastocysts were subjected to laser-assisted micromanipulation for ICM collection (n = 3). Next, day six expanded blastocysts were cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts and manual dissection was performed on the PICMI outgrowths between post-plating Day 6 and Day 10 (n = 3). Sequencing of these samples was performed on NextSeq500 and statistical analysis was performed using edgeR (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Comparative RNA-seq data analysis revealed that 634 and 560 protein-coding genes were significantly up and downregulated in hESCs compared to ICM (FDR < 0.05), respectively. Upon ICM to PICMI transition, 471 genes were expressed significantly higher in the PICMI compared to ICM, while 296 genes were elevated in the ICM alone (FDR < 0.05). Principle component analysis showed that the ICM was completely distinct from the PICMI and hESCs while the latter two clustered in close proximity to each other. Increased expression of E-CADHERIN1 (CDH1) in ICM and intermediate levels in the PICMI was observed, while CDH2 was higher in hESCs, suggesting a role of extracellular matrix components in facilitating pluripotency transition during hESC derivation. The PICMI also showed regulation of naive-specific LIF and bone morphogenetic protein signaling, differential regulation of primed pluripotency-specific fibroblast growth factor and NODAL signaling pathway components, upregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (PI3K/AKT/mTORC), as well as predisposition towards the germ cell lineage, further confirmed by gene ontology analysis. Hence, the data suggest that the PICMI may serve as an intermediate pluripotency stage which, when subjected to an appropriate culture niche, could aid in enhancing naive hESC derivation and germ cell differentiation efficiency. LARGE-SCALE DATA: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Accession number GSE119378. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Owing to the limitation in sample availability, the sex of ICM and PICMI have not been taken into consideration. Obtaining cells from the ICM and maintaining them in culture is not feasible as it will hamper the formation of PICMI and hESC derivation. Single-cell quantitative real-time PCR on low ICM and PICMI cell numbers, although challenging due to limited availability of human embryos, will be advantageous to further corroborate the RNA-seq data on transcriptional changes during hESC derivation process. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: We elucidate the dynamics of transcriptional network changes from the naive ICM to the intermediate PICMI stage and finally the primed hESC lines. We provide an in-depth understanding of the PICMI and its role in conferring the type of pluripotent state which may have important downstream effects on differentiation, specifically towards the PGC lineage. This knowledge contributes to our limited understanding of the true nature of the human pluripotent state in vitro.

Epub 2018 Sep 21.,"PURPOSE: A study of vincristine sulfate (VCR) liposome injection (VSLI) was conducted in patients with advanced, relapsed, or refractory, Philadelphia chromosome-negative acute lymphoblastic/lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). A retrospective subgroup analysis of the results was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VSLI in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. METHODS: Of the 65 patients treated in the pivotal Phase 2 Study HBS407 (NCT00495079), 44 patients were aged </=39 years (median 27 [range 19-39] years) and were included in this analysis. Patients received VSLI (2.25 mg/m(2) intravenously every 7 +/- 3 days) without dose capping or concurrent steroid administration in continuous 28-day cycles. RESULTS: VSLI was well tolerated in the AYA patients over a median of 5 (range 1-15) doses administered. One-third of patients (36%) experienced treatment-related serious adverse events (AEs) with peripheral neuropathy (7%), tumor lysis syndrome (7%), and febrile neutropenia (5%) in >1 patient. Neuropathy-associated AEs occurred in 82% patients; no neuropathy-related deaths occurred. The rate of complete remission (CR) (with or without complete blood count recovery) by investigator assessment was 25% in AYA patients, and the overall response rate was 39%. Median leukemia-free survival in AYA patients attaining CR was 135 (range 32-463) days, and median overall survival was 141 (range 13-620) days. CONCLUSION: VSLI provided a meaningful clinical benefit to AYA patients with ALL, and its safety profile was comparable to that of VCR despite the delivery of higher doses (individual and cumulative).",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*vincristine sulfate liposome injection']",,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00495079'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some patients with CLL develop a clinical syndrome entitled Richter syndrome (RS). Understanding CLL genetics and epigenetics may help to elucidate the molecular basics of the clinical heterogeneity of this type of malignancy. In the present project we aimed to identify a microRNA species that can predict the evolution of therapy-resistant CLL towards RS. In the first phase of our study, microRNA-19b was identified as a possible target, and in the second phase, we transfected three different CLL cell lines with microRNA-19b mimic and inhibitor and assessed the potential role on leukemia cells in vitro. The mechanism by which miR-19b acts were identified as the upregulation of Ki67 and downregulation of p53. This was further supported through RT-PCR and western blotting on CLL cell lines, as well as by next generation sequencing on two patients diagnosed with CLL that evolved into RS.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Richter syndrome', '*microRNA', '*prognostic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the occurrence, severity, and management of NEs; the relationship between NEs and blinatumomab dose; and the potential clinical risk factors in an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study (N = 189). Patients had Philadelphia chromosome-negative, relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and >/= 10% bone marrow blasts. The relationship between blinatumomab exposure and NE incidence and severity was assessed. Clinical risk factors for NEs were assessed in a post hoc multivariate analysis. Overall, 98 patients (52%) experienced NEs: most frequently, dizziness, tremor, confusional state, and encephalopathy. NEs occurred predominantly during cycle 1 (median onset, 9 days) and were usually grades 1 or 2. Grade >/= 3 NEs (13-17% incidence), serious NEs (16-19% incidence), and recurring NEs were managed with infusion interruptions or dexamethasone treatment. The incidence of NEs increased with increasing blinatumomab exposure at a given dose, but exposure appeared unrelated to NE severity. NEs were more frequent in patients >/= 65 years than < 65 years (72 vs 49%). In a multivariate analysis, race other than white (hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; P = 0.009), > 2 prior salvage therapies (HR, 2.48; P = 0.006), and prior NEs (HR, 1.65; P = 0.020) were risk factors for time to first on-study NE. Although the mechanism underlying NEs associated with blinatumomab treatment in patients with relapsed/refractory ALL remains unclear, NEs tended to occur early during treatment and were often resolved by interrupting treatment and with dexamethasone. Additional research is warranted to investigate the risk factors for NEs.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse event', 'BiTE(R)', 'Blinatumomab', 'Exposure', 'Neurologic events', 'Risk factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On vascular endothelial cells (ECs), ponatinib promotes EC dysfunction and apoptosis, and inhibits angiogenesis. Furthermore, ponatinib-mediated anti-angiogenic effect has been suggested to play a partial role in systemic and pulmonary hypertension via inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Even though ponatinib-associated VAEs are well documented, their etiology remains largely unknown, making it difficult to efficiently counteract treatment-related adversities. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which ponatinib mediates VAEs is critical. In cultured human aortic ECs (HAECs) treated with ponatinib, we found an increase in nuclear factor NF-kB/p65 phosphorylation and NF-kB activity, inflammatory gene expression, cell permeability, and cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, ponatinib abolished extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) transcriptional activity even under activation by its upstream kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5alpha (CA-MEK5alpha). Ponatinib also diminished expression of ERK5 responsive genes such as Kruppel-like Factor 2/4 (klf2/4) and eNOS. Because ERK5 SUMOylation counteracts its transcriptional activity, we examined the effect of ponatinib on ERK5 SUMOylation, and found that ERK5 SUMOylation is increased by ponatinib. We also found that ponatibib-mediated increased inflammatory gene expression and decreased anti-inflammatory gene expression were reversed when ERK5 SUMOylation was inhibited endogenously or exogenously. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism by which ponatinib up-regulates endothelial ERK5 SUMOylation and shifts ECs to an inflammatory phenotype, disrupting vascular homeostasis.",['NOTNLM'],"['EC inflammation', 'ERK5 SUMOylation', 'ponatinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibtor (TKI)', 'vascular adverse events']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological malignancies are relatively uncommon malignant disorders derived from the two major blood cell lineages: myeloid (leukemia) and lymphoid (lymphoma). Malignant clones lose their regulatory mechanisms, resulting in production of a large number of dysfunctional cells and destruction of normal hematopoiesis. Glycans are one of the four major types of essential biological macromolecules, along with nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. Major glycan subgroups are N-glycans, O-glycans, glycosaminoglycans, and glycosphingolipids. Aberrant expression of glycan structures, resulting from dysregulation of glycan-related genes, is associated with cancer development and progression in terms of cell signaling and communication, tumor cell dissociation and invasion, cell-matrix interactions, tumor angiogenesis, immune modulation, and metastasis formation. Aberrant glycan expression occurs in most hematological malignancies, notably acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and multiple myeloma, etc. Here, we review recent research advances regarding aberrant glycans, their related genes, and their roles in hematological malignancies. Our improved understanding of the mechanisms that underlie aberrant patterns of glycosylation will lead to development of novel, more effective therapeutic approaches targeted to hematological malignancies.",['NOTNLM'],"['N-glycosylation', 'O-glycosylation', 'glycan', 'glycosaminoglycan', 'glycosphingolipid', 'hematological malignancies', 'lectin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, flu-refractory (primary flu-insensitivity or flu-caused relapse) remains a major problem causing treatment failure for CLL patients. We isolated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CLL patients and treated with flu to find flu-refractory cases, and established flu-resistant clonal cells to study molecular mechanism of flu-resistance. By comparing parental MEC-2 cells, a human CLL cell line, we found that flu-resistant clonal cells were significantly increased lethal dose 50 of flu concentration, and up-regulated expression of P-glycoprotein, a drug-resistant marker, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), an enzyme that can convert ceramide to glucosylceramide, and CD34, a leukemia stem cell marker. Overexpression of GCS leads to promptly elimination of cellular ceramide levels and accumulation of glucosylceramide, which reduces apoptosis and promotes survival and proliferation of flu-resistant clonal cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the accumulation of glucosylceramide can be blocked by PDMP to restore flu-sensitivity in flu-resistant clonal cells. We also found that elevating glucosylceramide levels in flu-resistant clonal cells was associated with up-regulation of GCS and CD34 expression. Importantly, overexpression of GCS or CD34 was also determined in flu-refractory PBMCs. Our results show that flu-resistance is associated with the alteration of ceramide metabolism and the development of leukemia stem cell-like cells. The flu-resistance can be reversed by GCS inhibition as a novel strategy for overcoming drug resistance.",['NOTNLM'],"['ceramide', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'drug-resistance', 'fludarabine', 'glucosylceramide']",,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the HTLV-1 and XMRV coinfection for the first time in Iranian patients who were admitted to the Tehran hospitals. Materials and Methods: Two hundred and ninety one patients suspected with HTLV-1 were referred to the hospitals affiliated to the Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran from April 2012 to October 2016. Genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)/ribonucleic acid (RNA) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells/cerebrospinal fluids was extracted by High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche, Germany). After complementary DNA synthesis, conventional reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of HTLV-1 or XMRV-infected patients. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 16 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Results: Of the 291 patients suspected of HTLV infection, 123 (42.3%) were male with a mean age of 38+/-15 years. HTLV-1 RNA was found in 93 (31.9%) specimens comprising 40 men (41.3%) and 53 women (56.9%). Of the 93 patients who were HTLV-1 positive, one sample (1%) was positive for XMRV env gene. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the lack of significant detection of XMRV in patients who were HTLV-1 positive could not be associated with complications of HTLV-1. Although this is a preliminary report from Iranian patients with HTLV-1, further studies are needed to show the actual prevalence of XMRV infection by geographical distribution and various populations.",['NOTNLM'],"['Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)', 'Viral infection', 'reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)', 'xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV)']",,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently discovered that ganglioside GD2 expression defines BCSCs and that ST8SIA1 regulates GD2 expression and BCSC function. In this report, we show that ST8SIA1 is highly expressed in primary TNBC; its expression is positively correlated with the expression of several BCSC-associated genes such as BCL11A, FOXC1, CXCR4, PDGFRbeta, SOX2, and mutations in p53. CRISPR knockout of ST8SIA1 completely inhibited BCSC functions, including in vitro tumorigenesis and mammosphere formation. Mechanistic studies discovered activation of the FAK-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in GD2(+) BCSCs, and its tight regulation by ST8SIA1. Finally, knockout of ST8SIA1 completely blocked in vivo tumor growth and metastasis by TNBC cells. In summary, these data demonstrate the mechanism by which ST8SIA1 regulates tumor growth and metastasis in TNBC and identifies it as a novel therapeutic target.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8693-1310', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0166-7275', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1144-1958']",,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 20.,"Differentiation syndrome (DS) is a life-threatening complication arising during retinoid treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Administration of all-trans retinoic acid leads to significant changes in gene expression, among the most induced of which is transglutaminase 2, which is not normally expressed in neutrophil granulocytes. To evaluate the pathophysiological function of transglutaminase 2 in the context of immunological function and disease outcomes, such as excessive superoxide anion, cytokine, and chemokine production in differentiated NB4 cells, we used an NB4 transglutaminase knock-out cell line and a transglutaminase inhibitor, NC9, which inhibits both transamidase- and guanosine triphosphate-binding activities, to clarify the contribution of transglutaminase to the development of potentially lethal DS during all-trans retinoic acid treatment of APL. We found that such treatment not only enhanced cell-surface expression of CD11b and CD11c but also induced high-affinity states; atypical transglutaminase 2 expression in NB4 cells activated the nuclear factor kappa (kappa)-light-chain-enhancer of the activated B-cell pathway, driving pathogenic processes with an inflammatory cascade through the expression of numerous cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1. NC9 decreased the amount of transglutaminase 2, p65/RelA, and p50 in differentiated NB4 cells and their nuclei, leading to attenuated inflammatory cytokine synthesis. NC9 significantly inhibits transglutaminase 2 nuclear translocation but accelerates its proteasomal breakdown. This study demonstrates that transglutaminase 2 expression induced by all-trans retinoic acid treatment reprograms inflammatory signaling networks governed by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cell activation, resulting in overexpression of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in differentiating APL cells, suggesting that atypically expressed transglutaminase 2 is a promising target for leukemia treatment.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 20.,"In the POLLUX study, daratumumab plus lenalidomide/dexamethasone significantly reduced risk of progression/death versus lenalidomide/dexamethasone alone in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We provide one additional year of follow up and include the effect on minimal residual disease and in clinically relevant subgroups. After 25.4 months of follow up, daratumumab plus lenalidomide/dexamethasone prolonged progression-free survival versus lenalidomide/dexamethasone alone (median not reached vs 17.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.53; P<0.0001). The overall response rate was 92.9% versus 76.4%, and 51.2% versus 21.0% achieved a complete response or better, respectively (both P<0.0001). At the 10(-5) sensitivity threshold, 26.2% versus 6.4% were minimal residual disease-negative, respectively (P<0.0001). Post hoc analyses of clinically relevant patient subgroups demonstrated that progression-free survival was significantly prolonged for daratumumab plus lenalidomide/dexamethasone versus lenalidomide/dexamethasone regardless of number of prior lines of therapy. Patients previously treated with lenalidomide or thalidomide and those refractory to bortezomib received similar benefits (all P<0.01). Treatment benefit with daratumumab plus lenalidomide/dexamethasone was maintained in high-risk patients (median progression-free survival 22.6 vs 10.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-1.13; P=0.0921) and patients with treatment-free intervals of >12 and </=12 months and >6 and </=6 months. No new safety signals were observed. In relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients, daratumumab plus lenalidomide/dexamethasone continued to improve progression-free survival and deepen responses versus lenalidomide/dexamethasone.

Epub 2018 Sep 20.,"Stem cell grafts from 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donors are often mismatched for HLA-DP. In some patients, donor T-cell responses targeting the mismatched HLA-DP allele(s) have been found to induce a specific graft-versus-leukemia effect without coinciding graft-versus-host disease, whereas in other cases significant graft-versus-host disease occurred. Cell-lineage-specific recognition patterns within the allogeneic HLA-DP-specific donor T-cell repertoire could explain the differential clinical effects mediated by donor T cells after HLA-DP-mismatched allogeneic stem cell transplantation. To unravel the composition of the HLA-DP T-cell repertoire, donor T-cell responses were provoked by in vitro stimulation with allogeneic HLA-DP-mismatched monocyte-derived dendritic cells. A strategy including depletion of reactivity against autologous dendritic cells allowed efficient identification and enrichment of allo-reactive T cells upon stimulation with HLA-DP-mismatched dendritic cells. In this study we elucidated that the allogeneic HLA-DP-restricted T-cell repertoire contained T cells with differential cell-lineage-specific recognition profiles. As expected, some of the allogeneic HLA-DP-restricted T cells showed broad recognition of a variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types expressing the targeted mismatched HLA-DP allele. However, a significant proportion of the allogeneic HLA-DP-restricted T cells showed restricted recognition of hematopoietic cells, including primary malignant cells, or even restricted recognition of only myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and primary acute myeloid leukemia samples, but not of other hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell types. These data demonstrate that the allogeneic HLA-DP-specific T-cell repertoire contains T cells that show restricted recognition of hematopoietic cells, which may contribute to the specific graft-versus-leukemia effect without coinciding graft-versus-host disease.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The host immune response to Acanthamoeba spp. infection is poorly understood. Thus, in this study, we aimed to examine the course of Acanthamoeba spp. infection taking into account the host's immunological status, including assessment of the hematological parameters, cytokine analysis, immunophenotypic changes in spleen populations, and histological spleen changes, which could help clarify some aspects of the immune response to acanthamoebiasis. In our experimental study, we used Acanthamoeba strain AM 22 isolated from the bronchoaspirate of a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and atypical pneumonia symptoms. RESULTS: Acanthamoeba spp. affected the hematological parameters in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice and induced a change in spleen weight during infection. Moreover, analysis of anti-inflammatory (IL-4 and IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (IL-17A and IFN-gamma) cytokines produced by splenocytes stimulated with concanavalin A demonstrated that Acanthamoeba spp. induced a selective Th1, Th2 and Th17 response at later stages of the infection in immunocompetent hosts. In the case of hosts with low immunity, Acanthamoeba elicited robust Th1 cell-mediated immunity without the participation of Th17. We observed suppression of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD3+CD4-CD8- double-negative (DN) T lymphocyte populations in the beginning, and in the case of CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ double-positive (DP) T cells in the final phase of Acanthamoeba spp. infection in hosts with low immunity. Also, CD4+T lymphocytes and CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ lymphocyte counts during each stage of acanthamoebiasis were shown to be upregulated. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that analysis of the immune response and pathogenesis mechanisms of clinical isolates of Acanthamoeba spp. in an animal model not only has purely cognitive significance but above all, may help in the development of effective methods of pharmacological therapy especially in patients with low immunity.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acanthamoeba spp.', 'Immunological status', 'Immunophenotype']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their efficacy is affected by a number of factors, including (1) the quality of the DC vaccine and (2) tumor immune evasion. The recently characterized BDCA1+CD14+ immunosuppressive cells combine both aspects; their presence in DC vaccines may directly hamper vaccine efficacy, whereas, in patients, BDCA1+CD14+ cells may suppress the induced immune response in an antigen-specific manner systemically and at the tumor site. We hypothesize that BDCA1+CD14+ cells are present in a broad spectrum of cancers and demand further investigation to reveal treatment opportunities and/or improvement for DC vaccines. In this review, we summarize the findings on BDCA1+CD14+ cells in solid cancers. In addition, we evaluate the presence of BDCA1+CD14+ cells in leukemic cancers. Preliminary results suggest that the presence of BDCA1+CD14+ cells correlates with clinical features of acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. Future research focusing on the differentiation from monocytes towards BDCA1+CD14+ cells could reveal more about their cell biology and clinical significance.

Even if standard intensive chemotherapy induces morphologic complete remission (CR1), relapses in older AML patients are common leading to poor long-term survival outcomes. Since autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) offers distinct anti-leukemic effectiveness while avoiding graft-versus-host disease associated with allogeneic transplantation, it represents an option for consolidation treatment in selected older AML patients. However, prospective studies in older AML patients assessing the benefit of autologous HCT compared to chemotherapy consolidation or allogeneic transplantation are lacking. Consequently, clinicians face the dilemma that there is considerable ambiguity on the most appropriate consolidation treatment for older AML patients in CR1. This review highlights the possible role of autologous HCT for consolidation in older AML patients reaching CR1 after induction treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'autologous', 'elderly', 'older', 'outcome', 'review', 'survival', 'transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A hallmark of HSV-1 latency is the interaction between latent viral genomes and PML NBs, leading to the formation of viral DNA-containing PML NBs (vDCP NBs), and the complete silencing of HSV-1. Using a replication-defective HSV-1-infected human primary fibroblast model reproducing the formation of vDCP NBs, combined with an immuno-FISH approach developed to detect latent/quiescent HSV-1, we show that vDCP NBs contain both histone H3.3 and its chaperone complexes, i.e., DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complex (HIRA, UBN1, CABIN1, and ASF1a). HIRA also co-localizes with vDCP NBs present in trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons from HSV-1-infected wild type mice. ChIP and Re-ChIP show that vDCP NBs-associated latent/quiescent viral genomes are chromatinized almost exclusively with H3.3 modified on its lysine (K) 9 by trimethylation, consistent with an interaction of the H3.3 chaperones with multiple viral loci and with the transcriptional silencing of HSV-1. Only simultaneous inactivation of both H3.3 chaperone complexes has a significant impact on the deposition of H3.3 on viral genomes, suggesting a compensation mechanism. In contrast, the sole depletion of PML significantly impacts the chromatinization of the latent/quiescent viral genomes with H3.3 without any overall replacement with H3.1. vDCP NBs-associated HSV-1 genomes are not definitively silenced since the destabilization of vDCP NBs by ICP0, which is essential for HSV-1 reactivation in vivo, allows the recovery of a transcriptional lytic program and the replication of viral genomes. Consequently, the present study demonstrates a specific chromatin regulation of vDCP NBs-associated latent/quiescent HSV-1 through an H3.3-dependent HSV-1 chromatinization involving the two H3.3 chaperones DAXX/ATRX and HIRA complexes. Additionally, the study reveals that PML NBs are major actors in latent/quiescent HSV-1 H3.3 chromatinization through a PML NB/histone H3.3/H3.3 chaperone axis.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9248-648X'],,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted at Middlemore Hospital to identify adult patients with PV diagnosed between 1987 and 2007. Data extracted included diagnostic criteria, ethnicity, age, complications and survival. RESULTS: Eighty-eight adult patients with PV were identified during 1987-2007, 49 (55.7%) were Europeans and 36 (40.9%) Polynesians. The most striking finding was that Polynesian patients presented almost 14 years younger than Europeans (mean age of 54 years versus [vs] 68, respectively; P<.001). The white cell and platelet counts were higher in Polynesians compared with Europeans (mean white cell count of 22x109/L vs 13x109/L; mean platelet count of 648x109/L vs 512x109/L, respectively; P<.05 for both). The rate of JAK2 V617F mutation in Polynesians was 96%, equivalent to other large cohorts of European patients. The rates of long-term complications were comparable between Polynesians and Europeans, but the predicted impact on life expectancy was more severe for Polynesians. CONCLUSION: New Zealand Polynesian patients present with a distinctive PV phenotype. Their younger age at presentation suggests a different risk factor profile or a higher genetic susceptibility. We hope our observations initiate larger epidemiological and genetic studies to help elucidate the cause.",,,,,,,['Nil.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the notion that deadly thrombosis occurs as a result of normal hemostasis in intravascular injury could encounter with conceptual skepticism because the term 'thrombosis' automatically conjures up as serious disease. According to 'two-path unifying theory', normal hemostasis is initiated only by vascular injury through activated unusually large von Willebrand factor (ULVWF) path and/or activated tissue factor (TF) path. When these two equally important paths are unified in normal hemostasis, clotting at external bodily injury site is initiated for wound healing, but in intravascular injury 'blood clots' is formed to produce a disease called 'thrombosis'. As microthrombi from ULVWF path and fibrin clots from TF path become unified, macrothrombus would be formed via thrombogenesis. However, if ULVWF path and TF path cannot be unified due to lone ULVWF path activation, partial hemostasis produces only microthrombi seen in endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease. In real life, in-vivo fibrin clot cannot be formed alone via normal hemostasis because bleeding vascular injury always activates both ULVWF and TF paths. Without vascular injury, microthrombi due to activated ULVWF path occur in ADAMTS13 deficiency in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and fibrin clots due to activated TF path occur in acute promyelocytic leukemia. These two conditions can be called pathologic hemostasis. Three thrombogenic pathways produce three thrombotic disorders, which include macrothrombosis, microthrombosis and true DIC through macrothrombogenesis, microthrombogenesis and fibrinogenesis in both physiologic and pathological hemostasis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a precursor study testing fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide followed by alemtuzumab (FMC-A), we aimed to improve this regimen by upfront combining subcutaneous (s.c.) alemtuzumab with FMC for four cycles followed by an alemtuzumab-maintenance (FMCA + A). This prospective multicenter phase-II trial assessed response, survival, and toxicity of that regimen administered to pretreated (n = 4) and treatment-naive (n = 12) T-PLL patients. The best overall response rate after FMCA was 68.8% (n = 11) including five CRs (31.3%) and six PRs (37.5%). Six patients entered the alemtuzumab-maintenance. Median overall and progression-free survival was 16.7 and 11.2 months, respectively. Hematologic toxicities were the most frequent grade 3/4 side effects. A reduced incidence of CMV-reactivations was attributed to the prophylactic administration of valganciclovir. Overall, FMCA + A did not improve the efficacy of the FMC-A-regimen or of single i.v. alemtuzumab. It suggests that a chemotherapy backbone prevents efficient alemtuzumab dosing and confirms that intravenous alemtuzumab is to be preferred over its s.c. route in T-PLL.

The shortened telomere length, and elevated telomerase activity in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells are mainly indicative of extensive proliferative activity. This study aimed to investigate the effect of overexpression of miR-138 on telomerase activity, and cell proliferation of acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells. MiR-138 was overexpressed in NB4 cells using GFP hsa-miR-138-expressing lentiviruses. hTERT mRNA and protein expression levels were assessed by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. For evaluation of apoptosis, annexin-V staining and activation of caspases were assessed using flow cytometry and western blot analysis, respectively. Our data demonstrate that overexpression of miR-138 attenuated the hTERT mRNA and protein expression levels. In addition, cell growth was inhibited, and malignant cells underwent caspase mediated-apoptosis in response to miR-138 overexpression. These findings suggest that loss of miR-138 expression may be associated with increased telomerase activity in NB4 cells. Therefore, strategies for up-regulation of miR-138 may result in inhibition of malignant cell growth, and provide a promising therapeutic approach for acute promyelocytic leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'caspase', 'hTERT', 'miR-138', 'poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)']",,,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients have increased lymphocyte count (>1,00,000/dL) and widespread disease at presentation. Despite high response rate seen with alemtuzumab, the disease relapse is inevitable. Materials andMethods: This was a retrospective observational study done at a tertiary cancer center in South India. All patients diagnosed with T-PLL from August 2010 to July 2015 were studied for the clinical characteristics, pathological findings and treatment outcomes. Results: Seven patients were diagnosed as T-PLL over a period of 5 years. The median age at diagnosis was 51 years. In the present series, 6 patients (86%) had splenomegaly and 3 had hepatomegaly (43%). Generalized lymphadenopathy was seen in 4 (57%) patients at presentation. Skin lesions were seen in 5 (71%) patients, whereas pleural effusion was seen in only one patient (14%). All had elevated total leukocyte count, with more than 1, 00,000/dL in 4 patients. The median survival was 5 months with different chemotherapy (CT) regimens (5 patients treated with CT and 2 received best supportive care). Conclusion: T-PLL is a rare disease with no definite treatment guidelines. At present, the best outcomes are achieved if treatment with alemtuzumab is followed by stem cell transplant, but the disease invariably relapses.

Epub 2018 Aug 20.,"The present study aimed to determine whether an miRNA (miR)-29b inhibitor protected against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in vitro and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. As a model for induced cerebral IR injury, N2a cells were exposed to an oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) environment. Using this model, it was demonstrated that miR-29b was significantly upregulated compared with cells in a normal environment. The interactions between miR-29b and myeloid cell leukemia sequence (MCL)-1 were then investigated using dual-luciferase assays, revealing a strong regulation of MCL-1 through the 3'untranslated region. Using the OGD/R model, the present study additionally examined the effects of miR-29b and miR-29b inhibitor on cell viability and apoptosis using Cell Counting kit 8 and flow cytometry assays, respectively. miR-29b transfection led to increased N2a cell apoptosis and reduced cell viability under an OGD/R environment. However, this effect was reversed by the miR-29b inhibitor. Finally, the effects of miR-29b on the expression of several Wnt-associating proteins were examined. It was observed that B cell lymphoma-2 was inhibited by miR-29b, as was MCL-1, whereas caspase-3 expression was promoted. The miR-29b inhibitor demonstrated the opposite effect. Overall, miR-29b promoted neurocyte apoptosis by targeting MCL-1 during cerebral I/R injury. The results of the present study suggest a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",['NOTNLM'],"['MCL-1', 'cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury', 'miR-29b', 'neural apoptosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the sequence of the AML1/ETO fusion gene available in GenBank and the principles of the LAMP, CPA and IMSA methods, specific primers were designed to bind a conserved region of the AML1/ETO gene in each assay. Following optimization of the conditions for the LAMP, CPA and IMSA assays, the specificity and sensitivity of the assays were examined and compared. In addition, 41 clinical samples were assayed using the three methods. It was observed that a ladder-like pattern of DNA products was produced in AML1/ETO-positive samples in all three assays, whereas no DNA product was generated with the controls. The detection limit of the LAMP and CPA assays was 50 copies/tube, and for the IMSA assay was 10 copies/tube. This sensitivity was consistent, and improved in the latter case, compared with that of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Furthermore, the detection rate for bone marrow or peripheral blood samples was 9.76%, and the agreement among the LAMP, CPA, IMSA and RT-PCR methods was 100%. Therefore, the LAMP, CPA and IMSA methods optimized in the present study provided rapid detection of the AML1/ETO fusion gene for an initial clinical diagnosis of AML. In addition, the LAMP, CPA and IMSA assays are straightforward to perform and do not require specialized instruments. Therefore, these three isothermal methods may be used to perform field tests or assays at resource-limited hospitals.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML1/ETO', 'cross-priming amplification', 'isothermal multiple-self-matching-initiated amplification', 'loop-mediated isothermal amplification', 'thermal amplification']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous adoptive T cell therapies, based on the use of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), have made great progress in recent years for the treatment of solid tumors, especially melanoma. However, further work is needed to isolate tumor-reactive T cells among patients diagnosed with hematologic malignancies. The dynamics of the interaction between T cells and antigen presenting cells (APC) dictate the quality of the immune responses. While stable joints between target cells and T lymphocytes lead to the induction of T cell activation and immune response, brief contacts contribute to the induction of immune-tolerance. Taking advantage of the strong interaction between target cell and activated T-cells, we show the feasibility to identify and isolate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by flow cytometry. Using this technology, CTLs bound through T cell receptor (TCR) to tumor cells can be identified in peripheral blood and bone marrow and subsequently selected and isolated by FACS-based cell sorting. These CTLs display higher percentage of effector cells and marked cytotoxic activity against AML blasts. In conclusion, we have developed a new procedure to identify and select specific cytotoxic T cells in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['*T cell-tumor cell synapse', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*cell selection', '*immunotherapy', '*tumor-specific T cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A literature search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane library on March 3, 2018 to identify economic evaluations of chronic myeloid leukemia that met the inclusion criteria. Data on such parameters as patient characteristics, cost components, and main outcomes were extracted from eligible studies. RESULTS: The literature review retrieved 798 studies, 17 of which fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Eight studies included an economic analysis on newly diagnosed patients with CML. Seven studies investigated people with CML who were resistant or intolerant to standard-dose imatinib. One article focused on chronic phase (CP)-CML patients who experienced failure with first-line treatment for interferon-alpha. The last study investigated advanced stages of CML patients. Most studies (n = 70.6%) were conducted in high-income countries. Only five studies (n = 29.4%) were performed in middle-income countries. Most studies used a Markov model. The time horizon varied from six months to life-time. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high costs, the included studies indicate that imatinib regimens are cost effective in newly diagnosed patients with CP-CML. For people with CML who are resistant or intolerant to standard-dose imatinib, dasatinib is likely to be a more cost-effective strategy in middle-income countries. More studies are necessary to assess the long-term efficacy and cost effectiveness of novel treatment options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A research taxonomy developed for the review considers a wide perspective for automated detection and classification of acute leukaemia research and reflects the usage trends in the evaluation criteria in this field. The developed taxonomy consists of three main research directions in this domain. The taxonomy involves two phases. The first phase includes all three research directions. The second one demonstrates all the criteria used for evaluating acute leukaemia classification. The final set of studies includes 83 investigations, most of which focused on enhancing the accuracy and performance of detection and classification through proposed methods or systems. Few efforts were made to undertake the evaluation issues. According to the final set of articles, three groups of articles represented the main research directions in this domain: 56 articles highlighted the proposed methods, 22 articles involved proposals for system development and 5 papers centred on evaluation and comparison. The other taxonomy side included 16 main and sub-evaluation and benchmarking criteria. This review highlights three serious issues in the evaluation and benchmarking of multiclass classification of acute leukaemia, namely, conflicting criteria, evaluation criteria and criteria importance. It also determines the weakness of benchmarking tools. To solve these issues, multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) analysis techniques were proposed as effective recommended solutions in the methodological aspect. This methodological aspect involves a proposed decision support system based on MCDM for evaluation and benchmarking to select suitable multiclass classification models for acute leukaemia. The said support system is examined and has three sequential phases. Phase One presents the identification procedure and process for establishing a decision matrix based on a crossover of evaluation criteria and acute leukaemia multiclass classification models. Phase Two describes the decision matrix development for the selection of acute leukaemia classification models based on the integrated Best and worst method (BWM) and VIKOR. Phase Three entails the validation of the proposed system.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukaemia', 'Benchmarking', 'Detection', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation criteria', 'MCDM', 'Multiclass classification']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"PURPOSE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation during immunosuppressive therapy is common in patients with hematological malignancies, even in case of resolved infection. Prophylaxis of HBV reactivation is universally recommended in stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients and patients treated with anti-CD20 agents (i.e., rituximab). Despite its well-established favorable safety profile, lamivudine (LAM) use in prophylaxis has been debated because of the possible emergence of resistant viral strains. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of LAM in preventing HBV reactivation in allogeneic SCT recipients with a resolved HBV infection. METHODS: Patients who received first allogeneic SCT in years 2009-2016 were evaluated. Sixty-three patients with resolved infection received LAM prophylaxis and were included in the study. Baseline and post-SCT characteristics were recorded, including rituximab exposure, length of LAM prophylaxis, and time from transplant to the last clinical and virological follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 39 patients (62%) were male, 39 (62%) had acute myeloid leukemia, 38 (60%) received transplant from haploidentical donor, 29 (53%) received myeloablative conditioning, and 15 (24%) received rituximab post-transplant. Median clinical follow-up was 24 months after SCT (range 0.3-97); median virological follow-up 16 months (range 0.3-78), and median length of LAM prophylaxis of 14.5 months (range 0.3-78). No patient experienced HBV reactivation while on LAM prophylaxis. One patient experienced reactivation 8 months after discontinuing prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: In this high-risk population, LAM prophylaxis was effective in preventing HBV reactivation in patients with resolved infection. It should be considered a reasonable first-line prophylactic agent to be administered in this setting.",['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-CD20', 'HBV', 'HBcAb', 'Hematological', 'LAM', 'Transplant']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"The human T cell leukemia virus I basic leucine zipper protein (HTLV-1 HBZ) maintains chronic viral infection and promotes leukemogenesis through poorly understood mechanisms involving interactions with the KIX domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP and its paralog p300. The KIX domain binds regulatory proteins at the distinct MLL and c-Myb/pKID sites to form binary or ternary complexes. The intrinsically disordered N-terminal activation domain of HBZ (HBZ AD) deregulates cellular signaling pathways by competing directly with cellular and viral transcription factors for binding to the MLL site and by allosterically perturbing binding of the transactivation domain of the hematopoietic transcription factor c-Myb. Crystal structures of the ternary KIX:c-Myb:HBZ complex show that the HBZ AD recruits two KIX:c-Myb entities through tandem amphipathic motifs (L/V)(V/L)DGLL and folds into a long alpha-helix upon binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry reveals strong cooperativity in binding of the c-Myb activation domain to the KIX:HBZ complex and in binding of HBZ to the KIX:c-Myb complex. In addition, binding of KIX to the two HBZ (V/L)DGLL motifs is cooperative; the structures suggest that this cooperativity is achieved through propagation of the HBZ alpha-helix beyond the first binding motif. Our study suggests that the unique structural flexibility and the multiple interaction motifs of the intrinsically disordered HBZ AD are responsible for its potency in hijacking KIX-mediated transcription pathways. The KIX:c-Myb:HBZ complex provides an example of cooperative stabilization in a transcription factor:coactivator network and gives insights into potential mechanisms through which HBZ dysregulates hematopoietic transcriptional programs and promotes T cell proliferation.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CREB-binding protein', '*T cell leukemia virus', '*intrinsically disordered proteins', '*leukemogenesis']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6855-3398', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1368-0223']","['PDB/6DMX', 'PDB/6DNQ']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 19.,"With the advent of OMICs technologies, both individual research groups and consortia have spear-headed the characterization of human samples of multiple pathophysiologic origins, resulting in thousands of archived genomes and transcriptomes. Although a variety of web tools are now available to extract information from OMICs data, their utility has been limited by the capacity of nonbioinformatician researchers to exploit the information. To address this problem, we have developed CANCERTOOL, a web-based interface that aims to overcome the major limitations of public transcriptomics dataset analysis for highly prevalent types of cancer (breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal). CANCERTOOL provides rapid and comprehensive visualization of gene expression data for the gene(s) of interest in well-annotated cancer datasets. This visualization is accompanied by generation of reports customized to the interest of the researcher (e.g., editable figures, detailed statistical analyses, and access to raw data for reanalysis). It also carries out gene-to-gene correlations in multiple datasets at the same time or using preset patient groups. Finally, this new tool solves the time-consuming task of performing functional enrichment analysis with gene sets of interest using up to 11 different databases at the same time. Collectively, CANCERTOOL represents a simple and freely accessible interface to interrogate well-annotated datasets and obtain publishable representations that can contribute to refinement and guidance of cancer-related investigations at all levels of hypotheses and design.Significance: In order to facilitate access of research groups without bioinformatics support to public transcriptomics data, we have developed a free online tool with an easy-to-use interface that allows researchers to obtain quality information in a readily publishable format.

This mark has been reported to associate with silent genes. Here, we use a cell model of neural differentiation, which upon PRMT6 knockout exhibits proliferation and differentiation defects. Strikingly, we detect PRMT6-dependent H3R2me2a at active genes, both at promoter and enhancer sites. Loss of H3R2me2a from promoter sites leads to enhanced KMT2A binding and H3K4me3 deposition together with increased target gene transcription, supporting a repressive nature of H3R2me2a. At enhancers, H3R2me2a peaks co-localize with the active enhancer marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. Here, loss of H3R2me2a results in reduced KMT2D binding and H3K4me1/H3K27ac deposition together with decreased transcription of associated genes, indicating that H3R2me2a also exerts activation functions.

The regulation of apoptosis is thought to be crucial for normal embryonic development. Accordingly, complete loss of pro-survival MCL-1 or BCL-XL (BCL2L1) causes embryonic lethality. However, it is not known whether minor reductions in pro-survival proteins could cause developmental abnormalities. We explored the rate-limiting roles of MCL-1 and BCL-XL in development and show that combined loss of single alleles of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x causes neonatal lethality. Mcl-1(+/-);Bcl-x(+/-) mice display craniofacial anomalies, but additional loss of a single allele of pro-apoptotic Bim (Bcl2l11) restores normal development.

We previously demonstrated that Notch is constitutively activated in ATL cells. Activating genetic mutations were found in Notch; however, Notch signaling was also activated in the absence of genetic mutations suggesting the existence of other mechanisms. METHODS: We analyzed the expression of Notch receptor ligands in HTLV-I-transformed cells, ATL patient-derived cell lines, and fresh uncultured ATL samples by RT-PCR, FACS, and immunohistochemistry. We then investigated viral and cellular molecular mechanisms regulating expression of JAG1. Finally, using shRNA knock-down and neutralizing antibodies, we investigated the function of JAG1 in ATL cells. RESULTS: Here, we report the overexpression of the Notch ligand, JAG1, in freshly uncultured ATL patient samples compared to normal PBMCs. We found that in ATL cells, JAG1 overexpression relies upon the viral protein Tax and cellular miR-124a, STAT3, and NFATc1. Interestingly, our data show that blockade of JAG1 signaling dampens Notch1 downstream signaling and limits cell migration of transformed ATL cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that targeting JAG1 can block Notch1 activation in HTLV-I-transformed cells and represents a new target for immunotherapy in ATL patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*HTLV-I', '*JAG1', '*NF-kappaB', '*NFATc1', '*Notch', '*STAT3', '*miR-124']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a kinase involved in B cell receptor signaling. However, the potential regulation of neuroinflammatory responses in the brain by ibrutinib has not been comprehensively examined. METHODS: BV2 microglial cells were treated with ibrutinib (1 muM) or vehicle (1% DMSO), followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 mug/ml) or PBS. RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and subcellular fractionation were performed to examine the effects of ibrutinib on neuroinflammatory responses. In addition, wild-type mice were sequentially injected with ibrutinib (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle (10% DMSO, i.p.), followed by LPS (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or PBS, and microglial and astrocyte activations were assessed using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Ibrutinib significantly reduced LPS-induced increases in proinflammatory cytokine levels in BV2 microglial and primary microglial cells but not in primary astrocytes. Ibrutinib regulated TLR4 signaling to alter LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine levels. In addition, ibrutinib significantly decreased LPS-induced increases in p-AKT and p-STAT3 levels, suggesting that ibrutinib attenuates LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses by inhibiting AKT/STAT3 signaling pathways. Interestingly, ibrutinib also reduced LPS-induced BV2 microglial cell migration by inhibiting AKT signaling. Moreover, ibrutinib-injected wild-type mice exhibited significantly reduced microglial/astrocyte activation and COX-2 and IL-1beta proinflammatory cytokine levels.

However, knowledge of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulation of monocytic cell differentiation and diseases remains limited. We aimed to elucidate the role of the 17 kb lncRNA noncoding transcript in T cells (NTT) in monocyte functions. Knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays in THP-1 cells (human monocytic leukemia cell line) revealed that NTT is regulated by the monocyte key transcription factor C/EBPbeta and that it binds to the promoter of nearby gene PBOV1 via hnRNP-U. Overexpression of PBOV1 in THP-1 cells resulted in cell cycle G1 arrest, differentiation into macrophages, a marked increase in IL-10 and CXCL10 mRNA levels, and upregulation of the costimulatory molecules. In contrast to the downregulated NTT observed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated THP-1 cells, the C/EBPbeta/NTT/PBOV1 axis was found to be hyperactivated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of first-time diagnosed untreated early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and their gene expression levels decreased markedly after treatment. Higher initial C/EBPbeta/NTT/PBOV1 expression levels were associated with a trend of higher disease activity DAS28 scores. In conclusion, our study suggests that the lncRNA NTT is a regulator of inflammation in monocytes, and its activation participates in monocyte/macrophage differentiation and the pathogenesis of RA.",['NOTNLM'],"['C/EBPbeta', 'NTT', 'PBOV1', 'long noncoding RNA', 'monocyte differentiation', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They form the backbone of chemotherapy regimens used to treat childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, osteosarcoma, and neuroblastoma. More than 50% of children with cancer are treated with anthracyclines. The clinical utility of anthracyclines is compromised by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, manifesting initially as asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction and evolving irreversibly to congestive heart failure. Childhood cancer survivors are at a five- to 15-fold increased risk for congestive heart failure compared with the general population. Once diagnosed with congestive heart failure, the 5-year survival rate is less than 50%. Prediction models have been developed for childhood cancer survivors (i.e., after exposure to anthracyclines) to identify those at increased risk for cardiotoxicity. Studies are currently under way to test risk-reducing strategies. There remains a critical need to identify patients with childhood cancer at diagnosis (i.e., prior to anthracycline exposure) such that noncardiotoxic therapies can be contemplated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although T cells that express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) specific for CD19 have had remarkable success for B-cell-derived malignancies, which has led to their approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CAR T cells have been less effective for solid tumors and brain tumors. Lack of efficacy is most likely multifactorial, but heterogeneous antigen expression; limited migration of T cells to tumor sites; and the immunosuppressive, hostile tumor microenvironment have emerged as major roadblocks that must be addressed. In this review, we summarize the clinical experience with CAR T-cell therapy for pediatric solid tumors, including brain tumors. In addition, we review strategies that have been and are being developed to enhance their antitumor activity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic T cell leukemia and natural killer cell lymphocytosis can be considered as a similar spectrum of an indolent disease characterized by cytopenias and autoimmune conditions. The last category, aggressive natural killer cell LGL leukemia is very rare, related to Epstein-Barr virus, and seen mainly in young Asian people. Clonal LGL expansion arises from chronic antigenic stimulation sustained by interleukin-15 and platelet-derived growth factor cytokine signal. Those leukemic cells are resistant to apoptosis, mainly because of constitutive activation of survival pathways including Jak/Stat, MapK, Pi3k-Akt, RasRaf-1, MEK1/ERK, sphingolipid, and NFkappaB. Stat3 constitutive activation is the hallmark of this lymphoproliferative disorder. Socs3 is downregulated, but no mutation could be found to explain this status. However, several somatic mutations, including Stat3, Stat5b, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3, have been demonstrated recently in LGL leukemia; they are identified in half of patients and cannot explain by themselves LGL leukemogenesis. Recurrent infections as a result of chronic neutropenia, anemia, and autoimmune disorders are the main complications related to LGL leukemia. Despite an indolent presentation, 10% of patients die, mainly because of infectious complications. Current treatments are based on immunosuppressive therapies. A better mechanistic understanding of LGL leukemia will allow future consideration of a personalized therapeutic approach perhaps based on Jak/Stat inhibitors, which may offer better results than current immunosuppressive therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we performed a pan-cancer transcriptome analysis to identify aging-specific molecular patterns across 18 cancer types. Strikingly, aging-specific molecular features define human cancers into two types, including the strong and weak aging-effect groups. Significant aging associated molecular signature was observed in 16 cancer types (strong aging-effect group) such as breast invasive carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. In such 16 cancer types, old patients showed obvious poor survival compared to young patients, but this observation was not found in the weak aging-effect cancers. Aging-associated cancer-relevant molecules significantly enriched in 23 pathways including EMT and KRAS signaling. More interestingly, in cancer microenvironment, aging significantly restrains adaptive immunity, but strikingly, increases the number of infiltrated innate immune cells. Further analysis shows that the expression of immune checkpoints including PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2 and CTLA-4 are mostly correlated with age. In general, cancer cells in elderly patients show a more aggressive phenotype and their surrounding microenvironment is under a more immune suppression status compared to young patients. Our study provides a systematic understanding of aging-associated molecular features in pan-cancer and indicates a clinical requirement to develop aging-specific therapeutic strategies in a majority of cancer types. Furthermore, aging-altered immune cells and immune checkpoints should be considered in cancer immunotherapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['*PD-1', '*aging', '*cancer', '*immune checkpoints', '*immunotherapy']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9473-546X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6372-4765']",,,,,,['(c) 2018 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to determine whether a novel intervention targeting resilience resources would improve patient-reported resilience, quality of life, and psychological distress. METHODS: In this parallel, phase 2 randomized controlled trial, English-speaking AYAs (12-25 years old) with cancer were randomized to the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) intervention or usual care (UC). PRISM is a brief, skills-based intervention targeting stress management, goal setting, cognitive reframing, and meaning making. Participants completed surveys at enrollment and 6 months. Mixed effects regression models evaluated associations between PRISM and the primary outcome (10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale scores) and secondary outcomes (generic and cancer-related quality of life [Pediatric Quality of Life modules], psychological distress [Kessler-6], and anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression]) at 6 months. RESULTS: Ninety-two AYAs were enrolled, were randomized, and completed baseline surveys (48 in the PRISM group and 44 in the UC group); 73% were 12 to 17 years old, and 62% had leukemia or lymphoma. Attrition was primarily due to medical complications and/or death; 36 PRISM participants and 38 UC participants completed 6-month surveys. PRISM was associated with improved resilience (+3.0 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-5.4; P = .02) and cancer-specific quality of life (+9.6; 95% CI, 2.6-16.7; P = .01) and reduced psychological distress (-2.1; 95% CI, -4.1 to -0.2; P = .03) but not generic quality of life (+7.2; 95% CI, -0.8 to 15.2; P = .08). Although anxiety was similar between the groups, 2 PRISM participants (6%) and 8 UC participants (21%) met the criteria for depression at 6 months (odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-1.09; P = .06).

DATA AND METHODS: Data are from the Canadian Cancer Registry with mortality follow-up through record linkage to the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database and tax files. Net survival (NS) was derived using the Pohar Perme method. Predicted estimates of NS for the period from 2012 to 2014 were calculated using the period method. Age-standardized and age-specific changes in five-year NS between the periods from 1992 to 1994 and 2012 to 2014 were determined for 30 individual cancers. RESULTS: Predicted five-year NS for 2012 to 2014 ranged from 98% for thyroid cancer to 7% for mesothelioma. Between 1992 to 1994 and 2012 to 2014, improvements in five-year age standardized NS were greatest for chronic myeloid leukemia (23.9 percentage points), though a large majority of the increase occurred in the first decade. Increases exceeding 15.0 percentage points were also observed for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (19.5), cancer of the small intestine (17.4) and multiple myeloma (16.9). In contrast, little to no improvement was observed for cancers of the anus, larynx, soft tissue or uterus, or for mesothelioma. Increases in five-year NS were greatest for chronic myeloid leukemia in each age group with the exception of those aged 75 to 84 years (thyroid). DISCUSSION: This study reveals important areas of progress in cancer outcomes in Canada since the early 1990s. It also sheds light on cancers for which there has seemingly been no improvement in five-year net survival over a 20-year period.",['NOTNLM'],"['*neoplasms', '*net survival', '*population-based', '*prognosis', '*registries', '*survival analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, issues with PCZ tolerability can result in treatment interruption. Isavuconazole (ISA) has a similar broad spectrum of activity to PCZ; however, real-world data regarding the tolerability of ISA after PCZ toxicity are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To describe the tolerability of ISA after PCZ toxicity in leukaemia patients. PATIENTS/METHODS: We retrospectively assessed tolerability of ISA after PCZ toxicity in adult leukaemia patients (March 2015 to November 2017). We included all patients who received >/=7 days of ISA within 48 hours of PCZ discontinuation. Laboratory markers for liver toxicity were collected at three time points: prior to PCZ, at switch to ISA and after ISA therapy. RESULTS: We identified 23 such patients. Increased liver function tests (LFTs) were noted in 20 patients on PCZ, while three patients had Grade 3/4 QTc prolongation. No patient discontinued subsequent ISA due to toxicity. Grade 3/4 elevations in LFTs were decreased after changing to ISA (30% after PCZ vs 5% after ISA). No patient had significant QTc prolongation after switching to ISA.

This molecule plays a very important role in many solid tumors and shows changes in the bone marrow microenvironment. However, its role in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we established a HL-60 cell line with CCL2 knockdown to explore its effect on leukemogenesis. Lentivirus with CCL2-knockdown was successfully constructed after screening effective CCL2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences and was transfected into HL-60 cells, which was further validated at the mRNA and protein levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: Low expression of CCL2 significantly decreased HL-60 cell growth by increasing the cell arrest at G1 phase by 12% more than controls. We applied RNA sequencing technology to discriminate the gene expression profiles between the cells with CCL2 knockdown and the controls, and Cyclin D1 was selected for further experiments as its expression level was significantly downregulated, which was validated at the mRNA and protein levels. Cyclin D1 knockdown experiments showed that the cell proliferation rate was evidently decelerated, and cell cycle analysis also indicated a similar pattern for CCL2. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that Cyclin D1 is an effector that mediates CCL2's function in cell proliferation by blocking cells at G1 phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Nov 1.,"Human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. The development of HAM/TSP, a chronic neuroinflammatory disease, is correlated to complex interaction between the host immune response and the infecting virus. Tax expression plays an important role in HAM/TSP pathogenesis by activating various cellular genes, including the cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Exosomes have emerged as an important factor of cell-to-cell communication contributing to diverse cellular processes, including immune modulation. Considering the potential role of exosomes in modulating the immune response and inflammation, the main objective of this study was to examine if HTLV-1-infected cells produce exosomes carrying viral proteins or inflammatory molecules, which can participate in the chronic inflammation that is observed in patients with HAM/TSP. Exosomes were isolated from HTLV-1-infected cell line, evaluated for the tax mRNA presence, and tested for the ability to activate peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) in inducing an inflammatory immune response. We observed that the proinflammatory cytokines, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, were upregulated in T cells after treatment of the PBMC with Tax-carrying exosomes compared to the negative control. Interleukin-4, Granzyme B, and Perforin did not show alterations. Taken together, these results suggest that exosomes carrying tax-mRNA isolated from HTLV-1-infected cells might induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and activate T helper (Th)1, and not Th2-immune response. If this finding is further confirmed, this study may have impact on investigations on the pathogenesis of HAM-TSP and the inflammatory response involved in this disease.",['NOTNLM'],"['*HAM/TSP', '*HTLV-1', '*Tax', '*exosomes', '*interferon-gamma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 68-year old patient with a history of double allogeneic stem cell transplant for acute myeloid leukemia who developed a S. aureus bacteremia with dissemination, severe sepsis and lethal outcome due to nasal handkerchief packing after nose bleeding. CONCLUSION: A thorough medical examination with further diagnostic work-up is most important in S. aureus blood stream infection to identify and eradicate the portal(s) of entry, to rule out endocarditis, to search for spinal abscesses, osteomyelitis or spondylodiscitis.

The crosstalk between AML cells and the BM stroma is a major mechanism underlying therapy resistance in AML. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide, a new generation immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs), possess pleiotropic anti-leukemic properties including potent immune-modulating effects and are commonly used in hematological malignances associated with intrinsic dysfunctional BM such as myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma. Whether IMiDs may improve the efficacy of current standard treatment in AML remains understudied. Here, we have exploited in vitro and in vivo preclinical AML models to analyze whether IMiDs potentiate the efficacy of AraC/Idarubicin-based standard AML chemotherapy by interfering with the BM stroma-mediated chemoresistance. We report that IMiDs do not exert cytotoxic effects on either non-del5q/5q- AML cells nor BM-MSCs, but they enhance the immunomodulatory properties of BM-MSCs. When combined with AraC/Idarubicin, IMiDs fail to circumvent BM stroma-mediated resistance of non-del5q/5q- AML cells in vitro and in vivo but induce robust extramedullary mobilization of AML cells. When administered as a single agent, lenalidomide specifically mobilizes non-del5q/5q- AML cells, but not healthy CD34(+) cells, to peripheral blood (PB) through specific downregulation of CXCR4 in AML blasts.

Most of them target a single antigen on the surface of AML cells. Here we describe the development and key biological properties of a tri-specific agent, the dual-targeting triplebody SPM-2, with binding sites for target antigens CD33 and CD123, and for CD16 to engage NK cells as cytolytic effectors. Primary blasts of nearly all AML patients carry at least one of these target antigens and the pair is particularly promising for the elimination of blasts and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) from a majority of AML patients by dual-targeting agents. The cytolytic activity of NK cells mediated by SPM-2 was analyzed in vitro for primary leukemic cells from 29 patients with a broad range of AML-subtypes. Blasts from all 29 patients, including patients with genomic alterations associated with an unfavorable genetic subtype, were lysed at nanomolar concentrations of SPM-2. Maximum susceptibility was observed for cells with a combined density of CD33 and CD123 above 10,000 copies/cell. Cell populations enriched for AML-LSCs (CD34pos and CD34pos CD38neg cells) from 2 AML patients carried an increased combined antigen density and were lysed at correspondingly lower concentrations of SPM-2 than unsorted blasts. These initial findings raise the expectation that SPM-2 may also be capable of eliminating AML-LSCs and thus of prolonging survival. In the future, patients with a broad range of AML subtypes may benefit from treatment with SPM-2.",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CD33-CD16-CD123', '*NK cells', '*dual targeting', '*immunotherapy', '*redirected lysis', '*single-chain triplebodies', '*therapeutic antibodies']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3378-3967'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhancement of anti-tumor responses by blocking negative immune regulators is a promising strategy for novel effective leukemia therapeutics. V-domain Ig suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) is a recently defined negative regulator mediating immune evasion in cancer. To investigate the effect of VISTA on anti-leukemia immune response in AML, we initiated a study using clinical samples collected from AML patients. Here we report that VISTA is highly expressed on myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the peripheral blood of AML patients. Both the frequency and intensity of VISTA expression on MDSCs are significantly higher in newly diagnosed AML than in healthy controls. Importantly knockdown of VISTA by specific siRNA potently reduced the MDSCs-mediated inhibition of CD8 T cell activity in AML, suggesting a suppressive effect of VISTA on anti-leukemia T cell response. Furthermore, we observed a strong positive association between MDSC expression of VISTA and T cell expression of PD-1 in AML. These results support the strategy of VISTA-targeted treatment for AML and underscore the strong potential for combined blockade of VISTA and PD-1 pathways in effective leukemia control.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*VISTA', '*immunotherapy', '*programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0396-5804'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that mice lacking Bcor exon 4 (Bcor (DeltaE4/y) ) in the hematopoietic compartment developed NOTCH-dependent acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we analyzed mice lacking Bcor exons 9 and 10 (Bcor (DeltaE9-10/y) ), which express a carboxyl-terminal truncated BCOR that fails to interact with core effector components of polycomb repressive complex 1.1. Bcor (DeltaE9-10/y) mice developed lethal T-ALL in a similar manner to Bcor (DeltaE4/y) mice, whereas Bcor (DeltaE9-10/y) hematopoietic cells showed a growth advantage in the myeloid compartment that was further enhanced by the concurrent deletion of Tet2 Tet2 (Delta/Delta) Bcor (DeltaE9-10/y) mice developed lethal MDS with progressive anemia and leukocytopenia, inefficient hematopoiesis, and the morphological dysplasia of blood cells. Tet2 (Delta/Delta) Bcor (DeltaE9-10/y) MDS cells reproduced MDS or evolved into lethal MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms in secondary recipients. Transcriptional profiling revealed the derepression of myeloid regulator genes of the Cebp family and Hoxa cluster genes in Bcor (DeltaE9-10/y) progenitor cells and the activation of p53 target genes specifically in MDS erythroblasts where massive apoptosis occurred.

In this study, we report that both GAS8-AS1 and its host gene GAS8 act as HCC tumor suppressors. We found that expression of GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 is significantly decreased in HCC tissues and is associated with a poor prognosis among HCC patients. Interestingly, lncRNA GAS8-AS1 could promote GAS8 transcription. We detected a CpG island in the GAS8 promoter, but lncRNA GAS8-AS1 did not affect DNA methylation at this GAS8 promoter site. Moreover, we identified two GAS8-AS1-interacting proteins, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), a histone 3 Lys-4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, and its partner WD-40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5). RNA pulldown, ChIP, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GAS8-AS1 is required for maintaining the GAS8 promoter in an open chromatin state by recruiting the MLL1/WDR5 complex and for enhancing RNA polymerase II activity and GAS8 transcription. Of note, GAS8-AS1-dependent GAS8 hyperactivation inhibited malignant transformation of hepatocytes.

However, there are no clinical trials that have directly compared these agents. We conducted a systematic review and indirectly compared the efficacy of azacitidine to decitabine in MDS. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of several databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus) through June 28, 2018, without language or time restrictions. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers, and differences were resolved by consensus. The fixed effect model and adjusted indirect comparison methods were used to pool relative risks (RR) of major outcomes of interest (mortality, response rate, quality of life, hematologic improvement, hospitalization, leukemia transformation, transfusion independence). RESULTS: Only four trials met the eligibility criteria. Two trials compared azacitidine to the best supportive care (BSC) and included 549 patients, and the other two compared decitabine to BSC and included 403 patients. The risk of bias was unclear overall. Compared to BSC, azacitidine was significantly associated with lower mortality (RR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.94, I(2) = 89%) whereas decitabine did not significantly reduce mortality (RR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-1.00, I(2) = 53%). Both drugs were associated with higher partial and complete response compared to BSC. Indirect comparisons were not statistically significant for all the studied outcomes, except for complete response where azacitidine was less likely to induce complete response compared to decitabine (RR = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.01-0.86, very low-certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS: Azacitidine and decitabine are both associated with improved outcomes compared to BSC. The available indirect evidence comparing the two agents warrants very low certainty and cannot reliably confirm the superiority of either agent. Head-to-head trials are needed. In the meantime, the choice of agent should be driven by patient preferences, adverse effects, drug availability, and cost.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Azacitidine', '*Decitabine', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*Network meta-analysis']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6098-8450'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A broad range of diseases are characterized by CDK9 malfunction, illustrating its importance in maintaining transcriptional homeostasis in basal- and signal-regulated conditions. Here we provide a historical recount of CDK9 discovery and the current models suggesting CDK9 is a central hub necessary for proper execution of different steps in the transcription cycle.

However, their effects on solid tumor cells have not been determined. In this study, we investigated the effects of MPT0B169 and MPT0B002 on glioblastoma, breast, lung, and colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines. A cell viability analysis showed that MPT0B169 and MPT0B002 were more effective in inhibiting the proliferation of COLO205 and HT29 CRC cells than U87MG and GBM8401 glioblastoma, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, and A549 lung cancer cells. MPT0B169 and MPT0B002 inhibited growth of COLO205 and HT29 cells in dose- and time-dependent manners. A colony-formation assay confirmed the growth inhibitory effects of MPT0B169 and MPT0B002 on COLO205 and HT29 cells. MPT0B169 and MPT0B002 disrupted tubulin polymerization and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, with a concomitant increase of the cyclin B1 level. MPT0B169 and MPT0B002 induced apoptosis, accompanied by induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as shown by a reduction in the caspase-9 level and increases in cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. These results suggest that MPT0B169 and MPT0B002, new tubulin inhibitors, induced growth inhibition, G2/M arrest, and apoptosis in COLO205 and HT29 cells, and they could potentially be anticancer agents for CRC cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Colorectal cancer cells', 'G2/M arrest', 'Growth inhibition', 'MPT0B002', 'MPT0B169', 'Tubulin inhibitor']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 S.

In comparison with Caucasian populations, in Mexico a significantly higher prevalence of acute lymphoblastic, acute promyelocytic, and acute megakaryoblastic leukemias has been described. The rate of chronic myeloid leukemia seems to be as high as that reported in Caucasian populations, while other myeloproliferative neoplasias are significantly less frequent in Mexico. Significantly lower prevalences of hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia have been reported from Mexico.

METHODS: Since 2001, guidelines for treatment with imatinib mesylate (IM) and monitoring in patients younger than 18 years with CP-CML have been shared with 9 pediatric referral centers (P centers) and 4 reference centers for adults and children/adolescents (AP centers) in Italy. In this study, the adherence to these guidelines was analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with a median age of 11.4 years and 23 patients with a median age of 11.0 years were managed at 9 P and at 4 AP centers, respectively. Evaluations of bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) were available for more than 90% of evaluable patients. Cytogenetics and molecular monitoring of PB were more consistently performed in AP centers, whereas molecular analysis of BM was carried out more frequently in P centers. Before 2009, some patients who responded to IM underwent a transplantation, contrary to the guidelines' recommendations.

Epub 2018 Sep 18.,"INTRODUCTION: Myeloid sarcoma (MS), previously known as granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma, is a rare neoplastic condition defined as a tumor mass consisting of myeloblasts or immature myeloid cells occurring at an extramedullary site. Clinical presentation is diverse and determined by a tumor mass effect or local organ dysfunction. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 25-year-old previously healthy male with rapidly progressive shortness of breath. A chest CT scan demonstrated a heterogenous anterosuperior mediastinal mass with pleural and pericardial invasion. A diagnosis of MS with both myeloid and lymphoid characteristics was made by pathologic, morphologic, and immunophenotypic investigation. Next generation analysis revealed a pathogenic TP53 mutation (c.1035_1036insCT, p.Glu346Leufs*25). After 4 cycles of chemotherapy only a partial metabolic response and tumor size reduction was obtained. A pretransplant bone marrow biopsy revealed the progression of disease to acute myeloid leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated a t(10; 11)(p12;q21). Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of a PICALM-MLLT10 fusion gene. CONCLUSION: MS with a mediastinal localization is rare and often misdiagnosed as malignant lymphoma. Acute leukemia harboring a PICALM-MLLT10 fusion gene is characterized by a mixed T cell and myeloid phenotype. The rearrangement is a rare recurrent translocation associated with specific clinical features, as illustrated in this case report.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*MLLT10-PICALM', '*Mediastinum', '*Myeloid sarcoma', '*TP53 mutation']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 S.

This study has evaluated transplant outcomes in 223 CML patients with TKI failure due to resistance (n = 132) or intolerance (n = 29), as well as those that were TKI naive/responding with advanced disease (n = 35) or with chronic phase (CP, n = 27). We studied outcomes according to post-transplant BCR-ABL transcript level within 3 months. With respect to transplant outcomes according to the post-transplant BCR/ABLtranscript level within 3 months, the group failing to achieve a 1.3 log reduction (n = 14, 12.4%) showed the highest relapse rate of 78.6% at 5 years, compared to 26.2% and 24.1% in the groups achieving 1.3-4.0 log reduction (n = 45, 39.8%), and >/=4.1 log reduction (n = 54, 47.8%) respectively (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the group failing to achieve a 1.3 log reduction had a 2.3-fold higher risk of death and 6.6 times higher risk of relapse. Poor overall survival after HCT was associated with advanced disease at diagnosis, but not disease status prior to HCT. Of 61 patients who relapsed after HCT, 47 were treated with post-transplant TKI therapy; those receiving TKI after loss of MR2 or MMR showed higher rates of response and survival compared to those receiving TKI after hematologic relapse (p < 0.001).

Epub 2018 Sep 15.,"The current standard of care for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is high-dose conditioning followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). For some patients (ie, those with highest-risk disease, insufficient stem cell numbers after mobilization, or bone marrow involvement) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) offers the potential for cure. However, the majority of patients undergoing alloHCT receive reduced-intensity conditioning as a preparative regimen, and studies assessing outcomes of patients after alloHCT with myeloablative conditioning are limited. In this retrospective study, we reviewed outcomes of 22 patients with recurrent and refractory NHL who underwent alloHCT with myeloablative BEAM conditioning and received tacrolimus/sirolimus as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis at City of Hope between 2005 and 2018. With a median follow-up of 2.6 years (range, 1.0 to 11.2 years), the probabilities of 2-year overall survival and event-free survival were 58.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35.0% to 75.8%) and 45.5% (95% CI, 24.4% to 64.3%), respectively. The cumulative incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was 45.5% (95% CI, 23.8% to 64.9%), with only 1 patient developing grade IV acute GVHD. However, chronic GVHD was seen in 55% of the patients (n=12). Of the 22 eligible patients, 2 had undergone previous ASCT and 2 had undergone previous alloHCT. Both patients with previous ASCT developed severe regimen-related toxicity. Patients who underwent alloHCT with chemorefractory disease had lower survival rates, with 1-year OS and EFS of 44.4% and 33.0%, respectively. In conclusion, alloHCT with a BEAM preparative regimen and tacrolimus/sirolimus-based GVHD should be considered as an alternative option for patients with highest-risk lymphoma whose outcomes are expectedly poor after ASCT.",['NOTNLM'],"['*BEAM conditioning', '*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*tacrolimus/sirolimus']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

The purpose of this study was to reveal changes in the gene expression profile caused by enniatin B in human Jurkat lymphoblastic T-cells after 24h of exposure at 1.5, 3 and 5muM by next generation sequencing. It was found that up to 27% of human genome expression levels were significantly altered (5750 genes for both down-regulation and up-regulation). In the three enniatin B concentrations studied 245 differentially expressed genes were found to be overlapped, 83 were down and 162 up-regulated. ConsensusPathDB analysis of over-representation of differentially expressed genes provided a list of gene ontology terms in which several biological processes related to nucleoside monophosphate metabolic process, respiratory chain complex, electron transport chain, oxidative phosphorylation and cellular respiration were the most altered. Also, an interesting correlation was found between enniatin B toxicity and the up-regulation of the UCP protein complex. In summary, the transcriptomic analysis revealed that mitochondria are the organelles showing more related differentially expressed genes. Consequently, differentially expressed genes involved in biological processes, molecular functions and pathways related to mitochondrial metabolism and respiration were significantly changed.",['NOTNLM'],"['Gene ontology', 'In vitro', 'Jurkat', 'RT-qPCR', 'Transcriptomics']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

As an endpoint in hematologic malignancies, minimal residual disease (MRD) measures the depth of response to treatment, and has been given initial attention in draft regulatory guidelines and workshops by health authorities in the EU and US. METHODS: In this paper, we analyze hematologic malignancy trials by searching for terms in Trialtrove, parsing the data sets with ActivePerl, and determining significance with the statistical package R. RESULTS: We identify trends in the use of MRD compared to other endpoints and in different indications over time from 2005 to 2014. Results show that 2 trends of endpoint and MRD use emerge over time and the use of MRD as a primary endpoint is growing. We also take a case-study approach to investigate the functional context of MRD in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and show that it is predominantly used to determine MRD-negativity and also in correlation with other endpoints. CONCLUSION: The application of informatics tools to regulatory science can evaluate the role and context of MRD as it evolves in the changing pharmaceutical landscape.",['NOTNLM'],"['Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use', 'Food and Drug Administration', 'acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'biomarker', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'multiple myeloma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 29.,"ASXL1 is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies and is known to co-occur with other gene mutations. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the leukemogenesis associated with ASXL1 and cooperating mutations remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that Asxl1 loss cooperated with haploinsufficiency of Nf1, a negative regulator of the RAS signaling pathway, to accelerate the development of myeloid leukemia in mice. Loss of Asxl1 and Nf1 in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells resulted in a gain-of-function transcriptional activation of multiple pathways such as MYC, NRAS, and BRD4 that are critical for leukemogenesis. The hyperactive MYC and BRD9 transcription programs were correlated with elevated H3K4 trimethylation at the promoter regions of genes involving these pathways. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of both the MAPK pathway and BET bromodomain prevented leukemia initiation and inhibited disease progression in Asxl1Delta/Delta Nf1Delta/Delta mice. Concomitant mutations of ASXL1 and RAS pathway genes were associated with aggressive progression of myeloid malignancies in patients. This study sheds light on the effect of cooperation between epigenetic alterations and signaling pathways on accelerating the progression of myeloid malignancies and provides a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of myeloid malignancies with ASXL1 and RAS pathway gene mutations.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetics', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether the methy-lation of lysines on HMT complex components occurs and has functions in cancer progression is less well understood. WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) is a core component of an HMT complex named mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)/Suppressor of Variegation, Enhancer of Zeste, and Trithorax 1 (SET1). In the present study, it was reported that lysines 207 and 325 (K207 and K325, respectively) of WDR5 were monomethylated by SETdomaincontaining protein methyltransferase 6. Disrupting the methylation of K207/K325 via a K207R/K325R doublesite mutation attenuated the WDR5 promotion of breast cancer cell proliferation and migration. Methylation of K207/K325 on WDR5 partially contributed to maintaining global histone trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 levels, but did not affect MLL/SET1 complex assembly. These results further understanding of a potential posttranslational modification of WDR5, and imply that the methylation of lysines on HMT complex components is crucial for regulating human carcinogenesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of 3,5diCbetaDglucopyranosyl phloroacetophenone (betaGP), a main component of M. ptelefolia, on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A model of collageninduced arthritis (CIA) was established in mice using the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The clinical scores of arthritis, swelling, histopathological findings, and microcomputed tomography in CIA mouse paws were assessed. The levels of antitype II collagen antibody and cytokines were determined in the plasma and cell culture supernatant, respectively. Protein and gene expression levels were analyzed by western blot and reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. betaGP significantly decreased the gross arthritic scores of CIA mice and joint swelling, and decreased articular inflammation, cartilage degradation and bone erosion. However, betaGP did not exert any effect on antitype II collagen immunoglobulin G plasma levels or inflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages. betaGP significantly suppressed the expression of interleukin6 and leukemia inhibitory factor and decreased the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and expression of receptor activator of nuclear factorkappaB ligand in tumor necrosis factoralphastimulated MEFs and in CIA mouse paws. Osteoclastrelated gene expression was significantly reduced in CIA mouse paws. Taken together, betaGP suppressed the development of RA by regulating the activation of synovial fibroblasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the treatment is associated with adverse events such as retinoic acid syndrome (RAS) in some patients, whose histologic characteristics included organ infiltration by leukemic cells. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) is often upregulated in tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell migration and invasion by degrading the extracellular matrix. In this study, we examined the possible modulatory effects of ATRA on MMP-2 expression and secretion in human myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1. The cells were treated with various concentrations of ATRA, and MMP-2 expression and secretion were examined. MMP-2 expression and secretion started to increase with ATRA concentration as low as 0.1 nM and gradually increased thereafter. Agonists of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) or retinoid X receptor (RXR) alone could enhance MMP-2 secretion, and RAR or RXR antagonists alone could reverse ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. ATRA increased intracellular calcium ion levels, and a calcium-channel blocker inhibited ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. Dexamethasone suppressed ATRA-induced MMP-2 secretion. Our results suggest that ATRA enhances MMP-2 expression and secretion in human myeloid leukemia THP-1 cells in a calcium ion dependent manner through RAR/RXR signaling pathways, and this enhanced expression and secretion may be associated with the possible mechanisms of RAS.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0401-5843', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9323-3580']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have identified a biologically active component, icaritin, from a Chinese herba epimedii extract. Icaritin promotes platelet production and regulates T cell polarization, but its mechanism is not clear. In this study, the BALB/c mouse model of ITP was established by injection of an antiplatelet antibody every other day for seven total times. The antiplatelet sera were derived from guinea pigs immunized with the platelets of BALB/c mice. Mice with ITP were treated with icaritin at low, moderate, or high doses of 4.73, 9.45, and 18.90 mg/kg, respectively, for fourteen consecutive days. The present study shows that icaritin can significantly increase peripheral blood platelet counts and thrombocytocrit, increase the TPO level in serum, attenuate splenomegaly, and reduce the abnormal proliferation of megakaryocytes in the spleen and bone marrow.

To date, the only potentially curative therapy for these disorders remains allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation (HCT), although patient eligibility is limited due to high morbimortality associated with this procedure coupled with advanced age of most patients. Dopamine receptors (DRs) and serotonin receptors type 1 (HTR1s) were identified as cancer stem cell therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia. Given their close pathophysiologic relationship, expression of HTR1s and DRs was interrogated in MDS and CMML. Both receptors were differentially expressed in patient samples compared to healthy donors. Treatment with HTR1B antagonists reduced cell viability. HTR1 antagonists showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect with currently approved hypomethylating agents in AML cells. Our results suggest that HTR1B constitutes a novel therapeutic target for MDS and CMML.

However, the mechanisms of effective action of idelalisib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In the current study, we aimed to investigate how idelalisib inhibits the growth of HCC cells and enhances the effects of other chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results show that idelalisib treatment promotes Bim induction in HCC via the FoxO3a pathway following PI3K/AKT inactivation. Moreover, our results show that Bim is required for idelalisib-mediated apoptosis in HCC. Idelalisib also synergizes with sorafenib or doxorubicin to induce significant apoptosis in HCC, and Bim is also necessary for the induction of apoptosis by cotreatment. Furthermore, a xenograft experiment reveals that the Bim deficiency abolishes apoptosis and antitumor effects of idelalisib in vivo. In summary, our results indicate a key role of Bim in mediating the antitumor effects of idelalisib in HCC. Our results also support the clinical significance of the drug.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generate a catalog of bona fide bivalent genes in ESCs and demonstrate that loss of MLL2 leads to increased Polycomb occupancy. Consequently, promoters lose accessibility, long-range interactions are redistributed, and ESCs fail to differentiate.

Suppression of the NOTCH pathway using gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) is toxic and clinically not effective. The goal of this study was to identify alternative therapeutic strategies for T-ALL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a comprehensive analysis of our high-throughput drug screen across hundreds of human cell lines including 15 T-ALL models. We validated and further studied the top hit, navitoclax (ABT-263). We used multiple human T-ALL cell lines as well as primary patient samples, and performed both in vitro experiments and in vivo studies on patient-derived xenograft models. RESULTS: We found that T-ALL are hypersensitive to navitoclax, an inhibitor of BCL2 family of antiapoptotic proteins. Importantly, GSI-resistant T-ALL are also susceptible to navitoclax. Sensitivity to navitoclax is due to low levels of MCL-1 in T-ALL. We identify an unsuspected regulation of mTORC1 by the NOTCH pathway, resulting in increased MCL-1 upon GSI treatment. Finally, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1 lowers MCL-1 levels and further sensitizes cells to navitoclax in vitro and leads to tumor regressions in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the development of navitoclax, as single agent and in combination with mTOR inhibitors, as a new therapeutic strategy for T-ALL, including in the setting of GSI resistance.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4452-9320', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8751-9707']",,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 17.,"PURPOSE: T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive disease, affecting children and adults. Chemotherapy treatments show high response rates but have debilitating effects and carry risk of relapse. Previous work implicated NOTCH1 and other oncogenes. However, direct inhibition of these pathways affects healthy tissues and cancer alike. Our goal in this work has been to identify enzymes active in T-ALL whose activity could be targeted for therapeutic purposes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To identify and characterize new NOTCH1 druggable partners in T-ALL, we coupled studies of the NOTCH1 interactome to expression analysis and a series of functional analyses in cell lines, patient samples, and xenograft models. RESULTS: We demonstrate that ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) interacts with NOTCH1 and controls leukemia growth by stabilizing the levels of NOTCH1 and JMJD3 histone demethylase. USP7 is highly expressed in T-ALL and is transcriptionally regulated by NOTCH1. In turn, USP7 controls NOTCH1 levels through deubiquitination. USP7 binds oncogenic targets and controls gene expression through stabilization of NOTCH1 and JMJD3 and ultimately H3K27me3 changes. We also show that USP7 and NOTCH1 bind T-ALL superenhancers, and inhibition of USP7 leads to a decrease of the transcriptional levels of NOTCH1 targets and significantly blocks T-ALL cell growth in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide a new model for USP7 deubiquitinase activity through recruitment to oncogenic chromatin loci and regulation of both oncogenic transcription factors and chromatin marks to promote leukemia. Our studies also show that targeting USP7 inhibition could be a therapeutic strategy in aggressive leukemia.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8872-9266', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7036-1053', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5693-8570', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0125-3718', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3471-2132']",,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 14.,"The unchecked tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 contributes to the immortality of leukaemic cells. Therefore, this oncogene is a highly important therapeutic target for chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are an excellent drug treatment for CML patients. However, there are still some patients who are not responsive to TKIs. We found that a novel circular RNA (circRNA), named circBA9.3, is derived from BCR-ABL1. CircBA9.3 can efficiently promote the proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of cancer cells. In addition, some patients with TKI resistance have elevated circBA9.3 expression, which is positively correlated with the level of BCR-ABL1. Furthermore, circBA9.3 is predominantly located in the cytoplasm and enhances c-ABL1 and BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein expression. Thus, circBA9.3 is a molecule associated with increased tyrosine kinase activity that promotes resistance against TKI therapy. In this study, we provided a new potential target for the treatment of TKI-resistant CML patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*Chronic myelogenous leukaemia', '*Circular RNA', '*Drug resistance', '*Proliferation']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

However, transcriptomic analysis is challenging because the data is inherently noisy and high-dimensional. Gene set analysis is currently widely used to alleviate the issue of high dimensionality, but the user-defined choice of gene sets can introduce biasness in results. In this paper, we advocate the use of a fixed set of transcriptomic modules for such analysis. We apply independent component analysis to the large collection of microarray data in GEO in order to discover reproducible transcriptomic modules that can be used as features for machine learning. We evaluate the usability of these modules across six studies, and demonstrate (1) their usage as features for sample classification, and also their robustness in dealing with small training sets, (2) their regularization of data when clustering samples and (3) the biological relevancy of differentially expressed features. RESULTS: We identified 139 reproducible transcriptomic modules, which we term fundamental components (FCs). In studies with less than 50 samples, FC-space classification model outperformed their gene-space counterparts, with higher sensitivity (p < 0.01). The models also had higher accuracy and negative predictive value (p < 0.01) for small data sets (less than 30 samples). Additionally, we observed a reduction in batch effects when data is clustered in the FC-space. Finally, we found that differentially expressed FCs mapped to GO terms that were also identified via traditional gene-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The 139 FCs provide biologically-relevant summarization of transcriptomic data, and their performance in low sample settings suggest that they should be employed in such studies in order to harness the data efficiently.",['NOTNLM'],"['Functional modules', 'Gene expression', 'Independent component analysis', 'Transcriptome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 17.,"BACKGROUND:: The prognosis of hematologic malignancies has improved over the past three decades. However, the prognosis in hematologic malignancies with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome has remained poor. Initial reports regarding the utility of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in hematologic malignancies have been controversial, with limited evaluations of acute leukemia patients supported by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. METHODS:: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with acute leukemia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support at our facility from July 2015 through August 2017. RESULTS:: Four cases of acute myelogenous leukemia with respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome treated with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation while undergoing induction chemotherapy were identified. All patients completed induction therapy with addition of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, with two patients dying secondary to their acute leukemia and the other two surviving to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Overall, 75% (three of four) survived to decannulation with a 1-year survival rate following extracorporeal membrane oxygenation of 50% (two of four). CONCLUSION:: Currently, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with hematologic malignancies who develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome remains controversial. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant is associated with poorer outcomes, our data suggest that salvage extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support is a viable option to manage moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome while completing therapeutic chemotherapy and following in the peri-induction phase of acute leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute respiratory distress syndrome', 'acute myelogenous leukemia', 'extracorporeal membrane oxygenation', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BPT, only patients who achieve complete response (CR) after chemoradiation have a favorable prognosis and quality of life with a preserved functional bladder. Thus, predicting CR and favorable prognosis is important for optimal patient selection for BPT. We reviewed biomarkers for predicting the clinical outcomes of chemoradiation-based BPT. The biomarkers studied were categorized into those related to apoptosis, cell proliferation, receptor tyrosine kinases, DNA damage response genes, hypoxia, molecular subtype, and others. Among these biomarkers, the Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) and meiotic recombination 11 may be used for selecting BPT or RC. Ki-67 LI and erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (erbB2) may be used for predicting both the chemoradiation response and the prognosis of patients on BPT. Concurrent use of trastuzumab and a combination of carbogen and nicotinamide can overcome chemoradiation resistance conferred by erbB2 overexpression and tumor hypoxia.

Finally, the presence of clonal heterogeneity was associated with adverse prognosis for patients receiving intensive antileukemic treatment.

To reveal whether this overexpression is epigenetically regulated, we performed an integrative analysis of miRNA/mRNA expression and DNA methylation of the regulatory sequences in the region (promoter of the MEG3 gene) in CD34+ bone marrow cells from the patients with higher-risk MDS and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC), before and during hypomethylating therapy with azacytidine (AZA). Before treatment, 50% of patients showed significant miRNA/mRNA overexpression in conjunction with a diagnosis of AML-MRC. Importantly, increased level of MEG3 was associated with poor outcome. After AZA treatment, the expression levels were reduced and were closer to those seen in the healthy controls. In half of the patients, we observed significant hypermethylation in a region preceding the MEG3 gene that negatively correlated with expression. Interestingly, this hypermethylation (when found before treatment) was associated with longer progression-free survival after therapy initiation. However, neither expression nor methylation status were associated with future responsiveness to AZA treatment. In conclusion, we correlated expression and methylation changes in the DLK1(-)DIO3 region, and we propose a complex model for regulation of this region in myelodysplasia.",['NOTNLM'],"['14q32', 'MEG3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'microRNA', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6345-9180', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9158-881X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 17.,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a relapsed and refractory hematological malignancy with a lower morbidity but higher mortality. In addition to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy is used as the front-line treatment. However, the diversity of available agents and the inconsistency of outcomes of relevant trials render treatment decision-making tough. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is an efficient statistical framework that makes a comprehensive comparison and provides a valuable clinical reference. METHODS: All the potential trials were retrieved from the medical database and screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The main characteristics of each trial as well as the primary outcomes, including complete remission (CR), overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS), were extracted. In addition, the network graph was plotted to illustrate the connections among the trials involved. Comparison results in the network were exhibited in a forest plot. Furthermore, the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was introduced to rank the treatments for each endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 11 trials were selected from 1,625 identifications. No significant difference in the common treatment was observed for the endpoints CR and ORR. In terms of OS, CPX-351 (HR: 0.77, 95% CrI: 0.63, 0.94) and HiDAC plus MK-8776 (HR: 0.80, 95% CrI: 0.68, 0.93) showed a superiority over the common salvage regimen in the short term, while HiDAC plus MK-8776 (HR: 0.80, 95% CrI: 0.70, 0.93) and Ara-C plus vosaroxin (HR: 0.86, 95% CrI: 0.74, 0.99) outperformed the common salvage regimen for the 3-year OS. In addition, clofarabine plus Ara-C (HR: 0.61, 95% CrI: 0.53, 0.69) and CPX-351 (HR: 0.71, 95% CrI: 0.60, 0.83) were confirmed to be efficacious in enhancing the rate of EFS. CONCLUSION: Referring to the network outcome and SUCRA value, clofarabine plus Ara-C (CR: 79.05%, ORR: 80.02%) and Ara-C plus vosaroxin (CR: 75.42%, ORR: 73.43%) were potentially the top two choices for both CR and ORR. CPX-351 (1-year OS: 91.36%), HiDAC plus MK-8776 (3-year OS: 94.23%) and clofarabine plus Ara-C (1-year EFS: 97.34%) yielded the highest probabilities to be the optimal choices for 1-year OS, 3-year OS and 1-year EFS, respectively.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Complete remission', 'Meta-analysis', 'Overall response rate']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease. Until recently, treatment for patients with AML was limited to induction chemotherapy with cytarabine and anthracycline or hypomethylating agents, and, in some instances, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. With the recent approval of new therapies-i.e., CPX-351, enasidenib, ivosidenib, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and midostaurin-a new era in AML treatment has emerged. Comprehensive diagnostic testing, such as cytogenetic and molecular testing, is necessary for establishing patient eligibility for these new agents and should be performed in a timely manner. However, choosing a therapy for patients who are eligible for multiple treatments may be a complex process, particularly for patients with newly diagnosed AML. This review discusses data, including associated safety profiles that supported these recent approvals, and provides insights to help clinicians navigate new therapy options for this devastating disease. Given the heterogeneity of AML, the treatment landscape will likely continue to grow and evolve as additional agents (and their combinations) are approved for the treatment of subpopulations of patients with AML. Physicians will need to remain abreast of the ever-changing treatment landscape.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*CPX-351', '*Enasidenib', '*Gemtuzumab ozogamicin', '*Ivosidenib', '*Midostaurin']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

MTX is cytotoxic as it impairs DNA and RNA synthesis by inhibiting the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS). The association between genetic variants within the TYMS gene and MTX-induced toxicity has been studied, but results are inconsistent. We determined the role of three previously described variants within the TYMS gene and MTX-induced oral mucositis in a prospective cohort of Dutch children with ALL and performed a meta-analysis of the previous results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the presence of a 28-base pair tandem repeat (rs34743033; 2R3R), a single nucleotide polymorphism present within the 28-base pair repeat on the 3R allele (rs2853542; 3RG>C) and a 6-base pair deletion (rs15126436; TTAAAG) within the TYMS gene in germline DNA of 117 pediatric patients with ALL. Oral mucositis was defined as grade>/=3 according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.3.0. Data were analyzed for the individual rs34743033 (2R3R) and rs151264360 (6 bp deletion) polymorphisms, whereas rs2853542 (3RG>C) was combined with rs34743033 (2R3R) and analyzed according to predicted expression levels of TYMS: low expression (2R/2R, 2R/3RC and 3RC/3RC), median expression (2R/3RG and 3RC/3RG) and high expression (3RG/3RG). We performed a meta-analysis of the current literature on these polymorphisms in relation to oral mucositis using a fixed effects model. RESULTS: The 2R2R genotype (rs34743033) was not significantly associated with developing MTX-induced oral mucositis compared with the 2R3R/3R3R genotypes, which was confirmed in a meta-analysis [odds ratio (OR): 1.17 (0.62-2.19)]. Patients carrying the low-expression TYMS genotype (2R2R, 2R3RC, 3RC3RC) had an increased odds of developing MTX-induced oral mucositis [OR: 2.42 (0.86-6.80)], which did not reach statistical significance. The 6-bp deletion [rs151264360, OR: 0.79 (0.20-3.19)] was not associated with the development of MTX-induced oral mucositis. CONCLUSION: The TYMS 6-bp deletion and 2R3R polymorphism were not associated with MTX-induced oral mucositis. Validation studies in prospective cohorts are necessary to assess the possible role of the low-expression TYMS genotypes in relation to MTX-induced oral mucositis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: The outcome of URD stem cell transplants in terms of treatment-related mortality, relapse rates, disease free survival and overall survival is comparable to sibling donors. SUMMARY: Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the therapy of choice in many haematological malignant diseases but only one-third of the patients will have an HLA-matched sibling. The possibility of finding a matched URD is more than 70% because of recent advances in HLA typing and continuous expansion of URD registries around the world. The use of URD as a source of stem cells in adult patients are steadily increasing and in the last 8 years, superseded the matched sibling donors and became the most commonly used stem cell source.

This review will summarize biological, genetic and clinical features of childhood MDS and will provide an update of the algorithm of treatment of the different disease variants. RECENT FINDINGS: The most recent classification of MDS includes refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC), advanced and therapy-related MDS. Importantly, in children, these clonal hematopoietic disorders may be often associated with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, this representing a challenge for diagnostic work-up and treatment. Moreover, germline syndromes predisposing to develop MDS/acute myeloid leukemia have been recently identified, such as those caused by mutations in GATA2, ETV6, SRP72 and SAMD9/SAMD9-L. SUMMARY: Treatment of childhood MDS varies according to specific disease features; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using a Human Leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical donor, whenever available, represents the treatment of choice for most of these children. HSCT is indicated in MDS with excess of blasts, or in therapy-related MDS. For RCC patients, HSCT is recommended for RCC associated with monosomy 7, or complex karyotype and for patients showing severe neutropenia or transfusion dependence. Novel approaches of HSCT from an HLA-haploidentical relative after selective graft manipulation allow reducing transplant-related complications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of aggressive chemotherapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation has resulted in improved clinical outcomes in younger patients. However, the treatment results in unfit elderly AML population remain disappointing. New strategies should be introduced to improve the prognosis in this group of patients. Areas covered: This review presents and discusses the mechanism of action, safety and efficacy of sapacitabine in AML patients. Expert opinion: Sapacitabine, a novel nucleoside analog, seemed to be a promising new agent for AML treatment. Its oral bioavailability and tolerable toxicity profile allow the drug to be used in an outpatient setting, especially in elderly unfit patients. Sapacitabine is known to have antileukemic activity in randomized clinical trials. In AML patients, sapacitabine monotherapy offered no advantage over low-intensity cytarabine treatment, and the combination of sapacitabine with decitabine was not significantly more effective than decitabine alone. However, the oral administration of sapacitabine allows it to be used in AML maintenance therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['Sapacitabine', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'elderly']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Frontline treatments include cytotoxic chemotherapies, immunotherapies, and small molecule inhibitors. Clinical and molecular factors guide treatment initiation and selection. Over the last decade, refinement of CLL risk stratification tools and growth of the arsenal of effective therapeutics have profoundly improved outcomes. These advances have concurrently increased the complexity of managing the early phases of treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review describes the factors considered in the determination of first-line treatment of CLL. Areas of emphasis include assessment of patient fitness, disease classification and risk stratification, and the mechanisms, efficacy, and toxicities associated with available pharmacotherapeutics. EXPERT OPINION: Multiple different treatments may be appropriate for a specific clinical scenario, and selection among them requires discussion of relative risks and benefits. Advances in frontline CLL treatment will continue to shift the treatment paradigm toward prioritizing quality of life alongside survival, limiting treatment and toxicity, and the development of biologically rational synergistic drug combinations and sequences.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*frontline', '*treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 14.,"BACKGROUND: Recent evidence indicates that the PVT1, CCDC26, and CCAT1 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the leukemogenic process. This study quantified the expression levels of the PVT1, CCDC26, and CCAT1 lncRNAs in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and also correlated their expression levels with the clinicopathological features of the patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of the PVT1, CCDC26, and CCAT1 lncRNAs were analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of bone marrow specimens obtained from 86 AML patients, 48 AML-M3 patients, and 40 normal controls. RESULTS: No differences were found between the combined AML patient populations and the healthy controls with respect to the expression levels of PVT1, CCDC26, and CCAT1 (p = 0.35, p = 0.09, and p = 0.77, respectively). However, compared with the controls, the AML-M3 patients had higher PVT1 expression (p = 0.017). Furthermore, high-risk AML-M3 patients manifested higher expression levels of PVT1 than low- and intermediate-risk groups. In addition, distinctive CCDC26 and CCAT1 expression levels were observed among patients with different French-American-British subtypes (p = 0.001 for CCDC26 and p = 0.013 for CCAT1). Compared with the healthy controls, AML-M4 and M5 had higher CCAT1 expression (p = 0.04) and AML-M2 and AML-M4/M5 patients had higher CCDC26 expression (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02, respectively). In addition, different patterns of CCDC26 expression were found among the different cytogenetic risk subtypes (p = 0.005). Finally, patients with intermediate cytogenetic risk showed higher CCDC26 expression levels. CONCLUSION: The differential expression of the PVT1, CCDC26, and CCAT1 lncRNAs in different AML subtypes suggests that the deregulation of these transcripts may function in the multistep leukemogenic process and that they may serve as new therapeutic targets for this malignancy.",['NOTNLM'],"['CCAT1', 'CCDC26', 'PVT1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'long noncoding RNAs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mouse models, bone marrow transplantation has proven a valuable tool for understanding the hematopoietic system and the homing of hematopoietic cells to their target organs. Many techniques have been developed to create chimeric mice, animals with a hematopoietic system derived from a genetic background that differs from the rest of the body. Current genetic tools allow for virtually limitless possibilities in the choice of donor mice. This protocol describes methods of bone marrow transplantation in mouse models for studies of the brain under basal and pathological conditions. Specific points to be addressed include the preparation of recipient mice by irradiation or chemotherapy; the choice, isolation, and injection of donor cells; and analytical methods such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunostaining.

Materials and Methods Retrospectively, data from 507 consecutive adults (age >/= 15 years) with a diagnosis of ALL treated at our center were analyzed. Standard-risk (SR) patients were offered treatment with a modified German Multicenter ALL (GMALL) regimen, whereas high-risk (HR) patients were offered intensification of therapy with hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (HCVAD). Because of resource constraints, a proportion of HR patients opted to receive the same treatment regimen as used for SR patients. Results There were 344 SR patients (67.8%) and 163 HR patients (32.2%) at diagnosis. Among the HR patients, 53 (32.5%) opted to receive intensification with the HCVAD regimen. The SR cohort showed a superior 5-year event-free survival rate compared with the HR cohort (47.3% v 23.6%, respectively; P < .001). Within the HR subgroup, there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival or event-free survival between patients who received the modified GMALL regimen (n = 59) and patients who received HCVAD (n = 53). Conclusion Intensified therapy in the HR subset was associated with a significant increase in early treatment-related mortality and cost of treatment. A modified GMALL regimen was found to be cost-effective with clinical outcomes comparable to those achieved with more intensive regimens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 3.,"Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), despite its rarity, is an important mortality/morbidity event in transplant patients. The purpose of the present study was to retrospectively examine the clinical and pathologic characteristics, and outcomes of PTLD at the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto. A retrospective review of patient information was performed for patients that developed PTLD following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (aHSCT) and were diagnosed between 2005 and 2012. The present study included a total of 15 patients, 8 females (53.3%) and 7 males (46.7%), with different clinicopathological characteristics. The most frequent clinical condition inducing aHSCT was acute lymphocytic leukemia (40.0%). Conditioning regimens consisted primarily in busulfan and cyclophosphamide, with antithymocyte globulin, and myeloablation was the preferential treatment. EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) was present in all patients with a median time of diagnosis following transplant of 75 days (range, 25485 days) and a median viral load of 4.75 log10 copies/ml (range, 3.306.26 log10 copies/ml). PTLD diagnosis was mainly assessed by clinical findings, and histological confirmation was available for 5 patients: 3 monomorphic, 1 polymorphic and 1 with early lesions of PTLD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to describe PTLD cases in HSCT patients in Portugal. The data reinforces the importance of performing EBV monitoring in highrisk patients, particularly those receiving a transplant from mismatch/unrelated donors, and those with myeloablative conditioning regimen including antithymocyte globulin. The results also suggested that EBV viral load may be significant for the prediction of PTLD development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Nov 23.,"Background: Marker detection is an important task in complex disease studies. Here we provide an association rule mining (ARM) based approach for identifying integrated markers through mutual information (MI) based statistically significant feature extraction, and apply it to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and prostate carcinoma (PC) gene expression and methylation profiles. Methods: We first collect the genes having both expression and methylation values in AML as well as PC. Next, we run Jarque-Bera normality test on the expression/methylation data to divide the whole dataset into two parts: one that ollows normal distribution and the other that does not follow normal distribution. Thus, we have now four parts of the dataset: normally distributed expression data, normally distributed methylation data, non-normally distributed expression data, and non-normally distributed methylated data. A feature-extraction technique, ""mRMR"" is then utilized on each part. This results in a list of top-ranked genes. Next, we apply Welch t-test (parametric test) and Shrink t-test (non-parametric test) on the expression/methylation data for the top selected normally distributed genes and non-normally distributed genes, respectively. We then use a recent weighted ARM method, ""RANWAR"" to combine all/specific resultant genes to generate top oncogenic rules along with respective integrated markers. Finally, we perform literature search as well as KEGG pathway and Gene-Ontology (GO) analyses using Enrichr database for in silico validation of the prioritized oncogenes as the markers and labeling the markers as existing or novel. Results: The novel markers of AML are {ABCB11 upward arrow union or logical sumKRT17 downward arrow} (i.e., ABCB11 as up-regulated, & KRT17 as down-regulated), and {AP1S1- union or logical sumKRT17 downward arrow union or logical sumNEIL2- union or logical sumDYDC1 downward arrow}) (i.e., AP1S1 and NEIL2 both as hypo-methylated, & KRT17 and DYDC1 both as down-regulated). The novel marker of PC is {UBIAD1 paragraph sign union or logical sumAPBA2double dagger union or logical sumC4orf31double dagger} (i.e., UBIAD1 as up-regulated and hypo-methylated, & APBA2 and C4orf31 both as down-regulated and hyper-methylated). Conclusion: The identified novel markers might have critical roles in AML as well as PC. The approach can be applied to other complex disease.",['NOTNLM'],"['feature extraction', 'integrated markers', 'rule mining', 'statistical test']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We profile global posttranslational histone modification changes across a large panel of cancer cell lines with various sensitivities to EZH2i. We report here oncogenic transcriptional reprogramming mediated by MLL1's interaction with the p300/CBP complex, which directs H3K27me loss to reciprocal H3K27ac gain and restricts EZH2i response. Concurrent inhibition of H3K27me and H3K27ac results in transcriptional repression and MAPK pathway dependency in cancer subsets. In preclinical models encompassing a broad spectrum of EZH2-aberrant solid tumors, a combination of EZH2 and BRD4 inhibitors, or a triple-combination including MAPK inhibition display robust efficacy with very tolerable toxicity.

Pretransplant Twin A's bone marrow was negative for MRD by flow cytometry (<0.01%) unlike Twin B's bone marrow (0.07%). Twin A is alive in remission 3 years from transplant. Twin B developed primary graft failure, but subsequently rescued with a haploidentical stem cell transplant. However, she relapsed and died 13 months from diagnosis.

However, in 2017 alone, four new medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AML reached the market. Midostaurin, liposomal cytarabine and daunorubicin, enasidenib, and gemtuzumab ogozamicin all showed benefit in respective clinical trials to gain approval for the treatment of AML in various patient populations. Additionally, many phase II and III clinical trials are currently ongoing to assess the safety and efficacy of other potential therapies for the treatment of AML. In this review, we summarize the results of the landmark clinical trials associated with the newly approved agents as well as the current ongoing clinical trials for the treatment of AML.

The widely used ALDEFLUOR assay was initially designed to indicate the activity of ALDH1A1 in leukemia and has been demonstrated to detect the enzyme activity of several other ALDH isoforms in various cancer types in recent years. However, it is still elusive which isoforms, among the 19 ALDH isoforms in human genome, are the potential contributors in catalyzing ALDEFLUOR assay in different cancers. In the current study, we performed a screening via overexpressing each ALDH isoform to assess their ability of catalyzing ALDEFLUOR assay. Our results demonstrate that nine isoforms are active in ALDEFLUOR assay, whose overexpression significantly increases ALDH-positive (ALDH(+)) population. Further analysis of the expression of these active isoforms in various cancers reveals cancer-type specific expression patterns, suggesting that different cancer types may exhibit ALDEFLUOR activity through expression of specific active ALDH isoforms. This study strongly indicates that a detailed elucidation of the functions for each active ALDH isoform in CSCs is necessary and important for a profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ALDH-associated stemness.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ALDEFLUOR assay', '*Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)', '*BAAA', '*Cancer stem cell (CSC)', '*DEAB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Technical challenges, however, have long obscured the mechanics of these choices. Advances in flow-sorting have made possible the purification of HSC populations, but available HSC-enriched fractions still include substantial heterogeneity, and single HSCs have proven extremely difficult to track and observe. Advances in single-cell approaches, however, have led to the identification of a highly purified population of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that make a critical contribution to hematopoietic homeostasis through a preference for self-renewing division. Metabolic cues are key regulators of this cell fate choice, and the importance of controlling the population and quality of mitochondria has recently been highlighted to maintain the equilibrium of HSC populations. Leukemic cells also demand tightly regulated metabolism, and shifting the division balance of leukemic cells toward commitment has been considered as a promising therapeutic strategy. A deeper understanding of precisely how specific modes of metabolism control HSC fate is, therefore, of great biological interest, and more importantly will be critical to the development of new therapeutic strategies that target HSC division balance for the treatment of hematological disease.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cellular metabolism', 'Hematopoietic stem cell', 'Leukemia', 'Mitochondria', 'Stem cell fate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study deals with evaluating the anti-carcinogenic activity of the ether extracted metabolites derived from Streptomyces on nalm-6 and molt-4 ALL cell lines. MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity effect of Streptomyces sp on nalm-6 and molt-4 cell lines. Apoptosis and proliferation were evaluated by Flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot were performed to investigate the effect of these metabolites on the mRNA and protein expression levels of P53, Bax, and Bcl2. In both cell lines, extracted metabolites significantly inhibited cell growth and increased apoptosis. Although P53, Bax mRNA and protein expressions were increased, Bcl-2 expression decreased in treated cells compared with control. In addition, the G0/G1 arrest of Nalm-6 cells was induced.

Several previous studies have suggested such differences between Asian and European/USA countries. In this study, to elucidate potential differences in primary untreated MDS between Japanese (JPN) and Caucasians (CAUC), we analyzed the data from a large international database collected by the International Working Group for Prognosis of MDS (300 and 5838 patients, respectively). JPN MDS were significantly younger with more severe cytopenias, and cytogenetic differences: less del(5q) and more +1/+1q, -1/del(1p), der(1;7), -9/del(9q), del(16q), and del(20q). Although differences in time to acute myeloid leukemia transformation did not occur, a significantly better survival in JPN was demonstrated, even after the adjustment for age and FAB subtypes, especially in lower, but not in higher prognostic risk categories. Certain clinical factors (cytopenias, blast percentage, cytogenetic risk) had different impact on survival and time to transformation to leukemia between the two groups. Although possible confounding events (e.g., environment, diet, and access to care) could not be excluded, our results indicated the existence of clinically relevant ethnic differences regarding survival in MDS between JPN and CAUC patients.

Epub 2018 Sep 12.,"BACKGROUND: Previous efforts to report estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in India and its different parts include the National Cancer Registry Programme Reports, Sample Registration System cause of death findings, Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Series, and GLOBOCAN. We present a comprehensive picture of the patterns and time trends of the burden of total cancer and specific cancer types in each state of India estimated as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 because such a systematic compilation is not readily available. METHODS: We used all accessible data from multiple sources, including 42 population-based cancer registries and the nationwide Sample Registration System of India, to estimate the incidence of 28 types of cancer in every state of India from 1990 to 2016 and the deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by them, as part of GBD 2016. We present incidence, DALYs, and death rates for all cancers together, and the trends of all types of cancers, highlighting the heterogeneity in the burden of specific types of cancers across the states of India. We also present the contribution of major risk factors to cancer DALYs in India. FINDINGS: 8.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 7.9-8.6) of the total deaths and 5.0% (4.6-5.5) of the total DALYs in India in 2016 were due to cancer, which was double the contribution of cancer in 1990. However, the age-standardised incidence rate of cancer did not change substantially during this period. The age-standardised cancer DALY rate had a 2.6 times variation across the states of India in 2016. The ten cancers responsible for the highest proportion of cancer DALYs in India in 2016 were stomach (9.0% of the total cancer DALYs), breast (8.2%), lung (7.5%), lip and oral cavity (7.2%), pharynx other than nasopharynx (6.8%), colon and rectum (5.8%), leukaemia (5.2%), cervical (5.2%), oesophageal (4.3%), and brain and nervous system (3.5%) cancer. Among these cancers, the age-standardised incidence rate of breast cancer increased significantly by 40.7% (95% UI 7.0-85.6) from 1990 to 2016, whereas it decreased for stomach (39.7%; 34.3-44.0), lip and oral cavity (6.4%; 0.4-18.6), cervical (39.7%; 26.5-57.3), and oesophageal cancer (31.2%; 27.9-34.9), and leukaemia (16.1%; 4.3-24.2). We found substantial inter-state heterogeneity in the age-standardised incidence rate of the different types of cancers in 2016, with a 3.3 times to 11.6 times variation for the four most frequent cancers (lip and oral, breast, lung, and stomach). Tobacco use was the leading risk factor for cancers in India to which the highest proportion (10.9%) of cancer DALYs could be attributed in 2016. INTERPRETATION: The substantial heterogeneity in the state-level incidence rate and health loss trends of the different types of cancer in India over this 26-year period should be taken into account to strengthen infrastructure and human resources for cancer prevention and control at both the national and state levels. These efforts should focus on the ten cancers contributing the highest DALYs in India, including cancers of the stomach, lung, pharynx other than nasopharynx, colon and rectum, leukaemia, oesophageal, and brain and nervous system, in addition to breast, lip and oral cavity, and cervical cancer, which are currently the focus of screening and early detection programmes.

Epub 2018 Jan 11.,"BACKGROUND: Long-term survival of children with cancer has reached rates of up to 80%. Nevertheless, continued research devoted to further improvement of survival rates especially for patients with high-risk illnesses is necessary. Recent studies have shown direct positive effects on tumor reduction through Viscum album (mistletoe) extracts in adults, mainly as a result of higher dosage treatment and intravenous or intratumoral application. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A retrospective analysis of data was carried out of all oncological, pediatric patients treated with intravenous high-dose mistletoe therapy for a period of two years (11/2013-11/2015). RESULTS: A total of ten non-coherent cases were examined, all suffering from advanced and/or relapsed forms of cancer (leukemia, neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma, osteosarcoma, lymphoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor and soft tissue sarcoma). Patients were treated for an average period of 48days with a mean survival rate of 130days after beginning the mistletoe therapy. Partial remission was observed in four and a slowed disease progression was monitored in two patients. However, unrestricted progression of disease was documented in two other patients. Patients showed side effects including fever as well as fatigue and in some cases systemic inflammatory reactions with transient organ impairment occurred. CONCLUSION: Our study underpinned the safety and feasibility of high-dose mistletoe infusion in children with advanced stages of cancer and showed noteworthy antineoplastic effects, which should be verified in a prospective clinical phase II/III-study. Because of possible side effects, the treatment should be implemented only in an in-patient setting in experienced pediatric oncology centers.",['NOTNLM'],"['Child', 'Helleborus', 'Intravenous', 'Mistletoe', 'Taraxacum', 'Viscum album']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Sep 12.,"The V antigen (LcrV) of the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis is a potent protective protein that is considered as a vaccine component for humans. LcrV mediates the delivery of Yop toxins into host cells and upregulates TLR2-dependent IL-10 production. Although LcrV can interact with the receptor-bound human interferon-gamma (hIFN-gamma), the significance of these interactions in plague pathogenesis is not known. In this study, we determined the parameters of specific interactions of LcrV and LcrV68-326 with primary human thymocytes and Jurkat T-leukemia cells in the presence of receptor-bound hIFN-gamma. Although the C-terminal region of hIFN-gamma contains a GRRA138-141 site needed for high-affinity binding of LcrV and LcrV68-326, in the hIFN-gamma homodimer, these GRRA138-141 target sites becomes accessible for targeting by LcrV or LcrV68-326 only after immobilization of the hIFN-gamma homodimer on the hIFN-gamma receptors of thymocytes or Jurkat T-cells. The interaction of LcrV or LcrV68-326 with receptor-bound hIFN-gamma on the thymocytes or Jurkat T-cells caused apoptosis of both cell types, which can be completely blocked by the addition of monoclonal antibodies specific to the LEEL32-35 and DEEI203-206 sites of LcrV. The ability of LcrV to utilize hIFN-gamma is insidious and may account in part for the severe symptoms of plague in humans.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Interferon-gamma', 'LcrV protein', 'Plague', 'Yersinia']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2018 Nov 14.,"OBJECTIVE: We report cases of myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) with trisomy 8 associated with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (IADs). METHOD: Data for 21 patients with trisomy 8-MDS/MPN and IADs were analyzed and compared to 103 patients with trisomy 8-MDS/MPN without IADs. RESULTS: The median age of MDS/MPN patients with IADs was 67 [59-80]. The IADs were Behcet's-like disease in 11 (52%) patients, inflammatory arthritis in 4 (19%) and Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, aseptic abscess, periarteritis nodosa, Sweet's syndrome and unclassified vasculitis in one patient each. Overall, 17/21 (81%) patients with IADs received treatment (88% with steroids), with complete and partial response in 7/17 (35%) and 8/17 (47%), respectively. The effect of MDS treatment on IADs could be assessed in seven patients receiving azacytidine: five achieved remission and two partial response. As compared with the 103 trisomy 8-MDS/MPN cases without IADs, those with IADs were more often non-European (P = 0.005) and had poor karyotype (P < 0.001). We found no difference in overall survival or acute myeloid leukemia progression between trisomy 8-associated MDS/MPN with and without IADs. CONCLUSION: The spectrum of IADs associated with trisomy 8-positive MDS/MPN is dominated by Behcet's-like disease. Steroid therapy is effective, but mostly sparing therapies are necessary. Azacytidine could be an effective alternative.",['NOTNLM'],"['immunology and infectious diseases', 'myelodysplastic syndromes']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8131-9464'],,,,,"['GFM, MINHEMON (French Network of Dysimmune Disorders Associated to Hemopathies)']",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2018 Oct 26.,"Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can be rescued by allogeneic SCT. We identified 537 adult patients with AML allografted in second complete remission (CR2) or first relapse after ASCT in the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry. At 3 years post allograft, leukemia free survival (LFS) was 31.4% [95%CI 27.3-35.6], overall survival (OS) 39.5% [95%CI 35.1-43.9], relapse incidence (RI) 34.6% [95%CI 30.4-38.8], and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) 33.7% [95%CI 29.6-37.9]. RI was higher in patients transplanted in relapse in comparison to those transplanted in CR2 (HR 1.76, P = .004) and in patients who relapsed later after ASCT (HR 0.97 per month, P < 10(-3) ), both translating into better LFS/ OS. Relapse was also lower in patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) from an unrelated donor (UD) in comparison to those transplanted from a matched sibling donor (MSD) (HR 0.49, P < 10(-3) ). NRM was increased in patients who received total body irradiation (TBI) pre-ASCT (HR 2.43; P < 10-4), translating into worse LFS/OS. LFS/OS did not differ between patients allotransplanted with reduced intensity (RIC) or myeloablative (MAC) conditioning. In conclusion, one third of adult patients with AML relapsing post ASCT can be rescued with allo-HSCT, with better LFS/OS in patients who relapsed later post ASCT, those transplanted in CR2 and those who had not received TBI pre-ASCT.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4627-0412', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0108-5769', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6500-9514']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of pre-clinical CML and analysis the data relevant to disease progression to CML CP. METHOD: We performed a literature search on 16 July 2017 using EBSCOhost Research Databases interface and Western Pacific Region Index Medicus. Two authors selected the studies, extracted the data and evaluated the quality of studies using an 8-item tool, independently. The outcomes were percentage of Philadelphia chromosome in the number of metaphases examined (Ph%), correlation between Ph% and blood count and time progress to CML. RESULT: Our initial search returned 4770 studies. A total of 10 studies with a total 17 subjects were included. The lowest Ph%, which eventually progresses to CML, was 10%. Absolute basophil count seemed to correlate better with Ph% compared to total white cell and absolute eosinophil count. The time from the first documented pre-clinical CML to CML ranged from 12 to 48 months. The overall quality of the included studies was average. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review on pre-clinical CML.

Charts and autopsy reports of 107 patients (59 AML and 48 NHL) autopsied between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed. More than 50% of patients had missed major diagnoses found at autopsy with 95% of lungs displaying abnormal findings. Malignant infiltration in at least one organ was observed in about 70% of patients with either no complete remission or relapse at the time of death (n = 92) versus 20% in patients without signs of active malignancy (n = 15) (p = 0.001). In patients with ARF of unknown etiology (n = 59), the proportion of malignant lung infiltration was 27% and equilibrated with bacterial pneumonias (29%), fungal pneumonias represented 8%, and isolated alveolar damage or pulmonary edema were the only findings in 32% of patients. Overall, 85% of patients with ARF of unknown etiology had either relapsed or not achieved remission at time of death and 80% of patients with malignant lung infiltration had ARF of unknown etiology. Ninety percent of malignant infiltration and fungal infections were observed in patients with no complete remission or relapse. Autopsy remains valuable in AML and NHL patients; besides infections, malignant infiltration is a significant contributor to ARF of unknown etiology and is rarely diagnosed ante mortem.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Autopsy', 'Lung pathology', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2260-2005'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 14.,"T cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (T-NHLs) are aggressive malignancies which have a high risk of life-threatening complications. However, their prognosis in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting has not yet been assessed. We conducted a study including 87 ICU patients either with newly diagnosed T-NHLs or those undergoing first-line therapy admitted between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2014. The primary subtypes were peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) (n = 41, 47%), anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) (n = 13, 15%), and adult T-leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) (n = 11, 13%). Six in every ten patients had malignancy-related complications (haemophagocytic syndrome 37%, tumour lysis syndrome 18% and hypercalcaemia 9%), while infections accounted for one quarter of ICU admissions. Nine fungal infections were documented, including six invasive aspergillosis. Urgent chemotherapy was started in the ICU in 59% of the patients, and urgent surgery was required in 13%. ICU and day-90 mortality were 22% and 41%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that SOFA score at day 1, age, sepsis and haemophagocytic syndrome were independent predictors of day-90 mortality. Compared to 66 ICU-matched controls with non-Hodgkin B cell lymphomas, patients with T-NHLs had a similar ICU survival. Overall survival rates of patients with T cell NHLs and B cell NHLs were 20% and 46%, respectively (hazard ratio for death associated with T cell NHLs 2.00 [1.12-3.58]). Patients with T cell NHLs had a very poor long-term outcome. Although the high rate of short-term survival suggests that an ICU trial is a reasonable option for patients newly diagnosed for the malignancy, extended stay in the ICU or further readmission should be considered only for highly selected patients who respond to the haematological treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['Fungal infection', 'Haemophagocytic syndrome', 'Intensive care unit', 'T cell lymphoma', 'Tumour lysis syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that CD69 is in fact specifically required for the differentiation of mature NKT2 cells, which do not themselves express CD69. Mechanistically, CD69 expression is required on CD24(+) PLZF(hi) innate precursors for their retention in the thymus and completion of their differentiation into mature NKT2 cells. By contrast, CD69-deficient CD24(+) PLZF(hi) innate precursors express S1P1 and prematurely exit the thymus, while S1P1 inhibitor treatment of CD69-deficient mice retains CD24(+) PLZF(hi) innate precursors in the thymus and restores NKT2 cell differentiation. Thus, CD69 prevents S1P1 expression on CD24(+) PLZF(hi) innate precursor cells from aborting NKT2 differentiation in the thymus. This study reveals the importance of CD69 to prolong the thymic residency time of developing immature precursors for proper differentiation of a T cell subset.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5607-5066'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The solution NMR structure of the ZZ in complex with the H3 peptide reveals a unique binding mechanism involving caging of the N-terminal Alanine 1 of histone H3 in an acidic cavity of the ZZ domain, indicating a specific recognition of H3 versus other histones. Depletion of ZZZ3 or disruption of the ZZ-H3 interaction dampens ATAC-dependent promoter histone H3K9 acetylation and target gene expression.

Epub 2018 Sep 14.,"The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a classical iodide pump typically localized within the cell plasma membrane in thyroid cells, where NIS expression is believed to ensure success of mainstay radioiodide therapy in thyroid cancers. Although radioiodide uptake is generally reduced in thyroid cancer tissue, intracellular nonmembranous NIS has been reported to increase, suggesting that NIS serves a pump-independent function. Thyroid cancer is one of the major component cancers of Cowden syndrome, a subset of which is caused by germline mutations in PTEN In this study, we explored the noncanonical tumorigenic role of NIS in thyroid cancer cells in relation to PTEN signaling. PTEN knockdown in thyroid cancer cell lines stabilized intracellular NIS protein by promoting an interaction with NIS-LARG (leukemia-associated RhoA guanine exchange factor). Increased protein levels of cytoplasmic NIS enhanced RhoA activation and resulted in a promigration tumorigenic phenotype. Inhibition of NIS glycosylation through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway contributed to mislocalization of NIS in the cytoplasm, facilitating its nonpump tumorigenic function through an interaction with LARG, which predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. Moreover, PTEN or PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling could affect DPAGT1, a glycosylating enzyme involved in the initial step of N-linked glycosylation, to inhibit glycosylation of NIS. In summary, our results elucidate a pump-independent, protumorigenic role for NIS in thyroid cancer via its cross-talk with PTEN signaling.Significance: A novel pump-independent protumorigenic role of nonmembranous NIS challenges the presumption that radioiodine treatment of thyroid cancer is ineffective when transmembrane NIS is not expressed.

Despite its importance for the understanding of ALL etiology, this hypothesis has been inadequately explored. In a population-based case-control study, we measured the concentrations of 10 cytokines and other inflammatory markers on neonatal dried blood spots from 178 children who at ages 1 to 9 years were diagnosed with B-cell precursor ALL and 178 matched controls. Through linkage with Danish nationwide registers, we also assessed whether neonatal inflammatory markers were associated with previously demonstrated risk factors for childhood ALL. Children who developed B-cell precursor ALL had significantly lower neonatal concentrations of IL8, soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R) alpha, TGFbeta1, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and C-reactive protein (CRP) and higher concentrations of IL6, IL17, and IL18 compared with matched controls. Concentrations of IL10 were below the detection level for both patients and controls. Birth order (IL18 and CRP), gestational age (sIL6Ralpha, TGFbeta1, and CRP), and sex (sIL6Ralpha, IL8, and CRP), but not maternal age, infections during pregnancy, birth weight nor mode of delivery were significantly associated with the neonatal concentrations of inflammatory markers. Our findings support the hypothesis that children who later develop B-cell precursor ALL are born with a dysregulated immune function.Significance: Children who develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia are immunologically distinct at birth and could potentially react abnormally to infections in early childhood.

Epub 2018 Sep 14.,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the first retrovirus that has conclusively been shown to cause human diseases. In HIV-1, specific interactions between the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of the Gag protein and genomic RNA (gRNA) mediate gRNA dimerization and selective packaging; however, the mechanism for gRNA packaging in HTLV-1, a deltaretrovirus, is unclear. In other deltaretroviruses, the matrix (MA) and NC domains of Gag are both involved in gRNA packaging, but MA binds nucleic acids with higher affinity and has more robust chaperone activity, suggesting that this domain may play a primary role. Here, we show that the MA domain of HTLV-1, but not the NC domain, binds short hairpin RNAs derived from the putative gRNA packaging signal. RNA probing of the HTLV-1 5' leader and cross-linking studies revealed that the primer-binding site and a region within the putative packaging signal form stable hairpins that interact with MA. In addition to a previously identified palindromic dimerization initiation site (DIS), we identified a new DIS in HTLV-1 gRNA and found that both palindromic sequences bind specifically the NC domain. Surprisingly, a mutant partially defective in dimer formation in vitro exhibited a significant increase in RNA packaging into HTLV-1-like particles, suggesting that efficient RNA dimerization may not be strictly required for RNA packaging in HTLV-1. Moreover, the lifecycle of HTLV-1 and other deltaretroviruses may be characterized by NC and MA functions that are distinct from those of the corresponding HIV-1 proteins, but together provide the functions required for viral replication.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gag', '*HTLV-1', '*RNA binding protein', '*RNA dimerization', '*RNA folding', '*RNA structure', '*matrix domain', '*nucleocapsid', '*retrovirus', '*viral replication']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0354-4172'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 Wu et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an important curative therapy for patients with leukemia. However, relapse remains the leading cause of death after transplantation. In recent years, substantial progress has been made by Chinese physicians in the field of establishment of novel transplant modality, patient selection, minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, and immunological therapies, such as modified donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells, as well as MRD-directed intervention for relapse. Most of these unique systems are distinct from those in the Western world. In this consensus, we reviewed the efficacy of post-HSCT relapse management practice from available Chinese studies on behalf of the HSCT workgroup of the Chinese Society of Hematology, Chinese Medical Association, and compared these studies withthe consensus or guidelines outside China. We summarized the consensus on routine practices of post-HSCT relapse management in China and focused on the recommendations of MRD monitoring, risk stratification directed strategies, and modified DLI system. This consensus will likely contribute to the standardization of post-HSCT relapse management in China and become an inspiration for further international cooperation to refine global practices.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*Donor lymphocyte infusion', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*Targeted therapy']",,,['BMC Med. 2019 Feb 12;17(1):34.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cellular process that is characterized by activation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2alpha kinases and subsequent induction of activating transcription factor (ATF)4. The ISR plays an important role in protecting cells from tumor-related metabolic stresses, such as nutrient deprivation and perturbed proteostasis. Here, we showed that disruption of the ISR, together with increased cellular stress vulnerability, was produced by pharmacological inhibition of BCR-ABL, the oncogenic driver in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Treatment of CML-derived K562cells with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib, prevented activation of eIF2alpha kinases, protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and general control nonderepressible 2, and downstream ATF4 induction during metabolic stress. Prevention of ATF4 induction likely occurred as a result of the combinatorial suppression of the eIF2alpha kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways. In addition, we found that pharmacological inhibition of PERK mimicked BCR-ABL inhibition to enhance apoptosis induction under stress conditions. These findings indicate that the ISR is under the control of BCR-ABL and may foster adaptation to tumorigenic stresses in CML cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATF4', '*BCR-ABL', '*GCN2', '*Integrated stress response', '*PERK']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 Jun 21.,"BACKGROUND: Rhein (4, 5-dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-carboxylic acid), a natural anthraquinone derivative, is a traditional Chinese herb that has been used as a medication in many Asian countries. It has been used as a laxative and stomach drug for a long time in both China and Korea. It is well-known to have many pharmacological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant, anti-atherogenic, anti-angiogenic, anti-fibrosis, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and nephroprotective properties. However, little is known about how rhein may affect the differentiation activities in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. PURPOSE: The present study was designed to examine the anti-leukemic effects of rhein against APL cells and to explore the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Cell viability was investigated by MTS assay. To examine the differentiation activities in APL cells, the cell surface molecules (CD11b, CD14, CCR1 and CCR2), phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry. Also, induction of caspase-3 activity and reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry. RNA and protein expressions were determined by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: In this study we assessed the role of rhein in treating APL. Interestingly, rhein potentiated all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced macrophage differentiation in NB4 cells by inducing changes in morphology, expression of the differentiation markers CD11b and CD14, ROS production, phagocytic activity, and expression of CCR1 and CCR2. Signaling through CD11b was found to be dependent on ERK activation. Additionally, rhein induced APL cell death by activating apoptosis and suppressing the mTOR pathway. CONCLUSION: Therefore, we suggest that a combination of rhein and ATRA carries strong therapeutic potential through the beneficial differentiation of APL cells. Moreover, rhein causes cell death via the activation of apoptosis and suppression of survival signals in APL cells. In combination with the ability of rhein to promote functional macrophage differentiation in APL, these properties suggest that a combined treatment of rhein and ATRA has great potential as an anti-leukemic therapy for APL.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyeloid leukemia', 'All-trans retinoic acid', 'Anti-leukemic activity', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Differentiation', 'Rhein']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Attention has focused on mechanisms involving histone modifications, alternative pre-messenger RNA splicing, and cell-cycle progression. However, their intricate interrelations and joint contributions to ESC fate decision remain unclear. RESULTS: We analyze the transcriptomes and epigenomes of human ESC and five types of differentiated cells. We identify thousands of alternatively spliced exons and reveal their development and lineage-dependent characterizations. Several histone modifications show dynamic changes in alternatively spliced exons and three are strongly associated with 52.8% of alternative splicing events upon hESC differentiation. The histone modification-associated alternatively spliced genes predominantly function in G2/M phases and ATM/ATR-mediated DNA damage response pathway for cell differentiation, whereas other alternatively spliced genes are enriched in the G1 phase and pathways for self-renewal. These results imply a potential epigenetic mechanism by which some histone modifications contribute to ESC fate decision through the regulation of alternative splicing in specific pathways and cell-cycle genes. Supported by experimental validations and extended datasets from Roadmap/ENCODE projects, we exemplify this mechanism by a cell-cycle-related transcription factor, PBX1, which regulates the pluripotency regulatory network by binding to NANOG. We suggest that the isoform switch from PBX1a to PBX1b links H3K36me3 to hESC fate determination through the PSIP1/SRSF1 adaptor, which results in the exon skipping of PBX1. CONCLUSION: We reveal the mechanism by which alternative splicing links histone modifications to stem cell fate decision.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Alternative splicing', '*Cell cycle machinery', '*Cell fate decision', '*Embryonic stem cell', '*Histone modification']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9834-3006'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A lack of information received and understood about MDS may also arouse feelings of distress. Low health literacy (HL) might play a role particularly among older patients. Our aim was to assess MDS-related distress and to study the factors associated with it, including medical and non-medical factors such as HL. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all members of French and Australian patients' national MDS associations. Data of 280 patients were analysed. A majority of patient (59.5%) reported low functional HL and 50% reported regular difficulties in asking physicians questions. Distress was not modified by gender, awareness of increased risk of developing leukaemia or MDS characteristics. French patients had a higher mean IES score (adjusted beta = 5.9, p = 0.004) compared to Australian patients. Poor satisfaction with information provided about MDS, lower functional HL and difficulties in asking physician's questions were also independently associated with distress. MDS-related distress seems more related to HL and communication with physicians than to MDS characteristics. More efforts are needed to improve health literacy, tailor information for MDS patients and support them psychologically in order to improve their emotional well-being.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Avoidance', '*Doctor-patient communication', '*Health literacy', '*Intrusion', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*Psychological distress']",,,,,,,['Crown Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Sorcin (Soluble resistance related calcium binding protein) is a small soluble penta EF family (PEF) of calcium (Ca(2+)) binding protein (22,000 Da). It has been reported to play crucial roles in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, cancer development, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Overexpression of sorcin has been reported to be associated with different cancers such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, ovarian cancer, etc. Essentially, expression of sorcin has been found to be elevated in cancer cells as compared to normal cells, indicating that it has prominent role in cancer. Moreover, sorcin was found to be the regulator of various proteins that has an association with carcinogenesis including NF-kappaB, STAT3, Akt, ERK1/2, VEGF, MMPs, caspases, etc. Sorcin was also found to regulate apoptosis, as silencing of the same resulted in increased levels of proapoptotic genes and induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in cancer. Interestingly, mutations in the sorcin gene have been closely linked with poor overall survival in bladder cancer, brain lower-grade glioma, glioblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. Additionally, overexpression of sorcin was also found to induce MDR against different chemotherapeutic drugs. All these findings mark the importance of sorcin in cancer development and MDR. Therefore, there is urgent need to explore the functional mechanism of sorcin and to analyze whether silencing of sorcin would able to chemosensitize MDR cells. The current review summarizes the structure, expression, and functions of sorcin and its importance in the regulation of various malignancies and MDR.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Approximately one-third of individuals with pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) acquire heterozygous inactivating mutations of PAX5 in malignant cells, and heterozygous germline loss-of-function PAX5 mutations cause autosomal dominant predisposition to ALL. At least in mice, Pax5 is required for pre-B cell maturation, and leukemic remission occurs when Pax5 expression is restored in a Pax5-deficient mouse model of ALL. Together, these observations indicate that PAX5 deficiency reversibly drives leukemogenesis. PAX5 and its two most closely related paralogs, PAX2 and PAX8, which are not mutated in ALL, exhibit overlapping expression and function redundantly during embryonic development. However, PAX5 alone is expressed in lymphocytes, while PAX2 and PAX8 are predominantly specific to kidney and thyroid, respectively. We show that forced expression of PAX2 or PAX8 complements PAX5 loss-of-function mutation in ALL cells as determined by modulation of PAX5 target genes, restoration of immunophenotypic and morphological differentiation, and, ultimately, reduction of replicative potential. Activation of PAX5 paralogs, PAX2 or PAX8, ordinarily silenced in lymphocytes, may therefore represent a novel approach for treating PAX5-deficient ALL. In pursuit of this strategy, we took advantage of the fact that, in kidney, PAX2 is upregulated by extracellular hyperosmolarity. We found that hyperosmolarity, at potentially clinically achievable levels, transcriptionally activates endogenous PAX2 in ALL cells via a mechanism dependent on NFAT5, a transcription factor coordinating response to hyperosmolarity. We also found that hyperosmolarity upregulates residual wild type PAX5 expression in ALL cells and modulates gene expression, including in PAX5-mutant primary ALL cells. These findings specifically demonstrate that osmosensing pathways may represent a new therapeutic target for ALL and more broadly point toward the possibility of using gene paralogs to rescue mutations driving cancer and other diseases.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3260-5886', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9387-8431', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8774-0180', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7292-8084', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1683-1680']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two isoforms of the HBZ protein are synthesized from antisense messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are either spliced (sHBZ) or unspliced (usHBZ) versions of the HBZ transcript. The sHBZ and usHBZ mRNAs have entirely different 5'untranslated regions (5'UTR) and are differentially expressed in cells, with the sHBZ protein being more abundant. Here, we show that differential expression of the HBZ isoforms is regulated at the translational level. Translation initiation of the usHBZ mRNA relies on a cap-dependent mechanism, while the sHBZ mRNA uses internal initiation. Based on the structural data for the sHBZ 5'UTR generated by SHAPE in combination with 5' and 3' deletion mutants, the minimal region harboring IRES activity was mapped to the 5'end of the sHBZ mRNA. In addition, the sHBZ IRES recruited the 40S ribosomal subunit upstream of the initiation codon, and IRES activity was found to be dependent on the ribosomal protein eS25 and eIF5A.",,,,,,['Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Dec 19;:.

Guided by our experiments on the motion of two-dimensional clusters in vitro, we developed an agent-based model in which the cells form a cohesive cluster due to attractive and alignment interactions. We find that when cells at the cluster rim are more motile, all three phases of motion coexist, in agreement with our observations. Using the model, we show that the transitions between different phases are driven by competition between an ordered rim and a disordered core accompanied by the creation and annihilation of topological defects in the velocity field. The model makes specific predictions, which we verify with our experimental data.

We examined adherence to medication and other challenges to care in our patients on treatment of CML. This qualitative study involved in-depth interviews of 20 patients with CML receiving free imatinib (Glivec) from the Glivec International Patients' Assistance Program. Data collected were thematically analyzed. Findings revealed that despite free drug assistance, there was relative lack of awareness resulting in inappropriate health-seeking behavior. The challenges cut across situations such as poverty, fear of the sustenance of the compassionate drug program, and living far away from the clinic. Forgetfulness was reported as the cause of poor adherence in this study. Suggested solutions include increasing community awareness, ensuring sustainability of the program and establishing more treatment centers nationwide.

The tight regulation of Pax5 is therefore required for an efficient B cell differentiation. A defect in its dosage can translate into immunodeficiency or malignant disorders such as leukemia or lymphoma. Pax5 is expressed from two different promoters encoding two isoforms that only differ in the sequence of their first alternative exon. Very little is known regarding the role of the two isoforms during B cell differentiation and the regulation of their expression. Our work aims to characterize the mechanisms of regulation of the expression balance of these two isoforms and their implication in the B cell differentiation process using murine ex vivo analyses.

However, it is unclear if the aberrant expression of PBX3 and HOXA is essential for the survival of NPM1-mutated leukemic cells. Methods: Using the gene expression profiling of TCGA and E-MTAB-3444 datasets, we screened for high co-expression of PBX3 and HOXA9 in NPMc+ leukemia patients. We performed NPMc+ depletion and overexpression experiments to examine aberrant H3K79 methylation through epigenetic regulation. Through RNA interference technology and small-molecule inhibitor treatment, we evaluated the effect of methyl-modified H3K79 on cell survival and explored the possible underlying mechanism. Results: We showed that NPMc+ increased the expression of PBX3 and HOXA9, which are both poor prognosis indicators in AML. High PBX3 and HOXA9 expression was accompanied by increased dimethylated and trimethylated H3K79 in transgenic murine Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) cells and human NPMc+ leukemia cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) assays of NPMc+ cells, we determined that hypermethylated H3K79 was present at the expressed HOXA9 gene but not the PBX3 gene. PBX3 expression was positively regulated by HOXA9, and a reduction in either PBX3 or HOXA9 resulted in NPMc+ cell apoptosis. Importantly, an inhibitor of DOT1L, EPZ5676, effectively and selectively promoted NPMc+ human leukemic cell apoptosis by reducing HOXA9 and PBX3 expression. Conclusion: Our data indicate that NPMc+ leukemic cell survival requires upregulation of PBX3 and HOXA9, and this action can be largely attenuated by a DOT1L inhibitor.",['NOTNLM'],"['*DOT1L inhibitor', '*H3K79 hypermethylation', '*HOXA9', '*NPM1 mutation', '*PBX3']",,,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite numerous attempts, the common molecular events underlying the development of MDS and AML remain to be established. In the present study, 18 microarray datasets were selected, and a meta-analysis was conducted to identify shared gene signatures and biological processes between MDS and AML. Using NetworkAnalyst, 191 upregulated and 139 downregulated genes were identified in MDS and AML, among which, PTH2R, TEC, and GPX1 were the most upregulated genes, while MME, RAG1, and CD79B were mostly downregulated. Comprehensive functional enrichment analyses revealed oncogenic signaling related pathway, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) and immune response related events, 'interleukine-6/interferon signaling pathway, and B cell receptor signaling pathway', were the most upregulated and downregulated biological processes, respectively. Network based meta-analysis ascertained that HSP90AA1 and CUL1 were the most important hub genes.

Epub 2018 Jul 23.,"Activity of the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) determines the anti-leukemic effect of thiopurines used in the chemotherapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). TPMT status and its effects on treatment outcome have been studied extensively in ALL and autoimmune disorders, but few data is available on TPMT in AML. The present study assessed the genetic polymorphisms and activity of TPMT in children with AML at different treatment stages, and compared the results with those obtained for children with ALL. The study included 33 children with AML (0.7-19.7 years) treated with 6-thioguanine (6-TG) according to the AML-BFM 2004 Protocol. Blood samples were collected at diagnosis, during and following maintenance chemotherapy from 8, 10 and 17 patients with AML (the assay was performed at two time points in 2 patients), respectively. Blood samples from 105 children with ALL were obtained at diagnosis, during the maintenance chemotherapy and following the cessation of the chemotherapy from 16, 55 and 34 children, respectively. The activity of TPMT in red blood cells lysates was measured using an enzymatic reaction based on the conversion of 6-mercaptopurine into 6-methylmercaptopurine, involving S-adenozyl-L-methionine as the methyl group donor. TPMT mutations were determined using a polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Median TPMT activity at diagnosis, during maintenance chemotherapy and following chemotherapy was 43.1, 47,3 and 41.7 nmol 6-mMP g(-1) Hb h(-1), respectively. All patients with AML exhibited the homozygous TPMT*1/*1 genotype, with the exception of 1, who was a heterozygote with the TPMT*1/*3C genotype and demonstrated a TPMT activity level at diagnosis of 42.5 nmol 6-mMP g(-1) Hb h(-1). At each chemotherapy stage, the median TPMT activities in children with AML were significantly increased compared with the median TPMT activities in children with ALL. The preliminary results suggest that the TPMT activity in AML may be increased compared with that in ALL. Comprehensive studies on the association between thiopurine metabolism and treatment outcome in AML are required, with regard to the cytogenetic and molecular factors currently used for AML risk stratification.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'children', 'thiopurine methyltransferase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Jul 17.,"Chaetominine is a cytotoxic alkaloid that has been demonstrated to promote apoptotic cell death in human leukemia K562 cells. In the present study, chaetominine inhibited K562 (IC50 34 nM) and SW1116 (IC50 46 nM) cell growth. However, it remains unclear whether the inhibition of cell growth is associated with the cell cycle. To assess this potential relationship, the effect of chaetominine on the cell cycle of K562 and SW1116 cells was examined. Chaetominine treatment caused cell apoptosis and G1-phase arrest in SW1116 cells. Conversely, K562 cells underwent S-phase arrest according to flow cytometric analysis. The present study also aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning cell cycle regulation following the incubation of the associated cells with chaetominine. Western blot and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses suggested that chaetominine treatment facilitated the expression of p53, p21, checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) and phosphorylated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (p-ATM) and caused a reduction in the mRNA levels of cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 2 and 4. These results suggest that chaetominine may be involved in the regulation of p53/p21 and ATM and Rad3-related (ATM)/Chk2 signaling in SW1116 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that these signaling pathways are responsible for G1-phase arrest. Results of the present study demonstrated that the expression of p-ATR and Chk1 were increased in K562 cells. Additionally, cdc25A levels were decreased, while protein and gene expression levels of cyclin A and CDK2 were repressed. These results elucidated the role of chaetominine in in the regulation of ATR/cdc25A/Chk1 expression in K562 cells. These proteins are thus important determinants in the initiation of S-phase arrest. These data support the hypothesis that chaetominine is a potential anti-cancer therapeutic agent that targets the cell cycle.",['NOTNLM'],"['K562 cells', 'SW1116 cells', 'cell cycle arrest', 'chaetominine', 'cyclin', 'cyclin-dependent kinase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has previously been demonstrated that PLZF expression levels become diminished during the oncogenic transformation of certain tissue types and thus, may serve as a hallmark for tumor aggressiveness. To examine this in breast cancer, survival curves from available oncology databases were analyzed and demonstrated that PLZF expression was positively associated with increased survival in patients with breast cancer. The mRNA and protein levels of PLZF were also revealed to be associated with the tumorigenicity of four breast cancer cell lines. Since ATP-binding cassette subfamily E member 1 (ABCE1), also known as RNase L inhibitor, has been determined to be a target gene of PLZF, the present study also investigated whether the tumor suppressive effect of PLZF was associated with ABCE1 expression. PLZF was revealed to downregulate the expression of ABCE1 in vitro, which relieved the inhibitory effect of ABCE1 on the ribonuclease L enzyme. Finally, it was concluded that PLZF expression caused an ABCE1-mediated increase in cellular cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by a reduction in the proliferation rate of breast cancer cell lines.

Epub 2018 Jul 30.,"Previous studies have suggested that microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is highly expressed and closely associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in various types of malignant cells. However, their expression patterns and function with respect to T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remain largely unknown. The present study investigated whether mPGES-1 served a crucial role in T-ALL and aimed to identify interactions between mPGES-1 and the MAPK signaling pathway in T-ALL. The results indicated that mPGES-1 overexpression in T-ALL jurkat cells was significantly decreased by RNA silencing. Decreasing mPGES-1 on a consistent basis may inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle in T-ALL jurkat cells. Microarray and western blot analyses revealed that c-Jun N-terminal kinase served a role in the mPGES-1/prostaglandin E2/EP4/MAPK positive feedback loops. In addition, P38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 exhibited negative feedback effects on mPGES-1. In conclusion, the results suggested that cross-talk between mPGES-1 and the MAPK signaling pathway was very complex. Therefore, the combined regulation of mPGES-1 and the MAPK signaling pathway may be developed into a new candidate therapy for T-ALL in the future.",['NOTNLM'],"['T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'feedback', 'jurkat cell', 'microsomal prostaglandin-E synthase', 'mitogen activated protein Kinase Signaling System']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to describe this pathogenesis in NOD/LtSz-Prkdc(scid)IL2rgamma(tm1Wjl) (NSG) mice infused with human PBMCs and to assess the impact of the expression of HLA-A0201 by NSG mice cells (NSG-HLA-A2/HHD mice) on xGVHD and graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effects, by taking advantage of next-generation technologies. We found that T cells recovered from NSG mice after transplantation had upregulated expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, as well as in TCR, co-stimulatory, IL-2/STAT5, mTOR and Aurora kinase A pathways. T cells had mainly an effector memory or an effector phenotype and exhibited a Th1/Tc1-skewed differentiation. TCRbeta repertoire diversity was markedly lower both in the spleen and lungs (a xGVHD target organ) than at infusion. There was no correlation between the frequencies of specific clonotypes at baseline and in transplanted mice. Finally, expression of HLA-A0201 by NSG mice led to more severe xGVHD and enhanced GvL effects toward HLA-A2(+) leukemic cells. Altogether our data demonstrate that the pathogenesis of xGVHD shares important features with human GVHD and that NSG-HLA-A2/HHD mice could serve as better model to study GVHD and GvL effects.",['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*NSG', '*NSG-HLA-A2/HHD', '*RNA sequencing', '*TCR receptor', '*TCRbeta repertoire', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*xenogeneic']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because GPR56 is a transcriptional target of EVI1 and silencing of GPR56 expression induces apoptosis, we developed a novel drug to suppress GPR56 expression in EVI1(high) AML cells. For this purpose, we generated pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamides specific to GPR56 (PIP/56-1 or PIP/56-2) as nuclease-resistant novel compounds that interfere with the binding of EVI1 to the GPR56 promoter in a sequence-specific manner. Treatment of EVI1(high) AML cell lines (UCSD/AML1 and Kasumi-3) with PIP/56-1 or PIP/56-2 effectively suppressed GPR56 expression by inhibiting binding of EVI1 to its promoter, leading to suppression of cell growth with increased rates of apoptosis. Moreover, intravenous administration of PIP/56-1 into immunodeficient Balb/c-RJ mice subcutaneously transplanted with UCSD/AML1 cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and extended survival. Furthermore, organ infiltration by leukemia cells in immunodeficient Balb/c-RJ mice, which were intravenously transplanted using UCSD/AML1 cells, was successfully inhibited by PIP/56-1 treatment with no apparent effects on murine hematopoietic cells. In addition, PIP treatment did not inhibit colony formation of human CD34(+) progenitor cells. Thus, PI polyamide targeting of GPR56 using our compound is promising, useful, and safe for the treatment of EVI1(high) AML.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3992-5399'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of pro-survival BCL-2 family members rendering transformed cells resistant to cytotoxic drugs is a common theme in cancer. Targeting BCL-2 with the BH3-mimetic venetoclax is active in AML when combined with low-dose chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents. We now report the pre-clinical anti-leukemic efficacy of a novel BCL-2 inhibitor S55746, which demonstrates synergistic pro-apoptotic activity in combination with the MCL1 inhibitor S63845. Activity of the combination was caspase and BAX/BAK dependent, superior to combination with standard cytotoxic AML drugs and active against a broad spectrum of poor risk genotypes, including primary samples from patients with chemoresistant AML. Co-targeting BCL-2 and MCL1 was more effective against leukemic, compared to normal hematopoietic progenitors, suggesting a therapeutic window of activity. Finally, S55746 combined with S63845 prolonged survival in xenograft models of AML and suppressed patient-derived leukemia but not normal hematopoietic cells in bone marrow of engrafted mice. In conclusion, a dual BH3-mimetic approach is feasible, highly synergistic, and active in diverse models of human AML. This approach has strong clinical potential to rapidly suppress leukemia, with reduced toxicity to normal hematopoietic precursors compared to chemotherapy.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7341-5720'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies focus on identifying somatic mutations in the protein coding portion of the genome using whole exome sequencing (WES). Every human genome has around 4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A sizeable fraction of these germline SNPs is very rare and will not be found in the databases. Thus, in order to unambiguously identify somatic mutation, it is absolutely necessary to know the germline SNPs of the patient. While a blood sample can serve as source of germline DNA from patients with solid tumours, obtaining germline DNA from patients with haematological malignancies is very difficult. Tumor cells often infiltrate the skin, and their DNA can be found in saliva and buccal swab samples. The DNA in the tips of nails stems from keratinocytes that have undergone keratinization several months ago. DNA was successfully extracted from nail clippings of 5 probands for WES. We were able to identify somatic mutations in one tumor exome by using the nail exome as germline reference. Our results demonstrate that nail DNA is a reliable source of germline DNA in the setting of hematological malignancies.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-2202-9088'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 13.,"The ephrin transmembrane receptor family of tyrosine kinases is involved in platelet function. We report the first EPHB2 variant affecting platelets in 2 siblings (P1 and P2) from a consanguineous family with recurrent bleeding and normal platelet counts. Whole-exome sequencing identified a c.2233C>T variant (missense p.R745C) of the EPHB2 gene. P1 and P2 were homozygous for this variant, while their asymptomatic parents were heterozygous. The p.R745C variant within the tyrosine kinase domain was associated with defects in platelet aggregation, alphaIIbbeta3 activation, and granule secretion induced by G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and convulxin, as well as in thrombus formation on collagen under flow. In contrast, clot retraction, flow-dependent platelet adhesion, and spreading on fibrinogen were only mildly affected, indicating limited effects on alphaIIbbeta3 outside-in signaling. Most importantly, Lyn, Syk, and FcRgamma phosphorylation, the initial steps in glycoprotein VI (GPVI) platelet signaling were drastically impaired in the absence of platelet-platelet contact, indicating a positive role for EPHB2 in GPVI activation. Likewise platelet activation by PAR4-AP showed defective Src activation, as opposed to normal protein kinase C activity and Ca(2+) mobilization. Overexpression of wild-type and R745C EPHB2 variant in RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia) cells stably expressing human GPVI confirmed that EPHB2 R745C mutation impaired EPHB2 autophosphorylation but had no effect on ephrin ligand-induced EPHB2 clustering, suggesting it did not interfere with EPHB2-ephrin-mediated cell-to-cell contact. In conclusion, this novel inherited platelet disorder affecting EPHB2 demonstrates this tyrosine kinase receptor plays an important role in platelet function through crosstalk with GPVI and GPCR signaling.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-4064-8114', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7342-0389', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3398-0976']",,['Blood. 2018 Nov 8;132(19):2002-2004.

Epub 2018 Sep 13.,"The efficacy of autologous (alphabeta) T-cell-based treatment strategies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been modest. The Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cell subset consists of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with potent antilymphoma activity via a major histocompatibility complex-independent mechanism. We studied whether Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells can be exploited as autologous effector lymphocytes in CLL. Healthy control Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells were activated by and had potent cytolytic activity against CLL cells. However, CLL-derived Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells proved dysfunctional with respect to effector cytokine production and degranulation, despite an increased frequency of the effector-type subset. Consequently, cytotoxicity against malignant B cells was hampered. A comparable dysfunctional phenotype was observed in healthy Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells after coculture with CLL cells, indicating a leukemia-induced mechanism. Gene-expression profiling implicated alterations in synapse formation as a conceivable contributor to compromised Vgamma9Vdelta2-T-cell function in CLL patients. Dysfunction of Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells was fully reversible upon activation with autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). moDC activation resulted in efficient expansion and predominantly yielded Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells with a memory phenotype. Furthermore, ibrutinib treatment promoted an antitumor T helper 1 (TH1) phenotype in Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells, and we demonstrated binding of ibrutinib to IL-2-inducible kinase (ITK) in Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells. Taken together, CLL-mediated dysfunction of autologous Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells is fully reversible, resulting in potent cytotoxicity toward CLL cells. Our data support the potential use of Vgamma9Vdelta2-T cells as effector T cells in CLL immunotherapy and favor further exploration of combining Vgamma9Vdelta2-T-cell-based therapy with ibrutinib.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4694-6048', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3190-1891']",,['Blood. 2018 Nov 22;132(21):2212-2213.

Epub 2018 Sep 13.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia are at risk for neurocognitive deficits and leukoencephalopathy. We performed a longitudinal assessment of leukoencephalopathy and its associations with long-term brain microstructural white matter integrity and neurocognitive outcomes in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated on a modern chemotherapy-only protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-three survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (49% female), treated on a chemotherapy-only protocol, underwent brain MR imaging during active therapy and repeat imaging and neurocognitive testing at follow-up (median, 13.5 years of age; interquartile range, 10.7-17.6 years; median time since diagnosis, 7.5 years; interquartile range, 6.3-9.1 years). Persistence of leukoencephalopathy was examined in relation to demographic and treatment data and to brain DTI in major fiber tracts and neurocognitive testing at follow-up. RESULTS: Leukoencephalopathy was found in 52 of 173 long-term survivors (30.0%) and persisted in 41 of 52 (78.8%) who developed it during therapy. DTI parameters were associated with leukoencephalopathy in multiple brain regions, including the corona radiata (fractional anisotropy, P = .001; mean diffusivity, P < .001), superior longitudinal fasciculi (fractional anisotropy, P = .02; mean diffusivity, P < .001), and superior fronto-occipital fasciculi (fractional anisotropy, P = .006; mean diffusivity, P < .001). Mean diffusivity was associated with neurocognitive impairment including in the genu of the corpus callosum (P = .04), corona radiata (P = .02), and superior fronto-occipital fasciculi (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Leukoencephalopathy during active therapy and neurocognitive impairment at long-term follow-up are associated with microstructural white matter integrity. DTI may be more sensitive than standard MR imaging for detection of clinically consequential white matter abnormalities in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors treated with chemotherapy and in children undergoing treatment.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7584-2574', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9874-8938', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1054-1201', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7559-7927', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6319-3052', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9679-2054', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4250-6160', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6496-2087', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6693-8120', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0303-5658', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7460-8578', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6984-2407', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0476-7001']",,,,,,['(c) 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 10.,"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been reported to inhibit the activity of Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET). TET modulates FOXP3 expression, while dysregulation of FOXP3 expression promotes the malignant progression of leukemia cells. We examined the role of TET-FOXP3 axis in the cytotoxic effects of ATO on the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line, U937. ATO-induced apoptosis in U937 cells was characterized by activation of caspase-3/-9, mitochondrial depolarization, and MCL1 downregulation. In addition, ATO-treated U937 cells showed ROS-mediated inhibition of TET2 transcription, leading to downregulation of FOXP3 expression and in turn, suppression of FOXP3-mediated activation of Lyn and Akt. Overexpression of FOXP3 or Lyn minimized the suppressive effect of ATO on Akt activation and MCL1 expression. Promoter luciferase activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the crucial role of Akt-mediated CREB phosphorylation in MCL1 transcription. Further, ATO-induced Akt inactivation promoted GSK3beta-mediated degradation of MCL1. Transfection of constitutively active Akt expression abrogated ATO-induced MCL1 downregulation. MCL1 overexpression lessened the ATO-induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and increased the viability of ATO-treated cells. Thus, our data suggest that ATO induces mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells through its suppressive effect on TET2-FOXP3-Lyn-Akt axis-modulated MCL1 transcription and protein stabilization. Our findings also indicate that the same pathway underlies ATO-induced death in human leukemia HL-60 cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Arsenic trioxide', '*Leukemia cells', '*MCL1 Stability', '*MCL1 Transcription', '*TET2-FOXP3-Lyn-Akt Axis']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study investigated the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of elderly Thai patients with AML. This 3-year, prospective, multicenter study was focused on Thai patients with AML aged over 60 years who were diagnosed between 2014 and 2016. RESULTS: Of 680 patients with AML, 235 elderly patients with AML (34.6%) were identified, with a mean age of 70 +/- 8 years. Using a 3-group cytogenetic risk classification (favorable, intermediate, and adverse risk), the proportions of patients in each category were 3.6%, 73.8%, and 22.6%, respectively. The median follow-up time for surviving patients was 846 days. The median overall survival (OS) of the patients was 128.2 days (range, 0-1205 days), with a 1-year OS of 13%. From a multivariate analysis, the significant factors associated with an improved long-term OS were patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2 and those receiving intensive therapy. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms the high prevalence of AML in elderly patients with generally poor outcomes.

Epub 2018 Jul 6.,"INTRODUCTION: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are two of the most important growth factors mediating trophoblast actions. We hypothesized that the localization and expression patterns of LIF and IGF-1 in partial and complete hydatidiform moles (HM) compared with normal first trimester placentas may provide an understanding of the proliferative processes in HMs. METHODS: The study population included curettage material of women diagnosed as complete or partial HM as a result of histopathological and immunohistochemical examination (complete HM group, n=8; partial HM group, n=8) and women undergoing dilatation&curettage for unwanted pregnancies (control group, n=8). Expression of LIF and IGF-1 among placental cell groups was evaluated immunohistochemically and given a score depending on immunostaining intensity. RESULTS: In normal chorionic villi strong expression of LIF and IGF-1 was present. Both LIF and IGF-1 expressions were weaker in the chorionic villi of complete HMs. In complete mole decidua there was a significant decrease in glandular and endothelial IGF-1 expression along with a decrease in decidual cell LIF expression compared to normal first trimester decidua. LIF expression in extravillous trophoblasts was stronger in complete molar placentas compared to normal placentas. DISCUSSION: LIF and IGF-1 are important regulators of trophoblast proliferation and invasion. Differential expression of LIF and IGF-1 in molar trophoblasts and chorionic villi might have a role in regulation of trophoblasts in complete moles. Decreased expression of glandular IGF-1 and decidual LIF might be related to the decidual changes during trophoblastic proliferation and invasion of decidua in complete HMs.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Decidua', '*Hydatidiform mole', '*Immunohistochemistry', '*Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)', '*Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)', '*Trophoblast']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Jul 25.,"Indolent lymphomas typically have a prolonged course and favorable prognosis. Recent data support survival times that can reach several decades, even if periodic treatment is needed to manage symptoms or stabilize disease. However, all indolent lymphomas have the potential to undergo transformation to an aggressive phenotype, clinically characterized by a rapid progression of adenopathy, new-onset constitutional symptoms, or laboratory abnormalities, and the immediate need for therapeutic intervention. The most common scenario is transformation of follicular lymphoma to either diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocations; however, other indolent subtypes such as marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or even nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, can undergo similar histologic transformation. The prognosis of transformed lymphomas has historically been quite poor, but there is ample evidence this is changing in the rituximab era. This article will provide a review of transformed lymphomas with an emphasis on treatment and the nuances of diagnosis and clinical management. Unless otherwise specified, all discussion in this review pertains to transformed follicular lymphoma which is the more common scenario and the subtype with the most robust data. In many cases, this information can be extrapolated and applied to other indolent histologies (i.e. transformed marginal zone lymphoma); however, several other clinical scenarios, such as Richter's transformation and ""double hit"" transformations, warrant a distinct discussion and will be reviewed separately.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Autologous transplant', '*Follicular lymphoma', ""*Richter's syndrome"", '*Transformation']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Jul 18.,"Feline injection site sarcomas (FISS) were first described in the early 1990s. Despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of these tumours has not been elucidated conclusively. Their appearance and the marked increase in their incidence has been mainly connected to the injection of vaccines, and it is assumed that a chronic inflammatory reaction at the injection site triggers subsequent malignant transformation. The role of alum-based adjuvants has been discussed, but is controversial. The present study of the Swiss Feline Cancer Registry (SFCR) with data from 2009 to 2014 revealed a marked decrease of the incidence of fibrosarcomas compared with the previous observation period. Notably, this drop occurred after a non-adjuvanted feline leukaemia virus vaccine was introduced in Switzerland in 2007. This observation, together with the previous findings of the SFCR, further supports the notion that alum-adjuvanted vaccines are involved in the genesis of FISS and that non-adjuvanted vaccines might be safer for cats.",['NOTNLM'],"['cat', 'feline leukaemia virus', 'fibrosarcoma', 'vaccine']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

As ALL progresses, leukemic cells cross the endothelial barrier and infiltrate other tissues. Epigenetic enzymes represent novel therapeutic targets in hematological malignancies, and might contribute to cells' capacity to migrate across physical barriers. Although many molecules drive this process, the role of the nucleus and its components remain unclear. We report here, for the first time, that the expression of G9a (a histone methyltransferase related with gene silencing) correlates with the expression of the integrin subunit alpha4 in children with ALL. We have demonstrated that G9a depletion or its inhibition with BIX01294 abrogated the ability of ALL cells to migrate through an endothelial monolayer. Moreover, G9a-depleted and BIX01294-treated cells presented bigger nuclei and more adherent phenotype than control cells on endothelial monolayers. Blocking G9a did not affect the cell cytoskeleton or integrin expression of ALL cell lines, and only its depletion reduced slightly F-actin polymerization. Similarly to the transendothelial migration, G9a inhibition impaired the cell migration induced by the integrin VLA-4 (alpha4beta1) of primary cells and ALL cell lines through narrow spaces in vitro. Our results suggest a cellular connection between G9a and VLA-4, which underlies novel functions of G9a during ALL cell migration.",['NOTNLM'],"['G9a', 'VLA-4', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'epigenetics', 'migration']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0404-572X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5261-8270', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0332-6973', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0607-2171']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry ""fingerprinting"" is useful for characterizing biological materials. We demonstrate the utility of direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry for metabolic profiling using 100 different extracts of leaves from 20 blueberry cultivars collected at 5 time points from April to December 2008. A qualitative direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry method was used to profile the major and/or minor constituents in the blueberry leaf extracts. Blueberry leaf extracts could be distinguished by principal component analysis based on the absolute intensity of characteristic fragment ions. Twenty cultivars were categorized into four species, and the most appropriate discriminative marker m/z value for identifying each cultivar was selected statistically. Correlated m/z values indicating the collection month were determined in the same analysis, and air temperature variance factors were extracted from score plots by principal component analysis. We previously reported that blueberry extracts inhibit the proliferation of adult T-cell leukemia cells. Leaves of Vaccinium virgatum collected in December of 2008 exhibited significantly greater inhibition of adult T-cell leukemia cell proliferation than other species. Highly bioactive cultivars or species were identified by direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis of blueberry leaf extracts. The components extracted based on our direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry analyses could be used to construct a model to predict anti-adult T-cell leukemia bioactivity. This is the first study to report a relationship between seasonal variation and bioactivity of natural products using a direct-injection electron ionization-mass spectrometry metabolomics method.",,,,,,['Planta Med. 2019 Jan;85(1):e3.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the most common type of cancer in children worldwide, has one of the highest incidence rates in Mexico. It is a multifactorial disease and different cytokine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), have been associated with ALL expression. Few studies have been published analyzing IFNG +874T/A and IL2 -330 G/T in this type of leukemia. These SNPs are involved in high or low expression, and are central to cellular immunity, influencing greatly tumor growth. The purpose of this work was to explore the association of IFNG +874 A/T (rs2430561) and IL2 -330 G/T (rs2069762) SNPs with ALL susceptibility and/or protection in 488 Mexican Mestizos patients, as compared to 950 Mexican Mestizo healthy controls. The results demonstrated that IFNG +874T allele (pc=0.00004, OR=0.673) and the TT genotype (pc=0.00015, OR=0.349), protect against ALL expression with no specific gender association; however, the TT homozygote genotype (vs. TA+AA) seems more protective in males (pc=0.00683). IL2 -330 G/T does not contribute to the development of ALL. In healthy Mexicans, the most common genotypes for IL2 and IFNG, are the low cytokine producers, suggesting that the genetic background in this ethnic group, may be partly responsible for the high incidence of ALL. These results show for the first time in Mexicans, the relevant role that IFNG SNP has in the genetic etiology of ALL. Thus, a large group of patients belonging to different ethnicities will be very helpful to study in order to demonstrate if these SNPs contribute to the genetic etiology of ALL, as shown here in Mexican Mestizos.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*IFNG +874 T/A', '*IL2 -330 G/T', '*Mexican Mestizos', '*rs2069762', '*rs2430561']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Flow cytometry is a cornerstone of residual disease monitoring post therapy in this group of malignancies. Often, there is overlap between antigens targeted by immunotherapies and gating reagents utilized for population identification by flow cytometry. Such overlap can render a previously excellent gating reagent inadequate for disease detection. Recently, several anti-CD19 T cell-engaging immunotherapeutic agents and an anti-CD22 immunotoxin have been FDA approved for use in B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-LL), with an anti-CD22 T cell-engaging agent in development. In the setting of such targeted therapies, CD19 and CD22 expression may be altered, compromising the use of these reagents for identification of abnormal blasts. We describe herein a strategy for flow cytometric monitoring for residual disease in patients with B-LL post T cell-engaging anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 therapies.

We aimed to determine the shorter and longer term associations between RDW and incident common conditions in participants free of baseline disease, followed for 9 years. We undertook a prospective analysis of RDW% using 240,477 healthy UK Biobank study volunteers aged 40-70 years at baseline, with outcomes ascertained during follow-up (</=9 years). Participants were free of anemia, CAD, type-2 diabetes, stroke, hypertension, COPD, and any cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) at baseline. Survival models (with competing Hazards) tested associations with outcomes from hospital admission records and death certificates. High RDW (>/=15% variation, n = 6,050) compared to low (<12.5% n = 20,844) was strongly associated with mortality (HR 3.10: 95% CI 2.57 to 3.74), adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, education level, mean cell volume and hemoglobin concentration. Higher RDW was also associated with incident CAD (sub-HR 1.67: 1.40 to 1.99), heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and cancer (sHR 1.37: 1.21 to 1.55; colorectal cancer sHR 1.92: 1.36 to 2.72), especially leukemia (sHR 2.85: 1.63 to 4.97). Associations showed dose-response relationships, and RDW had long-term predictive value (>/=4.5 years after assessment) for the majority of outcomes, which were similar in younger and older persons. In conclusion, higher RDW predicted onsets of a wide range of common conditions as well as mortality in a large healthy volunteer cohort. RDW is not just a short term predictor, as high levels were predictive 4.5 to 9 years after baseline in healthy volunteers. The wide range of outcomes reflects known RDW genetic influences, including diverse disease risks. RDW may be a useful clinical marker for inclusion in wellness assessments.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3332-8454', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4919-9068']",,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 13.,"PURPOSE: The anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel was recently approved to treat relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With a one-time infusion cost of $475,000, tisagenlecleucel is currently the most expensive oncologic therapy. We aimed to determine whether tisagenlecleucel is cost effective compared with currently available treatments. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to evaluate tisagenlecleucel in pediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model was informed by recent multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Tisagenlecleucel (under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness) was compared with blinatumomab, clofarabine combination therapy (clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide), and clofarabine monotherapy. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty. Main outcomes were life-years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3% discount rate). RESULTS: With an assumption of a 40% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 12.1 years and cost $61,000/QALY gained. However, at a 20% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, life-expectancies were more modest (3.8 years) and expensive ($151,000/QALY gained). At a 0% 5-year relapse-free survival rate and with use as a bridge to transplant, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 5.7 years and cost $184,000/QALY gained. Reduction of the price of tisagenlecleucel to $200,000 or $350,000 would allow it to meet a $100,000/QALY or $150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold in all scenarios. CONCLUSION: The long-term effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost effectiveness. At its current price, tisagenlecleucel represents reasonable value if it can keep a substantial fraction of patients in remission without transplantation; however, if all patients ultimately require a transplantation to remain in remission, it will not be cost effective at generally accepted thresholds. Price reductions would favorably influence cost effectiveness even if long-term clinical outcomes are modest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the therapies used against the hematopoietic stem cells clones have limited efficacy; they slow the evolution toward acute myeloid leukemia rather than stop clonal evolution and eradicate the disease. The progress made in recent years regarding the role of the bone marrow microenvironment in disease evolution may contribute to progress in this area.

Although immunosuppressed MCC patients are at higher risk of recurrence and MCC-related death, it is unknown whether immunosuppression type is associated with differential outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 89 nonmetastatic MCC patients with a diagnosis of chronic immunosuppression. Immunosuppression was categorized as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (31% of cohort), other hematologic malignancies (18%), solid organ transplant (21%), autoimmune disease (21%), and human immunodeficiency virus acquired deficiency syndrome (8%). Progression-free survival (PFS) and MCC-specific survival (MSS) were estimated with the cumulative incidence function. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 52 months, 53 deaths occurred (42 from MCC, 7 unknown, and 4 non-MCC). Two-year PFS, MSS, and OS were 30%, 55%, and 52%, respectively. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired deficiency syndrome and solid organ transplant patients were diagnosed with MCC at a younger age (median 55 and 59 y, respectively) and with more advanced stage disease compared with other immunosuppressed subgroups. PFS did not significantly differ among the 5 immunosuppression subgroups (P=0.30), but significant differences were observed in MSS and OS (both P=0.01). Controlling for potential confounders for OS, including age and stage, immunosuppression type was still significantly associated with risk of death (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among immunosuppressed MCC patients, recurrent MCC is the major cause of mortality. The risk of death from MCC differs among immunosuppression types, suggesting important biological differences in host-tumor immune interactions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As an important medium for signal communication, exosomes can transfer important information, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), from donors to receptors. MiRNAs are known to fine-tune a variety of biological processes, including maxillofacial development; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In the present study, transient apoptosis was found to be due to the expression of a miniature swine maxillofacial-specific miRNA, ssc-mir-133b. Upregulation of ssc-mir-133b resulted in robust apoptosis in primary dental mesenchymal cells in the maxillofacial region. Cell leukemia myeloid 1 (Mcl-1) was verified as the functional target, which triggered further downstream activation of endogenous mitochondria-related apoptotic processes during tooth development. More importantly, mandible exosomes were responsible for the initial apoptosis signal. An animal study demonstrated that ectopic expression of ssc-mir-133b resulted in failed tooth formation after 12 weeks of subcutaneous transplantation in nude mice. The tooth germ developed abnormally without the indispensable exosomal signals from the mandible.",,,,,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Decitabine (5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, DAC), an anti-leukemic drug, is effective in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In our study, we investigated the anti-leukemic ability of chidamide, as well as its combination with decitabine in leukemia cells (HL60 and NB4). The results showed that the inhibitive effect of chidamide was dose- and time-dependent at concentration of 0.25-8 muM. The proliferation of HL60 and NB4 cells were significantly inhibited by chidamide or its combination with decitabine. The combination had a remarkable synergistic anti-leukemic effect. Chidamide increased the levels of acetylated histone H3 in both HL60 and NB4 cells by effectively inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDAC) enzymatic activities. The cells were blocked in G0/G1 phase by chidamide, but when chidamide was combined with decitabine, the cell cycle was mainly blocked in G2/M phase, accompanied by the induction of p21 expression.

This study aimed to address how the circadian clock genes behave over the course of treatment for both the acute and chronic forms of leukemia and whether any could be used as potential biomarkers as a read-out for therapeutic efficacy. Expression profiling for both core and ancillary clock genes revealed that the majority of clock genes are down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia patients, except for Cry2, which is up-regulated towards the end of treatment. A similar process was seen in acute lymphocytic leukemia patients; however, here, Cry2 expression came back up towards control levels upon treatment completion. In addition, all of the core clock genes were down-regulated in both chronic forms of leukemia (chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia), except for Cry2, which was not affected when the disease was diagnosed. Furthermore, the NAD(+) - dependent protein deacetylase Sirt1 has been proposed to have a dual role in both control of circadian clock circuitry and promotion of cell survival by inhibiting apoptotic pathways in cancer. We used a pharmacological-based approach to see whether Sirt1 played a role in regulating the circadian clock circuitry in both acute and chronic forms of leukemia. Our results suggest that interfering with Sirt1 leads to a partial restoration of BMAL1 oscillation in chronic myeloid leukemia patient samples. Furthermore, interfering with Sirt1 activity led to both the induction and repression of circadian clock genes in both acute and chronic forms of leukemia, which makes it a potential therapeutic target to either augment existing therapies for chronic leukemia or to act as a means of facilitating chronotherapy in order to maximize both the effectiveness of existing therapies and to minimize therapy-associated toxicity.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bmal', 'Circadian Clock', 'Leukemia', 'Per2', 'Reverb a', 'Sirt1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that NK cells are important for the control of acute retroviral infections, but their antiviral activity depends on multiple parameters such as viral inoculation dose, interactions with myeloid cell types and the cytokine milieu. In addition, during an ongoing retroviral infection regulatory T cells (Tregs) can suppress NK cell functions. However, the precise role of Tregs on the initial NK cell response and their immediate antiviral activity after an acute retroviral infection is still unknown. Here we show that thymus-derived Tregs suppress the proliferation, effector functions and cytotoxicity of NK cells very early during acute Friend Retrovirus (FV) infection. Tregs exhibited an activated phenotype and increased the production of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-beta after FV infection of mice. Neutralization of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 resulted in a significant augmentation of NK cell functions. Although the activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages as well as the IL-15 cytokine levels were increased after Treg depletion, Tregs mainly affect the NK cell activity in an IL-10-regulated pathway. In this study we demonstrate an IL-10-dependent suppression of NK cells by activated Tregs during the first days of a retroviral infection.",['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-10', '*TGF-beta', '*friend retrovirus', '*immune suppression', '*natural killer cells', '*regulatory T cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim to explore the imatinib targets expression in pituitary adenomas and study the effect of imatinib on GH secretion in somatotropinoma cells and GH3 cell line. Materials and Methods: The expression pattern of imatinib's targets (c-kit, VEGF, and PDGFR-alpha/beta) was studied using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting 157 giant (>/=4 cm) pituitary adenomas (121 non-functioning pituitary adenomas, 32 somatotropinomas, and four prolactinomas) and compared to normal pituitary (n = 4) obtained at autopsy. The effect imatinib on GH secretion, cell viability, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and apoptosis was studied in primary culture of human somatotropinomas (n = 20) and in rat somato-mammotroph GH3 cell-line. A receptor tyrosine kinase array was applied to human samples to identify altered pathways. Results: Somatotropinomas showed significantly higher immunopositivity for c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-beta; P < 0.009 and P < 0.001, respectively), while staining for platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) revealed a weaker expression (P < 0.001) compared to normal pituitary. Imatinib inhibited GH secretion from both primary culture (P < 0.01) and GH3 cells (P < 0.001), while it did not affect cell viability and apoptosis. The receptor tyrosine kinase array showed that imatinib inhibits GH signaling via PDGFR-beta pathway.

Recent evidence indicates that environment-mediated drug resistance arises from a reciprocal influence between tumor cells and the surrounding stroma. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells on the metabolism of bone marrow stroma, to determine the role of this metabolic change in the stroma in vorinostat resistance of CLL cells, and thus to assess a novel strategy to target stroma and achieve the maximum therapeutic effect of vorinostat. Methods: To evaluate this issue, we used freshly isolated CLL cells from peripheral blood samples of patients with CLL, and co-cultured them with bone marrow stromal cell lines to examine autophagy activity and metabolic changes in both CLL cells and stromal cells after vorinostat treatment. Results: The results demonstrated that CLL cells were under intrinsic oxidative stress which was further enhanced by vorinostat treatment, and released H2O2 outside the cells. The adjacent stromal cells took up H2O2 and drove autophagy, mitophagy and glycolysis, resulting in the local production of high-energy mitochondrial fuels, which were then taken up by CLL cells to be effectively utilized through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to enable more ATP production. Notably, targeting autophagic stromal cells with autophagy inhibitor remarkably decreased stromal protection against vorinostat treatment in CLL cells. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the stroma in the CLL microenvironment is abnormal and undergoes autophagy, and manipulation of autophagic stromal cells could serve as a novel promising strategy to circumvent stroma-mediated drug resistance in CLL cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['autophagy', 'bone marrow stroma', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'reactive oxygen species', 'vorinostat']",,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This strategy of designing compounds possessing selectivity over specific tyrosine kinase has been achieved through G-QSAR and molecular docking studies. METHODS: The objective of this research has been to design newer 2-phenazinamine derivatives as Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors by G-QSAR, molecular docking studies followed by wet lab studies along with evaluation of their anticancer potential. Computational chemistry was done by using VLife MDS 4.3 and Autodock 4.2 followed by wet lab experiments for synthesizing 2- phenazinamine derivatives. The chemical structures of ligands in 2D were drawn by employing Chemdraw 2D Ultra 8.0 and were converted into 3D. These were optimised by using semiempirical method called MOPAC. The protein structure was retrieved from RCSC protein data bank as PDB file. The binding interactions of protein and ligands were done by using PYMOL. The molecular properties of the designed compounds were predicted in silico by using Osiris property explorer. Later, we synthesized novel 13 2-phenazinamine derivatives by treating parent compound with various aldehydes in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and urea to afford 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-(phenazin-2-yl) thiazolidin-4-one and another series of derivatives synthesized with different aldehydes in the presence of p-toluylsulphonic acid, diphydropyridine and benzene sulfonyl chloride to afford benzenesulfonyl-N-(2-chlorobenzyl)-phenazin-2-amine. All the derivatives were tested for invitro anticancer activity on K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line by employing MTT assay method. RESULTS: The developed G-QSAR models were found to be statistically significant with respect to training (r2=0.8074), cross-validation (q2=0.6521), and external validation (pred_r2=0.5892). The best developed G-QSAR model suggested that the XlogP values of phenazinamine derivatives were found to be highly influential in determining biological activity. The standard drug was found to exhibit binding energy - 6.79 kcal/mol and the derivatives 5b and 6c exhibited binding energy of - 7.46 and - 8.51; respectively. CONCLUSION: Compounds 5b, 6c were observed to possess good lipophilicity and were found to exhibit better activity than other compounds in the series, although less than standard doxorubicin. The synthesis of these 2-phenazinamine derivatives (5a-m) is reported to be obtained from 2,4- dinitrodiphenylamine by applying appropriate synthetic route. Compounds 5b and 6c showed better cytotoxic activity against K562 cancer cell line when compared to other compounds of the series, although less than standard doxorubicin.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Anticancer activity', '*G-QSAR', '*K562', '*autodock 4.2', '*computer aided drug design', '*osiris property explorer', '*phena-zinamine.']",,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutated form of the IDH1 enzyme produces a metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which is thought to play a role in the formation and progression of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), gliomas and other cancers. Elevated 2-HG levels interfere with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, thereby contributing to oncogenesis. Ivosidenib targets the IDH1 metabolic pathway to prevent a build-up of the oncometabolite 2-HG. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ivosidenib leading to this first approval in the USA for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation.

Epub 2018 Sep 12.,"Tonic or chronic active B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is essential for the survival of normal or some malignant B cells, respectively. However, the molecular mechanism regulating the strength of these two types of BCR signaling remains unknown. Here, using high-speed high-resolution single-molecule tracking in live cells, we identified that PKCbeta, STIM1, and IP3R1/2/3 molecules affected the lateral Brownian mobile behavior of BCRs on the plasma membrane of quiescent B cells, which was correlated to the strength of BCR signaling. Further mechanistic studies revealed that these three molecules influenced BCR mobility by regulating the membrane tethering of MARCKS to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Indeed, membrane-untethered or deficiency of MARCKS significantly decreased, while membrane-tethered or overexpression of MARCKS drastically increased the lateral mobility of BCRs. Functional experiments indicated that the membrane-tethered MARCKS suppressed the survival and/or proliferation in both B-cell tumor cells and mouse primary splenic B cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that membrane-tethered MARCKS increased BCR lateral mobility, and thus decreased BCR nanoclustering by disturbing the interaction between cortical F-actin and the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, resulting in the suppression of the strength of both tonic and chronic active BCR signaling. Conclusively, MARCKS is a newly identified molecule regulating the strength of BCR signaling by modulating cytoskeleton and plasma membrane interactions, both in the physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting that MARCKS is a putative target for drug design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 12.,"Leukemic relapse is frequently accompanied by progressively aggressive clinical course. To understand the molecular mechanism of leukemic relapse, MLL/AF9-transformed mouse leukemia cells were serially transplanted in C57BL/6 mice (N = 96) by mimicking repeated recurrences, where mutations were monitored by exome sequencing (N = 42). The onset of leukemia was progressively promoted with advanced transplants, during which increasing numbers of somatic mutations were acquired (P < 0.005). Among these, mutations in Ptpn11 (p.G60R) and Braf (p.V637E) corresponded to those identified in human MLL-AML, while recurrent mutations affecting Msn (p.R295C) were observed only in mouse but not in human MLL-AML. Another mutated gene of interest was Gnb2 which was reported to be recurrently mutated in various hematological neoplasms. Gnb2 mutations (p.G77R) were significantly increased in clone size (P = 0.007) and associated with earlier leukemia onset (P = 0.011). GNB2 transcripts were significantly upregulated in human MLL-AML compared to MLL-negative AML (P < 0.05), which was supported by significantly increased Gnb2 transcript induced by MLL/AF9 overexpression (P < 0.001). In in vivo model, both mutation and overexpression of GNB2 caused leukemogenesis, and downregulation of GNB2 expression reduced proliferative potential and survival benefit, suggesting a driver role of GNB2. In conclusion, alterations of driver genes over time may play an important role in the progression of MLL-AML.",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8263-9902', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2174-6560', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7678-4284', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5983-8578']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 12.,"Mixed phenotype acute leukaemia (MPAL) is a high-risk subtype of leukaemia with myeloid and lymphoid features, limited genetic characterization, and a lack of consensus regarding appropriate therapy. Here we show that the two principal subtypes of MPAL, T/myeloid (T/M) and B/myeloid (B/M), are genetically distinct. Rearrangement of ZNF384 is common in B/M MPAL, and biallelic WT1 alterations are common in T/M MPAL, which shares genomic features with early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We show that the intratumoral immunophenotypic heterogeneity characteristic of MPAL is independent of somatic genetic variation, that founding lesions arise in primitive haematopoietic progenitors, and that individual phenotypic subpopulations can reconstitute the immunophenotypic diversity in vivo. These findings indicate that the cell of origin and founding lesions, rather than an accumulation of distinct genomic alterations, prime tumour cells for lineage promiscuity. Moreover, these findings position MPAL in the spectrum of immature leukaemias and provide a genetically informed framework for future clinical trials of potential treatments for MPAL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the effects of heavy metals on production of inflammatory cytokines have been previously studied, the role of heavy metals in inflammasome activation remains poorly studied. The inflammasome is an intracellular multi-protein complex that detects intracellular danger signals, resulting in inflammatory responses such as cytokine maturation and pyroptosis. In this study, we elucidated the effects of four heavy metals, including cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and lead (Pb), on the activation of NLRP3, NLRC4, and AIM2 inflammasomes. In our results, mercury and arsenic inhibited interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 secretion resulting from canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages and attenuated elevation of serum IL-1beta in response to LPS treatment in mice. In the mechanical studies, mercury interrupted production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, release of mitochondrial DNA, and activity of recombinant caspase-1, whereas arsenic down-regulated expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein. Both mercury and arsenic inhibited Asc pyroptosome formation and gasdermin D cleavage. Thus, we suggest that exposure to mercury and/or arsenic could disrupt inflammasome-mediated inflammatory responses, which might cause unexpected side effects.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3149-8433'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS arises from mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Thus, to define optimal therapies, it is essential to understand molecular events driving HSC pathogenesis. In this study, we report that during evolution of MDS, malignant HSCs activate distinct cellular programs that render such cells susceptible to therapeutic intervention. Specifically, metabolic analyses of the MDS stem cell compartment show a profound activation of protein synthesis machinery and increased oxidative phosphorylation. Pharmacological targeting of protein synthesis and oxidative phosphorylation demonstrated potent and selective eradication of MDS stem cells in primary human patient specimens. Taken together, our findings indicate that MDS stem cells are reliant on specific metabolic events and that such properties can be targeted prior to the onset of clinically significant AML, during antecedent MDS.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6519-4860'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since GISTs are encountered infrequently and inflexible to traditional therapy, the aim of the present study was to explore the correlation of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion site 1 (BMI-1) mRNA and BMI-1 protein levels with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis significance of GISTs. MATERIAL AND METHODS GIST tissues and normal tissues were collected from 156 patients who had undergone surgical treatment. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry were used to measure the BMI-1 mRNA and protein levels in GIST tissues and normal tissues. Univariate survival analysis was used for determination of the factors that affect prognosis of GIST patients. Cox proportional hazards model was plotted to determine the independent risk factors for prognosis of GIST patients. RESULTS The BMI-1 mRNA and protein levels in GIST tissues were higher than those in normal tissues. BMI-1 mRNA and positive protein levels were correlated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) risk grade, tumor diameter and infiltration, and metastasis. There was a short survival period for the patients with a positive protein level and a high mRNA level of BMI-1. The site of primary tumor, tumor diameter, NIH risk grade, infiltration, and metastasis, as well as BMI-1 mRNA and protein levels were independent risk factors for prognosis of GIST patients. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these findings suggest there might be a relationship between BMI-1 mRNA and protein levels, and clinicopathological characteristics, including NIH risk grade, tumor size as well as infiltration and metastasis, of GIST patients. In addition, BMI-1 mRNA and protein levels were identified as independent risk factors for prognosis of GIST patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 12.,"Adoptive transfer of patient-derived T cells modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARTs) has demonstrated dramatic success in relapsed/refractory pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), but response and durability of remission requires exponential CART expansion and persistence. Tumors are known to affect T-cell function, but this has not been well studied in ALL and in the context of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) expression. Using TCF3/PBX1 and MLL-AF4-driven murine ALL models, we assessed the impact of progressive ALL on T-cell function in vivo. Vaccines protect against TCF3/PBX1.3 but were ineffective when administered after leukemia injection, suggesting immunosuppression induced early during ALL progression. T cells from leukemia-bearing mice exhibited increased expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD1, Tim3, and LAG3, and were dysfunctional following adoptive transfer in a model of T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent leukemia clearance. Although expression of inhibitory receptors has been linked to TCR signaling, pre-B-cell ALL induced inhibitory receptor expression, at least in part, in a TCR-independent manner. Finally, introduction of a CAR into T cells generated from leukemia-bearing mice failed to fully reverse poor in vivo function.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8044-5226'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a chemical genetic screen and identified retinoic acid agonists as suppressors of c-myb expression. Retinoic acid treatment also decreased c-myb gene expression in human leukemia cells. Translocations that drive overexpression of the oncogenic transcription factor MYB are molecular hallmarks of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a malignant salivary gland tumor with no effective therapy. Retinoic acid agonists inhibited tumor growth in vivo in ACC patient-derived xenograft models and decreased MYB binding at translocated enhancers, thereby potentially diminishing the MYB positive feedback loop driving ACC.

Although most of these methods do not account for possibly different types of variables in the set of covariates available in the same dataset, there are many such scenarios where the variables can be structured in blocks of different types, e.g., clinical, transcriptomic, and methylation data. To date, there exist a few computationally intensive approaches that make use of block structures of this kind. RESULTS: In this paper we present priority-Lasso, an intuitive and practical analysis strategy for building prediction models based on Lasso that takes such block structures into account. It requires the definition of a priority order of blocks of data. Lasso models are calculated successively for every block and the fitted values of every step are included as an offset in the fit of the next step. We apply priority-Lasso in different settings on an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset consisting of clinical variables, cytogenetics, gene mutations and expression variables, and compare its performance on an independent validation dataset to the performance of standard Lasso models. CONCLUSION: The results show that priority-Lasso is able to keep pace with Lasso in terms of prediction accuracy. Variables of blocks with higher priorities are favored over variables of blocks with lower priority, which results in easily usable and transportable models for clinical practice.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cox regression', 'Lasso', 'Multi-omics data', 'Penalized regression', 'Prediction model', 'Priority-lasso']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7857-1263'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are limited data on the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis in children. Objective: To determine the efficacy and risks of levofloxacin prophylaxis in children receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia or undergoing HSCT. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial, patients (6 months-21 years) receiving intensive chemotherapy were enrolled (September 2011-April 2016) in 2 separate groups-acute leukemia, consisting of acute myeloid leukemia or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and HSCT recipients-at 76 centers in the United States and Canada, with follow-up completed September 2017. Interventions: Patients with acute leukemia were randomized to receive levofloxacin prophylaxis for 2 consecutive cycles of chemotherapy (n = 100) or no prophylaxis (n = 100). Those undergoing HSCT were randomized to receive levofloxacin prophylaxis during 1 HSCT procedure (n = 210) or no prophylaxis (n = 214). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the occurrence of bacteremia during 2 chemotherapy cycles (acute leukemia) or 1 transplant procedure (HSCT). Secondary outcomes included fever and neutropenia, severe infection, invasive fungal disease, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, and musculoskeletal toxic effects. Results: A total of 624 patients, 200 with acute leukemia (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 11 years [6-15 years]; 46% female) and 424 undergoing HSCT (median [IQR] age, 7 years [3-14]; 38% female), were enrolled. Among 195 patients with acute leukemia, the likelihood of bacteremia was significantly lower in the levofloxacin prophylaxis group than in the control group (21.9% vs 43.4%; risk difference, 21.6%; 95% CI, 8.8%-34.4%, P = .001), whereas among 418 patients undergoing HSCT, the risk of bacteremia was not significantly lower in the levofloxacin prophylaxis group (11.0% vs 17.3%; risk difference, 6.3%; 95% CI, 0.3%-13.0%; P = .06). Fever and neutropenia were less common in the levofloxacin group (71.2% vs 82.1%; risk difference, 10.8%; 95% CI, 4.2%-17.5%; P = .002). There were no significant differences in severe infection (3.6% vs 5.9%; risk difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -1.1% to 5.6%; P = .20), invasive fungal disease (2.9% vs 2.0%; risk difference, -1.0%; 95% CI, -3.4% to 1.5%, P = .41), C difficile-associated diarrhea (2.3% vs 5.2%; risk difference, 2.9%; 95% CI, -0.1% to 5.9%; P = .07), or musculoskeletal toxic effects at 2 months (11.4% vs 16.3%; risk difference, 4.8%; 95% CI, -1.6% to 11.2%; P = .15) or at 12 months (10.1% vs 14.4%; risk difference, 4.3%; 95% CI, -3.4% to 12.0%; P = .28) between the levofloxacin and control groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with acute leukemia receiving intensive chemotherapy, receipt of levofloxacin prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis resulted in a significant reduction in bacteremia. However, there was no significant reduction in bacteremia for levofloxacin prophylaxis among children undergoing HSCT.",,,,,,['JAMA. 2019 Jul 2;322(1):84.

Epub 2018 Sep 9.,"The selection of chemotherapy regimen for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains challenging. Here, we report that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) upregulates the expression of microRNA (miR)-146a in a nuclear factor kappaB-dependent manner, leading to direct decreases in the expression of the target proteins CXCR4 and Smad4 in AML cells in vitro. The reduction in CXCR4 expression suppressed the migration abilities of leukemia cells. Downregulation of Smad4 promoted cell cycle entry in leukemia cells. Furthermore, an increase in apoptosis was observed when leukemia cells were treated sequentially with G-CSF and cytosine arabinoside in vitro. These findings suggest that G-CSF treatment may disrupt the protection of bone marrow niches from leukemia cells. In a review of data from 78 cases of primary AML, we found that a high miR-146a expression and/or upregulation of this miRNA during G-CSF priming chemotherapy was predictive of better clinical outcomes. Our findings suggest that miR-146a may be a novel biomarker for evaluating the clinical prognosis and treatment effects of a G-CSF priming protocol in elderly patients with AML.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Recent reports have shown a link between NOTCH1 signaling and intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis in T-ALL. Here, we investigate the role of store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) mediated by the Ca(2+) channel ORAI1 and its activators STIM1 and STIM2 in T-ALL. Deletion of STIM1 and STIM2 in leukemic cells abolishes SOCE and significantly prolongs the survival of mice in a NOTCH1-dependent model of T-ALL. The survival advantage is unrelated to the leukemic cell burden but is associated with the SOCE-dependent ability of malignant T lymphoblasts to cause inflammation in leukemia-infiltrated organs. Mice with STIM1/STIM2-deficient T-ALL show a markedly reduced necroinflammatory response in leukemia-infiltrated organs and downregulation of signaling pathways previously linked to cancer-induced inflammation. Our study shows that leukemic T lymphoblasts cause inflammation of leukemia-infiltrated organs that is dependent on SOCE.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CRAC channel', '*Ca(2+)', '*Notch1', '*STIM1', '*STIM2', '*T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*T-ALL', '*anemia', '*calcium', '*inflammation', '*interferon', '*macrophages']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Previous reports show that the expression of (E-type prostaglandin 2) EP2 and (E-type prostaglandin 4) EP4 are elevated in HCC and further demonstrate that Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces HA22T cell proliferation and metastasis through EP2 and EP4 receptor. Danshen (root of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge) is a very important and popular traditional Chinese herbal medicine which is widely and successfully used against breast cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and head and neck squamous carcinoma cells. In this study, we used Cryptotansinone (Dsh-003) (MW 269.14) from Danshen to investigate their effect and corresponding mechanism of action in PGE2-treated HA22T cells. Dsh-003 inhibited HA22T cell viability and further induced cell apoptosis in PGE2-treated HA22T cells. Furthermore, Dsh-003 inhibited EP2, EP4, and their downstream effector such as p-PI3K and p-Akt expression in HA22T hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We also observed that Dsh-003 blocked PGE2-induced cell migration by down-regulating PGE2-induced beta-catenin expression and by up-regulating E-cadherin and GSK3-beta expression. All these findings suggest that Dsh-003 inhibit human HCC cell lines and could potentially be used as a novel drug for HCC treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['hepatocellular carcinoma', 'prostaglandin E2', 'salvia miltiorrhiza']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2347-0411'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Many antidiabetes treatments, particularly metformin, enhance insulin signaling, but this pathway can be inhibited by specific cancer treatments. The modulation of cancer growth by metformin and of insulin sensitivity by anticancer drugs is so common that this phenomenon is being studied in hundreds of clinical trials on cancer. Many meta-analyses have consistently shown a moderate but direct effect of body mass index on the incidence of multiple myeloma and lymphoma and the elevated risk of leukemia in adults. Moreover, new epidemiological and preclinical studies indicate metformin as a therapeutic agent in patients with leukemia, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma.

This chromosomal alteration leads to the deletion of the miR-15/16 cluster, as well as downregulation of DLEU7. Deletion of miR-15a and miR-16-1 causes overexpression of BCL2, an apoptosis suppressing protein, while the deletion of DLEU7 activates the NF-kB pathway. Both lead to the development of a pro-proliferative phenotype, an inhibition of apoptosis and prolonged cell life. This is the basis of the pathogenesis of indolent CLL where these pathways present themselves as essential targets for pharmacological therapy. Since BCL2 is, arguably, the most important factor in the pathogenesis of CLL, BCL2 inhibitors are beginning to acquire more relevance regarding targeted therapies for patients with CLL.

We report a case of a 68-year-old male with a history of PV. About four years later, the patient developed myelofibrosis. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed the presence of myelofibrosis confirmed by a hypercellular bone marrow (80%) with increased reticulin fibrosis (MF2-3), 5% blasts, and a normal 46,XY karyotype. A follow-up bone marrow biopsy documented acute myeloid leukemia (post-polycythemic myelofibrosis with acute leukemic transformation) with 20-30% blasts in the bone marrow. Chromosome analysis revealed an abnormal male karyotype with a t(3;8)(q26.2;q23) involving MECOM (EVI1) on 11q23 and confirmed by FISH and no PVTI rearrangement. To the best of our knowledge, this translocation has not been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), de novo or therapy related-myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or MDS or myeloproliferative disorder progressing to AML.

The molecular predictors of disease progression after transplantation are unclear. METHODS: We sequenced bone marrow and skin samples from 90 adults with MDS who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation after a myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning regimen. We detected mutations before transplantation using enhanced exome sequencing, and we evaluated mutation clearance by using error-corrected sequencing to genotype mutations in bone marrow samples obtained 30 days after transplantation. In this exploratory study, we evaluated the association of a mutation detected after transplantation with disease progression and survival. RESULTS: Sequencing identified at least one validated somatic mutation before transplantation in 86 of 90 patients (96%); 32 of these patients (37%) had at least one mutation with a maximum variant allele frequency of at least 0.5% (equivalent to 1 heterozygous mutant cell in 100 cells) 30 days after transplantation. Patients with disease progression had mutations with a higher maximum variant allele frequency at 30 days than those who did not (median maximum variant allele frequency, 0.9% vs. 0%; P<0.001). The presence of at least one mutation with a variant allele frequency of at least 0.5% at day 30 was associated with a higher risk of progression (53.1% vs. 13.0%; conditioning regimen-adjusted hazard ratio, 3.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.96 to 7.62; P<0.001) and a lower 1-year rate of progression-free survival than the absence of such a mutation (31.3% vs. 59.3%; conditioning regimen-adjusted hazard ratio for progression or death, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.32 to 3.73; P=0.005). The rate of progression-free survival was lower among patients who had received a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and had at least one persistent mutation with a variant allele frequency of at least 0.5% at day 30 than among patients with other combinations of conditioning regimen and mutation status (P</=0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that patients who had a mutation with a variant allele frequency of at least 0.5% detected at day 30 had a higher risk of progression (hazard ratio, 4.48; 95% CI, 2.21 to 9.08; P<0.001) and a lower 1-year rate of progression-free survival than those who did not (hazard ratio for progression or death, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.09; P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of disease progression was higher among patients with MDS in whom persistent disease-associated mutations were detected in the bone marrow 30 days after transplantation than among those in whom these mutations were not detected.

Two sisters with XX ovarian dysgenesis carried compound heterozygous truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene that led to reduced BRCA2 protein levels and an impaired response to DNA damage, which resulted in chromosomal breakage and the failure of RAD51 to be recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks. The sisters also had microcephaly, and one sister was in long-term remission from leukemia, which had been diagnosed when she was 5 years old. Drosophila mutants that were null for an orthologue of BRCA2 were sterile, and gonadal dysgenesis was present in both sexes. These results revealed a new role for BRCA2 and highlight the importance to ovarian development of genes that are critical for recombination during meiosis.

However, these measurements are often confounding as dynamic processes within cells rapidly change depending on environment, meaning that cell handling, transport, and storage can affect signaling pathways and alter results. To meet these challenges, we describe a method utilizing aldehyde fixation to simultaneously terminate cellular reactions across a population, freezing reaction results in time prior to analytical analysis. Fluorescent sphingosine was loaded into cells of different lineages (leukemia and lymphoma cell lines and primary leukemia cells) and allowed to react before fixing. The remaining sphingosine and any products formed were then quantified with chemical cytometry utilizing CE. When cells were loaded with sphingosine followed by glyoxal fixation and immediate analysis, 55 +/- 5% of lipid was recoverable compared to an unfixed control. Storage of fixed cells for 24 h showed no statistical differences in total amount of recoverable sphingolipid compared to samples analyzed immediately after fixation-though there was a difference in recovery of low-abundance products. Sphingosine kinase activity decreased in response to inhibitor treatment compared to treatment with a DMSO vehicle (21 +/- 3% product formed in inhibitor-treated cells vs. 57 +/- 2% in control cells), which was mirrored in single-cell measurements. This ""fix and assay"" strategy enables measurement of sphingosine kinase activity in single cells followed by subsequent analytical assay separated in space and time from reaction initiation, enabling greater temporal control over intracellular reactions and improving future compatibility with clinical workflow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The unmet needs in cancer therapeutics make its derivatization an important and exciting field of research. Keeping this in view, a whole new series of diverse analogues of osthol (1) were synthesized. METHOD: All the newly synthesized compounds were made through modification in the lactone ring as well as in the side chain of the osthol molecule and were subjected to anti-proliferative screening through 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-yl)-diphenyl tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) against four different human cancers of diverse origins viz. Colon (Colo-205), lung (A549), Leukemia (THP- 1) and breast (MCF-7) including SV40 transformed normal breast epithelial cell (fR-2). RESULTS: Interestingly, among the tested molecules, most of the analogs displayed better antiproliferative activity than the parent Osthol 1. However, among all the tested analogs, compound 28 exhibited the best results against leukemia (THP1) cell line with IC50 of 5microM.Compound 28 induced potent apoptotic effects and G1 phase arrest in leukemia cancer cells (THP1). The population of apoptotic cells increased from 13.8% in negative control to 26.9% at 8muM concentration of 28. Compound 28 also induced a remarkable decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (LambdaPsim) leading to apoptosis of the cancer cells. CONCLUSION: A novel series of molecules derived from natural product osthol were synthesized, wherein compound 28 was found to be most effective against leukemia and with 10 fold less toxicity against normal cells. The compound induced cancer inhibition mainly through apoptosis and thus has a potential in cancer therapeutics.",['NOTNLM'],"['Coumarins', 'Osthol', 'Prangos pabularia', 'cell cycle analysis', 'mitochondrial membrane potential loss', 'natural products.']",,,,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the significance of post-induction CNS 2 results and the impact of equipment on CNS 2 prevalence have not been well studied. PROCEDURE: A single-institution retrospective cohort study was conducted to analyze the outcome of patients with >/=1 post-induction CNS 2. A subanalysis compared the proportion of CNS 2 CSF results using 2 different cytocentrifuges; the Shandon Cytospin used from 2005 to 2008 and the Wescor Cytopro used from 2010 to 2014. RESULTS: Over 4500 post-induction CSF samples were analyzed, of which 59 were CNS 2. In covariate-adjusted analyses, post-induction CNS 2 did not significantly increase relapse risk. The proportion of CNS 2 results increased 4.3-fold in noninfants and 6.3-fold in infants using the Wescor Cytopro. Cytocentrifuge machine did not affect CNS 3 prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support our current practice of not changing management based on a post-induction CNS 2 CSF and highlight how equipment changes can significantly influence testing results.

Therefore, studies should explore the efficacy of combination therapy with oridonin and HHT in t(8; 21) AML. In this study, we investigated the synergistic effects and mechanism of oridonin combined with HHT in t(8; 21) AML cell line and mouse model. The two drugs synergistically inhibited cell viability and induced significant mitochondrial membrane potential loss and apoptosis. Oridonin and HHT induced significant downregulation of c-KIT and its downstream signaling pathways and promoted AE cleavage. HHT increased intracellular oridonin concentration by modulating the expressions of MRP1 and MDR1, thus enhancing the effects of oridonin. The combination of oridonin and HHT prolonged t(8; 21) leukemia mouse survival. In conclusion, oridonin and HHTexert synergistic effects against t(8; 21) leukemia in vivo and in vitro, thereby indicating that their combination may be an effective therapy for t(8; 21) leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'c-KIT', 'homoharringtonine', 'oridonin', 'synergistic effect', 't(8; 21) AML']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many patients have undergone prior hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), yet effects of transplant status on CAR T-cell therapy efficacy and safety have not been reported. The purpose of the study is to systematically evaluate the likelihood of achieving optimum response, severe cytokine release syndrome (sCRS), and neurotoxicity in the context of CAR T-cell therapy for HSCT-naive patients versus those with prior HSCT. Trials were identified in ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Library, and PubMed, and through reference pearl growing. Included studies used CD19-directed CAR T-cells for relapsed/refractory B-lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia and B cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, enrolled both HSCT-naive and prior-HSCT patients, and denoted transplant status with outcomes. Six studies were included for optimum response, five for sCRS incidence, and four for neurotoxicity incidence. The pooled odds ratio for optimum response was 1.57 favoring HSCT-naive patients (95% CI 0.54-4.61), whereas the pooled odds ratios for sCRS and neurotoxicity were 1.41 (95% CI 0.51-3.94) and 1.37 (95% CI 0.28-6.77), respectively, toward HSCT-naive patients. Odds ratios were non-statistically significant. Overall risk of bias was moderate.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of honey mouthwash and an oral care protocol on mucositis and weight loss in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this single-blind clinical trial, 53 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients receiving chemotherapy were randomly assigned into three groups: honey mouthwash (n = 17), oral care (n = 17), and control (n = 19). The severity of mucositis and weights was examined blindly at the baseline and 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: The prevalence of grades of mucositis in the study groups was significant at the end of the third (p = 0.002) and fourth (p < 0.001) weeks. The mucositis severity decreased at the end of the third and fourth weeks in the honey mouthwash group (p < 0.05), whereas it increased in the control group (p < 0.001). The difference in the weight was significant between the honey mouthwash and the control groups (p < 0.05, MD = 1.95) at the end of the third week, and between the honey mouthwash group with the control (p < 0.01, MD = 2.92) and oral care groups (p < 0.05, MD = 1.95) at the end of the fourth week. CONCLUSIONS: Honey mouthwash is effective in preventing and reducing the severity of mucositis, and weight loss and can be recommended for patients undergoing chemotherapy. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that honey mouthwash can reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis in patients, reduce or eliminate the possibility of weight loss in them, as well as encourage some weight gain. Compared to routine oral care, honey mouthwash is also easier to use and handle.

WPC hydrolysate was prepared using enzymatic digestion for 8 h with trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin, after which it was freeze-dried. The allergic parameters assessed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells were degranulation and release of beta-hexosaminidase, release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and changes in the expression of IL-1beta, IL-4, and IL-10 by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). During preparation of the WPC hydrolysate, hydrolysis increased rapidly from 0 to 10 min and then gradually increased slowly from 1 h onwards, achieving a final degree of hydrolysis of 78.50%. The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a reduction in the intensity of several protein bands in the WPC hydrolysate compared to the WPC. IgE-induced beta-hexosaminidase release from RBL-2H3 cells was decreased to a higher degree following treatment with the hydrolysate compared to WPC treatment. W500 (500 microg/mL WPC) showed the least inhibition of beta-hexosaminidase release, but there was no significant difference between W500 and W1000 (1,000 microg/mL) (p<0.05). H1000 (1,000 microg/mL WPC hydrolysate) inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release by 39%. Compared to the control, treatment with H1000 decreased TNF-alpha secretion to 11.87 pg/mL. The gene expression levels of IL-1beta, IL-4, and IL-13 were all significantly decreased in hydrolysate (p<0.05). In the case of IL-1beta and IL-4, the expression levels in W1000 treated cells were decreased by 73.67% and 65%, respectively, and that of IL-13 was decreased by 66.43% compared to the control.",['NOTNLM'],"['cytokine', 'whey protein concentrate', 'whey protein hydrolysate', 'beta-hexosaminidase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"The Notch signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of a wide spectrum of human cancers, including hematopoietic malignancies. Its functions are highly dependent on the specific cellular context. Gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutations are prevalent in human T-cell leukemia, while loss of Notch signaling is reported in myeloid leukemias. Here, we report a novel oncogenic function of Notch signaling in oncogenic Kras-induced myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). We find that downregulation of Notch signaling in hematopoietic cells via DNMAML expression or Pofut1 deletion significantly blocks MPN development in Kras(G12D) mice in a cell-autonomous manner. Further mechanistic studies indicate that inhibition of Notch signaling upregulates Dusp1, a dual phosphatase that inactivates p-ERK, and downregulates cytokine-evoked ERK activation in Kras(G12D) cells. Moreover, mitochondrial metabolism is greatly enhanced in Kras(G12D) cells but significantly reprogrammed by DNMAML close to that in control cells. Consequently, cell proliferation and expanded myeloid compartment in Kras(G12D) mice are significantly reduced. Consistent with these findings, combined inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation effectively inhibited the growth of human and mouse leukemia cells in vitro. Our study provides a strong rational to target both ERK signaling and aberrant metabolism in oncogenic Ras-driven myeloid leukemia.",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7032-4623', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2350-0046']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the cellular mechanisms underlying these functional alterations remain to be defined. Here, we found that AML incursion precipitates compartmental endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and an unfolded protein response (UPR) in both leukemia and stromal cells. We observed that extracellular vesicles (EV) transmit ER stress in vivo from the AML xenograft to BM stroma, whereby the upregulation of core UPR components drives subsequent osteolineage differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Finally, we show that the underlying mechanism involves quantitative incorporation and cell-cell transfer of Bone Morphogenic Protein 2 (BMP2), a potent osteogenic signal, by AML-EVs. Corroborative studies in AML patient samples support the translational relevance of AML-EVs as a platform for BMP trafficking and source of compartmental crosstalk. Transmissible ER stress was previously identified as a source of chemoresistance in solid tumor models, and this work reveals a role in remodeling the BM niche in AML.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway is deregulated in CML, with altered expression and response to the BMP ligands shown to impact on LSC expansion and behaviour. In this study, we determined whether alterations in the BMP pathway gene signature had any predictive value for therapeutic response by profiling 60 CML samples at diagnosis from the UK SPIRIT2 trial and correlating the data to treatment response using the 18-month follow-up data. There was significant deregulation of several genes involved in the BMP pathway with ACV1C, INHBA, SMAD7, SNAIL1 and SMURF2 showing differential expression in relation to response. Therapeutic targeting of CML cells using BMP receptor inhibitors, in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), indicate a synergistic mode of action. Furthermore, dual treatment resulted in altered cell cycle gene transcription and irreversible cell cycle arrest, along with increased apoptosis compared to single agents. Targeting CML CD34(+) cells with BMP receptor inhibitors resulted in fewer cell divisions, reduced numbers of CD34(+) cells and colony formation when compared to normal donor CD34(+) cells, both in the presence and absence of BMP4. In an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) model generated from CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, we demonstrate altered cell cycle profiles and dynamics of ALK expression in CML-iPSCs in the presence and absence of BMP4 stimulation, when compared to normal iPSC. Moreover, dual targeting with TKI and BMP inhibitor prevented the self-renewal of CML-iPSC and increased meso-endodermal differentiation. These findings indicate that transformed stem cells may be more reliant on BMP signalling than normal stem cells. These changes offer a therapeutic window in CML, with intervention using BMP inhibitors in combination with TKI having the potential to target LSC self-renewal and improve long-term outcome for patients.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4663-4191'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have suggested that p11 is intrinsically unstable and requires binding to annexin A2 (p36) to prevent its rapid ubiquitylation and degradation. Our laboratory has shown that p11 levels are stimulated by the expression of the oncoprotein, PML/RARalpha. Furthermore, treatment of the APL cell line, NB4 with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) causes the rapid loss of p36 and p11 protein. However, the mechanism by which ATRA regulates p11 levels has not been established. Here, we show that the proteasomal inhibitor, lactacystin reversed the ATRA-dependent loss of p11, but did not cause an accumulation of ubiquitylated forms of p11, suggesting that ATRA promotes the proteasomal degradation of p11 in an ubiquitin-independent manner. ATRA treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells reduced p11 but not p36 transcript and protein levels, thus indicating that ATRA can regulate p11 levels independently of PML/RARalpha and p36. Overexpression of p36 upregulated p11 protein but not mRNA levels, indicating that p36 affects p11 post translationally. The forced expression of ubiquitin and p11 in 293 T cells resulted in ubiquitylation of p11 that was blocked by mutagenesis of lysine 57. This study highlights the complex regulation of p11 by retinoid signaling and challenges the hypothesis that ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of p11 represents a universal mechanism of regulation of this protein.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CERS6 is an isoform of ceramide synthases known to generate ceramides with C16 acyl chain (C16-Cer). CERS6 and C16-Cer levels were significantly higher in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in comparison to peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes derived from healthy human volunteers. We investigated the role of CERS6 in chemo-resistance in T-ALL cell lines. Stable knockdown of CERS6 in CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 cells resulted in increased sensitivity to ABT-737, a pan-BCL-2 inhibitor, while CCRF-CEM cells with exogenous CERS6 expression showed resistance to ABT-737 relative to the vector control. The cytotoxic activity of ABT-737 in CERS6 knockdown cells was significantly reduced by the addition of a caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD, suggesting that CERS6 alters the cytotoxicity via extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. By co-immunoprecipitation of CERS6 in CCRF-CEM cells, we identified CD95/Fas, a mediator of extrinsic apoptotic pathway, as a novel CERS6 binding partner. In Fas pull-down samples, FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) was detected at higher levels in cells with CERS6 knockdown compared with control cells when treated with ABT-737, and this was reversed by the overexpression of CERS6, demonstrating that CERS6 interferes with Fas-FADD DISC assembly.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Purpose: Methotrexate chemotherapy can be associated with neurologic complications during therapy and long-term neurologic deficits. This study evaluated demographic and clinical factors associated with incidence of methotrexate neurotoxicity and described the impact of neurotoxicity on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy in pediatric patients.Experimental Design: Patients were enrolled between 2012 and 2017 from three pediatric cancer treatment centers in the United States. Medical records for suspected cases of methotrexate neurotoxicity, defined as an acute neurologic event following methotrexate therapy, were reviewed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between race/ethnicity and methotrexate neurotoxicity. Multivariable linear regression models compared treatment outcomes between patients with and without methotrexate neurotoxicity.Results: Of the 280 newly diagnosed patients enrolled, 39 patients (13.9%) experienced methotrexate neurotoxicity. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic patients experienced the greatest risk of methotrexate neurotoxicity (adjusted HR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.06-5.58) after accounting for sex, age at diagnosis, BMI Z-score at diagnosis, and ALL risk stratification. Patients who experienced a neurotoxic event received an average of 2.25 fewer doses of intrathecal methotrexate. Six of the 39 cases of neurotoxicity (15.4%) experienced relapse during the study period, compared with 13 of the 241 (2.1%) patients without neurotoxicity (P = 0.0038).Conclusions: Hispanic ethnicity was associated with increased risk of methotrexate neurotoxicity, which was associated with treatment modifications and relapse.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"The caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9)-B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) signaling axis is activated in myeloid cells during the innate immune response to a variety of diverse pathogens. This signaling pathway requires a critical caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-CARD interaction between CARD9 and Bcl10 that promotes downstream activation of factors, including NF-kappaB and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Despite these insights, CARD9 remains structurally uncharacterized, and little mechanistic understanding of its regulation exists. We unexpectedly found here that the CARD in CARD9 binds to Zn(2+) with picomolar affinity-a concentration comparable with the levels of readily accessible Zn(2+) in the cytosol. NMR solution structures of the CARD9-CARD in the apo and Zn(2+)-bound states revealed that Zn(2+) has little effect on the ground-state structure of the CARD; yet the stability of the domain increased considerably upon Zn(2+) binding, with a concomitant reduction in conformational flexibility. Moreover, Zn(2+) binding inhibited polymerization of the CARD9-CARD into helical assemblies. Here, we also present a 20-A resolution negative-stain EM (NS-EM) structure of these filamentous assemblies and show that they adopt a similar helical symmetry as reported previously for filaments of the Bcl10 CARD. Using both bulk assays and direct NS-EM visualization, we further show that the CARD9-CARD assemblies can directly template and thereby nucleate Bcl10 polymerization, a capacity considered critical to propagation of the CARD9-Bcl10 signaling cascade. Our findings indicate that CARD9 is a potential target of Zn(2+)-mediated signaling that affects Bcl10 polymerization in innate immune responses.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl10', '*CARD9', '*cell signaling', '*cell signaling;', '*crystallography', '*electron microscopy (EM)', '*innate immunity', '*metal ion-protein interaction', '*nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)', '*oligomerization', '*protein dynamic', '*structural biology']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1112-9892', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3343-9621', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0480-5124']","['PDB/4LWD', 'PDB/6E26', 'PDB/6E25', 'PDB/30492', 'PDB/30491', 'PDB/4I16', 'PDB/6E28', 'PDB/6E27']",,,"['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of', 'this article.']",,['(c) 2018 Holliday et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined outcomes of 242 patients treated over 3 years who had a matched unrelated donor (MUD) search at our institution. One hundred sixty patients (66%) had a 10 of 10 MUD identified, and 85 (53%) proceeded to MUD transplantation. White patients and those with common haplotypes were more likely to have a MUD identified (odds ratio [OR], 7.4 [P < .0001]; OR, 41.6 [P < .0001]), and were more likely to proceed to transplantation with a MUD (OR, 11.2 [P < .0001]; OR, 85.1 [P = .002]). In addition, patients who were newly diagnosed/in remission at the time of MUD search had a higher probability of receiving a transplant (OR, 2.01 [P = .013]) and better progression-free survival (PFS; P < .0001). In multivariate analysis for patients who received a transplant, donor type did not influence PFS at 3 years, which was 40% for MUD and 57% for haploidentical transplants, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.2 [P = .50]). In conclusion, race, haplotype frequency, and disease status at the time of MUD search influence the probability of identifying a MUD and receiving a transplant.

Epub 2018 Jul 17.,"BACKGROUND: The mucinous histologic subtype accounts for 5% to 20% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases but remains poorly characterized. The present study characterized the baseline characteristics, mutational profile, and clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with mucinous CRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 1877 patients with metastatic CRC with available histologic findings and molecular profiling and summarized the baseline clinical and pathologic characteristics and overall survival (OS) stratified by the histologic type. The data from separate cohorts with consensus molecular subtype (CMS) and CpG island methylator information were also summarized. RESULTS: The mucinous histologic type was found in 277 of the 1877 patients (14.8%) and was associated with an increased prevalence of microsatellite instability (P < .001) and a right-sided primary (P < .001). An increased frequency of CMS1 (microsatellite instability immune) and lower rates of CMS2 (canonical) were identified, with mucinous compared with nonmucinous adenocarcinoma (P < .0001). Mutations in SMAD4 (P < .001), GNAS (P < .001), ERBB2 (P = .02), BRAF (P < .001), and KRAS (P < .001) occurred at greater frequencies in the mucinous CRC cases, and TP53 (P < .001), APC (P < .001), and NRAS mutations (P = .03) were less common. Univariate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-1.63; P < .001) and multivariate analysis (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64; P = .002) demonstrated that the mucinous histologic type is associated with worse OS. The features associated with the mucinous histologic subtype were independent predictors for shorter OS, including BRAF (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.35-2.25; P < .001) and KRAS (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.22-1.65; P < .001) mutations, right-sided location (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.39; P = .01), and synchronous metastases (HR, 2.92; 95% CI, 2.49-3.42; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Compared with nonmucinous adenocarcinoma, the mucinous histologic type is associated with a worse prognosis, even when controlling for known prognostic features. This unique biologic behavior should be considered in the treatment and prognostic assessment of patients with CRC.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Consensus molecular subtype', '*Histologic type', '*Mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma', '*Mutation', '*Prognosis']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Abnormalities in hemoglobin concentration are closely correlated with health status and many diseases, including thalassemia, anemia, leukemia, heart disease, and excessive loss of blood. Particularly in resource-constrained settings existing blood analyzers are not readily applicable due to the need for high-level instrumentation and skilled personnel, thereby inexpensive, easy-to-use, and reliable detection methods are needed. Herein, a molecular fingerprints of hemoglobin on a nanofilm chip was obtained for real-time, sensitive, and selective hemoglobin detection using a surface plasmon resonance system. Briefly, through the photopolymerization technique, a template (hemoglobin) was imprinted on a monomeric (acrylamide) nanofilm on-chip using a cross-linker (methylenebisacrylamide) and an initiator-activator pair (ammonium persulfate-tetramethylethylenediamine). The molecularly imprinted nanofilm on-chip was characterized by atomic force microscopy and ellipsometry, followed by benchmarking detection performance of hemoglobin concentrations from 0.0005 mg mL(-1) to 1.0 mg mL(-1). Theoretical calculations and real-time detection implied that the molecularly imprinted nanofilm on-chip was able to detect as little as 0.00035 mg mL(-1) of hemoglobin. In addition, the experimental results of hemoglobin detection on the chip well-fitted with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model with high correlation coefficient (0.99) and association and dissociation coefficients (39.1 mL mg(-1) and 0.03 mg mL(-1)) suggesting a monolayer binding characteristic. Assessments on selectivity, reusability and storage stability indicated that the presented chip is an alternative approach to current hemoglobin-targeted assays in low-resource regions, as well as antibody-based detection procedures in the field. In the future, this molecularly imprinted nanofilm on-chip can easily be integrated with portable plasmonic detectors, improving its access to these regions, as well as it can be tailored to detect other proteins and biomarkers.",['NOTNLM'],"['chip', 'hemoglobin', 'molecular imprinting', 'nanofilm', 'surface plasmon resonance']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5173-1522'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interest in this thematic has grown due to a possible correlation between the increased risk of childhood leukemia and a daily average exposure above 0.4 microT, although the causal relationship is still uncertain. The aim of this paper was to present a new method of characterizing the children's exposure to ELF-MF starting from personal measurements using a stochastic approach based on segmentation (and to apply it to the personal measurements themselves) of two previous projects: the ARIMMORA project and the EXPERS project. The stochastic model consisted in (i) splitting the 24 h recordings into stationary events and (ii) characterizing each event with four parameters that are easily interpretable: the duration of the event, the mean value, the dispersion of the magnetic field over the event, and a final parameter characterizing the variation speed. Afterward, the data from the two databases were divided in subgroups based on a characteristic (i.e., children's age, number of inhabitants in the area, etc.). For every subgroup, the kernel density estimation (KDE) of each parameter was calculated and the p-value histogram of the parameters together was obtained, in order to compare the subgroups and to extract information about the children's exposure. In conclusion, this new stochastic approach allows for the identification of the parameters that most affect the level of children's exposure.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ELF-MF', ""*children's exposure"", '*kernel density estimation', '*p-value histogram', '*stochastic model']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9008-7530', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2503-4779', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0282-3329']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,"Whether a graft-versus-graft (GVG) response in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is associated with an enhanced graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect remains highly controversial. Furthermore, it is unknown if the GVG response overwhelms the impact of refractory acute leukemia. We aimed to compare the characteristics and therapeutic outcomes between patients undergoing a modified haploidentical cord blood (cord-haplo) HSCT protocol (n=97) and those undergoing haploidentical HSCT (n=42) for refractory acute leukemia. A reliable and stable predominant haploidentical donor chimerism was established. The 2-year relapse rate was more favorable in patients undergoing cord-haplo HSCT than in those undergoing haploidentical HSCT (25.9% versus 53.2%; P = .007), as was progression-free survival (PFS; 35.5% versus 17.9%; P = .049). Meanwhile, nonrelapse mortality at 2 years was not significantly different (38.0% versus 24.6%; P = .367). We also found that a higher number of mutual haploidentical donor-mismatched antigens, a concept similar to HLA mismatching, was associated with better disease control. Multivariate analysis identified cord-haplo HSCT as an independent significant predictor of reduced relapse (hazard ratio [HR], .44; P = .028) and improved PFS (HR, .58; P = .033), as was chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (relapse: HR, .42; P = .013; PFS: HR, .63: P = .052). However, the incidences of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, GVHD, and virus reactivation were comparable in the 2 groups. This study demonstrates that cord-haplo HSCT significantly enhances the GVL effect and improves PFS, providing a reliable and efficient therapeutic platform for patients with refractory acute leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute leukemia', '*Chimerism', '*Cord blood transplantation', '*Haploidentical cord', '*Refractory', '*Relapse']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,"PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between dose rate and other factors in the development of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia who are undergoing total body irradiation (TBI)-based myeloablative conditioning for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 2006 to 2016, 202 patients with acute leukemia (111 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 91 acute myeloid leukemia) ranging in age from 1 to 57 years (median, 25 years) underwent allogeneic HCT at University of Minnesota. Pretransplantation conditioning included cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) with (68%) or without fludarabine (75 mg/m(2)) followed by 13.2 Gy TBI given in 8 twice-daily fractions of 1.65 Gy over 4 days. Dose rate varied based on linear accelerator availability and ranged from 8.7 to 19.2 cGy/min. Patients were stratified by receipt of high-dose-rate (HDR; >15 cGy/min; 56%) or low-dose-rate (LDR; </=15 cGy/min; 44%) TBI for all 8 fractions. IPS was defined as pulmonary injury based on clinical symptoms, radiographic evidence, or pulmonary function testing within 100 days of HCT in the absence of concurrent infection. RESULTS: IPS developed in 42 patients (21%) between 4 and 73 days (median, 16 days) after transplantation. HDR TBI was associated with a higher rate of IPS compared with LDR TBI (29% vs 10%; P < .01). On multiple regression analysis, HDR remained a significant predictor of IPS (hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-5.3; P = .01), and this led to inferior 1-year overall survival (60% vs 76%; P = .01) and increased 1-year nonrelapse mortality (28% vs 15%; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: TBI dose rates </=15 cGy/min reduce the risk of posttransplantation IPS and improve overall survival. LDR TBI should be strongly considered as an easily implemented parameter to improve the safety of pretransplantation TBI-based conditioning.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In AML cells, NPM1 mutations result in abnormal cytoplasmic localization of the mutant protein (NPM1c); however, it is unknown whether NPM1c is required to maintain the leukemic state. Here, we show that loss of NPM1c from the cytoplasm, either through nuclear relocalization or targeted degradation, results in immediate downregulation of homeobox (HOX) genes followed by differentiation. Finally, we show that XPO1 inhibition relocalizes NPM1c to the nucleus, promotes differentiation of AML cells, and prolongs survival of Npm1-mutated leukemic mice. We describe an exquisite dependency of NPM1-mutant AML cells on NPM1c, providing the rationale for the use of nuclear export inhibitors in AML with mutated NPM1.",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CRISPR', '*HOX', '*MEIS1', '*NPM1', '*XPO1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*dTAG', '*nuclear export', '*selinexor']",,,['Cancer Cell. 2018 Sep 10;34(3):355-357.

To date, about 24 various RAF1 germline mutations were identified in NS. The incidence of malignancies in NS patients with RAF1 mutations has not been reported so far. However, in a few cases somatic RAF1 mutations were observed in cancer, including two described in therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML). We present a case of an adult female patient with Noonan syndrome and her affected mother with a rare RAF] germline mutation c.1279A>G (p.S427G), located within the highly conserved domain (CR3) of serine/threonine kinase C-RAF. Interestingly, this mutation has been reported for the first time in a patient with t-AML as a somatic change and so far has been identified in only one individual with NS phenotype and his mother. Our report presents the second familial case of Noonan syndrome due to a germline p.S427G substitution in RAF] with no occurrence of a malignant tumor. It may suggest that carrying a germline mutation in the RAF1 oncogene is not associated with an increased risk of tumor development. Since RAF1 mutations have been observed as a somatic event in many types of cancer, this report might be of importance for the genetic counselling and management of patients both with germline and somatic alterations in this gene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The expression of PIM kinases was assessed in synovial tissues by immunohistochemistry and double IF. After PIM-1 inhibition using either small-interfering RNA or the chemical inhibitor AZD1208, we performed proliferation and migration assays and measured the levels of MMPs and IL-6 released from RA-FLSs under stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, S100A4 and IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor). Additionally, PIM-1-associated downstream signalling pathways were analysed by immunoblotting. Results: Three isoforms of PIM kinases were immunodetected in the synovial tissues from patients with RA or OA. Specifically, PIM-1 and PIM-3 were upregulated in RA synovium and PIM-1 was expressed in T cells, macrophages and FLSs. Additionally, upon stimulation of RA-FLSs with TNF-alpha, S100A4 and IL-6/sIL-6R, PIM-1 and PIM-3, but not PIM-2, were significantly inducible. Moreover, PIM-1 knockdown or AZD1208 treatment significantly suppressed basal or cytokine-induced proliferation and migration of RA-FLS and the secretion of MMPs from stimulated RA-FLSs. PIM-1 knockdown significantly affected the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cAMP responsive element binding protein in RA-FLSs. Conclusion: PIM-1 was upregulated in RA synovial tissues and RA-FLSs and its inhibition significantly reduced the proliferation, migration and MMP production of RA-FLSs in vitro. These findings suggest PIM-1 as a novel regulator of the aggressive and invasive behaviour of RA-FLSs and indicate its potential as a target for RA treatment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Previously, we found that dual therapy by the CXCR4 inhibitor Plerixafor and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) effectively eradicated leukemia cells and concurrently activated immune cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To reveal the significance of programmed death-ligand1 (PD-L1) in AML and as a strategic approach, we investigated the anti-leukemic effect of a triple combinational therapy by utilizing Plerixafor and anti-PD-L1 in combination with chemotherapy in an AML mouse model. We examined leukemic myeloid blast cells in multiple organs after the successive treatment with Ara-C, Plerixafor, and anti-PD-L1. The results showed that noticeable benefits of triple combinational therapy for eradication of myeloid blast cells in vivo with prolonged survival rates. The frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs), monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs), and granulocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs), in the peripheral blood of leukemic mice were consistently decreased, even when mice were sacrificed alive at D + 26 after completion of the triple combinational therapy, compared to the other subgroups. These findings imply that the modulation by the triple combinational therapy may lead to more efficient leukemic myeloid blast cell ablation through the suppression of Tregs or M-MDSCs and G-MDSCs in AML. Although Plerixafor and PD-L1 antagonist do not have a direct anti-leukemic role, our results provide some clues and guidelines to develop clinically therapeutic strategies for chemotherapy-resistant patients by the modulation of leukemic microenvironments.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CXCR4 inhibitor', 'PD-L1', 'myeloid derived suppresser cells', 'regulatory T cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because embryonic germ cells (EGCs) possess physiological and developmental features similar to those of embryonic stem cells, pig EGCs are considered a potential tool for generating transgenic animals for agricultural usage. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to establish and characterize pig EGCs from fetal gonads. EGC lines were derived from the genital ridges of porcine fetuses in media containing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and stem cell factor. After establishment, these cells were cultured and stabilized in LIF- or FGF2-containing media. The cell lines were maintained under both conditions over an extended time period and spontaneously differentiated into the three germ layers in vitro. Interestingly, expression of pluripotency markers showed different patterns between cell lines cultured in LIF or FGF2. SSEA4 was only expressed in FGF2-treated pig EGCs (FGF2-pEGCs), not LIF-treated pig EGCs (LIF-pEGCs). Pluripotency genes were upregulated in FGF2-pEGCs, and germline markers were highly expressed, indicating that FGF2 supplements are more efficient in supporting the pluripotency of pEGCs. In conclusion, we verified that FGF2 signaling plays an important role in reprogramming and maintaining pEGCs from fetal gonads.",['NOTNLM'],"['*FGF2', '*LIF', '*embryonic germ cells', '*pig', '*pluripotency']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are no data on ED in children after successful treatment of ALL. We aimed to assess new ED in these children using the plethysmographic reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and biomarkers that are known to be related to ED. In all, 22 children (mean 15.6 years), after successful treatment of ALL, and 18 healthy subjects were included in this prospective study. RHI, plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), high-sensitive CRP (hsCRP) and E-selectin were measured in all children. RHI values were significantly lower in ALL patients when compared with healthy controls (p<0.05). hsCRP was significantly increased in ALL patients compared with the control group (p<0.001). E-selectin plasma levels were higher in ALL patients as compared to healthy controls (p=0.05). This is the first study that combines both plethysmographic and biochemical methods to assess ED in ALL survivors. Significantly decreased RHI with elevated plasma concentrations of biochemical markers imply a possible association with premature ED in ALL patients. The combined diagnostic approach seems to be a valuable tool for more accurate detection of ED and preventive cardiovascular management in these patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the cells simulation Jurkat and MDCK cells was incubated with the components of prosthetic materials, Prothyl Hot, Ftorax and Perflex Flexi Nylon/ Prosthetic materials were added to the incubation medium at the doses used in practice (calculated at 106 cells); duration of incubation was 24 hours. A comparative assessment of the toxicity of prosthetic materials was determined by the MTT test (activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases). Statistical analysis was carried out using the package (SPSS version 11.0). The statistical reliability of the difference between the indices was evaluated by the Student t test (the P <0.05 level was considered reliable). The results of the conducted studies testify to the absence of toxicity of the complexes Prothyl Hot, Ftorax and Perflex Flexi Nylon, used as a basis of circuit prostheses, on intact Jurkat and MDCK cells, as evidenced by the stability of their mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Based on the analysis of the conducted studies, it can be concluded, that as Jurkat and MDCK cells are used as models of immune and epithelial cells, the materials used for manufacturing of removable prostheses, the polymethylmethacrylate-based plastics (Prothyl Hot and Ftorax) and elastic thermoplastic polymer material Perflex Flexi Nylon, are not toxic.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) analyses are increasingly being introduced in routine genetic diagnostics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Despite this, only few studies that have compared the diagnostic value of SNP-A with conventional chromosome banding have been published. We here report such a comparison of 296 ALL cases, the largest series to date. Only genomic imbalances >5 Mb and microdeletions targeting the BTG1, CDKN2A/B, EBF1, ERG, ETV6, IKZF1, PAX5, and RB1 genes and the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1) were ascertained, in agreement with recent guidelines. Of 36 T-cell ALL cases, the karyotypes of 24 cases (67%) were revised by SNP-A analyses that either revealed additional imbalances >5 Mb or better characterized the changes found by G-banding. Of 260 B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cases, SNP-A analyses identified additional copy number alterations, including the above-mentioned microdeletions, or better characterized the imbalances found by G-banding in 236 (91%) cases. Furthermore, the cytogenetic subtype classification of 41/260 (16%) BCP ALL cases was revised based on the SNP-A findings. Of the subtype revisions, 12/41 (29%) had clinical implications as regards risk stratifying cytogenetic groups or genotype-specific minimal residual disease stratification. We conclude that SNP-A analyses dramatically improve the cytogenetic characterization of both T-cell and BCP ALL and also provide important information pertinent to risk stratification of BCP ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['*array analysis', '*clinical genetic diagnostics', '*pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*single nucleotide polymorphism']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6306-6942'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Trisomy 12 (tri12) is the second most frequent chromosomal aberration (15%-20%) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Tri12 confers an intermediate prognosis but is a heterogeneous entity. We examined whether additional mutational or chromosomal alterations might impact tri12 patient outcomes. This retrospective study, carried out by the French Innovative Leukemia Organization, included 188 tri12 patients with comprehensive information on immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGHV) gene status, karyotypic/FISH abnormalities, and NOTCH1, TP53, SF3B1, and MYD88 mutations. The main cytogenetic abnormalities associated with tri12 were del(13q) (25%), additional trisomies (14%) (including tri19 (10%) and tri18 (4%)), 14q32 translocations (10%), del(17p) (6.5%), del(14q) (4%), and del(11q) (4%). Unmutated (UM) IGHV, NOTCH1, and TP53, mutations were identified in respectively 66%, 25%, and 8.5% of cases. Multivariate analyses showed that additional trisomies (HR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.23-0.78, P = .01) were associated with a significantly longer time to first treatment in Binet stage A patients and with a lower risk of relapse (HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.15-0.9, P = .03) in the overall tri12 population. Binet stage B/C, TP53 disruption, and UM IGHV status were associated with a shorter time to next treatment, while Binet stage B/C (HR = 4, 95% CI = 1.6-4.9, P = .002) and TP53 disruption (HR = 5, 95% CI = 1.94-12.66, P = .001) conferred shorter overall survival in multivariate comparisons. These data indicate that additional cytogenetic and mutational abnormalities, and particularly additional trisomies, IGHV status, and TP53 disruption, influence tri12 patient outcomes and could improve risk stratification in this population.",['NOTNLM'],"['*IGHV', '*TP53', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*trisomy 12']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7767-755X'],,,,,['FILO working group'],"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the antileukemic effects of crocetin are still unclear, especially in primary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells. In the current study, the potential antipromyelocytic leukemia activity of crocetin and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. Crocetin (100 microM), like standard anti-APL drugs, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA, 10 microM) and As2 O 3 (arsenic trioxide, 50 microM), significantly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in primary APL cells, as well as NB4 and HL60 cells. The effect was associated with the decreased expressions of prosurvival genes Akt and BCL2, the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins, ABCB1 and ABCC1 and the inhibition of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), while the expressions of proapoptotic genes CASP3, CASP9, and BAX/BCL2 ratio were significantly increased. In contrast, crocetin at relatively low concentration (10 microM), like ATRA (1 microM) and As 2 O 3 (0.5 microM), induced differentiation of leukemic cells toward granulocytic pattern, and increased the number of differentiated cells expressing CD11b and CD14, while the number of the immature cells expressing CD34 or CD33 was decreased. Furthermore, crocetin suppressed the expression of clinical marker promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha ( PML/RARalpha) in NB4 and primary APL cells, and reduced the expression of histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1) in all leukemic cells. The results suggested that crocetin can be considered as a candidate for future preclinical and clinical trials of complementary APL treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'crocetin', 'differentiation', 'multidrug resistance', 'tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6094-8712', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3228-6897']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"INTRODUCTION: External quality assessment (EQA) is an essential tool for quality assurance of analytical testing processes of p210 BCR-ABL1 transcripts by RT-qPCR. As an EQA provider, the National Center for Clinical Laboratories organized an EQA scheme of p210 BCR-ABL1 testing in China for the first time to identify existing problems and ensure the reliability of p210 BCR-ABL1 testing. METHODS: Using armored RNA technology, we first constructed pACYC-MS2-p210 and CG recombinant plasmids and expressed p210 and CG armored RNAs, with packaging segments of p210 BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (FG) and four common control gene (CG) transcripts. Using these armored RNAs, we prepared lyophilized p210 quality control (QC) sample panels and evaluated detection performance of participating laboratories in China. RESULTS: Of the 66 participating laboratories, great variation was found with coefficient of variation (CV%) of raw p210 BCR-ABL1 results basically ranging from 60.0% to 100.0%.

While the underlying frequency of KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements has been identified in approximately 4-8% of T-ALL/LBL cases, a paucity of literature is available to characterize further the KMT2A rearrangements in pediatric/young adult T-ALL/LBL. A 10-year retrospective review was performed to identify KMT2A rearrangements in specimens sent for T-ALL/LBL fluorescence in situ hybridization studies in patients under the age of 30 years. Of 806 T-ALL/LBL FISH studies performed on unique individuals, 27 (3.3%) harbored KMT2A rearrangements. Nineteen patients were male and eight were female (M:F ratio, 2.4:1) with ages ranging from 1 to 20 years (mean 12, median 12). Of the 27 cases, nine (33%) had KMT2A/MLLT1 fusions, eight (30%) had KMT2A/AFDN fusions, two (7%) had KMT2A/ELL fusions, and one (4%) had a KMT2A/MLLT10 fusion. In addition, five (19%) had KMT2A rearrangements with unidentified gene fusion partners and two (7%) had 3'KMT2A deletions. Our results indicate that MLLT1 and AFDN account for the majority (63%) of KMT2A gene partners in pediatric/young adult T-ALL/LBL, while no KMT2A/AFF1 or KMT2A/MLLT3 fusions were observed despite their common identification in B-ALL and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. In addition to diagnostic and prognostic value, detecting specific KMT2A fusions may also be of clinical importance in the era of targeted therapies.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromosome analysis', '*Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)', '*KMT2A MLL', '*T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL)']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2496-8000'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, all known regulatory pathways of these channels are coupled with intracellular actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Here, to search for physiological mechanisms controlling epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC)-like channels, we utilized leukemia K562 cells as a unique model to examine single channel behavior in a whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. We have shown for the first time that extracellular serine protease trypsin directly activates sodium channels in plasma membrane of K562 cells. The whole-cell single current recordings clearly demonstrate no inhibition of trypsin-activated channels by amiloride or benzamil. Involvement of proteolytic cleavage in channel opening was confirmed in experiments with soybean trypsin inhibitor. More importantly, stabilization of F-actin with intracellular phalloidin did not prevent trypsin-induced channel activation indicating no implication of cytoskeleton rearrangements in stimulatory effect of extracellular protease.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"Generating accurate prognoses is extremely important for treating patients with cancer. Prognostic prediction based on messenger RNA (mRNA) expression has shown superior clinical value to other markers for some cancers but is not currently used for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Lipid metabolism is associated with biological aspects of cancer progression, including massive proliferation, and abnormal signaling. Moreover, abnormalities in lipid metabolism have prognostic significance. Patients with AML display abnormalities in sphingolipid metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. TPD52 is a regulator of lipid metabolism and plays a role in the formation of lipid droplets and fatty acid storage. Although the prognostic significance of TPD52 expression has been reported for many types of cancer, it has not yet been assessed in patients with AML. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess the prognostic significance of TPD52 in AML using three independent AML cohorts: one from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA; n = 142) and two from the National Center for Biotechnology Information: GSE12417 (GPL96-97; n = 162) and GSE12417 (GPL570; n = 78). TPD52 was found to be overexpressed in patients with AML (GSE84881; n = 23). The Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that TPD52 overexpression was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with AML with good discrimination ( P = 0.013, P = 0.005, and P = 0.032 for the TGCA, GSE12417, and GSE12417, respectively). Analysis of C-indices and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values further supported this discriminative ability. Moreover, multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of TPD52 expression levels ( P = 0.0196). These results suggest that the TPD52 mRNA level is a potential biomarker for AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['*TCGA', '*TPD52', '*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*prognosis']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9796-8266'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligible studies were identified by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google scholar databases. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated in codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and allele models to quantitatively estimate the association. The overall findings showed no significant association between miR-34b/c rs4938723 polymorphism and cancer risk in codominant, dominant, recessive, overdominant, and allele inheritance model. However, in stratified analysis by cancer types, the rs4938723 polymorphism significantly increased the risk of gastrointestinal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition, the rs4938723 polymorphism was associated with decreased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The findings did not support an association between rs4938723 variant and digestive tract as well as gastric cancer.

Epub 2018 Sep 10.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing consolidation with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) depend on the successful mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells. However, the factors affecting the mobilization potential in AML patients and, in particular, the effect of transfusion-related iron overload on peripheral blood stem cell mobilization are largely unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the association of varying levels of iron overload and stem cell mobilization efficacy in consecutive AML patients after two induction cycles. RESULTS: A total of 113 AML patients in early first complete remission underwent the mobilization procedure. While 84 (74.3%) patients had serum ferritin levels exceeding 1000 mug/L, 26 (23.0%) patients had levels even higher than 2000 mug/L. Iron overload correlated with the number of preceding red blood cell transfusions and inversely correlated with circulating CD34+ cell levels (p = 0.04) at apheresis. Finally, the median progression-free and overall survival rates of patients with ferritin levels of higher than 2000 mug/L were shorter with 332 days versus 2156 days (p = 0.04) and 852 days versus 2235 days (p = 0.04), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that transfusion-related iron overload is suppressing the mobilization potential and is associated with inferior outcome in AML.",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 AABB.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Medical records of 138 patients, diagnosed with t-MN between 1995 and 2017, were reviewed. Of 138 patients, 80 had t-MDS, 53 t-AML, and 5 t-MDS/MPN (age, 22-88 years; median 64 years; male/female ratio, 0.8). The median latency time was 6 years and 5 months. Of 115 patients, 56 patients received cytotoxic-/radiotherapy for a solid tumor, 56 for hematological malignancy, and 3 for an auto-immune disorder, respectively. Another 21 patients had a combination of 2 disorders. Moreover, 2 patients had 3 previous malignancies. Breast cancer was the most prevalent tumor, followed by low-grade B non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Immunophenotyping and immunohistochemistry showed aberrant expression of B-, T-, or NK-cell markers in 21% and 6%, respectively. In 90% of the patients, dysplasia in >/= 1 lineage was found. KMT2A fusion gene transcripts were seen in 5%. Cytogenetic analysis showed complex karyotypes (31%) and chromosome 5 and/or 7 abnormalities (40%). Almost 82% of the patients died and the median overall survival was about 1 year. Our study confirms that previous therapy for breast cancer is the most important cause of t-MN.

Many of its derivatives are already characterized as medicinally important drugs and used worldwide. In this study, we have screened some novel Hantzsch 1,4-DHP compounds using both in silico (QSAR and Pharmacophore) and in vitro (cytotoxic screening). 1,4-DHP showed selective cytotoxicity against five human cancerous cell lines; A375, A549, HeLa, HepG2 and SH-SY5Y but limited effect towards normal skin keratinocyte (HaCaT), lung fibroblast (WL-38) and healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In A375 and HepG2 cells, one of the 1,4-DHP derivative (DHP-8) was found to inhibit cell proliferation, and simultaneously increased the apoptotic population as well as mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Furthermore, the mitochondrial signal was triggered with the activation of cleaved Caspase9, Caspase3 and PARP. The treatment with DHP-8 also increased the expression level of SIRT1, subsequently decreasing the level of pAKT(ser473) and survivin. Reduced pAKT(ser473) expression led to decrease the phosphorylated inactive form of GSK3beta(ser9) and as a result, proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 occurred in both the cell lines. Here, we suggest that the apoptotic effect of DHP-8 in A375 and HepG2 cells was mediated by AKT and survivin pathways through SIRT1 activation. The involvement of DHP-8 in SIRT1 activation was further verified by co-treatment of nicotinamide with DHP-8 in both A375 and HepG2 cells. Overall, this study emphasizes the possible potential and therapeutic role of DHP-8 in skin and liver cancer.",['NOTNLM'],"['*1,4-DHP', '*AKT', '*Apoptosis', '*GSK3beta', '*SIRT1', '*Survivin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 10.,"The first clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of interferon-alpha2 (IFN-alpha2) were performed about 30 years ago. Since then, several single-arm studies have convincingly demonstrated that IFN-alpha2 is a highly potent anti-cancer agent in several cancer types but unfortunately not being explored sufficiently due to a high toxicity profile when using non-pegylated IFN-alpha2 or high dosages or due to competitive drugs, that for clinicians at first glance might look more attractive. Within the hematological malignancies, IFN-alpha2 has only recently been revived in patients with the Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms-essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis (MPNs)-and in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in combination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this review, we tell the IFN story in MPNs from the very beginning in the 1980s up to 2018 and describe the perspectives for IFN-alpha2 treatment of MPNs in the future. The mechanisms of actions are discussed and the impact of chronic inflammation as the driving force for clonal expansion and disease progression in MPNs is discussed in the context of combination therapies with potent anti-inflammatory agents, such as the JAK1-2 inhibitors (licensed only ruxolitinib) and statins as well. Interferon-alpha2 being the cornerstone treatment in MPNs and having the potential of inducing minimal residual disease (MRD) with normalization of the bone marrow and low-JAK2V617F allele burden, we believe that combination therapy with ruxolitinib may be even more efficacious and hopefully revert disease progression in many more patients to enter the path towards MRD. In patients with advanced and transforming disease towards leukemic transformation or having transformed to acute myeloid leukemia, ""triple therapy"" is proposed as a novel treatment modality to be tested in clinical trials combining IFN-alpha2, DNA-hypomethylator, and ruxolitinib. The rationale for this ""triple therapy"" is given, including the fact that even in AML, IFN-alpha2 as monotherapy may revert disease progression. We envisage a new and bright future with many more patients with MPNs obtaining MRD on the above therapies. From this stage-and even before-vaccination strategies may open a new horizon with cure being the goal for some patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Combination therapy', '*Cure', '*DNA-hypomethylator', '*Inflammation', '*MPN', '*MPNs', '*MRD', '*Minimal residual disease', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*Pegylated interferon-alpha2', '*Ruxolitinib', '*Statins', '*Vaccination strategies']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3936-8032'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a retrospective study of 26 adult patients with LN. Tacrolimus was initiated at a dose of 3 mg/day after induction therapy. We retrospectively collected data on renal response; modified lupus nephritis disease activity index (m-LNDAI), including hematuria, proteinuria, complement 3, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and prednisolone (PSL) dose. Three patients discontinued tacrolimus treatment because of related complications, including acute myeloblastic leukemia, tremor, or a general personal choice or a desire to become pregnant. We analyzed data from 23 patients who were treated with tacrolimus over a 5-year period. The mean urinary protein/creatinine ratio decreased from a baseline of 0.24 (min 0.00-max 4.20) to 0.00 (0.00-7.05) at 5 years (p = 0.0134), while eGFR levels remained unchanged throughout the 5 years. The mean m-LNDAI decreased from a baseline of 3.00 (0.00-12.0) to 2.00 (0.00-4.00) at 5 years (p = 0.0074). The mean PSL dose decreased from a baseline of 0.33 (0.00-0.75) mg/kg/day to 0.15 (0.15-0.33) at 5 years (p = 0.001).

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in New Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-16) and 650 days (95% CI 431-993), respectively.

Epub 2018 Apr 3.,"Background: Bacterial infections in pediatric patients with leukemia are associated with increased risks for morbidity and mortality. Few Recommendations have been made on the use of antibacterial prophylaxis in pediatrics with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Objectives: To determine the role of antibacterial prophylaxis in pediatric patients with leukemia and the most appropriate regimen that can be safely and effectively used. Methods: Literature search was conducted independently by 3 reviewers to find studies on the safety and effectiveness of antibacterial prophylactic regimens. Results: The search strategy resulted in 13 studies; most of them were observational studies. The available evidence recommends use of antibiotics with Gram-positive bacterial coverage in AML patients. In ALL patients, prophylaxis was used during the intensive phases of chemotherapy with ciprofloxacin being recommended most commonly. Conclusion: Antibacterial prophylaxis mainly with coverage against Gram-positive bacteria is recommended in pediatric patients with AML. For ALL patients, prophylaxis may be considered for patients who are undergoing intensive chemotherapy phases and are at high risk for infections with ciprofloxacin being the most commonly used agent. In general more studies are needed to determine the role of antibacterial prophylaxis in pediatric patients with leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antibiotics', 'Infection', 'Leukemia', 'Pediatrics', 'Prophylaxis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An alternative approach to treat CML is to degrade the BCR-ABL protein. Recently, potent degraders against BCR-ABL have been developed by conjugating dasatinib to ligands for E3 ubiquitin ligases. Since the degraders contain the dasatinib moiety, they also inhibit BCR-ABL kinase activity, which complicates our understanding of the impact of BCR-ABL degradation by degraders in CML growth inhibition. To address this issue, we chose DAS-IAP, as a potent BCR-ABL degrader, and developed a structurally related inactive degrader, DAS-meIAP, which inhibits kinase activity but does not degrade the BCR-ABL protein. DAS-IAP showed slightly weaker activity than DAS-meIAP in inhibiting cell growth when CML cells were treated for 48 h. However, DAS-IAP showed sustained growth inhibition even when the drug was removed after short-term treatment, whereas CML cell growth rapidly resumed following removal of DAS-meIAP and dasatinib. Consistently, suppression of BCR-ABL levels and downstream kinase signaling were maintained after DAS-IAP removal, whereas kinase signaling rapidly recovered following removal of DAS-meIAP and dasatinib. These results indicate that BCR-ABL degrader shows more sustained inhibition of CML cell growth than ABL kinase inhibitor.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0451-1337'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we use consecutive serum deprivation and re-stimulation to reconstruct biphasic collective migration and proliferation in cultured sheets of human keratinocytes. In this system, a burst of long-range coordinated locomotion is rapidly generated throughout the cell sheet in the absence of wound edges. Migrating cohorts reach correlation lengths of several millimeters and display dependencies on epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated signaling, self-propelled polarized migration, and a G1/G0 cell cycle environment. The migration phase is temporally and spatially aligned with polarized cell divisions characterized by pre-mitotic nuclear migration to the cell front and asymmetric partitioning of nuclear promyelocytic leukemia bodies and lysosomes to opposite daughter cells. This study investigates underlying mechanisms contributing to the stark contrast between cells in a static quiescent state compared to the long-range coordinated collective migration seen in contact with blood serum.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether familial risk of MGUS differs by the MM proband's age at onset, tumor or clinical characteristics is unknown. MM and smoldering MM (SMM) cases (N = 430) were recruited from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota between 2005-2015. First-degree relatives over age 40 provided serum samples for evaluation of MGUS (N = 1179). Age and sex specific rates of MGUS among first-degree relatives were compared to a population-based sample. Cytogenetic subtypes were classified by Fluorescence in situ hybridization. MGUS was detected in 75 first-degree relatives for an age- and sex- adjusted prevalence of 5.8% (95% CI: 4.5-7.2). Prevalence of MGUS in first-degree relatives was 2.4 fold (95% CI: 1.9-2.9) greater than expected rates. Familial risk did not differ by proband's age at diagnosis, gender, isotype, IgH translocation, or trisomy. This study confirms first-degree relatives of MM cases have a significantly higher risk of MGUS compared to the general population, regardless of age, gender, or tumor characteristics. In selected situations, such as multiple affected first-degree relatives, screening of first-degree relatives of MM cases could be considered for follow-up and prevention strategies.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5392-9284'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a series of genome-wide association studies, we analysed time-weighted means (wm) of erythrocyte concentrations of TGN (Ery-TGN) and DNA-TG in 1009 patients undergoing maintenance therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). In discovery analyses (454 patients), the propensity for DNA-TG incorporation (wmDNA-TG/wmEry-TGN ratio) was significantly associated with three intronic SNPs in NT5C2 (top hit: rs72846714; P = 2.09 x 10(-10), minor allele frequency 15%). In validation analyses (555 patients), this association remained significant during both early and late maintenance therapy (P = 8.4 x 10(-6) and 1.3 x 10(-3), respectively). The association was mostly driven by differences in wmEry-TGN, but in regression analyses adjusted for wmEry-TGN (P < 0.0001), rs72846714-A genotype was also associated with a higher wmDNA-TG (P = 0.029). Targeted sequencing of NT5C2 did not identify any missense variants associated with rs72846714 or wmEry-TGN/wmDNA-TG. rs72846714 was not associated with relapse risk, but in a separate cohort of 180 children with relapsed ALL, rs72846714-A genotype was associated with increased occurrence of relapse-specific NT5C2 gain-of-function mutations that reduce cytosol TGN levels (P = 0.03).

In previous studies, we determined that PEITC inhibited the in vitro growth of human glioblastoma GBM 8401 cells by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting migration and invasion, and altering gene expression. Nevertheless, there are no further in vivo reports disclosing whether PEITC can suppress the growth of glioblastoma. Therefore, in this study we investigate the anti-tumor effects of PEITC in a xenograft model of glioblastoma in nude mice. Thirty nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with GBM 8401 cells. Mice with one palpable tumor were divided randomly into three groups: control, PEITC-10, and PEITC-20 groups treated with 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 10 and 20 mumole PEITC/100 muL PBS daily by oral gavage, respectively. PEITC significantly decreased tumor weights and volumes of GBM 8401 cells in mice, but did not affect the total body weights of mice. PEITC diminished the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) and XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) in GBM 8401 cells. PEITC enhanced the levels of caspase-3 and Bax in GBM 8401 cells. The growth of glioblastoma can be suppressed by the biological properties of PEITC in vivo. These effects might support further investigations into the potential use of PEITC as an anticancer drug for glioblastoma.",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'caspase', 'glioblastoma', 'phenethyl isothiocyanate', 'xenograft']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2153-340X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7303-2287']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 10.,"MCL-1, a member of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family, is a prosurvival protein with an essential DNA repair function. This study aims to test whether inhibition of protein synthesis by mTOR complex (mTORC) inhibitors depletes MCL-1, suppresses homologous recombination (HR) repair, and sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors. Treatment with everolimus decreases MCL-1 in colorectal carcinomas and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells but not glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells with a PTEN mutational background. However, AZD2014, a dual mTORC inhibitor, depletes MCL-1 in GBMs. Further, we show that everolimus decreases 4EBP1 phosphorylation only in colorectal carcinoma, whereas AZD2014 decreases 4EBP1 phosphorylation in both colorectal carcinoma and GBM cells. Combination therapy using everolimus or AZD2014 with olaparib inhibits the growth of clone A and U87-MG xenografts in in vivo and decreases clonogenic survival in in vitro compared with monotherapy. Reintroduction of MCL-1 rescues the survival of cancer cells in response to combination of everolimus or AZD2014 with olaparib. Treatment of cells with mTORC inhibitors and olaparib increases gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci, decreases BRCA1, RPA, and Rad51 foci, impairs phosphorylation of ATR/Chk1 kinases, and induces necroptosis. In summary, mTORC inhibitors deplete MCL-1 to suppress HR repair and increase sensitivity to olaparib both in in vitro and in xenografts. IMPLICATIONS: Targeting the DNA repair activity of MCL-1 in in vivo for cancer therapy has not been tested. This study demonstrates that depleting MCL-1 sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitors besides eliciting necroptosis, which could stimulate antitumor immunity to improve the therapeutic intervention of cancers.",,,,,,,,,['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 10.,"Post-translational modifications by ubiquitin-related SUMO modifiers regulate cellular signaling networks and protein homeostasis. While SUMO1 is mainly conjugated to proteins as a monomer, SUMO2/3 can form polymeric chains. Poly-SUMOylation is best understood in the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (StUbL) pathway, where chains prime proteins for subsequent ubiquitylation by StUbLs. SUMO chains typically form in response to genotoxic or proteotoxic stress and are preferentially linked via lysine 11 of SUMO2/3. Here, we report that K11 of SUMO2/3 undergoes reversible acetylation with SIRT1 being the K11 deacetylase. In a purified in vitro system, acetylation of SUMO2/3 impairs chain formation and restricts chain length. In a cellular context, however, K11 acetyl-mimicking SUMO2 does not affect the StUbL pathway, indicating that in cells non-canonical chains are more prevalent. MS-based SUMO proteomics indeed identified non-canonical chain types under basal and stress conditions.

Despite recent advances in long-read sequencing, transcriptome assembly of short reads remains a useful and cost-effective methodology for unveiling transcript-level rearrangements and novel isoforms. One of the major concerns for adopting the proven de novo assembly approach for RNA-seq data in clinical settings has been the analysis turnaround time. To address this concern, we have developed a targeted approach to expedite assembly and analysis of RNA-seq data. RESULTS: Here we present our Targeted Assembly Pipeline (TAP), which consists of four stages: 1) alignment-free gene-level classification of RNA-seq reads using BioBloomTools, 2) de novo assembly of individual targets using Trans-ABySS, 3) alignment of assembled contigs to the reference genome and transcriptome with GMAP and BWA and 4) structural and splicing variant detection using PAVFinder. We show that PAVFinder is a robust gene fusion detection tool when compared to established methods such as Tophat-Fusion and deFuse on simulated data of 448 events. Using the Leucegene acute myeloid leukemia (AML) RNA-seq data and a set of 580 COSMIC target genes, TAP identified a wide range of hallmark molecular anomalies including gene fusions, tandem duplications, insertions and deletions in agreement with published literature results. Moreover, also in this dataset, TAP captured AML-specific splicing variants such as skipped exons and novel splice sites reported in studies elsewhere. Running time of TAP on 100-150 million read pairs and a 580-gene set is one to 2 hours on a 48-core machine. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that TAP is a fast and robust RNA-seq variant detection pipeline that is potentially amenable to clinical applications.

Mutations in CHST3 have been previously reported to be associated with a rare phenotype of skeleton dysplasia, known as Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia. Here we reported 1 patient with APL with CHST3 mutations. PATIENT CONCERNS: An 18-year-old girl was referred to the Hematology Department because of a lasting history (10 days) of repeated fever and bleeding on skin. The girl was of short stature for age and with short fingers. Double nail beds were short with anti-nail deformity. DIAGNOSES: She was diagnosed with APL according to the 2016 WHO classification after a MICM analysis (bone marrow morphology [M], immunophenotype [I], cytogenetics [C], and molecular biology [M]). Whole exome sequencing revealed complex heterozygous mutations on CHST3. Further confirmation showed that 1 mutation (c.155T>G; p.Leu52Arg) was from her father and the other mutation (c.1414G>A; p.Glu472Lys) was from her mother. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received Idarubicin (8 mg/m) injection intravenous drip for 3 days based on all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide induction therapy. OUTCOMES: The patient died from disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ hemorrhage at 9 days after diagnosis. LESSONS: This case describes a patient with APL with complex heterozygous mutations on CHST3. Carbohydrate sulfotransferases were found to play an important role in metastatic spread of tumor cells. Whether the mutation status of CHST3 gene has relationship with APL pathogenesis and prognosis is unknown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Essential part of the management of CML patients is a consequent use of cytogenetic and molecular follow up with standardized methods to regularly assess the remission status. Long lasting remission without treatment in an important minority of patients prompted the hope for curability of CML.

The latest version of the European Leukemia Network (ELN)-risk classification defines AML with mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1 or TP53 to fall in the unfavorable risk group. Consequently, the somatic molecular genetic testing at the time of initial diagnosis should encompass these before mentioned three genes next to the already routine testing of NPM1, CEBPA and FLT3-ITD. Several new innovative substances have been developed and approved for AML therapy. The multikinase inhibitor midostaurin is a new substance in the induction therapy for patients with FLT-3 mutated AML. CPX-351 (cytarabin and daunorubicin in liposomatic formulation in a defined molar relation) is a new option for therapy associated AML and AML with myelodysplastic changes.

Epub 2018 Sep 10.,"BACKGROUND: Certain nuclear envelope proteins are associated with important cancer cell characteristics, including migration and proliferation. Abnormal expression of and genetic changes in nuclear envelope proteins have been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Transmembrane protein 18 (TMEM18), a nuclear envelope protein, is involved in neural stem cell migration and tumorigenicity. METHODS: To examine the prognostic significance of TMEM18 in AML patients, we analyzed an AML cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 142). RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that TMEM18 overexpression was associated with a better AML prognosis with good discrimination (p = 0.019). Interestingly, this ability to predict the prognosis was significant in male AML patients, but not in female ones. C-index and area-under-the-curve analyses further supported this discriminative ability and multivariate analysis confirmed its prognostic significance (p = 0.00347). Correlation analysis revealed that TMEM18 had a statistically significant positive correlation with nuclear envelop protein 133 (NUP133), NUP35, NUP54, NUP62, and NUP88. CONCLUSION: Because the current AML prognostic factors do not take mRNA expression into consideration unlike other cancers, the development of mRNA-based prognostic factors would be beneficial for accurate prediction of the survival of AML patients. Therefore, TMEM18 gene is a potential biomarker for AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Prognosis', '*TCGA', '*TMEM18']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this patient developed grade 4 CRS, multiple organ failure, hemophagocytic syndrome, neurotoxicity, and severe pulmonary infection after CAR-T-cell therapy. Tocilizumab and glucocorticoids treatment were ineffective for controlling the adverse effects and in contrast, hemofiltration immediately ameliorated the severe CRS and prevented the exacerbation of multiple organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and hydrosarca caused by CAR-T-cell therapy. All side effects disappeared within days following hemofiltration. Hemofiltration helped quickly clear cytokines, speeded up patient recover, and successfully resolved the severe CRS crisis.

DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: De-identified patient data from 2008 to 2011 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) were linked to 2007-2013 Medicare claims and 2007-2013 Hospital Characteristics. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to prior nonshortage time period, patients diagnosed during a major drug shortage were 47 percent less likely (p < .05) to receive inpatient chemotherapy within 14 days of diagnosis. Patients who were younger, had a lower Charlson Comorbidity score, and for whom AML was a first primary cancer were prioritized across all periods. CONCLUSIONS: Period of major shortage of a generic oncolytic, without an equivalent therapeutic substitute, reduced timely receipt of induction chemotherapy treatment. More favorable economic and regulatory policies for generic drug suppliers might result in greater availability of essential, older generic drug products that face prolonged or chronic shortage.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytarabine', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*drug shortage', '*prioritization', '*receipt of treatment', '*timeliness of treatment']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0297-9091', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6436-7157']",,,,,,['(c) Health Research and Educational Trust.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined treatment of Ph+ cells with ABL TKIs and alisertib was cytotoxic, with the fraction of senescent cells increasing in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Aurora A gene silencing suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced ABL TKI efficacy. In a mouse xenograft model, co-administration of ponatinib and alisertib enhanced survival and reduced tumor size; moreover, the treatments were well tolerated by the animals. These results indicate that inhibiting Aurora kinase can enhance the cytotoxic effects of ABL TKIs and is, therefore, an effective therapeutic strategy against ABL TKI-resistant cells, including those with the T315I mutation.",['NOTNLM'],"['ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'Aurora kinase', 'T315I mutation', 'cell cycle', 'chronic myeloid leukemia']",,,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the dose-related toxicity remains a considerable challenge. The apoptosis-regulating gene, PDCD5, is downregulated in various tumors, including leukemias, and may provide a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of leukemia. The purpose of this study was to construct a triple-regulated oncolytic adenovirus carrying a PDCD5 gene expression cassette (SG611-PDCD5) and explore the combined antitumor efficacy of SG611-PDCD5 in combination with low dose daunorubicin on leukemic cells. Materials and methods: A variety of leukemic cell lines, including K562, MEG-01, KG-1a, HL-60, SUP-B15, and BV-173, were cultured according to the providers' instructions. The insertion and orientation of all recombined plasmids were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and PCR. The tumor-selective replication of the constructed conditionally replicating SG611-PDCD5 and its antitumor efficacy in combination with daunorubicin were characterized in leukemic cell lines in vitro and in a nude mouse xenograft model. Cell viability was detected using cell-counting kit-8. Apoptosis was detected in whole living cells using flow cytometry and in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Results: The triple-regulated CRAd carrying SG611-PDCD5 and nude mouse xenograft models of K562 cells were successfully constructed. In vitro treatment with SG611-PDCD5 in combination with low-dose daunorubicin elicited more potent anti-proliferative and proapoptotic effects in leukemic cells in a dose-dependent manner. The Chou-Talalay analysis revealed synergistic anti-proliferative effects in all of the above cell lines. In the nude mice xenograft model, the tumor size in the control, daunorubicin, SG611-PDCD5, and combined treatment groups on day 10 were 170.1+/-47.8, 111.9+/-81.1, 60.7+/-12.3, and 33.2+/-17.5 mm(3), respectively (all P<0.05). The results of the TUNEL assay showed significantly more apoptotic cells in the SG611-PDCD5 plus daunorubicin group than in the SG611-PDCD5 or daunorubicin groups alone (25+/-0.82, 12.5+/-2.27, and 7.8+/-2.67 apoptotic cells/field, respectively) (P<0.05). Conclusion: The findings suggest that combined treatment with SG611-PDCD5 and daunorubicin may be a promising strategy for enhancing chemosensitivity and thus lowering the dose-related toxicity of daunorubicin in leukemia therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['PDCD5 gene', 'gene therapy', 'leukemia', 'oncolytic adenovirus']",,,,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atypical presentations such as absence of splenomegaly and presence of lymphadenopathy and leukocytosis, a hypoplastic marrow masquerading as aplastic anemia, pose a diagnostic challenge to both clinician and pathologist. A diligent morphological examination to look for the presence of hairy cells along with flow cytometric immunophenotyping showing consistent bright expression of CD200, in addition to well-described characteristic immunophenotype, helps in correctly diagnosing the case. This can be further confirmed by the consistent presence of V600E point mutation in BRAF gene.

Lately, monotherapy with hypomethylating agents like azacitidine (Aza) has been used to prolong overall survival (OS) in AML patients. Herein, we present a retrospective study investigating treatment responses and OS of Aza in combination with etoposide (Eto) and cytarabine (ARA-C) in elderly. Materials and Methods: In this study, therapies and outcomes of 37 newly diagnosed AML patients, >60 years old, and ineligible for intensive chemotherapy were investigated retrospectively. Patients were grouped according to the treatments they received as follows - Group 1: low-dose conventional therapies as hydroxyurea, low-dose ARA-C, or best supportive care (n = 11); Group 2: Aza alone (n = 6); Group 3: Aza in combination with Eto and ARA-C (Aza + Eto + ARA-C, n = 20). Results: It was found that an Aza + Eto + ARA-C combination therapy had significantly better overall response rates (P = 0.002). Combination group had significantly better OS than Group 1 (8 months vs. 1 month, P < 0.001), the difference between combination and monotherapy was not significant. The OS was also associated with age and performance status, but the difference was still statistically significant after adjustment for these factors, especially for patients with younger age and better performance. Conclusions: We concluded that combination therapy of Aza with Eto and ARA-C increases response rates, and prolong survival for this poor prognosed patient group. We believe that larger controlled studies investigating Aza combinations with other antileukemic drugs will contribute to the development of tolerable treatment protocols for elderly AML patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'azacitidine', 'combination chemotherapy', 'elderly', 'geriatrics']",,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukins (ILs) are a diverse set of small cell signaling protein molecules. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ILs alter their function, increasing susceptibility to different diseases. Patients and Methods: We investigated the association between polymorphism in IL-10 -819T/C (rs1800871) and the risk of AML in the Egyptian population. DNA was isolated from bone marrow of 80 newly diagnosed adult AML patients, and 85 age- and sex-matched controls. Genetic analysis of IL-10 SNPs at -819T/C was assayed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: Genetic analysis of IL-10 revealed that the Egyptians have high -819T allele frequencies in apparently healthy controls, whereas -819CC genotype and the -819C allele frequencies in the AML group were higher than in the controls (P = 0.000086). The study suggested that subjects carrying the rs1800871CC genotype and C allele had a significantly increased risk for AML.

Recent studies show aberrant lncRNAs expression in different types of cancer including blood malignancies. As such, lncRNAs could be a possible way for diagnosis and treatment of certain cancers. In the current study, the level of PCA3 gene expression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was compared with normal individuals to find out whether the level of PCA3 in CML patients is increased according to our hypothesis. Materials and Methods: The buffy coat was collected from peripheral blood of thirty untreated CML patients (BCR-ABL positive) and twenty normal volunteers. RNA was extracted from white blood cells and cDNA was synthesized. The level of PCA3 gene expression was measured using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: The results showed that PCA3 has expression in both normal and leukemic white blood cells. The data also revealed higher expression of PCA3 in leukemic patients, compared to the normal counterpart (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The unusual increase in PCA3 gene expression in CML patients suggests the need for more research on mechanisms of molecular pathways related to PCA3 which could help achieve better treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'PCA3', 'gene expression', 'long noncoding RNAs']",,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a specific genetic abnormality resulting in a fusion protein with an active tyrosine kinase region. Therefore, TKIs were developed as a suitable treatment option. Methods: Full-text articles, abstracts, and meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of the five TKIs were included in the review. Efficacy of these enhanced therapies is estimated on the basis of achievement of a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) and this outcome is an important goal as a surrogate marker for improved survival. Results: Bosutinib's efficacy is comparable to that of imatinib in the first-line setting and with dasatinib and nilotinib as second-line therapy, while its safety profile is distinctly different. Most therapeutic guidelines for CML recommend an initiation of therapy with imatinib and application of dasatinib and nilotinib as subsequent lines. Conclusion: Bosutinib is generally not recommended despite its demonstrated efficacy and manageable toxicity. However, resistance, intolerance, specific mutations, as well as disease progression are often the reasons for the lack of sufficient response to therapy registered by the lower rates or complete absence of CCyR.

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"BACKGROUND: Maternal hormonal contraception has been suspected of being linked to an increased risk of childhood cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the association between maternal use of hormonal contraception and diagnosis of leukaemia in their children. METHODS: In this cohort study, we followed a nationwide cohort of 1 185 157 liveborn children between 1996 and 2014 listed in the Danish Medical Birth Registry and identified those diagnosed with leukaemia in the Danish Cancer Registry. Redeemed prescriptions from the Danish National Prescription Registry provided information about maternal hormonal contraceptive use, categorised as: no use (never used contraception before birth; reference category), previous use (>3 months before start of pregnancy), and recent use (</=3 months before and during pregnancy). We also calculated risk estimates separately for maternal hormonal contraceptive use during pregnancy. The primary outcome of interest was a diagnosis of any leukaemia in the children. Secondary outcomes were diagnoses of lymphoid leukaemia and non-lymphoid leukaemia. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for risk of leukaemia in children. The Data Protection Agency registration number for this study is 2017-41-5221. FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2014, the 1 185 157 liveborn children accumulated 11 114 290 person-years of follow-up (median 9.3 years, IQR 4.6-14.2), during which 606 children were diagnosed with leukaemia (465 with lymphoid leukaemia and 141 with non-lymphoid leukaemia). Children born to women with recent use of any type of hormonal contraception were at higher risk for any leukaemia than children of women who never used contraception (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.96; p=0.011); and for exposure during pregancy the risk was 1.78 (0.95-3.31; p=0.070). No association was found between timing of use and risk for lymphoid leukaemia (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.97-1.57, p=0.089, for previous use and 1.27, 0.90-1.80, p=0.167, for recent use); however, the HRs for non-lymphoid leukaemia were 2.17 (1.22-3.87; p=0.008) for recent use and 3.87 (1.48-10.15; p=0.006) for use during pregnancy. Hormonal contraception use close to or during pregnancy might have resulted in one additional case of leukaemia per about 50 000 exposed children, or 25 cases during the 9-year study period. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest the maternal hormonal use affects non-lymphoid leukaemia development in children. Since almost no risk factors have been established for childhood leukaemia, these findings suggest an important direction for future research into its causes and prevention.

Epub 2018 Sep 7.,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the incidence, inpatient mortality, and economic burden of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) in adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the United States. METHODS: Using MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits Database, data for patients with B-cell ALL from April 1, 2009, to October 31, 2016, were extracted by using diagnosis codes. VOD was identified based on clinical criteria and expert opinions. Patients with VOD were followed up from diagnosis of VOD until the earliest occurrence of inpatient death, end of continuous enrollment, end of study period, or for a maximum of 100days. The incidence of VOD and VOD-associated inpatient mortality were calculated. VOD-related health care costs based on paid adjudicated claims were calculated. FINDINGS: Of the 2571 adults with B-cell ALL, the overall incidence of VOD was low at 3.4% (88 of 2571). Of these patients with VOD, 52% (46 of 88) experienced multiorgan failure and were identified as having severe VOD. VOD was only identified in patients having undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (5.4% [88 of 1624]). The inpatient mortality rate of those with any VOD over the 100-day postindex period was 26.1%, and the inpatient mortality was even higher for patients with severe VOD (37.0%). Total mean (SD) medical costs per patient during the 100 days' post-VOD diagnosis were $55,975 ($160,335); mean (SD) costs per patient were approximately 4-fold higher for severe ($86,953 [$206,906]) versus nonsevere ($22,047 [$72,847]) VOD. IMPLICATIONS: Clinical criteria were used to identify VOD events and thus VOD might be underdiagnosed. The mortality of VOD also might be underestimated because only inpatient deaths are captured in the data. The incidence and mortality of VOD could also be underestimated because we focused on adult patients who might receive reduced-intensity treatment. The economic burden of VOD may be underestimated because the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code specific for defibrotide was not available, and thus the cost for defibrotide might not be included. Finally, as the study population consisted of patients with commercial or Medicare supplemental insurance, results may not be generalizable to all patients with VOD in the United States. Although VOD occurred infrequently in adults with B-cell ALL, it was associated with high inpatient mortality and substantial costs. Patients with severe VOD were associated with highest mortality and highest costs. Given the clinical and economic burden associated with VOD, it is important that patients at high risk for VOD be identified and treated to minimize this risk.",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cost', '*incidence', '*inpatient mortality', '*veno-occlusive disease']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Amgen Inc.

Leukemic arthritis and hypercalcemia are rare manifestations in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old Thai man who had been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase developed blast crisis while he was receiving ongoing treatment with imatinib at 400 mg/day. Initially, he presented with oligoarthritis in both knees and ankles. A bone scintigraphy showed a prominent bony uptake, with a symmetrical, increased uptake in many bone areas. Induction therapy with a 7 + 3 induction regimen was prescribed in conjunction with 600 mg of imatinib once daily before switching to 140 mg of dasatinib. He subsequently developed severe hypercalcemia (total serum calcium of 17.8 mg/dL), with generalized osteolytic lesions detected on a bone survey. His serum vitamin D level was 50.64 ng/mL, while the serum parathyroid hormone level was 9.82 pg/mL. Despite the administration of an aggressive intravenously administered hydration, intravenously administered calcitonin, and 600 mg/day of imatinib, the severe hypercalcemia was refractory. We therefore decided to prescribe 20 mg/day of intravenously administered dexamethasone; fortunately, his serum calcium level decreased dramatically to normal range within a few days. CONCLUSIONS: Although leukemic arthritis and severe hypercalcemia are extraordinary presentations in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, the advanced phase of the disease might bring on these symptoms. Apart from parathyroid hormone-related protein-related hypercalcemia, vitamin D is a mechanism of humoral-mediated hypercalcemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Hypercalcemia', 'Leukemic arthritis', 'Osteolytic bone']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1262-2005'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,"Antigenic stimulation is considered as a possible trigger of neoplastic transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). B-cell receptor plays a key role in the interactions between the microenvironment and leukemic cells; however, an important role has also been attributed to Toll-like receptors (TLRs). It is believed that disorders of TLR expression may play a part in the pathogenesis of CLL. In this study, we investigated the potential role of TLR2 in CLL by analyzing its expression on leukemic B cells in correlation with clinical and laboratory parameters characterizing disease activity and patients' immune status. We assessed the frequencies of TLR2(+)/CD19(+) cells by the flow cytometry method in peripheral blood of 119 patients with CLL. The percentage of TLR2(+)/CD19(+) cells was significantly lower in patients with CLL as compared to the healthy volunteers. There was also a lower percentage of TLR2(+)/CD19(+) cells in CLL patients with poor prognostic factors, such as ZAP70 and/or CD38 expression, 17p and/or 11q deletion. On the other hand, among patients with del(13q14) associated with favorable prognosis, the percentage of TLR2(+)/CD19(+) cells was higher than among those with del(11q22) and/or del(17p13) as well as in the control group. We found an association between low percentage of CD19(+)/CD5(+)/TLR2(+) cells and shorter time to treatment. We also demonstrated the relationship between low percentage of CD19(+)/CD5(+) TLR2-positive and overall survival (OS) of CLL patients. CLL patients with a proportion of 1.6% TLR2-positive B CD5(+) cells (according to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis) or more had a longer time to treatment and longer OS than the group with a lower percentage of TLR2 positive cells. To sum up, the results of the study suggest that low TLR2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in CLL patients. The monitoring of CD19(+)/CD5(+)/TLR2(+) cells number may provide useful information on disease activity.

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,"Radiotherapy improves survival for common childhood cancers such as medulloblastoma, leukemia, and germ cell tumors. Unfortunately, long-term survivors suffer sequelae that can include secondary neoplasia. Gliomas are common secondary neoplasms after cranial or craniospinal radiation, most often manifesting as high-grade astrocytomas with poor clinical outcomes. Here, we performed genetic profiling on a cohort of 12 gliomas arising after therapeutic radiation to determine their molecular pathogenesis and assess for differences in genomic signature compared to their spontaneous counterparts. We identified a high frequency of TP53 mutations, CDK4 amplification or CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and amplifications or rearrangements involving receptor tyrosine kinase and Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway genes including PDGFRA, MET, BRAF, and RRAS2. Notably, all tumors lacked alterations in IDH1, IDH2, H3F3A, HIST1H3B, HIST1H3C, TERT (including promoter region), and PTEN, which genetically define the major subtypes of diffuse gliomas in children and adults. All gliomas in this cohort had very low somatic mutation burden (less than three somatic single nucleotide variants or small indels per Mb). The ten high-grade gliomas demonstrated markedly aneuploid genomes, with significantly increased quantity of intrachromosomal copy number breakpoints and focal amplifications/homozygous deletions compared to spontaneous high-grade gliomas, likely as a result of DNA double-strand breaks induced by gamma radiation. Together, these findings demonstrate a distinct molecular pathogenesis of secondary gliomas arising after radiation therapy and identify a genomic signature that may aid in differentiating these tumors from their spontaneous counterparts.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Astrocytoma', '*Chromosome breaks', '*DNA double-strand breaks', '*Ganglioglioma', '*Genomic signature', '*Glioblastoma', '*Ionizing radiation', '*Mutational signature', '*Radiation therapy', '*Radiation-associated glioma', '*Radiation-induced glioma (RIG)', '*Secondary malignancy']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4571-7999'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2017 Dec 18.,"INTRODUCTION: Resistance of cancer cells is a serious impediment to chemotherapy and several phytochemicals are active against multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes. The cytotoxicity of five naturally occurring compounds: betulin (1), mundulea lactone (2), seputhecarpan A (3), seputheisoflavone (4) and epunctanone (5) was evaluated on a panel of 9 cancer cell lines including various sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines. The modes of action of compound 5 were further investigated. METHODS: The resazurin reduction assay was used to evaluate cytotoxicity of samples and ferroptotic cell death induced by compound 5; caspase-Glo assay was used to detect the activation of caspases in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells treated with compound 5. Flow cytometry was used for cell cycle analysis in CCRF-CEM cells treated with compound 5, as well as detection of apoptotic cells by annexin V/PI staining, analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). RESULTS: Compounds 1-5 displayed cytotoxic effects in the 9 studied cancer cell lines with IC50 values below 70 microM. The IC50 values varied from 8.20 microM (in HCT116 (p53(-/-)) colon cancer cells) to 35.10 microM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for 1, from 8.84 microM (in CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells) to 48.99 microM (in MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells) for 2, from 12.17 microM (in CEM/ADR5000 cells) to 65.08 microM (in MDA-MB-231 cells) for 3, from 23.80 microM (in U87MG.DeltaEGFR glioblastoma cells) to 68.66 microM (in HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells) for 4, from 4.84 microM (in HCT116 (p53(-/-)) cells) to 13.12 microM (in HepG2 cells) for 5 and from 0.02 microM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 microM (in CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. Compound 5 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells through alteration of MMP and increase in ROS production. In addition to apoptosis, ferroptosis was also identified as another mode of cell death induced by epunctanone. CONCLUSIONS: Compounds 1-5 are valuable cytotoxic compounds that could be used to combat MDR cancer cells. Benzophenoe 5 is the most active molecule and deserve more investigations to develop new anticancer drugs.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Benzophenone', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Ferroptosis', 'Multi-drug resistance', 'Phytochemicals']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Epub 2018 Sep 3.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the risk and survival of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) after breast cancer (BC) diagnosis. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 'SEER' database. Females, diagnosed with BC between 1992 and 2014, were selected and followed for the development of CML after a 6-month latency period from BC diagnosis. We used the Multiple Primary Standardized Incidence Ratios session of the SEER*Stat software (version 8.3.4) to calculate the Observed/Expected (O/E) ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). To calculate the overall survival, we performed an unadjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis using the SPSS software. RESULTS: We included 474,866 females with BC, of which 178 were later diagnosed with CML. We found the risk of CML to increase significantly after BC diagnosis (O/E=1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.45) and the risk was specifically higher within the first 5 years of diagnosis (O/E=1.45, 95% CI: 1.16-1.8). When the risk was stratified by cancer stage, localized BC was associated with a significant increase in CML risk within 5 years of diagnosis (O/E=1.4, 95% CI: 1.06-1.82), while regional BC was associated with a significant increase in CML risk after more than 5 years of diagnosis (O/E=1.59, 95% CI: 1.09-2.25). Moreover, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and presence of hormonal receptors were associated with a significant increase in CML risk in BC patients. The median overall survival of CML after BC was 28 months. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer patients have an increased risk of developing CML and further investigation is required to establish the causes of this finding.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Breast cancer', '*Chemotherapy', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Radiotherapy', '*SEER', '*Survival']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 May 29.,"The pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) still remains a cancer with worst prognosis for high recurrence. Massive studies were conducted for the leukemia relapse based on diagnosis and relapse paired samples. However, the initially diagnostic samples may contain the relapse information and mechanism, which were rarely studied. In this study, we collected mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) data from initially diagnosed pediatric T-ALL samples with their relapse or remission status after treatment. Integrated differential co-expression and miRNA-transcription factor (TF)-gene regulatory network analyses were used to reveal the possible relapse mechanisms for pediatric T-ALL. We detected miR-1246/1248 and NOTCH2 served as key nodes in the relapse network, and they combined with TF WT1/SOX4/REL to form regulatory modules that influence the progress of T-ALL. A regulatory loop miR-429-MYCN-MFHAS1 was found potentially associated with the remission of T-ALL. Furthermore, we proved miR-1246/1248 combined with NOTCH2 could promote cell proliferation in the T-ALL cell line by experiments. Meanwhile, analysis based on the miRNA-drug relationships demonstrated that drugs 5-fluorouracil, ascorbate, and trastuzumab targeting miR-1246 could serve as potential supplements for the standard therapy. In conclusion, our findings revealed the potential molecular mechanisms of T-ALL relapse by the combination of co-expression and regulatory network, and they provide preliminary clues for precise treatment of T-ALL patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['T-ALL', 'co-expression', 'drug', 'network', 'relapse']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

Epub 2018 Aug 23.,"The proteins of Bcl-2 family, which are promising anti-cancer-drug targets, have substantial similarity in primary sequence and share homologous domains as well as similar structural folds. In spite of similarities in sequence and structures, the members of its pro- and anti- apoptotic subgroups form complexes with different type of partners with discriminating binding affinities. Understanding the origin of this discrimination is very important for designing ligands that can either selectively target a protein or could be made broad ranged as necessary. Using principal component analysis (PCA) of the available structures and from the analysis of the evolution of the binding pocket residues, the correlation has been investigated considering two important anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xl and Mcl-1, which serve as two ideal representatives of this family. The flexibility of the receptor enables them to discriminate between the ligands or the binding partners. It has been observed that although Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 are classified as homologous proteins, through the course of evolution the binding pocket residues are highly conserved for Bcl-xl; whereas they have been substituted frequently in Mcl-1. The investigation has revealed that the Bcl-xl can adjust the backbone conformation of the binding pocket residues to a larger extent to complement with the shape of different binding partners whereas the Mcl-1 shows more variation in the side chain conformation of binding pocket residues for the same purpose.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-xl', 'Conformational flexibility', 'Ligand binding', 'Mcl-1', 'Principal component analysis']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"BCR-ABL1-independent mechanisms had been thought to mediate drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). The pro-oncogenic anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) mediates drug resistance of cancer cells. In this study, we observed an increased level of AGR2 in TKI-resistant CML cells. Silence of AGR2 in dasatinib-resistant K562 (K562DR) cells led to restored sensitivity to dasatinib both in vitro and in vivo. Exposure to dasatinib induced upregulation of AGR2 in K562 cells, which indicated a probable treatment-related drug resistance. We further investigated the potential interaction between microRNA (miRNA) and AGR2 in K562DR cells and found that downregulation of miR-217 was associated with overexpression of AGR2 in K562DR cells. Luciferase reporter assay identified that miR-217 negatively regulated expression of AGR2 through binding the 3'-untranslated region of AGR2. Hypermethylation of the CpG island on the promoter region of the MIR217 gene is a probable reason for the downregulation of miR-217 in dasatinib-treated K562 cells. Forced expression of miR-217 led to decreased expression of AGR2 as well as compromised TKI-resistant potential of K562DR cells. Similarly, overexpression of miR-217 resensitized K562DR cells to dasatinib treatment in a murine xenograft transplantation model. TKI treatment-induced drug resistance is correlated with a decrease of miR-217 and upregulation of AGR2. The miR-217/AGR2 interaction might be a potential therapeutic target in treating CML patients with TKI resistance.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, ""real-life"" data remain few and the use of ponatinib in this setting and its consequences remain mostly unknown. We report, within a national observational study, the use of ponatinib in unselected CML patients who had previously failed >/=2 lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy (or one line if an Abelson (ABL)(T315I) mutation was identified), in real-life conditions (2013-2014) in a compassionate program. Our analysis has been focused on 48 chronic phase CML patients recorded. With a median follow-up of 26.5 months since ponatinib initiation, the overall survival (OS) rates (80.5% at 3 years) and cumulative incidence of major molecular response (81.8% at 18 months) were similar to those of the phase II study, with no influence of BCR-ABL mutations nor the reason of ponatinib prescription. A specific subanalysis of the preexisting cardiovascular risk factors and events occurring on ponatinib is described. These events occurred after a median time on ponatinib of 5.8 months (excluding hypertension) and were observed in 29/48 patients (47%), even in those already on anti-aggregants/coagulants. The majority were not severe and resolved, but two cases were fatal. Other hematological or nonhematological nonvascular adverse events were similar to those previously described in trials. This observational study reports similar rates of survival, molecular responses, and a slight increase in the cardiovascular toxicity of ponatinib in real-life conditions, prompting improved control of cardiovascular risk factors and selection of patients.",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

In the present study, we investigated the potential of epigenetic modulators EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate) and BIX-01294 (N-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)-6,7-dimethoxy-2-(4-methyl-1,4-diazepan-1-yl)quinazoli n-4-amine) to alter epigenetic state and cause cellular senescence in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia NB4 and K562 cells. We have shown that after leukemia cell treatment with EGCG and BIX-01294 the proliferation and survival were inhibited of both cell lines; however, only NB4 cells underwent apoptosis. Both epigenetic modulators caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase as assessed by RT-qPCR (p53, p21, Rb) and flow cytometry analysis. Increased levels of ATM, HMGA2, phosphorylated ATM, and SA-beta-galactosidase staining indicated that EGCG caused cellular senescence, whereas BIX-01294 did not. Immunoblot analysis of epigenetic players DNMT1, HP1alpha, H3K9me3, EZH2, and SUZ12 demonstrated beneficial epigenetic modulation by both agents with exception of mainly no epigenetic changes caused in K562 cells by EGCG. Therefore, we suggest EGCG as a promising epigenetic modulator for acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy and as a potential cellular senescence inducer in both acute and chronic myeloid leukemia treatment, whereas BIX-01294 could be beneficial as an epigenetic modifier for both myeloid leukemias treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['BIX-01294', 'EGCG', 'Epigenetic regulation', 'Myeloid leukemia', 'Senescence']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"RAS oncogene mutations frequently occur in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the prognostic significance of RAS mutations in AML is inconclusive. We searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane from 1990 to 2018. In this study, 24 eligible studies were included, and the meta-analysis was conducted with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2 software program. The row hazard ratio (HR) was adjusted and re-evaluated when publication bias existed after detecting all the heterogeneities. A combined analysis showed that RAS mutations were not associated with a poor prognosis in general AML patients (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.78-1.19, p=0.70). To further verify the results, a subgroup analysis was conducted. Interestingly, in the analysis of age bracket, children with RAS mutations had an unfavourable survival (HR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.05-1.75, p=0.02) of AML, but the adults did not (HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.70-1.09, p=0.21). Further analysis of the subgroup of children indicated that patients with NRAS mutations had an adverse prognosis (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.13-2.12, p=0.007), but not those with KRAS mutations (HR: 1.51, 95% CI: 0.34-6.73, p=0.59). In conclusion, this study revealed that RAS mutations did not influence the over survival for adults with AML. However, NRAS mutations may be a key prognostic marker related with poor survival for children with AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Children', 'NRAS', 'Prognosis', 'RAS']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Oct 2.,"This study evaluates the role of sequential therapy in HLA-haploidentical transplantation (haplo-HSCT) of high-risk, relapsed/refractory AML/MDS. We analyzed the course of 33 adults with active disease at time of transplantation (AML n = 30; MDS n = 3; median age 58 years, range: 32-71). Sequential therapy consisted of cytoreductive chemotherapy (FLAMSA n = 21; clofarabine n = 12) applied shortly prior to reduced intensity conditioning for T-cell-replete haplo-HSCT using post-transplantation cyclophosphamide as GvHD prophylaxis. No graft rejection was observed. Complete remission at day +30 was achieved in 97% of patients. CI of acute GvHD grade II-IV and chronic GvHD was 24% (no grade IV) and 23%, respectively. NRM at 1 and 3 years was 15%, each. Severe regimen-related toxicities (grade III-IV) were observed in 58%, predominantly involving the gastrointestinal tract (diarrhea 48%, mucositis 15%, transient elevation of transaminases 18%). Probability of relapse at 1 and 3 years was 28% and 35%. At a median follow-up of 36 months, the estimated 1- and 3-year overall survival was 56% and 48%. Disease-free survival was 49% and 40%, respectively. At 3 years, GvHD and relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 24% while chronic GvHD and relapse-free survival (CRFS) was 29%. Thus, our results indicate that sequential haplo-HSCT is an effective salvage treatment providing high anti-leukemic activity, favorable tolerance, and acceptable toxicity in patients suffering from advanced AML/MDS.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-8780-8015'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,"Danon disease (DD) is an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) gene (Xq24). DD is characterized by cognitive deficit, myopathy, and cardiomyopathy in male patients. The phenotype is variable and mitigated in females. The timely identification of de-novo LAMP2 mutated family members, many of whom are heterozygous females, remains critical for their treatment and family counseling. DD laboratory testing builds on minimally invasive quantification of the LAMP2 protein in white blood cells and characterization of the specific mutation. This integrative approach is particularly helpful when assessing suspect female heterozygotes. LAMP2 exon-copy number variations (eCNVs) were so far reported only in X-hemizygous male DD probands. In heterozygous female DD probands, the wild-type allele may hamper the identification of an eCNV even if it results in the complete abolition of LAMP2 transcription and/or translation. To document the likely underappreciated rate of occurrence and point out numerous potential pitfalls of detection of the LAMP2 eCNVs, we present the first two DD heterozygote female probands who harbor novel multi-exon LAMP2 deletions. Critical for counseling and recurrence prediction, we also highlight the need to search for somatic-germinal mosaicism in DD families.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Danon disease', '*X-chromosome', '*exon-copy number variations', '*female heterozygotes', '*flow cytometry', '*lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4104-2023'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether PPI can be used to treat t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells requires further investigation. Here, we determined the inhibitory effects of PPI on t(8;21) AML cells by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and the trypan blue dye exclusion assay. DAPI staining and Wright-Giemsa staining were performed to check for apoptosis. Detection of apoptotic protein and AML1-ETO signaling protein expression were conducted by Western blot analysis. Our results suggested that PPI decreased growth and induced apoptosis in a dosage-dependent manner in the t(8;21) AML cell line Kasumi-1. PPI significantly downregulated AML1-ETO expression in a dosage- and time-dependent manner. PPI also upregulated P21 and downregulated survivin expression by reducing AML1-ETO. Mechanistically, PPI significantly reduced the expression of C-KIT, another therapeutic target for AML with t(8;21), followed by inhibition of Akt signaling. These results suggest that PPI can suppress growth and induce apoptosis of t(8;21) AML by suppressing the AML1-ETO and C-KIT/Akt signaling pathways. Therefore, PPI may be an anticancer therapeutic to treat t(8;21) AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AML1-ETO', 'C-KIT', 'apoptosis', 'cytotoxicity', 'polyphyllin I']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7423-5169'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3-year OS, LFS for all patients was 63.9% and 59.7% respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that grade III-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) was an independent risk factor for treatment related mortality (HR=8.134, 95% CI: 3.210-20.611, P<0.001), monosomy/complex chromosomal karyotype and white blood cell count more than 50x10(9) L(-1) were two independent factors for relapse (HR=1.533, 95% CI: 1.040-2.260, P=0.031) (HR=1.004, 95% CI: 1.001-1.008, P=0.015). Grade III-IV aGVHD was an independent factor for mortality (HR=3.184, 95% CI: 1.718-5.902, P<0.001).

Epub 2018 Sep 8.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia with dismal long-term prognosis with age. The most aggressive subtype of AML is MLL-AML that is characterized by translocations of the mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL) and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Cyclin dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) plays a crucial role in the MLL-driven oncogenic transcription, and hence, inhibiting activity of CDK9 has been proposed as a promising strategy for treatment of AML. We investigated the therapeutic potential of CDKI-73, one of the most potent CDK9 inhibitors, against a panel of AML cell lines and samples derived from 97 patients. CDKI-73 induced cancer cells undergoing apoptosis through transcriptional downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and XIAP by majorly targeting CDK9. Contrastively, it was relatively low toxic to the bone marrow cells of healthy donors. In MV4-11 xenograft mouse models, oral administration of CDKI-73 resulted in a marked inhibition of tumor growth (p < 0.0001) and prolongation of animal life span (P < 0.001) without causing body weight loss and other overt toxicities. The study suggests that CDKI-73 can be developed as a highly efficacious and orally deliverable therapeutic agent for treatment of AML.",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Apoptosis', '*CDK9', '*CDKI-73', '*MLL-AML', '*MV4-11 xenograft']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6225-5525'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new-generation TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, are found to have deeper and faster treatment response rates compared to imatinib in the first-line setting. However, a direct comparison between nilotinib and dasatinib has never been reported previously. Our study aims to compare the outcomes and molecular responses achieved following the first-line use of these two agents in patients with CML-CP. The database of the CML Cooperative Study Group was reviewed and patients with CML in the chronic phase (CP) who were given nilotinib or dasatinib as first-line therapy were identified. Out of 361 patients with CML-CP enrolled in our database, 58 and 63 had been treated with conventional doses of nilotinib (300 mg twice daily) and dasatinib (100 mg once daily), respectively, as first-line therapy. The patient demographics did not show significant differences between the groups. The event-free survival rates did not differ between these two groups. The major molecular response (MMR) and the deep molecular response (DMR) rates by 6, 12, 18, and 24 months did not differ between groups. Among the three scoring systems, only the Hasford score could predict the achievement of DMR, and all of them failed to predict the achievement of MMR in the entire cohort.

To this end we use new Lyapunov functionals and take into account the interconnection between cell populations. Secondly, stability conditions for healthy situation in interconnected model are established by using Nyquist criterion. And thirdly, we design an optimal control based therapy that aims to eradicate cancerous cells and minimize the side effects of the treatment on healthy ones. After showing the existence of an optimal control, this one is determined by using Pontriagyn's principal.

However, the therapeutic efficiency of this enzyme is hampered by its undesirable glutaminase activity. Given the pivotal role of this enzyme against cancer, designing engineered mutants with diminished glutaminase activity would be of great therapeutic interest. To this end, N248S mutation was selected as the potential mutation with beneficial effects. Various in silico analyses including MD simulation, molecular docking and QMMM studies were performed to assess the effects of N248S mutation on the activity of the enzyme. Thereafter, this mutation along with N248A, N248V and N248T mutations as controls were exerted in lASNase gene. The results from in silico analyses and experimental efforts indicated that N248S mutation is associated with the suitable lASNase activity, while the glutaminase activity is disturbed due to impaired interactions. It has been shown that glutamine turnover was affected much more strongly than asparagine hydrolysis. The approach of exploiting in silico tools to design mutated enzymes lead to staggering time and cost reduction. Following this strategy, we have designed a mutant lASNase with diminished glutaminase activity, which could be of interest for improved biomedical applications.",['NOTNLM'],"['Blood cancer', 'In silico', 'Site directed mutagenesis', 'lasparaginase']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Recent studies showed that most of AA cases might be mediated by immune mechanisms. Toxic agent leads to expression of neoantigens or cryptic antigens on the surface of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells with subsequent activation of immune effector cells and induction of stem cell apoptosis. Histopathological findings obtained from bone marrow biopsy are crucial for diagnosis of AA. Hypoplastic MDS, PNH, hairy cell leukemia and late manifestation of congenital cytopenias must be excluded in differential diagnosis. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation from HLA matched related donor or combined immune suppression represent the first line treatment for patients with severe AA (SAA). Transplantation from unrelated donor may be a second line treatment for patients who failed to respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Recent studies showed eltrombopag or its combination with immune supression as an effective therapeutic approach to AA patients. Up to 15 % of AA patients may later develop PNH, MDS or acute leukemia. An influence of disturbed immune mechanisms as well as of immunosuppressive treatment on the development of clonal proliferation is currently discussed.

Prolonged or persistent ZIKV infection of human cells and tissues may serve as a reservoir for the virus and present serious challenges to the safety of public health. Human hematopoietic cell lines with different developmental properties revealed differences in susceptibility and outcomes to ZIKV infection. In three separate studies involving the prototypic MR 766 ZIKV strain and the human monocytic leukemia U937 cell line, ZIKV initially developed only a low-grade infection at a slow rate. After continuous culture for several months, persistently ZIKV-infected cell lines were observed with most, if not all, cells testing positive for ZIKV antigen. The infected cultures produced ZIKV RNA (v-RNA) and infectious ZIKVs persistently (""persistent ZIKVs"") with distinct infectivity and pathogenicity when tested using various kinds of host cells. When the genomes of ZIKVs from the three persistently infected cell lines were compared with the genome of the prototypic MR 766 ZIKV strain, distinct sets of mutations specific to each cell line were found. Significantly, all three ""persistent ZIKVs"" were capable of infecting fresh U937 cells with high efficiency at rapid rates, resulting in the development of a new set of persistently ZIKV-infected U937 cell lines. The genomes of ZIKVs from the new set of persistently ZIKV-infected U937 cell lines were further analyzed for their different mutations. The 2nd generation of persistent ZIKVs continued to possess most of the distinct sets of mutations specific to the respective 1st generation of persistent ZIKVs. We anticipate that the study will contribute to the understanding of the fundamental biology of adaptive mutations and selection during viral persistence. The persistently ZIKV-infected human cell lines that we developed will also be useful to investigate critical molecular pathways of ZIKV persistence and to study drugs or countermeasures against ZIKV infections and transmission.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8892-7465', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9547-2478']",['Dryad/10.5061/dryad.7r7812c'],,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a long-term study of parents of children who were treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we aimed to: 1) describe parents' adjustment (psychological distress, relationship satisfaction; 2) describe the perceived impact of cancer on couples' relationship, and; 3) identify to what extent the perceived impact of cancer on the couple is related to both parents' long-term adjustment. METHODS: Parents of childhood ALL survivors (n = 103 couples) were surveyed as part of a cohort recall (PETALE cohort). Both parents completed questionnaires exploring adjustment (Brief Symptom Inventory-18, Dyadic Adjustment Scale) and perceived impact of cancer on the relationship (Impact of Cancer on the Couple). Mothers' and fathers' scores were compared using MANOVAs. We also examined the degree to which a parent's perceived changes in relationship dynamics following their child's cancer were associated with their own current adjustment (actor effects), and their partner's current adjustment (partner effects) using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). RESULTS: Frequencies of current distress were normative in parents (mothers/fathers): general distress (6.8/7.8%), anxiety (5.8/6.8%), depression (2.9/6.8%), somatization (13.6/9.7%), and relationship distress (21.4/20.4%). Mothers and fathers typically agreed on their reported relationship satisfaction, and the perceived nature of relationship changes following the illness. Dyadic analyses indicated that whereas mothers' adjustment was related to their own perceived relationship changes, fathers' adjustment was primarily related to their partner's perceptions. CONCLUSION: In long-term stable couples, mothers may act as an influential bridge connecting the illness experiences of survivors and fathers. This could explain why mothers' perceptions of relationship changes were related to their partners' long-term adjustment, which was not the case for fathers.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7520-1734'],,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Folate provides methyl groups for DNA methylation, which is dramatically disrupted in ALL. Whether or not maternal folate (and related B-vitamin) intake during pregnancy may affect ALL risk via influencing DNA methylation is investigated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genes in which methylation changes are reported both in response to folate status and in ALL are investigated. Folate-responsive genes (n = 526) are identified from mouse models of maternal folate depletion during pregnancy. Using published data, 2621 genes with persistently altered methylation in ALL are identified. Overall 25 overlapping genes are found, with the same directional methylation change in response to folate depletion and in ALL. Hypermethylation of a subset of genes (ASCL2, KCNA1, SH3GL3, SRD5A2) in ALL is confirmed by measuring 20 patient samples using pyrosequencing. In a nested cohort of cord blood samples (n = 148), SH3GL3 methylation is inversely related to maternal RBC folate concentrations (p = 0.008). Furthermore, ASCL2 methylation is inversely related to infant vitamin B12 levels. (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate proof of concept for a plausible mechanism, i.e., variation in DNA methylation, by which low intake of folate, and related B-vitamins during pregnancy may influence ALL risk.",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*biomarkers', '*folic acid', '*maternal', '*vitamin B12']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

PATIENTS & METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing data were combined with exome-wide association study to identify predicted-functional germline variants associated with high-grade VIPN. Genotyping was then performed for top-ranked signals (n = 237), followed by validation in independent replication group (n = 405). RESULTS: Minor alleles of rs2781377/SYNE2 (p = 0.01) and rs10513762/MRPL47 (p = 0.01) showed increased risk, whereas that of rs3803357/BAHD1 had a protective effect (p = 0.007). Using a genetic model based on weighted genetic risk scores, an additive effect of combining these loci was observed (p = 0.003). The addition of rs1135989/ACTG1 further enhanced model performance (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Variants in SYNE2, MRPL47 and BAHD1 genes are putative new risk factors for VIPN in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adverse drug reactions', '*association study', '*cancer', '*genetics', '*pharmacogenetics', '*polymorphism', '*vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy', '*whole-exome sequencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main aim of this study was to develop PTX-loaded multifunctional nanoparticles and target to leukemia cells. In this study, transferrin-decorated paclitaxel-loaded lipid nanoparticle (TPLN) was prepared with an aim to increase the chemotherapeutic efficacy in the leukemia cells. Results clearly showed the superior targeting potential of TPLN to the HL-60 cancer cells compared to that of the paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles (PLN). To be specific, TPLN showed a significantly higher cytotoxic effect in the cancer cells compared to that of the PLN indicating the superior targeting efficiency of the Tf-decorated nanoparticle system. The IC50 value of TPLN was 0.45 mug/ml compared to 2.8 mug/ml for PLN. TPLN induced a most remarkable apoptosis of the cancer cells and much of the cells were distorted with huge presence of the apoptotic body formation. Importantly, TPLN showed a remarkable reduction in the viable cells proportion to ~ 65% with around ~ 30% apoptosis cells (early and late apoptosis). Overall, results clearly showed the targeting potential of ligand-conjugated lipid nanoparticle system to the leukemia cells that might pave the way for the successful cancer treatment.",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Cancer targeting', 'Leukemia', 'Lipid nanoparticles', 'Paclitaxel', 'Transferrin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was carried out using Mossbauer spectroscopy and magnetization measurements for the analysis of ferritin-like iron in spleen and liver tissues. Magnetization measurements demonstrated small differences in the saturation magnetic moments and revealed additional paramagnetic components. Two liver samples demonstrated unusual behavior of the magnetic moment when the zero-field-cooled curve was over the field-cooled curve in the temperature range between ~40 and ~70 K. Relative iron content variations in the tissue cells as well as small variations in the (57)Fe hyperfine parameters were demonstrated for healthy and patients' spleen and liver tissues on the base of measured Mossbauer spectra.

To define the consequences of mycoplasma infection at the level of protein expression we utilized the reverse phase protein array technology to analyze the expression of 235 proteins in mycoplasma infected, uninfected post treatment, and never-infected leukemic cell lines. Overall, protein profiles of cultured cells remained relatively stable after mycoplasma infection. However, paired comparisons for individual proteins identified that 18.7% of the proteins significantly changed between the infected and the never-infected cell line samples, and that 14.0% of the proteins significantly altered between the infected and the post treatment samples. Six percent of the proteins were affected in the post treatment samples compared to the never-infected samples, and 7.2% compared to treated cells that had never had mycoplasma infection before. Proteins that were significantly altered in the infected cells were enriched for apoptotic signaling processes and auto-phosphorylation, suggesting an increased cellular stress and a decreased growth rate. In conclusion, this study shows that mycoplasma infection of leukemic cell lines alters the proteins expression levels, potentially confounding experimental results. This reinforces the need for regular testing of mycoplasma.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell lines', 'Mycoplasma', 'Proteomics', 'RPPA']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10.1038/s41408-018-0123-2.,"Mutations of the GATA binding protein 2 (GATA2) gene in myeloid malignancies usually cluster in the zinc finger 1 (ZF1) and the ZF2 domains. Mutations in different locations of GATA2 may have distinct impact on clinico-biological features and outcomes in AML patients, but little is known in this aspect. In this study, we explored GATA2 mutations in 693 de novo non-M3 AML patients and identified 44 GATA2 mutations in 43 (6.2%) patients, including 31 in ZF1, 10 in ZF2, and three outside the two domains. Different from GATA2 ZF2 mutations, ZF1 mutations were closely associated with French-American-British (FAB) M1 subtype, CEBPA double mutations (CEBPA(double-mut)), but inversely correlated with FAB M4 subtype, NPM1 mutations, and FLT3-ITD. ZF1-mutated AML patients had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than GATA2-wild patients and ZF2-mutated patients in total cohort as well as in those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics and normal karyotype. ZF1 mutations also predicted better disease-free survival and a trend of better OS in CEBPA(double-mut) patients. Sequential analysis showed GATA2 mutations could be acquired at relapse. In conclusion, GATA2 ZF1 mutations are associated with distinct clinico-biological features and predict better prognosis, different from ZF2 mutations, in AML patients.",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4513-2472', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4174-8766', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1647-8634', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7965-7579']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"PURPOSE: Tisagenlecleucel is an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19) T-cell therapy approved for the treatment of children and young adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the cellular kinetics of tisagenlecleucel, the effect of patient factors, humoral immunogenicity, and manufacturing attributes on its kinetics, and exposure-response analysis for efficacy, safety and pharmacodynamic endpoints in 79 patients across two studies in pediatric B-ALL (ELIANA and ENSIGN). RESULTS: Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction to quantify levels of tisagenlecleucel transgene, responders (N = 62) had approximately 2-fold higher tisagenlecleucel expansion in peripheral blood than nonresponders (N = 8; 74% and 104% higher geometric mean Cmax and AUC0-28d, respectively) with persistence measurable beyond 2 years in responding patients. Cmax increased with occurrence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Tisagenlecleucel continued to expand and persist following tocilizumab, used to manage CRS. Patients with B-cell recovery within 6 months had earlier loss of the transgene compared with patients with sustained clinical response. Clinical responses were seen across the entire dose range evaluated (patients </=50 kg: 0.2 to 5.0 x 10(6)/kg; patients >50 kg: 0.1 to 2.5 x 10(8) CAR-positive viable T cells) with no relationship between dose and safety. Neither preexisting nor treatment-induced antimurine CAR19 antibodies affected the persistence or clinical response.

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"Differential induction therapy of all subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia other than acute promyelocytic leukemia is impeded by the long time required to complete complex and diverse cytogenetic and molecular genetic analyses for risk stratification or targeted treatment decisions. Here, we describe a reliable, rapid and sensitive diagnostic approach that combines karyotyping and mutational screening in a single, integrated, next-generation sequencing assay. Numerical karyotyping was performed by low coverage whole genome sequencing followed by copy number variation analysis using a novel algorithm based on in silico-generated reference karyotypes. Translocations and DNA variants were examined by targeted resequencing of fusion transcripts and mutational hotspot regions using commercially available kits and analysis pipelines. For the identification of FLT3 internal tandem duplications and KMT2A partial tandem duplications, we adapted previously described tools. In a validation cohort including 22 primary patients' samples, 9/9 numerically normal karyotypes were classified correctly and 30/31 (97%) copy number variations reported by classical cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis were uncovered by our next-generation sequencing karyotyping approach. Predesigned fusion and mutation panels were validated exemplarily on leukemia cell lines and a subset of patients' samples and identified all expected genomic alterations. Finally, blinded analysis of eight additional patients' samples using our comprehensive assay accurately reproduced reference results. Therefore, calculated karyotyping by low coverage whole genome sequencing enables fast and reliable detection of numerical chromosomal changes and, in combination with panel-based fusion-and mutation screening, will greatly facilitate implementation of subtype-specific induction therapies in acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"To shed light onto the molecular basis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and to investigate the prognostic role of additional genomic lesions, we analyzed copy number aberrations using the Cytoscan HD Array in 116 newly diagnosed adult patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in four different GIMEMA protocols, all based on a chemotherapy-free induction strategy. This analysis showed that patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia carry an average of 7.8 lesions/case, with deletions outnumbering gains (88% versus 12%). The most common deletions were those targeting IKZF1, PAX5 and CDKN2A/B, which were detected in 84%, 36% and 32% of cases, respectively. Patients carrying simultaneous deletions of IKZF1 plus CDKN2A/B and/or PAX5 had a significantly lower disease-free survival rate (24.9% versus 43.3%; P=0.026). The only IKZF1 isoform affecting prognosis was the dominant negative one (P=0.003). Analysis of copy number aberrations showed that 18% of patients harbored MEF2C deletions, which were of two types, differing in size: the longer deletions were associated with the achievement of a complete molecular remission (P=0.05) and had a favorable impact on disease-free survival (64.3% versus 32.1% at 36 months; P=0.031). These findings retained statistical significance also in multivariate analysis (P=0.057). KRAS deletions, detected in 6% of cases, were associated with the achievement of a complete molecular remission (P=0.009). These results indicate that in adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia a detailed evaluation of additional deletions - including CDKN2A/B, PAX5, IKZF1, MEF2C and KRAS - has prognostic implications and should be incorporated in the design of more personalized treatment strategies.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"Molecular measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment is not established in approximately 60% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients because of the lack of suitable markers for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. To overcome this limitation, we established an error-corrected next-generation sequencing (NGS) MRD approach that can be applied to any somatic gene mutation. The clinical significance of this approach was evaluated in 116 AML patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in complete morphologic remission (CR). Targeted resequencing at the time of diagnosis identified a suitable mutation in 93% of the patients, covering 24 different genes. MRD was measured in CR samples from peripheral blood or bone marrow before alloHCT and identified 12 patients with persistence of an ancestral clone (variant allele frequency [VAF] >5%). The remaining 96 patients formed the final cohort of which 45% were MRD(+) (median VAF, 0.33%; range, 0.016%-4.91%). In competing risk analysis, cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was higher in MRD(+) than in MRD(-) patients (hazard ratio [HR], 5.58; P < .001; 5-year CIR, 66% vs 17%), whereas nonrelapse mortality was not significantly different (HR, 0.60; P = .47). In multivariate analysis, MRD positivity was an independent negative predictor of CIR (HR, 5.68; P < .001), in addition to FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation status at the time of diagnosis, and of overall survival (HR, 3.0; P = .004), in addition to conditioning regimen and TP53 and KRAS mutation status. In conclusion, NGS-based MRD is widely applicable to AML patients, is highly predictive of relapse and survival, and may help refine transplantation and posttransplantation management in AML patients.",,,,,,,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 3.,"BACKGROUND: Pituitary apoplexy (PA) is a life-threatening syndrome. The usage of a dopamine agonist, such as bromocriptine or cabergoline, is considered a predisposing factor for PA, which commonly occurs 1.5 years within commencement. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old female with a >15-year history of cabergoline therapy for pituitary prolactinoma was referred to our department of neurosurgery after complaining of headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and ptosis for 3 days during hospital admission for chemotherapy of chronic myelocytic leukemia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings indicative of PA. As the patient was experiencing thrombocytopenia related to chemotherapy, blood transfusion was preceded, and after a platelet count of 15.0 x 104/muL was confirmed, transnasal neuroendoscopic surgery was performed 5 days from the onset of symptoms. The majority of the prolactinoma was removed, and the prolactinoma in the cavernous sinus was intentionally left. The postoperative course was generally good. The ptosis and diplopia improved, and the blurred vision resolved. CONCLUSIONS: PA related to dopamine agonist therapy can occur in cases of elevated bleeding tendency, even in long-term users, suggesting that attention should be paid in the administration of a dopamine agonist in the patient experiencing thrombocytopenia. Surgical intervention should be performed after the preoperative platelet number and adequate response to transfusion are confirmed, and the aggressive removal of prolactinoma in the cavernous sinus should be avoided to reduce the risk of hemorrhagic complications.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cabergoline', 'Neuroendoscopic surgery', 'Pituitary apoplexy', 'Prolactinoma', 'Thrombocytopenia']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We have generated novel OK-seq, Repli-seq and RNA-seq data to compare the DNA replication and gene expression programs of twelve cancer and non-cancer human cell types. Changes in replication fork directionality (RFD) determined by OK-seq are widespread but more frequent within GC-poor isochores and largely disconnected from transcription changes. Cancer cell RFD profiles cluster with non-cancer cells of similar developmental origin but not with different cancer types. Importantly, recurrent RFD changes are detected in specific tumour progression pathways. Using a model for establishment and early progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), we identify 1027 replication initiation zones (IZs) that progressively change efficiency during long-term expression of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene, being twice more often downregulated than upregulated. Prolonged expression of BCR-ABL1 results in targeting of new IZs and accentuation of previous efficiency changes. Targeted IZs are predominantly located in GC-poor, late replicating gene deserts and frequently silenced in late CML. Prolonged expression of BCR-ABL1 results in massive deletion of GC-poor, late replicating DNA sequences enriched in origin silencing events. We conclude that BCR-ABL1 expression progressively affects replication and stability of GC-poor, late-replicating regions during CML progression.",,,,,,['Nucleic Acids Res. 2018 Nov 2;46(19):10532.

This study evaluated whether circulating miRNAs display differential expression profiles in peripheral blood of CML-Chronic Phase (CML-CP) patients newly diagnosed in comparison with CML-CP treated with imatinib. We obtained peripheral blood samples from CML-CP Ph(+) patients divided among group 1 (untreated newly diagnosed) and group 2 (treated with imatinib).

Although KMT2A rearrangement is the predominant genetic signature in infantile B-ALL, disease course is heterogenous, behaving more aggressively in younger infants. We investigated clinicopathological differences throughout the first year to understand the transition to pediatric B-ALL. In a multi-institutional review involving four medical institutions, 54 cases of infantile B-ALL were identified. Patients were divided into congenital and non-congenital groups with multiple age subgroups. Male predominance was seen in congenital cases compared to female in non-congenital cases. There were decreasing trends of hyperleukocytosis, central nervous system involvement, KMT2A rearrangements, lineage switch, and mortality, versus increasing trends of CD10 expression and non-KMT2A abnormalities. Statistically significant differences emerged at 3 and 9 months, the latter was not previously described. Poor-prognostic risk factors decreased with age, the last trimester of infantile B-ALL essentially merging with pediatric B-ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['* rearrangements', '*B-lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Infantile leukemia', '*congenital leukemia', '*lineage switch']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical study reported that administration of plant could treat or prevent relapse in 12 cancer patients. However, detailed mechanism of the anticancer effects and chemical profiles are not thoroughly studied. The chemical study did show that the acetone extract (MHA) exerted the highest antiproliferative effect on human leukemia MOLT-4 cells and lymphoma SUP-T1 cells in dose-dependent cytotoxicity. We found that the use of MHA increased apoptosis by 4.28%-43.65% and caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by 11.79%-26.93%, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 19.54% and increased calcium ion by 233.83%, as demonstrated by annexin-V/PI, JC-1, H2 DCFDA, and Flou-3 staining assays, respectively.

Epub 2018 Oct 8.,"3',4',7-Trimethoxyflavone (TMF) has been reported to show a potent reversal effect on drug resistance mediated by breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2). In this study, we designed and synthesized five derivatives with either a hydroxy group or a fluorine atom at C-5 and several kinds of capping moiety at the C-7 hydroxy group, on the same 3',4'-dimethoxy-substituted flavone skeleton. We subsequently evaluated the efficacies of these compounds against BCRP-expressing human leukaemia K562/BCRP cells. Reversal of drug resistance was expressed as the concentration of compound causing a twofold reduction in drug sensitivity (RI50 ). Of the synthesized compounds, the reversal effect of 5-hydroxy-3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone (HTMF, RI50 7.2 nm) towards 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) was stronger than that of TMF (RI50 18 nm). Fluoro-substituted 5-fluoro-3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone (FTMF, RI50 25 nm) and monoglycosylated 7-(beta-glucosyloxy)-5-hydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyflavone (GOHDMF, 91 nm) also exhibited reversal effects, whereas the di- and triglycoside derivatives did not. TMF, HTMF and FTMF at 0.01-10 mum upregulated the K562/BCRP cellular accumulation of Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining dye. In addition, western blotting revealed that treatment of K562/BCRP cells with 0.1 mum TMF, HTMF or FTMT suppressed the expression of BCRP. HTMF showed the strongest inhibition of BCRP-mediated efflux and suppression of BCRP expression of the three effective synthesized flavones.",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCRP/ABCG2', '*antitumor agents', '*drug resistance', '*structure-activity relationships', '*substituted flavones']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4416-6435'],,,,,,"['(c) 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The median age was 11 years (range, 5-48). Patients had a median of 4 prior regimens, including blinatumomab in 6 and prior stem-cell transplantation in 10. In total 8 patients had extramedullary (EM) leukemic involvement, and prior to lymphodepletion and CAR 7 had active lesions, a group underrepresented in previous trials. In vivo expansion of CAR T cells was observed in 18 patients. In total 16 patients developed cytokine release syndrome, and 11 patients developed neurotoxicity, with no toxic deaths. All responding patients were referred to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The remission rate was 90%, including resolution of all refractory EM sites. Four responding patients relapsed, 3 who had a PCR-MRD positive remission at 28 days following CAR-T cells and 1 patient 21 months after an MRD-negative response.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding, single-stranded RNA molecules that can mediate the expression of target genes. While miRNAs mean to contribute the developments of normal functions, abnormal expression of miRNAs and regulations on their corresponding targets have often been found in the developments of AML and described in recent years. In leukemia, miRNAs may function as regulatory molecules, acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Overexpression of miRNAs can down-regulate tumor suppressors or other genes involved in cell differentiation, thereby contributing to AML formation. Similarly, miRNAs can down-regulate different proteins with oncogenic activity as tumor suppressors.

Epub 2018 Sep 6.,"Sanguinarine (Sang), a plant-derived compound isolated from the roots of Sanguinaria canadensis was evaluated for its potential pro-apoptotic effects in precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Pre-ALL) cell lines. Treatment of 697, REH, RS4;11, and SupB15 cell lines with Sang exhibited significant inhibition of cell viability via induction of apoptotic cell death. Sang-mediated apoptosis was found to be associated with the increased expression of proapoptotic bax with concomitant decrease of Bcl-2 expression leading to depolarization of mitochondria membrane resulting in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The reduced MMP caused the leakage in mitochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. The cytochrome c then mediates the activation of caspase-cascade and subsequently PARP cleavage. Furthermore, pretreatment with z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, abrogated Sang-induced inhibition of cell viability, induction of apoptosis. Sang treatment also reduced the phosphorylation of AKT and suppressed the expression of a number of anti-apoptotic genes such as cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP. Sang mediates its anti-cancer activity by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to depletion of glutathione level in leukemic cell lines. Pretreatment of these cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) prevented Sang-induced depletion of glutathione level and mitochondrial-caspase-induced apoptosis. Finally, Sang treatment of Pre-ALL cell suppressed colony formation ability of these cells suggesting Sang has an anti-leukemic potential. Altogether, our data suggest that Sang is an efficient inducer of intrinsic apoptotic cell death via generation of ROS and exhibition of anti-leukemic effect in Pre-ALL cells raises the possibility to develop Sang as a therapeutic modality for the treatment and management of Pre-ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*ROS', '*pre-ALL cells', '*sanguinarine', '*signaling']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5526-7496', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1886-6710']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 17.,"Cell competition in the thymus promotes turnover and functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting leukemia. Using thymus transplantation experiments, we have shown that the presence of T lymphocyte precursors, recently seeding the thymus, promotes the clearance of precursors with a longer time of thymus residency. If cell competition is impaired and no cells seed the thymus, the organ is capable of sustaining T lymphocyte production, a state termed thymus autonomy. However, we observed consistently that prolonged autonomy is permissive to the emergence of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). This resembled the onset of T-ALL in patients treated by gene therapy for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID-X1). Following treatment, thymus activity was established, with T lymphocyte production, although no bone marrow contribution was detected. However, some patients developed T-ALL. The favored explanation for malignant transformation was considered to be genotoxicity due to integration of the retroviral vector next to oncogenes, thereby activating them ectopically. Although plausible, we consider an alternative, mutually nonexclusive explanation: that any condition enabling prolonged thymus autonomy will promote leukemogenesis. In support of this view, two independent studies have recently shown that the efficacy of reconstitution of the bone marrow in the context of SCID-X1 dramatically influences the outcome of treatment, and that lymphoid malignancies emerge following transplantation of a small number of healthy progenitors. Here, we discuss the most recent data in light of our own studies in thymopoiesis and the conditions that trigger malignant transformation of thymocytes in various experimental and clinical settings.",['NOTNLM'],"['* SCID', '*T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*T lymphocyte development', '*T-ALL', '*cell competition', '*gene therapy', '*primary immune deficiency', '*thymus autonomy']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2018 The Authors.

In a phase I randomised double-blinded study, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of sodium selenite (SS), Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC) and seleno-l-methionine (SLM) were compared in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and a cohort of patients with solid malignancies. Twenty-four patients received 400 mug of elemental Se as either SS, MSC or SLM for 8 weeks. None of the Se compounds were associated with any significant toxicities, and the total plasma Se AUC of SLM was markedly raised in comparison to MSC and SS. DNA damage assessment revealed negligible genotoxicity, and some minor reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed. At the dose level used, all three Se compounds are well-tolerated and non-genotoxic. Further analyses of the pharmacodynamic effects of Se on healthy and malignant peripheral blood mononuclear cells will inform the future evaluation of higher doses of these Se compounds.

High hyperdiploidy (HH), a rare cytogenetic abnormality seen commonly in elder male AML patients, is normally categorized under AML with complex karyotype (CK). Accordingly, patients with HH generally are associated with low remission rates and a short overall survival. Case presentation: Here we report a case of 21-year-old female, diagnosed with a de novo AML-M1 according to WHO classification and a CK at diagnosis. Cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic approaches (standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), array-proven multicolor banding (aMCB)) and high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analyses revealed a unique complex but still near diploid karyotype involving eleven chromosomes was identified. It included pentasomy 4, three yet unreported chromosomal aberrations t(1;2)(p35;p22), t(1;3)(p36.2;p26.2), and t(10;12)(p15.2;q24.11), and a combination of two cytogenetic events, yet unreported to appear in together, i.e. a reciprocal translocation t(1;3)(p36.2;p26.2) leading to EVI1/PRDM16 gene fusion, and monoallelic loss of tumor suppressor gene TP53. After successful chemotherapeutic treatment the patient experienced a relapse to AML-M1, and she developed secondary AML-M6 with tetraploidy and HH. Unfortunately, the young woman died 8.5 months after initial diagnosis. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, a comparable adult AML associated with such a CK, coexistence of 3q rearrangements with loss of TP53 at diagnosis, and HH in secondary AML were not previously reported. Thus, the combination of the here seen chromosomal aberrations in adult primary AML seems to indicate for an adverse prognosis.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)', 'Complex karyotype', 'High hyperdiploidy', 'Molecular cytogenetics', 'Pentasomy 4', 'Prognostic factors']",,,,,"['Study procedures were reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the', 'Atomic Energy Commission, Damascus, Syria Review Board.

Epub 2018 Jul 9.,"Following the application of inhalational anesthetics, including sevoflurane, patients may suffer from neural injury. The present study was conducted to explore the mechanism involved in Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) treatment of sevoflurane injured hippocampal neurons. Primary hippocampal neurons were isolated from Sprague Dawley embryonic rats. The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to detect cell viability. Furthermore, flow cytometry (FCM) was used to determine cell proliferation and apoptosis rates. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were applied to detect the expression levels of apoptosis-related factors, including activated-Caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X (Bax), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and total ERK1/2. The results showed that LBP promoted cell viability and cell proliferation but inhibited cell apoptosis in neurons injured with 3% sevoflurane, in dose-dependent manners (100, 200 and 400 microg/ml). LBP increased the expression levels of Bcl-2 and p-ERK1/2, and decreased levels of activated-Caspase-3 and Bax in a dose-dependent manner in hippocampal neurons that were injured with sevoflurane. In addition, ERK1/2 inhibitor reversed the above phenomenon in 400 microg/ml LBP and 3% sevoflurane-treated hippocampal neurons. Therefore, the present study indicated that LBP protected hippocampal neurons from sevoflurane injury, including aberrant cell apoptosis, via the ERK1/2 pathway.",['NOTNLM'],"['Lycium barbarum polysaccharides hippocampus neuron', 'apoptosis', 'extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'sevoflurane']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Jul 4.,"The aim of the present study was to determine the expression of adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) gene and its protein P-glycoprotein (PGP) in bone marrow mononuclear cells from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with imatinib mesylate (IM) resistance, or IM-resistant CML K562 cells. In addition, the molecular mechanism of action of microRNA (miR)-214 on ABCB1 in IM resistance was investigated. A total of 26 CML patients with IM resistance were included in the present study. In addition, 31 CML patients who did not have IM resistance were included as the control group. Bone marrow was collected from all subjects. The K562R cell line, which is a K562 cell line with IM resistance, was used for cellular studies. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression of ABCB1 mRNA and miR-214 in cells. Western blotting was employed to determine the expression of PGP. Dual luciferase reporter assay was carried out to identify interactions between ABCB1 mRNA and miR-214. MTT assay was used to determine the survival rate of cells. ABCB1 mRNA and PGP expression was upregulated in bone marrow mononuclear cells from CML patients with IM resistance. K562R cells had higher ABCB1 and PGP expression than K562 cells, potentially due to their different sensitivity to IM. Expression miR-214 was decreased in bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with IM resistance and K562R cells. Notably, miR-214 was able to bind with the 3'-untranslated region, seed region of ABCB1 mRNA to regulate its expression. In addition, elevated expression of miR-214 restored IM sensitivity to K562R cells potentially by affecting ABCB1 expression. The present study demonstrated that upregulated expression of ABCB1 mRNA and PGP in bone marrow mononuclear cells from CML patients with IM resistance may be associated with the downregulation of miR-214. In addition, miR-214 may participate in the IM resistance of CML patients by regulating ABCB1 expression.",['NOTNLM'],"['P-glycoprotein', 'adenosine triphosphate binding cassette subfamily B member 1 gene', 'drug resistance', 'imatinib mesylate', 'microRNA-214']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were positive for cytokeratins CK7 and CK8/18, Napsin A, and thyroid transcription factor-1, specific for a primary poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma. Leukoerythroblastosis in association with cytopenia often indicates a BM infiltration and warrants an early BM biopsy to rule out hematological and solid malignancies, particularly in CLL patients treated with FCR. In our case, a diagnosis of a lung adenocarcinoma was established by BM examination, the only clinically feasible diagnostic modality.",['NOTNLM'],"['Bone marrow', 'Cytopenia', 'Leukoerythroblastosis', 'Lung adenocarcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment induces autophagy that promotes survival and TKI-resistance in leukemic stem cells (LSCs). In clinical studies hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the only clinically approved autophagy inhibitor, does not consistently inhibit autophagy in cancer patients, so more potent autophagy inhibitors are needed. We generated a murine model of CML in which autophagic flux can be measured in bone marrow-located LSCs. In parallel, we use cell division tracing, phenotyping of primary CML cells, and a robust xenotransplantation model of human CML, to investigate the effect of Lys05, a highly potent lysosomotropic agent, and PIK-III, a selective inhibitor of VPS34, on the survival and function of LSCs. We demonstrate that long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs: Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-kit(+)CD48(-)CD150(+)) isolated from leukemic mice have higher basal autophagy levels compared with non-leukemic LT-HSCs and more mature leukemic cells. Additionally, we present that while HCQ is ineffective, Lys05-mediated autophagy inhibition reduces LSCs quiescence and drives myeloid cell expansion. Furthermore, Lys05 and PIK-III reduced the number of primary CML LSCs and target xenografted LSCs when used in combination with TKI treatment, providing a strong rationale for clinical use of second generation autophagy inhibitors as a novel treatment for CML patients with LSC persistence.",,,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5404-475X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1616-132X']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"BACKGROUND: Survival rates are increasing in patients with prostate cancer, and second primary cancers (SPCs) are becoming more common in these patients. However, the etiology and clinical consequences of SPCs are not well-known. We define the impact of family history on SPC and causes of mortality in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A nation-wide cohort study based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database covering 4.4 million men and 80,449 prostate cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 2015. Relative risks (RRs) and cumulative incidence for SPCs and for familial SPC were calculated for prostate cancer patients. RESULTS: SPC was diagnosed in 6,396 men and more than a third of these patients had a first-degree family history of any cancer; the familial risk was 1.37 (95% CI: 1.27-1.40), compared to 1.10 (1.08-1.16), without a family history. Cumulative incidence by the age of 83 years reached 21% for prostate cancer alone, 28% in those with SPC, and 35% in patients with SPC and family history. Family history was associated with the risk of seven specific SPCs, including colorectal, lung, kidney, bladder and skin (both melanoma and squamous cell) cancers, and leukemia. Colorectal and lung cancers were common SPCs, and family history doubled the risk of these SPCs. In patients with SPC, half of all causes of death were due to SPC and only 12.77% were due to prostate cancer. Most deaths in SPC were caused by lung and colorectal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: SPCs were an important cause of death in patients with prostate cancer and family history was an important risk factor for SPCs. Prevention of SPC should be essential when prostate cancer survival rates are being improved and this could start by conducting a thorough assessment of family history at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"The impressive selectivity and efficacy of BH3 mimetics for treating cancer has largely been limited to BCL-2 dependent hematological malignancies. Most solid tumors depend on other anti-apoptotic proteins, including MCL-1, for survival. The recent description of S63845 as the first specific and potent MCL-1 inhibitor represents an important therapeutic advance, since MCL-1 is not targeted by the currently available BH3 mimetics, Navitoclax or Venetoclax, and is commonly associated with chemoresistance. In this study, we confirm a high binding affinity and selectivity of S63845 to induce apoptosis in MCL-1-dependent cancer cell lines. Furthermore, S63845 synergizes with other BH3 mimetics to induce apoptosis in cell lines derived from both hematological and solid tumors. Although the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members in these cell lines interact with a spectrum of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins to regulate apoptosis, these interactions alone do not explain the relative sensitivities of these cell lines to BH3 mimetic-induced apoptosis. These findings necessitated further investigation into the requirement of BH3-only proteins in BH3 mimetic-mediated apoptosis. Concurrent inhibition of BCL-XL and MCL-1 by BH3 mimetics in colorectal HCT116 cells induced apoptosis in a BAX- but not BAK-dependent manner. Remarkably this apoptosis was independent of all known BH3-only proteins. Although BH3-only proteins were required for apoptosis induced as a result of BCL-XL inhibition, this requirement was overcome when both BCL-XL and MCL-1 were inhibited, implicating distinct mechanisms by which different anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members may regulate apoptosis in cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in certain mitochondrial proteins, such as IDH2 have been shown to contribute to leukemogenesis. However, the role of mutations in mitochondrial-encoded Electron Transport Chain (ETC) genes have thus far not been well elucidated in AML. Here, we use TCGA data to characterize mutations in the ETC genes and their association with clinical outcomes in AML. We found that mitochondrial ETC mutations-in Complex I, III, IV and/or V (ATP Synthase)-were present in 8% of patients with AML and were significantly more frequent in older patients. Patients with ETC mutations had worse overall survival than ETC wild type patients (OS: 9.3 vs 20.1 months; p-value: 0.007).

We compared the outcomes of MUD (n2,089) and 1MMUD with antithymocyte globulin [ATG; 1MM-ATG () ; n109] with those of 1MMUD without ATG [1MM-ATG (-) ; n1,115]. In the 1MM-ATG () group, the median total dose of ATG (thymoglobulin) was 2.5 (range, 1.0-11.0) mg/kg. The rates of grade III-IV acute GvHD, non-relapse mortality (NRM), and overall mortality were significantly lower in the MUD group than in the 1MM-ATG (-) group [hazard ratio (HR) 0.77; P0.016; HR, 0.74, P<0.001; and HR, 0.87, P0.020, respectively].

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"Suppression of apoptosis by expression of antiapoptotic BCL2 family members is a hallmark of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). Induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (MCL1), an antiapoptotic BCL2 family member, is commonly upregulated in AML cells and is often a primary mode of resistance to treatment with the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Here, we describe VU661013, a novel, potent, selective MCL1 inhibitor that destabilizes BIM/MCL1 association, leads to apoptosis in AML, and is active in venetoclax-resistant cells and patient-derived xenografts. In addition, VU661013 was safely combined with venetoclax for synergy in murine models of AML. Importantly, BH3 profiling of patient samples and drug-sensitivity testing ex vivo accurately predicted cellular responses to selective inhibitors of MCL1 or BCL2 and showed benefit of the combination. Taken together, these data suggest a strategy of rationally using BCL2 and MCL1 inhibitors in sequence or in combination in AML clinical trials. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting antiapoptotic proteins in AML is a key therapeutic strategy, and MCL1 is a critical antiapoptotic oncoprotein. Armed with novel MCL1 inhibitors and the potent BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax, it may be possible to selectively induce apoptosis by combining or thoughtfully sequencing these inhibitors based on a rational evaluation of AML.See related commentary by Leber et al., p. 1511.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1494.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2664-3541', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3763-5504']",,['Cancer Discov. 2018 Dec;8(12):1511-1514.

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"High expression of VEGFC predicts adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We therefore explored VEGFC-targeting efficacy as an AML therapy using a VEGFC mAb. VEGFC antibody therapy enforced myelocytic differentiation of clonal CD34(+) AML blasts. Treatment of CD34(+) AML blasts with the antibody reduced expansion potential by 30% to 50% and enhanced differentiation via FOXO3A suppression and inhibition of MAPK/ERK proliferative signals. VEGFC antibody therapy also accelerated leukemia cell differentiation in a systemic humanized AML mouse model. Collectively, these results define a regulatory function of VEGFC in CD34(+) AML cell fate decisions via FOXO3A and serve as a new potential differentiation therapy for patients with AML.Significance: These findings reveal VEGFC targeting as a promising new differentiation therapy in AML.

Whereas interleukin-7 (IL-7) is essential for normal T-cell development, it can also accelerate T-ALL development in vivo and leukemia cell survival and proliferation by activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling. Here, we investigated whether STAT5 could also mediate IL-7 T-ALL-promoting effects. We show that IL-7 induces STAT pathway activation in T-ALL cells and that STAT5 inactivation prevents IL-7-mediated T-ALL cell viability, growth, and proliferation. At the molecular level, STAT5 is required for IL-7-induced downregulation of p27(kip1) and upregulation of the transferrin receptor, CD71. Surprisingly, STAT5 inhibition does not significantly affect IL-7-mediated Bcl-2 upregulation, suggesting that, contrary to normal T-cells, STAT5 promotes leukemia cell survival through a Bcl-2-independent mechanism. STAT5 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing reveal a diverse IL-7-driven STAT5-dependent transcriptional program in T-ALL cells, which includes BCL6 inactivation by alternative transcription and upregulation of the oncogenic serine/threonine kinase PIM1 Pharmacological inhibition of PIM1 abrogates IL-7-mediated proliferation on T-ALL cells, indicating that strategies involving the use of PIM kinase small-molecule inhibitors may have therapeutic potential against a majority of leukemias that rely on IL-7 receptor (IL-7R) signaling. Overall, our results demonstrate that STAT5, in part by upregulating PIM1 activity, plays a major role in mediating the leukemia-promoting effects of IL-7/IL-7R.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3660-9646', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6521-7257', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4826-8976']",,,,,,['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) can be difficult to diagnose, especially when morphological changes in blood and marrow cells are minimal, myeloblast proportion is not increased, and the karyotype is normal. The discovery of >40 genes that are recurrently somatically mutated in MDS patients raised hope that molecular genetic testing for these mutations might help clarify the diagnosis in ambiguous cases where patients present with cytopenias and nondiagnostic marrow morphological findings. However, many older healthy individuals also harbor somatic mutations in leukemia-associated driver genes, especially in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1, and detection of common aging-associated mutations in a cytopenic patient can cause diagnostic uncertainty. Despite this potential confounding factor, certain somatic mutation patterns when observed in cytopenic patients confer a high likelihood of disease progression and may allow a provisional diagnosis of MDS even if morphologic dysplasia and other diagnostic criteria are absent. A subset of acquired mutations also influences risk stratification of patients with an established MDS diagnosis and can inform treatment selection. Many unanswered questions remain about the implications of specific mutations, and clinicians also vary widely in their comfort with interpreting sequencing results.

In this open-label, nonrandomized, prospective phase 2 study, patients with MF initially received RUX twice per day continuously in 28-day cycles for the first 3 cycles. Azacitidine (AZA) 25 mg/m(2) (days 1-5) was added starting with cycle 4 and could be subsequently increased to 75 mg/m(2) (days 1-5). Forty-six patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 28 months (range, 4-50+ months). An International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) response was achieved in 33 patients (72%), with a median time to response of 1.8 months (range, 0.7-19.0 months). One-fourth (7 of 33) of the IWG-MRT responses occurred after the addition of AZA. A reduction of >50% in palpable spleen length at 24 weeks and at any time on the study was achieved in 62% and 71% of the evaluable patients, respectively. Among patients who achieved a >50% reduction in spleen length at 24 weeks, 95% had maintained it at 48 weeks. Notably, improvements in bone marrow reticulin fibrosis grade occurred in 57% of the patients at 24 months. Treatment discontinuations as a result of drug-related toxicities occurred in 4 patients (9%), all as a result of cytopenias. New onset grade 3 to 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 35% and 26% of patients, respectively. RUX and AZA were safe, with encouraging spleen response rates and improvement in bone marrow fibrosis in patients with MF.

Previous studies have suggested that Scl is essential for primitive erythropoiesis. However, analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data of early embryos showed that primitive erythroid cells express both Scl and Lyl1 Therefore, to determine whether Lyl1 can function in primitive erythropoiesis, we crossed conditional Scl knockout mice with mice expressing a Cre recombinase under the control of the Epo receptor, active in erythroid progenitors. Embryos with 20% expression of Scl from E9.5 survived to adulthood. However, mice with reduced expression of Scl and absence of Lyl1 (double knockout; DKO) died at E10.5 because of progressive loss of erythropoiesis. Gene expression profiling of DKO yolk sacs revealed loss of Gata1 and many of the known target genes of the SCL-GATA1 complex. ChIP-seq analyses in a human erythroleukemia cell line showed that LYL1 exclusively bound a small subset of SCL targets including GATA1. Together, these data show for the first time that Lyl1 can maintain primitive erythropoiesis.",['NOTNLM'],"['*LYL1', '*Mouse', '*Primitive erythropoiesis', '*SCL (TAL1)', '*Transcription factors']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9497-0996'],,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing or financial interests.'],,['(c) 2018.

This was the beginning of the development of a new type of immunotherapy treatment in cancer patients. Since then, identification of novel antigens expressed in tumor cells and optimization of both CAR constructs and protocols of administration have opened up new avenues for the successful treatment of other hematological malignancies. However, research still continues to avoid some problems such as toxicities associated with the treatment and to find strategies to avoid tumor cell immune evasion mechanisms. On the other hand, for solid tumors, CAR-T therapy results are still in an early phase. In contrast to hematological malignancies, the complex tumor heterogeneity of solid tumors has led to the research of novel and challenging strategies to improve CAR-T cell activity. Here, we will review the main clinical results obtained with CAR-T cells in hematological malignancies, specifically focusing on CAR-T-19 and CAR-T against B-cell maturation antigen (CAR-T-BCMA). Moreover, we will mention the main problems that decrease CAR-T cell activity in solid tumors and the strategies to overcome them.

It suggests that non-high-risk APL patients can be cured without chemotherapy. However, ATRA plus chemotherapy is still the standard therapy for the high-risk patients. Central nervous system (CNS) relapse remains a significant cause of treatment failure in high-risk patients. However, increasing the ATO concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may reduce CNS relapse in high-risk patients. Mannitol can allow ATO to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and reach therapeutically effective levels in the CSF. It is used for the treatment of CNS relapse in patients APL. We compare ATRA-ATO with ATRA-ATO plus chemotherapy in both high-risk and non-high-risk patients with APL. METHODS: This study was designed as a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients with APL were randomly assigned into two groups: the ATRA-ATO group (experimental group) and the ATRA-ATO plus chemotherapy group (control group). The experimental group receives therapy with ATRA-ATO for induction, consolidation and maintenance therapy. In the high-risk patients, mannitol will be used with ATO in the consolidation and maintenance therapy. Hydroxyurea will be used in patients who developed leukocytosis in the induction therapy. The control group receives therapy with ATRA-ATO plus chemotherapy for induction and consolidation therapy. DISCUSSION: In this study, a randomized clinical trial design is described. It aims to compare the efficacy of ATRA-ATO versus ATRA-ATO plus chemotherapy in all-risk patients with APL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trials Registry, ID: ChiCTR-IPR- 15006821 .

When this rearrangement is present, imatinib usually results in complete remission. In rare cases of imatinib resistance, there is poor evidence guiding second-line therapy. We present the case of a 71-year-old male who presented with abdominal discomfort, fevers, and leukocytosis with eosinophilia. The patient was diagnosed with a myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha rearrangement after a bone marrow evaluation revealed hypercellular marrow with eosinophilia and fluorescence in situ hybridization identified the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha rearrangement. The patient was successfully treated with imatinib. Within months he relapsed and converted into acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was then treated with ponatinib which induced and maintained clinical and hematological remission for 2 months. That ponatinib briefly induced remission in our patient with acute myeloid leukemia arising from a myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia and FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha fusion may merit exploration of ponatinib as a potential second-line treatment option for this patient population.

However, we and others have reported that PRMT5 is essential for normal physiology. This dependence may become dose limiting in a therapeutic setting, warranting the search for combinatorial approaches. Here, we report that PRMT5 depletion or inhibition impairs homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, leading to DNA-damage accumulation, p53 activation, cell-cycle arrest, and cell death. PRMT5 symmetrically dimethylates histone and non-histone substrates, including several components of the RNA splicing machinery. We find that PRMT5 depletion or inhibition induces aberrant splicing of the multifunctional histone-modifying and DNA-repair factor TIP60/KAT5, which selectively affects its lysine acetyltransferase activity and leads to impaired HR. As HR deficiency sensitizes cells to PARP inhibitors, we demonstrate here that PRMT5 and PARP inhibitors have synergistic effects on acute myeloid leukemia cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['*53BP1', '*DNA damage and repair', '*PARP inhibitor', '*PRMT5', '*PRMT5 inhibitor', '*Tip60/KAT5', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*alternative splicing', '*hematopoiesis', '*histone post-translational modifications acetylation', '*homologous recombination', '*methylation']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

Objective: To describe mortality by orphan diseases and to analyze its trends in Colombia from 2008 to 2013. Materials and methods: We conducted a descriptive study to analyze mortality rate trends from the death certificates between 2008 and 2013. We calculated specific mortality rates and adjusted by age and sex. Results: Seven thousand one hundred and thirty five deaths were attributed to orphan diseases, and 51.4 % of them occurred among men of all ages. The mean mortality rate during the study period was 2.53 deaths per 100,000 people. Overall, the trend showed an increasing pattern of mortality although very heterogeneous across the country. Mortality rates were higher in Bogota (20), and the Andes and the Caribbean regions (5.3 and 3.7 deaths per 100,000 population). The five most important causes of mortality among men were: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, muscular dystrophy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia originating in the perinatal period, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and gastroschisis, and among women: multiple sclerosis, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, gastroschisis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia originating in the perinatal period, Guillain-Barre syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. The mean mortality rate by acute lymphoblastic leukemia was 0.17 deaths per 100,000 men younger than 15 years and that of multiple sclerosis was 0.16 in women over 40 years of age. Conclusion: The causes of death showed a similar pattern in both sexes. However, the burden of mortality was higher among men of all ages in Bogota.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Mortality registries', '*rare diseases', '*leukemia', '*lymphoid', '*multiple sclerosis', '*public health', '*Colombia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS : A decision-tree model was built using Life Years Gained as a measure of effectiveness. Costs were estimated considering the perspective of the Colombian health system. Stratification costs included treatment costs based on said stratification. Drug prices were taken from SISMED (Drug Price Information System) 2008 and the monetary value of the procedures was extracted from the ISS 2001 rate manual, plus 30%. All costs were expressed in Colombian pesos for 2010 and the gross domestic product per capita of the same year was used as a cost-effective threshold. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes were performed. RESULTS : Risk stratification tests have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of COP 8,559,944.

It is well known that many tumors recruit monocytes from circulation and influence their differentiation, mainly into suppressive M2-like subsets. Since there are contradictory data concerning the importance of macrophages for colon cancer progression, we used in our experiments four colon cancer cell lines representing different stages of tumor development (HT29, LS180, SW948, SW620). An acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was used as a human model of monocytes. Our work revealed that conditioned medium from the tumor cell lines induced activation and differentiation of THP-1 cells. The changes involved increased expression of CD68, a macrophage differentiation marker. Moreover, we also observed increased expression of CD206 and CD163, which are widely considered as markers of tumor-associated macrophages. The tumor-derived conditioned medium decreased the proliferation of THP-1 cells and blocked their cell cycle at the G1 stage. The tumor-conditioned medium also upregulated the production of several cytokines and chemokines characteristic of both M1 and M2 subsets and induced the expression of important pro-angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in THP-1 cells. Moreover, the tumor-conditioned medium induced the expression of galectin-3, which is implicated in malignant transformation, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, that is, a key enzyme of the kynurenine pathway. Our data suggest that tumor cells can actively influence the phenotype of monocytes and switch their differentiation into a population of non-adherent mixed M1 and M2 cells. These preliminary studies suggest that colon cancer cells produce soluble factors that influence monocyte differentiation, most probably into suppressive subsets. These data provide a better understanding of the influence of colon cancer on polarization of monocytes.",['NOTNLM'],"['CD206', 'Colon cancer', 'THP-1', 'galectins', 'matrix metalloproteinase-9', 'tumor-associated macrophages', 'vascular endothelial growth factor']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0512-5155'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 2.,"Few treatment options are available for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. DCLL9718A is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets C-type lectin-like molecule-1 (CLL-1). This receptor is prevalent on monocytes, neutrophils, and AML blast cells, and unlike CD33, is not expressed on hematopoietic stem cells, thus providing possible hematopoietic recovery. DCLL9718A comprises an anti-CLL-1 IgG1 antibody (MCLL0517A) linked to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer payload, via a cleavable disulfide-labile linker. Here, we characterize the in vitro and in vivo stability, the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of DCLL9718A and MCLL0517A in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys. Three key PK analytes were measured in these studies: total antibody, antibody-conjugated PBD dimer and unconjugated PBD dimer. In vitro, DCLL9718A, was stable with most (> 80%) of the PBD dimer payload remaining conjugated to the antibody over 96 hours. This was recapitulated in vivo with antibody-conjugated PBD dimer clearance estimates similar to DCLL9718A total antibody clearance. Both DCLL9718A and MCLL0517A showed linear PK in the non-binding rodent species, and non-linear PK in cynomolgus monkeys, a binding species. The PK data indicated minimal impact of conjugation on the disposition of DCLL9718A total antibody. Finally, in cynomolgus monkey, MCLL0517A showed target engagement at all doses tested (0.5 and 20 mg/kg) as measured by receptor occupancy, and DCLL9718A (at doses of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) showed strong PD activity as evidenced by notable reduction in monocytes and neutrophils.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibody-drug conjugate', '*CLL-1', '*PBD dimer', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*pharmacokinetics', '*receptor occupancy']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2116-4277', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2614-9375', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8309-8490', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4120-7828', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9118-1086', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4572-462X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3751-7225', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3289-6502']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"Targeting the early steps of the glycolysis pathway in cancers is a well-established therapeutic strategy; however, the doses required to elicit a therapeutic effect on the cancer can be toxic to the patient. Consequently, numerous preclinical and clinical studies have combined glycolytic blockade with other therapies. However, most of these other therapies do not specifically target cancer cells, and thus adversely affect normal tissue. Here we first show that a diverse number of cancer models - spontaneous, patient-derived xenografted tumor samples, and xenografted human cancer cells - can be efficiently targeted by 2-deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG), a well-known glycolytic inhibitor. Next, we tested the cancer-cell specificity of a therapeutic compound using the MEC1 cell line, a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell line that expresses activation induced cytidine deaminase (AID). We show that MEC1 cells, are susceptible to 4,4'-Diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid (DIDS), a specific RAD51 inhibitor. We then combine 2DG and DIDS, each at a lower dose and demonstrate that this combination is more efficacious than fludarabine, the current standard- of- care treatment for CLL. This suggests that the therapeutic blockade of glycolysis together with the therapeutic inhibition of RAD51-dependent homologous recombination can be a potentially beneficial combination for targeting AID positive cancer cells with minimal adverse effects on normal tissue. Implications: Combination therapy targeting glycolysis and specific RAD51 function shows increased efficacy as compared to standard of care treatments in leukemias.",['NOTNLM'],"['*AID', '*RAD51', '*cancer', '*glycolysis', '*xenograft']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7937-232X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"PURPOSE: Intensity of end-of-life care receives much attention in oncology because of concerns that high-intensity care is inconsistent with patient goals, leads to worse caregiver outcomes, and is expensive. Little is known about such care in those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), a population at high risk for morbidity and mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based analysis of patients who died between 2000 and 2013, within 1 year of undergoing an inpatient allogeneic HCT using California administrative data. Previously validated markers of intensity were examined and included: hospital death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation at end of life. Multivariable logistic regression models determined clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with: hospital death, a medically intense intervention (ICU admission, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hemodialysis, intubation), and >/= two intensity markers. RESULTS: Of the 2,135 patients in the study population, 377 were pediatric patients (age </= 21 years), 461 were young adults (age 22 to 39 years), and 1,297 were adults (age >/= 40 years). The most common intensity markers were: hospital death (83%), ICU admission (49%), and intubation (45%). Medical intensity varied according to age, underlying diagnosis, and presence of comorbidities at time of HCT. Patients with higher-intensity end-of-life care included patients age 15 to 21 years and 30 to 59 years, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and those with comorbidities at time of HCT. CONCLUSION: Patients dying within 1 year of inpatient allogeneic HCT are receiving medically intense end-of-life care with variations related to age, underlying diagnosis, and presence of comorbidities at time of HCT. Future studies need to determine if these patterns are consistent with patient and family goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 14.,"INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have clearly demonstrated that there is an altered cancer risk profile in patients with systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) versus the general population. This includes a higher risk of certain cancers (e.g. hematologic, lung) and a decreased risk of others (e.g. breast cancer). Several determinants could be behind this altered risk; these include immunosuppressant drugs, viral exposures, genetic factors, and other variables. Area covered: We review what is known regarding specific risk profiles and risk factors for some key cancers in SLE, including hematologic malignancies and lung cancers. In light of this, we examine current guidelines and practices regarding cancer screening, and propose ways that patients and physicians might help manage cancer risk in SLE. Expert commentary: Despite significant progress over the past decade, not many risk factors have been precisely identified. A better understanding of the elements that drive malignancy risk in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases may permit the further development of guidelines (regarding. cancer screening) for SLE patients.

The proximity of the genetic regions is considered important for genetic exchange, and interphase molecular cytogenetic methods can be employed to measure the same. The interphase genomic location of gene pairs taking part in translocations which are non-randomly associated with leukemia subtypes was studied for the extent of proximity by measuring relative distance and radial location. The FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) signals corresponding to gene pairs were scored for relative distance and percentage of possible translocation pairs showing proximity which was found higher for BCR-ABL, PML-RARA and AML-ETO. The radial position of the gene pairs was also recorded to see if there is any preferred location in terms of nuclear centre or periphery for translocation partners. The results suggested no preferential location of any of the gene pairs in periphery or centre of the interphase nucleus, rather random distribution was observed for all the three cases. We report here the use of simple interphase FISH method to assess the interphase proximity of gene fusion pairs which can be further employed for other translocations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,"BACKGROUND: Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is defined as AML that develops after exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. There is a paucity of available literature, particularly in regard to t-AML following childhood cancer. Our aim was to describe the risk of t-AML among children treated for other cancers and their subsequent survival. PROCEDURE: We utilized data from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry to examine all childhood patients (<15 years at diagnosis) treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for cancers other than AML who received a subsequent diagnosis of AML between 1983 and 2014. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to approximate the relative risk of being diagnosed with AML compared to the general population. Estimates of 5-year observed survival were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method, with differences determined by the log-rank test. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 11,753 patients in the study cohort (0.5%) were diagnosed with t-AML, an almost 50-fold higher risk than expected (SIR = 45.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 35.3-59.0). Five-year observed survival from the date of t-AML diagnosis was 31.2% (95% CI = 19.6-43.5%). A significant survival advantage was found for patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following diagnosis of t-AML, with a 5-year survival of 52.4% (29.7-70.9%) compared to 5.7% (0.4-22.6%) for those who did not have HSCT (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although rare, t-AML is an important potential late effect of childhood cancer therapy. Prognosis is generally poor, with HSCT offering some survival benefit.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Australia', '*population-based', '*relative risk', '*survival', '*therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2721-9083', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8062-1779']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Osteonecrosis (ON) is a serious disabling complication in treated ALL patients. The aim of the study was to define the frequency of ON identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to study the risk factors for ON. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The frequency of ON was evaluated retrospectively in 858 patients with ALL who were diagnosed at Children's Cancer Hospital of Egypt from January 2009 to December 2012. Patients were treated with St Jude Total Therapy Study XV. RESULTS: Of 858 patients evaluated, 665 were eligible for the study and 65 (9.7%) developed ON. The cumulative 5-year incidence of ON was 11.96% (SE, 0.131%). Of 154 patients aged 10 years and older, 40 (26%) developed ON. The mean age of patients with ON was 10.7 years. The prognostic factors with a significant relationship with ON were age 10 years and older (P = 0.0001) and intermediate-/high-risk group (P = 0.0001). However, gender did not have a significant relationship. At the onset of ON, the mean cumulative dexamethasone dose was 796 mg/m(2) , and the mean total corticosteroid dose, calculated as prednisolone equivalence, was 6,431 mg/m(2) . Out of 43 patients who developed ON while on corticosteroid therapy, 36 (84%) required dexamethasone dose modification and/or discontinuation. CONCLUSION: The frequency of ON among the studied patients was 9.7%.

Epub 2018 Sep 5.,AIM: We investigated whether DNA methylation regulates expression of LPL and PI3K complex genes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and evaluated the prognostic significance of LPL promoter methylation in CLL patients. Patients & methods: Methylation of LPL promoter was assessed in 112 patients using methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting (MS-HRM). RESULTS: Patients with a fully or heterogeneously methylated LPL promoter had significantly longer median time to treatment (p < 0.001) and 75% lower (hazard ratio: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.15-0.42; p < 0.001) risk of requirement for treatment as opposed to patients with nonmethylated promoter. Multivariate modeling confirmed independent prognostic value of these findings. CONCLUSION: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with a fully or heterogeneously methylated LPL gene promoter display indolent disease course and acquisition of heterogeneous methylation of LPL promoter is insufficient to induce gene expression.,['NOTNLM'],"['*CLL', '*MS-HRM', '*biomarker', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*heterogeneous methylation', '*treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses were carried out on restricted cohorts (CMML = 84, CLL = 186), excluding patients with a prior history of CVD, as well as on unrestricted cohorts. In the restricted cohorts, a significant effect of cardiovascular event occurrence did not remain after adjustment (HR 2.49, 95% CI 0.94-6.60).

KIF20A plays a critical role in the development of several cancers, but its role in blood cells and hematological malignancies have not been studied. In the present study, we focused on the role of KIF20A in hematopoietic cells and possible involvement in myeloid neoplasms. We found that human leukemia cell lines and normal bone marrow CD34-positive cells stimulated by growth factors, but not mature peripheral blood cells, exhibit high KIF20A expression. We further found that HL60 cells, which originally express a large amount of KIF20A, showed decreased KIF20A expression in parallel with both neutrophil-like and macrophage-like differentiation-induction. KIF20A-knockdown using a lentivirus shRNA transfection system led to partial cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and frequent appearance of multinucleated cells. Treatment with a KIF20A-selective inhibitor, paprotrain enhanced the multinuclearity of KIF20A-knockdown cell clones and suppressed growth. The present study contributes to our understanding of the role of KIF20A in blood cells and leukemia cells in particular.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell cycle arrest', 'Cell differentiation', 'Hematopoietic organ', 'Kinesin-like family member', 'Multinuclearity']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0812-9816'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTX-induced neurotoxicity occasionally manifests with a stroke-like presentation that is difficult to distinguish from genuine stroke. We retrospectively reviewed records of nine patients with leukemia or lymphoma and episodes of stroke-like presentation at our institute between 2010 and 2015 for whom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were available. Coagulation test results were compared between the two diagnostic groups. Four patients were diagnosed with MTX-induced stroke-like neurotoxicity. The first neurological event occurred 10-13 days after the fourth or later IT-MTX treatment. All four patients had hemiparalysis, two exhibited disturbed consciousness and three presented with speech disorders. Fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) and D-dimer values were within normal ranges. MRI revealed bilateral lesions with restricted diffusion in all four cases. Neurological symptoms fluctuated and resolved within 5 days, and IT-MTX was subsequently re-initiated in all four cases. One patient developed transient hemiparalysis after a subsequent IT-MTX treatment, but this did not recur thereafter. Bilateral lesions on MRI and normal coagulation are indicative of MTX-induced stroke-like neurotoxicity. Continuation of IT-MTX after these events is generally feasible, but adverse event risk should be carefully weighed against anti-tumor benefits.",['NOTNLM'],"['Leukoencephalopathy', 'Methotrexate', 'Neurotoxicity']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0868-5289'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study the platform was applied on cancer cells from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia resulting in discovery of antibodies with improved cytotoxicity in vitro compared to the standard of care, the CD20-specific monoclonal antibody rituximab. Isolated antibodies were found to target six different receptors on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia cells; CD21, CD23, CD32, CD72, CD200, and HLA-DR of which CD32, CD200, and HLA-DR appeared as the most potent targets for antibody-based cytotoxicity treatment.

Patient was on treatment for the CML but never had hematological remission. Patient saw an ophthalmologist who told her that she has bilateral optic disc swelling and advised her to get an MRI of the brain. She came to the ER due to worsening headache and blurry vision. The funduscopic examination showed significant bilateral papilledema. Laboratory evaluation revealed a leukocytosis of 240 x 103/uL with platelet count of 1,202 x 103. The white cell differential count showed 17% blasts along with myelocytes and meta-myelocytes. MRI of brain revealed non-specific CSF flair signal. Lumbar puncture (LP) showed significantly elevated opening pressures. The CSF composition was however normal. The patient felt much relief of her symptoms following the LP. The papilledema was thought to be due to benign intracranial hypertension (ICH), which was attributed to poor CSF absorption due to resistance to flow of CSF caused by the high WBC count. She received 2 cycles of leukopheresis which dropped her WBC count. She was also started on acetazolamide for the benign ICH and her symptoms improved considerably. Patients with CML can thus present with symptoms mimicking CNS involvement of the disease such as headaches and blurry vision, but that could be attributed to the poor CSF resorption given the leukocytosis rather than spread of the disease itself.",['NOTNLM'],"['Intracranial hypertension', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'papilledema']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, working together with adapter protein CIN85, controls the degradation of protein kinases involved in BCR signaling. To investigate cell homeostasis in CLL, we studied c-Cbl since in normal B cells it is involved in the ubiquitin-dependent Lyn degradation and in the down-regulation of BCR signaling. We found that c-Cbl is overexpressed and not ubiquitinated after BCR engagement. We observed that c-Cbl did not associate to CIN85 in CLL with respect to normal B cells at steady state, nor following BCR engagement. c-Cbl association to Lyn was not detectable in CLL after BCR stimulation, as it happens in normal B cells. In some CLL patients, c-Cbl is constitutively phosphorylated at Y731 and in the same subjects, it associated to regulatory subunit p85 of PI3K. Moreover, c-Cbl is constitutive associated to Cortactin in those CLL patients presenting Cortactin overexpression and bad prognosis. These results support the hypothesis that c-Cbl, rather than E3 ligase activity, could have an adaptor function in turn influencing cell homeostasis in CLL.",['NOTNLM'],"['CIN85', 'Lyn', 'PI3Kp85', 'cortactin']",,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: The study included 463 patients diagnosed with HMs multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), non-HL (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia, between January 2014 and June 2015. The patients were followed for 1 year after inclusion, to record the infectious complications. The collected data included age, sex, type of chemotherapy regimen, and several blood tests at admission. All patients received prophylactic treatment with antibiotics and antifungal agents. For each infection, we recorded the microbiological diagnosis and the day of occurrence since HMs diagnosis. Results: In patients with MM, we found that the treatment with growth factors (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2; confidence interval [CI] 95%: 1-4.6; P = 0.03) was associated with a higher chance of infectious complications. In patients with non-Hodgkin lymhoma (LNH), the following drugs were associated with a higher infectious incidence: cytarabine (HR: 2.3; CI 95%: 1-5; P = 0.03), methotrexate (HR: 2.1; CI 95%: 1.8-4; P = 0.01), dexamethasone (HR: 1.7; CI 95%: 0.9-3; P = 0.06), growth factors (HR: 1.7; CI 95%: 0.9-3.2; P = 0.001), and etoposide (HR: 2.5; CI 95%: 1.5-4.2; P = 0.002). Cytarabine (induction) (HR: 2; CI 95%: 1.1-3.7; P = 0.01), cytarabine (consolidation) (HR: 2.1; CI 95%: 1.3-3.5; P = 0.01), and growth factors (HR: 2.1; CI 95%: 1.3-3.5; P = 0.002) were often on the therapeutic plan of patients with AML, which developed infections.

Indeed, many researchers have reported lncRNA mediated-competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) could regulate the progression of solid tumors. However, the roles of ceRNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in pediatric and adolescent AML, were not completely expounded. Materials and methods: 27 cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) patients under 18 years old with corresponding clinical data were selected from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA), which was a large sample sequencing database of RNA sequencing. We constructed a survival specific ceRNA network, and investigated its associations with patients' clinical information by analyzing the data from TCGA. Results: We identified survival specific lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs, and constructed a survival specific ceRNA network of CN-AML patients and a weighted correlation network. Furthermore, we identified 4 biological pathways associated with OS and selected the most enriched pathway 'Transcriptional misregulation in cancer' to verify that it could accurately predict younger CN-AML patients' prognosis to guide treatment. Conclusions: We successfully constructed a survival specific ceRNA network which could provide a new approach to lncRNA research in younger CN-AML. Importantly, we constructed a weighted correlation network to overcome the difficulty in biological interpretation of individual genes.",['NOTNLM'],"['Biological pathways', 'CN-AML', 'LncRNA', 'Pediatric and adolescent', 'Prognosis', 'WGCNA', 'ceRNA network']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2815-4568'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One emerging therapeutic, the chimeric-antigen receptor T-cell adoptive immunotherapy (CAR-T) is showing remarkable efficacy in the treatment of several B-cell malignancies. The popularity of CAR-T has been founded on two CAR T-cell products recently approved by FDA (during 2017) in the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell lymphoma. However, their toxicities observed in clinical trials were extremely significant and in some cases even fatal with no approved algorithms for toxicity prediction being available to date. A deeper understanding of the biological basis of such complications is the key to prompt and comprehensive clinical management. Here we review the wide spectrum of effects associated with CAR T cell therapy with a major focus on the pathogenesis of cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity as the most common, potentially life-threatening effects of this treatment. We discuss the basis of clinical management and the existing models that predict the severity of toxicity, as well as the key factors that modulate this event. Finally, we will summarize the literature detailing universal allogenic CAR T-cells and their toxicity profile.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2961-0032', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9428-5972']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,"Mature B-cell neoplasms and immature or precursor B-cell neoplasms need to be distinguished because these patients usually require different therapeutic approaches. B-cell neoplasms that express TdT without unequivocal other features of immaturity may therefore present a diagnostic challenge. We describe 13 patients with TdT-positive aggressive B-cell lymphoma. The clinicopathologic features of these patients were highly heterogeneous, but for the purpose of this study we grouped these cases as follows: (1) de novo high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 rearrangements (double-hit or triple-hit lymphoma) with TdT expression. In this group we included two cases of de novo composite lymphoma in which there were components of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and TdT-positive blastic B-cell lymphoma; (2) TdT-positive aggressive B-cell lymphoma arising in patients who previously had follicular lymphoma; (3) initial relapse of TdT-negative aggressive B-cell lymphoma in patients who previously had follicular lymphoma, followed by relapses in which the neoplasm acquired TdT expression; and (4) mature B-cell lymphomas that acquired TdT expression at relapse. This group included one case of EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and one case of pleomorphic variant mantle cell lymphoma. All patients in this study had an aggressive clinical course and a dismal outcome despite appropriate therapy. Rather than ""squeezing"" these cases into current World Health Organization classification categories, we suggest the use of a descriptive term such as high-grade B-cell lymphoma with TdT expression.

The activating BRAF(V600E) mutation is one well-characterized oncogenic mutation that has been described and targeted with clinical success in various malignancies, including melanoma and hairy cell leukemia. Although BRAF-directed treatments have yielded clinical benefit in a subset of tumor types, such as melanoma, thyroid cancer, and lung cancer, BRAF inhibition fails to confer a clinical benefit in colon cancer. Identification of patients for whom BRAF inhibition may produce clinically meaningful outcomes is imperative. The incidence of BRAF mutations in neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is estimated to be 5% to 10%. A recent case series demonstrated benefit in targeting the BRAF(V600E) mutation in metastatic high-grade rectal NECs. Combination BRAF and MEK inhibition is known to yield improved outcomes compared with BRAF inhibition alone in melanoma. This report presents 2 patients with high-grade colorectal NECs who had different responses to treatment with combined BRAF/MEK inhibition after experiencing disease progression through first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. One patient experienced an excellent initial response to therapy before ultimately experiencing progression, and in the other patient initially had stable disease before eventually experiencing progression. These cases highlight the complicated role BRAF mutations play in gastrointestinal NECs, and the need for further research to identify not only patients who may benefit from BRAF-directed therapies but also strategies to avoid development of resistance.",,,,"['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01713972', 'ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01885195']",,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,"PURPOSE: Recurrent internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are observed in various cancers including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where ITD mutations in tyrosine kinase receptor FLT3 are associated with poor prognostic outcomes. Several FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) are in clinical trials for high-risk FLT3-ITD-positive AML. However, the variability of survival following FLT3i treatment suggests that the mere presence of FLT3-ITD mutations might not guarantee effective clinical response. Motivated by the heterogeneity of FLT3-ITD mutations, we investigated the effects of FLT3-ITD structural features on the response of AML patients to treatment.Experimental Design: We developed the HeatITup (HEAT diffusion for Internal Tandem dUPlication) algorithm to identify and quantitate ITD structural features including nucleotide composition. Using HeatITup, we studied the impact of ITD structural features on the clinical response to FLT3i and induction chemotherapy in FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. RESULTS: HeatITup accurately identifies and classifies ITDs into newly defined categories of ""typical"" or ""atypical"" based on their nucleotide composition. A typical ITD's insert sequence completely matches the wild-type FLT3, whereas an atypical ITD's insert contains nucleotides exogenous to the wild-type FLT3. Our analysis shows marked divergence between typical and atypical ITD mutation features. Furthermore, our data suggest that AML patients carrying typical FLT3-ITDs benefited significantly more from both FLT3i and induction chemotherapy treatments than patients with atypical FLT3-ITDs. CONCLUSIONS: These results underscore the importance of structural discernment of complex somatic mutations such as ITDs in progressing toward personalized treatment of AML patients, and enable researchers and clinicians to unravel ITD complexity using the provided software.See related commentary by Gallipoli and Huntly, p. 460.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-7931-2175'],,['Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jan 15;25(2):460-462.

Thus far, results in patients with advanced solid tumors have proven disappointing. Constitutive tonic signaling in the absence of ligand is an increasingly recognized complication when deploying these synthetic fusion receptors and can be a cause of poor antitumor efficacy, impaired survival, and reduced persistence in vivo In parallel, ligand-dependent tonic signaling can mediate toxicity and promote T-cell anergy, exhaustion, and activation-induced cell death. Here, we review the mechanisms underpinning CAR tonic signaling and highlight the wide variety of effects that can emerge after making subtle structural changes or altering the methodology of CAR transduction. We highlight strategies to prevent unconstrained tonic signaling and address its deleterious consequences. We also frame this phenomenon in the context of endogenous TCR tonic signaling, which has been shown to regulate peripheral tolerance, facilitate the targeting of foreign antigens, and suggest opportunities to coopt ligand-dependent CAR tonic signaling to facilitate in vivo persistence and efficacy.

For retroviruses, the Gag polyprotein is the key driver for virus particle assembly. In order to produce progeny virus, once Gag is translated, it must translocate from the location in the cytoplasm where it is synthesized to the plasma membrane and form an oligomeric lattice that results in Gag puncta. The biogenesis of mature Gag puncta can trigger the budding process, resulting in virus particle production. While some aspects of the dynamics of Gag oligomerization and particle biogenesis have been observed with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the process of Gag punctum biogenesis remains poorly understood, particularly for other retroviruses. Here, we have conducted the most detailed studies thus far on Gag punctum biogenesis for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Using mEos2 photoconvertible fluorescent proteins and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF), we have found that HTLV-1 Gag was recruited to Gag puncta primarily from the plasma membrane. This was in stark contrast to HIV-1 Gag, which was recruited from the cytoplasm. These observations imply fundamental differences among retroviruses regarding the orchestration of Gag punctum biogenesis, which has important general implications for enveloped virus particle assembly.IMPORTANCE This report describes the results of experiments examining the pathway by which the human retroviral Gag protein is recruited to sites along the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where Gag punctum biogenesis occurs. In particular, clever and sensitive experimental methods were devised to image in living cells fluorescently labeled Gag protein derivatives from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) at the plasma membrane. The photoconvertible fluorescent protein mEos2 was strategically utilized, as the fluorescence emission of Gag at the plasma membrane could be differentiated from that of cytosolic Gag. This experimental strategy allowed for the determination of the Gag recruitment pathway into Gag puncta. For HTLV-1 Gag, puncta recruited Gag primarily from the plasma membrane, while HIV-1 Gag was recruited from the cytoplasm. These observations represent the first report of HTLV-1 particle biogenesis and its contrast to that of HIV-1. The observed differences in the Gag recruitment pathways used by HTLV-1 and HIV-1 Gag provide key information that is useful for informing the discovery of novel targets for antiretroviral therapies directed at eliminating virus infectivity and spread.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Gag', '*deltaretroviruses', '*oligomerization', '*retroviruses', '*virus assembly']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2391-1061'],,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Eichorst et al.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,"Genomic studies have recently identified RPS15 as a new driver gene in aggressive and chemorefractory cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). RPS15 encodes a ribosomal protein whose conserved C-terminal domain extends into the decoding center of the ribosome. We demonstrate that mutations in highly conserved residues of this domain affect protein stability, by increasing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and cell-proliferation rates. On the other hand, we show that mutated RPS15 can be loaded into the ribosomes, directly impacting on global protein synthesis and/or translational fidelity in a mutation-specific manner. Quantitative mass spectrometry analyses suggest that RPS15 variants may induce additional alterations in the translational machinery, as well as a metabolic shift at the proteome level in HEK293T and MEC-1 cells. These results indicate that CLL-related RPS15 mutations might act following patterns known for other ribosomal diseases, likely switching from a hypo- to a hyperproliferative phenotype driven by mutated ribosomes. In this scenario, loss of translational fidelity causing altered cell proteostasis can be proposed as a new molecular mechanism involved in CLL pathobiology.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4914-1619'],,['Blood. 2018 Nov 29;132(22):2317-2319.

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,"Castleman disease (CD) describes a group of heterogeneous hematologic disorders with characteristic histopathological features. CD can present with unicentric or multicentric (MCD) regions of lymph node enlargement. Some cases of MCD are caused by human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), whereas others are HHV-8-negative/idiopathic (iMCD). Treatment of iMCD is challenging, and outcomes can be poor because no uniform treatment guidelines exist, few systematic studies have been conducted, and no agreed upon response criteria have been described. The purpose of this paper is to establish consensus, evidence-based treatment guidelines based on the severity of iMCD to improve outcomes. An international Working Group of 42 experts from 10 countries was convened by the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network to establish consensus guidelines for the management of iMCD based on published literature, review of treatment effectiveness for 344 cases, and expert opinion. The anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody siltuximab (or tocilizumab, if siltuximab is not available) with or without corticosteroids is the preferred first-line therapy for iMCD. In the most severe cases, adjuvant combination chemotherapy is recommended. Additional agents are recommended, tailored by disease severity, as second- and third-line therapies for treatment failures. Response criteria were formulated to facilitate the evaluation of treatment failure or success. These guidelines should help treating physicians to stratify patients based on disease severity in order to select the best available therapeutic option. An international registry for patients with CD (ACCELERATE, #NCT02817997) was established in October 2016 to collect patient outcomes to increase the evidence base for selection of therapies in the future.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-9959-1282', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9011-4268', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3609-661X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7367-8184']",['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02817997'],['Blood. 2018 Nov 15;132(20):2109-2110.

Epub 2018 Aug 4.,"BACKGROUND: Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) mRNA expression is a universal marker of minimal residual disease in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the ability of serial measurement of peripheral blood WT1 mRNA levels to predict relapse in patients with AML in remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From April 2012 to May 2015, 131 patients with AML were admitted to our hospital. Among them, 55 were examined for WT1 mRNA at least 3 times during complete remission to assess minimal residual disease, and thus were included in the following analyses. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 921 days, 34 remained in remission, but their WT1 values frequently increased to 100 copies/mug RNA. Therefore, we focused on the 40 posttreatment observation periods of 37 patients who experienced high WT1 values (defined as those above 100 copies/mug RNA) at least once after they achieved remission. The cumulative incidence of hematologic relapse was 75.8% at 6 months in 26 patients with 2 consecutive high WT1 values, whereas just 1 of the 14 patients with only 1 high WT1 value relapsed (P < .01). Similar results were obtained in subgroup analyses of allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients.

Here, we present a whole exome sequencing (WES) study showing race-specific genetic variations that may play a role on the disparate outcomes among AA and EA children with B-ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five AA and 15 EA patients ranging in age from 1 to 18 years were enrolled. The median blast percentage was 94.8% (range, 64.5%-99.9%). Frozen bone marrow aspirate was used to extract DNA, and WES was performed, focusing on race and B-ALL-specific germline mutations. RESULTS: Most genetic variants (n = 339) were shared between AA and EA children. Some genetic aberrations were only uniquely identified in AA (n = 58) and others in EA (n = 52) In AA, the genetic aberrations clustered in canonical pathways related to telomerase signaling and cancer signaling. In EA, the unique genetic aberration clustered in pathways related to stem cell pluripotency and hereditary cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed aberrant genetic aberrations in signaling networks that may contribute to race-specific aspects of leukemogenesis. Our results suggest the value of WES as a tool for development of individual gene signatures and gene scores for AA and EA children afflicted by B-ALL. These findings may ultimately impact disease management and contribute to the elimination of disparate outcomes in AA children with B-ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*Genetic aberrations', '*Pediatric', '*Race', '*Whole exome sequencing']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Critical roles of cytokines in the context of inflammation have gained special interest. While pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6 tend to increase AML aggressiveness, anti-inflammatory mediators such as TGF-beta and IL-10 appear to impede AML progression. Dysregulation of the complex interactions between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in AML may create a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment with effects on leukemic cell proliferation, survival and drug-resistance.

We sought to assess risk factors for CLABSI with a focus on the effect of AIP PICCs. METHODS: CLABSI rate was determined among patients who received PICCs from July 2009 through June 2012 using a retrospective study design. A nested case-control study matched for operators (interventional radiology [IR], infectious diseases [IDs], and the nurse venous access team [VAT]) was conducted to assess risks for PICC CLABSI. RESULTS: Eighty-nine PICC CLABSIs (1.66%) occurred among 5,372 PICC placements a mean of 32 days after placement. Higher infection risk (1.75) was observed for IR-placed PICCs compared with ID-placed PICCs (P=.02). In addition, higher infection risk (4.22) was observed for IR-placed PICCS compared with VAT-placed PICCs (P=.0008). IR-placed NAIP catheters, as indicated by multivariate analysis, revealed a 5.45-fold greater CLABSI risk compared with AIP catheters (P < .0005). Other risk factors included chemotherapy, placement of a tunneled catheter, leukemia, and AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: PICC CLABSIs were highest among patients receiving NAIP catheters in this large study. Highest risk occurred with placement of a tunneled catheter, AIDS, leukemia, and if the indication for PICC was chemotherapy.

Epub 2018 Jun 29.,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Adoptive cell therapy employing natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in several model systems, including hematological and solid tumors. We present comprehensive data on manufacturing development and clinical production of autologous NKG2D CAR T cells for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02203825). An NKG2D CAR was generated by fusing native full-length human NKG2D to the human CD3zeta cytoplasmic signaling domain. NKG2D naturally associates with native costimulatory molecule DAP10, effectively generating a second-generation CAR against multiple ligands upregulated during malignant transformation including MIC-A, MIC-B and the UL-16 binding proteins. METHODS: CAR T cells were infused fresh after a 9-day process wherein OKT3-activated T cells were genetically modified with replication-defective gamma-retroviral vector and expanded ex vivo for 5 days with recombinant human interleukin-2. RESULTS: Despite sizable interpatient variation in originally collected cells, release criteria, including T-cell expansion and purity (median 98%), T-cell transduction (median 66% CD8(+) T cells), and functional activity against NKG2D ligand-positive cells, were met for 100% of healthy donors and patients enrolled and collected. There was minimal carryover of non-T cells, particularly malignant cells; both effector memory and central memory cells were generated, and inflammatory cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, RANTES, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were selectively up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: The process resulted in production of required cell doses for the first-in-human phase I NKG2D CAR T clinical trial and provides a robust, flexible base for further optimization of NKG2D CAR T-cell manufacturing.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T', '*Good manufacturing practice cell therapy', '*NKG2D', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*gamma retrovirus', '*multiple myeloma']",,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT02203825'],,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Methods: Liver biochemistry parameters [including ALT(alanine aminotransferase), AST(aspartate aminotransferase), ALP(alkaline phosphatase), and TBil(total bilirubin)] during the first 6 months on imatinib (Gleevec((R))), dasatinib (Sprycel((R))) or nilotinib (Tasigna((R))) in CML-CP patients were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Results: A total of 436 patients were enrolled in this study, including 271 with imatinib, 58 with dasatinib, and 107 with nilotinib. The incidences of any abnormality of liver injury were 21.8%(59/271), 15.5%(9/58) and 32.7%(35/107) in the imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib groups, respectively. Most of the hepatic AEs were CTCAE grade 1 or 2 and mild or moderate liver injury except 1.9% of TBil CTCAE grade 3 in the nilotinib group. Multivariate analyses showed nilotinib [OR=2.9(1.3-6.6), P=0.012; OR=4.4(1.2-15.6), P=0.023] and male gender [OR=2.3(1.4-3.9), P=0.002; OR=3.0(1.2-7.6), P=0.018] were significantly associated with moderate liver impairment.

Epub 2018 Sep 1.,"Due to their high porosity and versatile composition and structure, nanoscaled Metal-Organic Frameworks (nanoMOFs) have been recently proposed as novel drug delivery systems, and have been demonstrated to have important capacities and potential for controlled release of different active ingredients. Gentamicin (GM; a broad spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic indicated in bacterial septicemia therapy) has great therapeutic interest, but the associated bioavailability and toxicity drawbacks accompanying high doses and repeated administration of this free drug make its encapsulation inside new nanocarriers necessary. GM encapsulation within two different porous biofriendly Fe and Zr-carboxylates nanoMOFs was performed by a simple impregnation method, with full characterization of the resulting GM-containing solid using a large panel of techniques (X ray powder diffraction-XRPD, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-FTIR, thermogravimetric analysis-TGA, N2 sorption, scanning electron microscopy-SEM, dynamic light scattering-DLS, zeta-potential, fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular simulations). High reproducible encapsulation rates, reaching 600microg of GM per.mg of formulation, were obtained using the biocompatible mesoporous iron(III) trimesate nanoparticles (NPs) MIL-100(Fe) (MIL: Materials from Institut Lavoisier). In vitro GM delivery studies were also carried out using different oral and intravenous simulated physiological conditions, with complete antibiotic release within 8h when using protein free media, but lower release rates in the presence of proteins. Furthermore, in vitro toxicity of GM-containing MIL-100(Fe) NPs was investigated on two different cell lines: a monocyte from leukemia (THP-1) and adherent fibroblastoid cells (NIH/3T3). These nanoMOFs had a low cytotoxic profile with IC50 values up to 1mg.mL(-1), ensuring adequate cell proliferation after 24h. Finally, antibacterial activity studies were carried out on two Gram-positive bacteria and one Gram-negative bacterium: S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, respectively. GM-loaded MIL-100(Fe) NPs exhibited the same activity as free GM, confirming that the antibiotic activity of the released GM was conserved.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antibiotic activity', 'Drug delivery', 'Encapsulation', 'Gentamicin', 'NanoMOFs']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we identified an intrachromosomal fusion gene located on chromosome 19q.13 between UBA2 and WTIP gene in a case of acute myeloid leukemia. The UBA2-WTIP fusion gene contains the N-terminal E1_enzyme_family, VAE_Ubl domains of UBA2, and the C-terminal LIM domains of WTIP. The UBA2-WTIP fusion was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing in 19 of 56 acute myeloid leukemia samples (33.9%). Ectopic expression of the UBA2-WTIP fusion in human acute myeloid leukemia KG-1a cells showed enhanced cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. The UBA2-WTIP fusion induced phosphorylation of STAT3, STAT5 and ERK1/2, and abrogates WTIP-mediated mammalian processing body formation. Finally, triptolide displayed selective cytotoxicity against KG-1a cells harboring the UBA2-WTIP fusion. Collectively, our findings suggest that the UBA2-WTIP fusion is an oncogenic fusion gene, as well as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Fusion gene', '*UBA2', '*WTIP']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,"PURPOSE: To provide an updated joint ASCO/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline on antimicrobial prophylaxis for adult patients with immunosuppression associated with cancer and its treatment. METHODS: ASCO and IDSA convened an update Expert Panel and conducted a systematic review of relevant studies from May 2011 to November 2016. The guideline recommendations were based on the review of evidence by the Expert Panel. RESULTS: Six new or updated meta-analyses and six new primary studies were added to the updated systematic review. RECOMMENDATIONS: Antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis is recommended for patients who are at high risk of infection, including patients who are expected to have profound, protracted neutropenia, which is defined as < 100 neutrophils/microL for > 7 days or other risk factors. Herpes simplex virus-seropositive patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation or leukemia induction therapy should receive nucleoside analog-based antiviral prophylaxis, such as acyclovir. Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis is recommended for patients receiving chemotherapy regimens that are associated with a > 3.5% risk for pneumonia as a result of this organism (eg, those with >/= 20 mg prednisone equivalents daily for >/= 1 month or on the basis of purine analog usage). Treatment with a nucleoside reverse transcription inhibitor (eg, entecavir or tenofovir) is recommended for patients at high risk of hepatitis B virus reactivation. Recommendations for vaccination and avoidance of prolonged contact with environments that have high concentrations of airborne fungal spores are also provided within the updated guideline.

Epub 2018 Oct 8.,"BACKGROUND: Management of pregnant patients with BCR-ABL-positive leukemia is challenging. Managing a patient who has been diagnosed while pregnant requires a different approach as compared to a patient who plans to become pregnant while on the treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Interferon (IFN)-alpha is a useful option in both situations due to teratogenic potential of TKIs. METHODS: We presented a series of 12 successful pregnancies in 11 women with BCR-ABL-positive leukemia, whose leukemia was managed with IFN-alpha throughout their pregnancy. RESULTS: All children have normal growth and development. All patients remained at least in hematological response and could start or resume TKI after delivery or breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: Because of the increased risk of teratogenicity and spontaneous abortion in female patient with pregnancy, when receiving TKI, IFN-alpha can be considered a safe drug to be administered throughout pregnancy and could represent the drug of choice in this situation during the era of TKI therapy.",['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'interferon', 'pregnancy', 'prognosis']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5332-2404'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,"Nilotinib, an oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of Abelson protein, is approved for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase and patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase resistant or intolerant to prior therapies. This review describes the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of nilotinib in patients with CML and in healthy volunteers. Nilotinib is rapidly absorbed, with a peak serum concentration approximately 3 hours after dosing. The area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over 24 hours and the peak serum concentration of nilotinib were dose proportional from 50-400 mg once daily. The metabolism of nilotinib is primarily via hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 according to in vitro studies. In the clinical setting, exposure to nilotinib was significantly reduced by the induction of CYP3A4 with rifampicin and significantly increased by the inhibition of CYP3A with ketoconazole. Additionally, nilotinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. The bioavailability of nilotinib is increased by up to 82% when given with a high-fat meal compared with fasted state. There is a positive correlation between the occurrences of all-grade total bilirubin elevations and the steady-state nilotinib trough concentrations. Fredericia method corrected QT interval change from baseline was observed to have a correlation with nilotinib exposure. No significant relationship between nilotinib exposure and major molecular response at 12 months was seen at therapeutic doses of nilotinib 300-400 mg, probably due to the narrow range of the doses investigated.",['NOTNLM'],"['*drug-drug interactions', '*nilotinib', '*pharmacodynamics', '*pharmacokinetics', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2023-7198'],,,,,,"['(c) 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was performed to explore whether the combination of As2O3 and artemisinin could produce a more powerful anticancer effect and reduce the toxicity of As2O3. METHOD: MTT assay was performed to detect the cell viability of A549, Hela and HepG2 cells treated with As2O3 and artemisinin. Combination Index (CI) analysis was carried out to evaluate the synergistic effect of As2O3 and artemisinin. Wound healing assay was performed to evaluate the migration rate. Fluorescent microscopy measurements and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the apoptosis. RESULT: Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) was detected with DCFH-DA. The cell proliferation assay indicated that artemisinin significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of As2O3 in a dose and time-dependent manner (P<0.01). Combination Index (CI) analysis further demonstrated that combining artemisinin with As2O3 generated synergistic effects in A549 (CI=0.65+/-0.05), Hela (CI=0.68+/-0.07) and HepG2 (CI=0.47+/-0.01) cells. The combination of these two drugs also evidently reduced the cell migration rate. Artemisinin also enhanced the apoptosis, necrosis in As2O3- treated A549 and Hela cells. Combination of As2O3 and artemisinin significantly induced more apoptosis (22.1%) than As2O3 (5.68%) or ART (5.93%) alone in Hela cells. In addition, ROS levels were increased obviously by combining artemisinin with As2O3.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples of B-ALL children diagnosed at The Children & Women's Healthcare of Laiwu City from June 2014 to February 2017 were collected. Subjects were assigned into methotrexate-resistant group (n=8) and non-resistant group (n=32) according to the follow-up outcome. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect expressions of BCL6 and E-cadherin in bone marrow tissues. Cell cycle and apoptosis of methotrexate-resistant B-ALL cells (BALL-1/MTXR cells) were detected after overexpression or inhibition of BCL6, respectively. Western blot was performed to determine the protein levels of E-cadherin and BCL6. The direct binding of BCL6 in the ZEB1 promoter region was verified by the ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assay. RESULTS: QRT-PCR showed a higher BCL6 expression in bone marrow samples of methotrexate-resistant group than that of the non-resistant group. Moreover, BCL6 was upregulated in BALL-1/MTXR cells than that of untreated B-ALL cells. After knockdown of BCL6 expression, we observed a decreased IC50, increased apoptosis, and arrested the cell cycle in BALL-1/MTXR cells. In addition, increased expression of E-cadherin was found in BALL-1/MTXR cells, which could be reversed by ZEB1 overexpression. ChIP assay suggested that BCL6 bound to the promoter region of ZEB1, so as to promote ZEB1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: BCL6 is overexpressed in the bone marrow of methotrexate-resistant children with B-ALL, which is capable of attenuating the sensitivity of B-ALL to methotrexate via promoting ZEB1 expression.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 29.,"Reprogramming of neutrophils by malignant cells is well-described for many types of solid tumors, but data remain scarce for hematological diseases. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized for a deep immune dysregulation mediated by leukemic cells that compromises patient's outcome. Murine models of CLL highlight the relevance of myeloid cells as tumor-driven reprogramming targets. In our study, we evaluated neutrophil reprogramming by CLL cells. We first show that the proportion of the CD16(high) CD62L(dim) neutrophil subset in peripheral blood of CLL patients is increased compared to age-matched healthy donors (HD). In vitro, neutrophils from HD cultured in the presence of CLL cells or conditioned media (CM) from CLL cells exhibited a longer lifespan. Depletion of G-CSF and GM-CSF from CM partially reversed the protective effect. In addition, the proportion of viable neutrophils that displayed a CD16(high) CD62L(dim) phenotype was increased in the presence of CM from CLL cells, being TGF-beta/IL-10 responsible for this effect. Altogether, our results describe a novel mechanism through which CLL cells can manipulate neutrophils.",['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*leukemia', '*phenotype reprogramming', '*tumor associated neutrophil']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3078-9458'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 UICC.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that a regulation of homing to BM and retention of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) occur by SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in BMM. Previously, we found that altering the BMM by the CXCR4 antagonist led to enhanced cytotoxic activity of immune cells, which leads to increased susceptibility of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in leukemic BMM. However, no reports have yet shown an architectural change of BMM such as the sinusoidal vessel and megakaryocyte by plerixafor treatment. Thus, we performed immunohistochemistry and observed that the capillary density of sinusoidal vessels was highly increased by CXCR4 antagonist with Ara-C in leukemia, showing the reconstruction of BMM with megakaryocytes in sinusoidal vessels by dual treatment. The number of megakaryocytes was also increased in the Plerixafor treated group, compared to that of leukemic or wild groups. Ultimately, we addressed the normalization of megakaryocyte and BMM in leukemia by showing the reconstitution of the sinusoidal vasculature by Plerixafor. This study proposed that chemotherapy with CXCR4 antagonist represents an advanced therapeutic strategy of targeting the leukemic niche.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MYB has therefore emerged as an attractive target for drug development. Recent work has suggested that targeting MYB by small-molecule inhibitors is feasible and that inhibition of MYB has potential as a therapeutic approach against acute myeloid leukemia. To facilitate the identification of small-molecule MYB inhibitors we have re-designed and improved a previously established cell-based screening assay and have employed it to screen a natural product library for potential inhibitors. Our work shows that teniposide and etoposide, chemotherapeutic agents causing DNA-damage by inhibiting topoisomerase II, potently inhibit MYB activity and induce degradation of MYB in AML cell lines. MYB inhibition is suppressed by caffeine, suggesting that MYB is inhibited indirectly via DNA-damage signalling. Importantly, ectopic expression of an activated version of MYB in pro-myelocytic NB4 cells diminished the anti-proliferative effects of teniposide, suggesting that podophyllotoxins disrupt the proliferation of leukemia cells not simply by inducing general DNA-damage but that their anti-proliferative effects are boosted by inhibition of MYB. Teniposide and etoposide therefore act like double-edged swords that might be particularly effective to inhibit tumor cells with deregulated MYB.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this article, we report that nuclear p21-activated kinase 4 (nPAK4) is a novel repressor of ERalpha-mediated transactivation in a 17beta-estradiol (E2)-dependent manner and promotes PAK4-ERalpha axis-mediated bone metastasis by targeting leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) in ERalpha-positive breast cancer. An evaluation of clinical breast cancer samples revealed that nPAK4 is linked to ERalpha expression and appears to be associated with a poor prognosis in bone metastatic breast cancer. PAK4 bound and co-translocated with ERalpha from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon stimulation with E2. nPAK4 enhanced the invasive potential of ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and promoted breast cancer metastasis in vivo.

Epub 2018 Sep 4.,"The SMAD family (SMAD1-9) was critically important for regulating cellular process through transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, and contributed to carcinogenesis; however, their prognostic roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remained unclear. This study collected 84 de novo AML patients treated with chemotherapy and 71 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Kaplan-Meier survival estimate indicated that among SMAD1-9, high SMAD3 and SMAD7 expression were both associated with poor event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS; all P < 0.05) in AML patients undergoing chemotherapy; and high SMAD6 expression was associated with shorter EFS and OS (all P < 0.01) in patients underwent allo-HSCT. Multivariate analysis showed that only high SMAD7 expression had adverse effect on EFS and OS (P = 0.021, 0.026) independently. Furthermore, High SMAD3 and SMAD7 expressers had significantly shorter EFS and OS than low expressers (P = 0.006, 0.001). In AML patients who went through allo-HSCT, there were no significant differences for EFS and OS between patients with high and low-expression SMAD3 or SMAD7. Our study suggested that high expression of SMAD3 and SMAD7 predicted adverse prognosis in AML patients undergoing chemotherapy and SMAD7 was a better prognostic marker than SMAD3. Their prognosis impact may be overcome by allo-HSCT.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-8586-3889', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2416-7572']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine years after diagnosis, a rapidly growing systemic lymphadenopathy was observed, and a biopsy specimen revealed the presence of typical Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, surrounded by T-lymphocytes and CLL cells. Sequencing analysis of the germline complementary determining region 3 (CDR3) region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene showed that the Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells were clonally unrelated to the preexisting CLL cells and the HRS cells were composed of five different clones, leading to the molecular diagnosis of de novo lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoproliferative diseases (LPDs) with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). As the initial treatment was neither effective for classic Hodgkin LPDs nor for SLL, Bendamustine, Rituximab (BR) was started and complete remission was achieved, which has continued for more than one year so far.

Male infertility, including spermatogenesis disturbance, is known to be one of the side effects of anticancer drugs. While hormone preparations and vitamin preparations are used for spermatogenesis disturbance, their therapeutic effects are low. Some traditional herbal medicines have been administered to improve spermatogenesis. In the present study, we administered Gosha-jinki-gan (TJ107; Tsumura Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to mice suffering from severe aspermatogenesis after busulfan treatment to determine whether TJ107 can recover spermatogenesis. Male 4-week-old C57BL/6J mice were administered a single intraperitoneal injection of busulfan, and they were then fed a normal diet for 60 days and then a TJ107 diet or TJ107-free normal diet for another 60 days. After busulfan treatment, the weight of the testes and the epididymal sperm count progressively decreased in the normal diet group. On the other hand, in the TJ107 group, these variables dramatically recovered at 120 days. These results suggest that busulfan-induced aspermatogenesis is irreversible if appropriate treatment is not administered. Supplementation of TJ107 can completely recover the injured seminiferous epithelium via normalization of the macrophage migration and reduction of the expressions of Tool-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4, suggesting that TJ107 has a therapeutic effect on busulfan-induced aspermatogenesis.",['NOTNLM'],"['anticancer treatment', 'aspermatogenesis', 'oriental medicine', 'testicular immunology']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5110-6719', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0302-7658', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0618-0607']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 3.,"MacroH2A histone variants suppress tumor progression and act as epigenetic barriers to induced pluripotency. How they impart their influence on chromatin plasticity is not well understood. Here, we analyze how the different domains of macroH2A proteins contribute to chromatin structure and dynamics. By solving the crystal structure of the macrodomain of human macroH2A2 at 1.7 A, we find that its putative binding pocket exhibits marked structural differences compared with the macroH2A1.1 isoform, rendering macroH2A2 unable to bind ADP-ribose. Quantitative binding assays show that this specificity is conserved among vertebrate macroH2A isoforms. We further find that macroH2A histones reduce the transient, PARP1-dependent chromatin relaxation that occurs in living cells upon DNA damage through two distinct mechanisms. First, macroH2A1.1 mediates an isoform-specific effect through its ability to suppress PARP1 activity. Second, the unstructured linker region exerts an additional repressive effect that is common to all macroH2A proteins. In the absence of DNA damage, the macroH2A linker is also sufficient for rescuing heterochromatin architecture in cells deficient for macroH2A.",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA damage', '*PARP1', '*heterochromatin', '*histone variants', '*macroH2A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3597-5698', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6342-8985', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3218-4567', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3835-232X']",['PDB/6FY5'],,,,,['(c) 2018 The Authors.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Mar 14.,"BACKGROUND: Relapse is the leading cause of treatment failure for myeloid malignancies treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Treatment options are very limited and use of azacitidine is one of the available options. METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-institution study. Of 28 evaluated patients, 18 were males, and the median age was 60 years (range, 15-78). There were 15 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 8 with myelodysplastic syndrome, 4 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 1 with primary myelofibrosis. Ten patients received azacitidine for overt relapse, 14 received it as a preemptive therapy, and 4 others received it as maintenance treatment after allo-hematopoietic cell transplant (HSCT). Eleven patients received a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). RESULTS: The patients received median 5 (1-9) cycles of azacitidine in preemptive and maintenance therapy and median 2.5 (1-9) cycles in patients with relapse. Thirty-nine percent of patients received DLIs. Median overall survival was 6.1 months (95% CI, 0.7-13) for relapse therapy vs 21.2 months (95% CI, 8.4-inf) for preemptive therapy. Among patients treated for relapse, 30% achieved temporary disease control and underwent the second allo-HSCT. A complete, cytogenetic remission was achieved in 50% of patients and stable minimal residual disease in 14% of patients in a group with preemptive therapy. Toxicity was considerable; neutropenia (71%), anemia (14%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and serious infections (36%) were observed in the preemptive setting. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that azacitidine is best used as a preemptive therapy against relapse for patients after allo-HSCT performed for myeloid malignancy. Applying azacitidine as therapy for ongoing relapse after allo-HSCT may lead to stable disease and allow for better performance of the second allo-HSCT.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Many preclinical reports and retrospective population studies have shown an anti-cancer effect of metformin. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the effect of metformin on the treatment regimen in patients with ALL who exhibited high levels of ABCB1 gene expression and to determine its impact on overall survival. METHODS: A total of 102 patients with ALL were recruited; one group (n = 26) received metformin, and the other received chemotherapy (n = 76). Measurement of ABCB1 transcript expression was performed using qRT-PCR prior to treatment initiation. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves. The impact of both the type of treatment and the level of expression on the response (remission or relapse) was analyzed by calculating the odds ratio. RESULTS: The survival of patients with high ABCB1 expression was lower than those with low or absent ABCB1 gene expression (p = 0.030). In the individual analysis, we identified a benefit to adding metformin in the group of patients with high ABCB1 gene expression (p = 0.025). In the metformin user group, the drug acted as a protective factor against both therapeutic failure (odds ratio [OR] 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.0037-1.53) and early relapse (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.0028-1.153). CONCLUSION: The combined use of metformin with chemotherapy is effective in patients with elevated levels of ABCB1 gene expression.

Epub 2018 Aug 22.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is 10- to 20-fold less common in Asians (including Han Chinese) compared with persons of predominately European descent. Why is unknown but seems predominately genetic. We observed an increasing frequency of new cases of CLL at our Haematology Centre beginning 2011 and wondered why. OBJECTIVE: Determine the cause(s) for this increased frequency. METHOD: We interrogated the context of CLL diagnosis in 483 consecutive subjects seen at the Institute of Haematology of a large referral hospital in Beijing. 3 cohorts were considered based on why a CBC was done to establish the CLL diagnosis: (1) a CBC-testing situation unrelated to a health condition such as a routine annual health exam or application for employment or medical insurance (termed routine CBC); (2) an unrelated medical condition such as a cold, influenza, heart disease etc. (termed CBC for other disorders); and (3) signs and/or symptoms consistent with CLL such as lymph-adenopathy, hepato- or splenomegaly, fatigue, B-symptoms etc. (termed CBC for possible CLL). RESULTS: Data regarding context of CLL diagnosis were available for 389 subjects (81%). Proportions of subjects in the 3 cohorts were 44% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 39, 49%), 24% (20, 28%) and 32% (28, 37%). The proportion of subjects whose evaluation of CLL was prompted by an abnormal CBC not for possible CLL (cohorts 1 and 2) increased over the surveillance interval (r = 0.164; P = 0.001) as did median age at diagnosis (r = 0.207; P < 0.001). Age at diagnosis was correlated with probability of CLL being suspected because of an abnormal routine CBC (r = 0.249; P < 0.001); 42% (32, 53%) amongst subjects </=50 years versus 86% (75, 92%; P < 0.001) among those >70 years. Consistent with this, older subjects were diagnosed at Rai stage-0 with asymptomatic disease compared with younger subjects (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest much of the increased frequency of CLL at our centre and likely elsewhere in China predominately reflects ascertainment bias.

This trend has yet to affect the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as flow cytometry, while being integral in the diagnosis of many hematologic malignancies, has no explicit role in the current WHO criteria for CMML. The absence of WHO-determined criteria for flow cytometry in the diagnosis of CMML is not due to a lack of research on the subject over the years. Herein, we review the literature concerning the use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of CMML, focusing on recent studies showing that CMML can be differentiated from other hematologic malignancies and reactive monocytoses by the quantification of monocyte subsets by flow cytometry with high sensitivity and specificity. We also detail how this methodology could be used clinically, both as a diagnostic test and potentially as a screening test.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', '*Flow cytometry', '*Monocyte subsets']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we identify the receptor tyrosine kinase Axl as a novel target of ZNF224 transcriptional repression activity. Axl overexpression is found in many types of cancer and is frequently associated with drug resistance. Interestingly, we also found that sensitivity to imatinib can be partly restored in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia cells by ZNF224 overexpression and the resulting suppression of Axl expression. These results, in accordance with our previous findings, support the role of ZNF224 in imatinib responsiveness and shed new insights into potential therapeutic use of ZNF224 in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['Axl', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Imatinib-resistance', 'Transcription', 'ZNF224']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie', 'Moleculaire (SFBBM).

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"OBJECTIVES: Molecular screening plays a major role in prognostic categorization and subsequent definition of treatment strategies for acute myeloid leukemia. The possibility of using IDH1/2 mutations as a marker for the monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) is still under investigation and remains unclear. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we evaluated 90 patients with de novo AML using Sanger sequencing (exon 4, IDH1 and IDH2). For subsequent MRD monitoring were used both methods, massive parallel sequencing and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). RESULTS: We identified 22 patients (24%) who harboured mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 genes. Fourteen (64%) of them had other commonly used MRD markers (insertion in NPM1 and partial tandem duplication of MLL, MLL-PTD). Eight of the 22 patients had IDH1 mutations, 13 had IDH2 mutations and 1 had both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. In our cohort, this IDH1/2 marker responded to the treatment in all of the patients and reflected the onset of the relapse very well. NPM1 mutation based MRD monitoring was more sensitive and predicted relapse earlier but IDH1/2 based monitoring was more sensitive than a method based on MLL-PTD. Both massive parallel sequencing and ddPCR were competent to monitor MRD using IDH1/2. Nevertheless, ddPCR was able to achieve a higher sensitivity in some cases and moreover this method can analyse a single sample without significant price increases. CONCLUSION: Given these data, we conclude that IDH1/2 mutations can be used as a reliable and cost-effective marker for MRD monitoring.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'IDH1 and IDH2 mutations', 'Minimal residual disease', 'NGS', 'ddPCR']",,,,['Clin Biochem. 2019 Jan;63:161.

Stx induces rapid apoptotic cell death in some cells, such as human myelogenous leukemia THP-1 cells expressing CD77, a receptor for Stx internalization, and the induction of apoptotic cell death is thought to be crucial for the fatal systemic complications. Therefore, in order to suppress the fatal toxicity, it is important to understand the mechanism how cells can escape from apoptotic cell death in the presence of Stx. In this study, we isolated resistant clones to Stx-induced apoptosis from highly sensitive THP-1 cells by continuous exposure with lethal dose of Stx.

However, murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells do not express HSP72, a heat-inducible member of HSP70 family. So, it is of interest to examine how MEL cells respond to heat stress (44 degrees C, 30 min). Heat stress-induced apoptosis was suppressed by pretreatment of heat shock (44 degrees C, 10 min). Such suppressive effects were maximal at 6 h after heat shock and remained up to 12 h. Interestingly, such effects of heat shock were abrogated by specific inhibitors of HSP90 such as 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and novobiocin. From flow cytometric analysis, it was found that MEL cells arrest in G2 phase at 6 h after heat shock, but restore original cell cycle at 12 h. High expression level of HSP90 was maintained before and after heat shock. Phosphorylation of HSP90alpha was observed in apoptotic cells induced by heat stress, but inhibited by pretreatment of heat shock. Such inhibition was abrogated by 17-AAG. Moreover, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated in heat stress-induced apoptotic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that HSP90alpha in MEL cells plays an important role in the thermotolerance, i.e., suppression of heat stress-induced apoptosis by heat shock.",['NOTNLM'],"['17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin', 'apoptosis', 'heat', 'heat shock protein 90alpha', 'murine erythroleukemia cell', 'novobiocin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we showed that piceatannol exhibits potent cytotoxic effects in all tested leukemia cell lines (THP-1, HL-60, U937, and K562). These effects were accompanied by induction of DNA damage, an increase in the proportion of cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, and inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a strong ROS scavenger, significantly inhibited piceatannol-induced apoptosis, suggesting that piceatannol-induced apoptosis does not occur via inhibition of ROS generation. Piceatannol also resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial depolarization, along with a decline in Bcl-2 expression, which was not restored by NAC. Conversely, ectopic Bcl-2 overexpression moderately inhibited piceatannol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, piceatannol strongly inhibited X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression, which was restored by NAC. A transient knockdown of XIAP significantly increased piceatannol-induced apoptosis in the presence of NAC, suggesting that XIAP downregulation increases piceatannol-induced apoptosis, and that NAC could reverse this effect by increasing XIAP expression. Taken together, these results suggest that piceatannol induces apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines by downregulating XIAP expression, regardless of antioxidant activity.",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell lymphoma 2', 'N-acetyl-L-cysteine', 'X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein', 'apoptosis', 'piceatannol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the early stage of infection, the viral core is released into the cytoplasm, the viral RNA genome is reversed transcribed to cDNA and this viral DNA is then integrated into the host cell chromatin to form a provirus. The p12 protein has N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD) that are required for steps leading up to integration, but the molecular details of their functions remain poorly characterised. Using the prototypic gammaretrovirus, murine leukemia virus (MLV) as a model, we recently showed that the NTD of p12 directly binds to and stabilises the capsid (CA) lattice of the viral core. Alterations to the CTD of MLV p12 prevented the viral pre-integration complex (PIC) tethering to host chromatin in mitosis, and this could be partially rescued by addition of a heterologous chromatin binding motif. In this study we demonstrated that the CTD of p12 directly binds to nucleosomal histone proteins, targeting not only p12 but also CA to mitotic chromatin. Additionally, cell-cycle-dependent phosphorylation of p12 appeared to increase the affinity of p12 for chromatin in mitosis relative to interphase. Thus, we have revealed how p12 can link the CA-containing PIC to mitotic chromatin, ready for integration. Importantly, we observed that direct binding to nucleosomes is a conserved feature of p12 orthologs across the gammaretrovirus genus and that the nucleosomal docking site is potentially shared with that of spumaretroviral Gag proteins.",['NOTNLM'],"['Gag', 'chromatin-targeting', 'integration', 'murine leukemia virus', 'nucleosomes', 'p12', 'retrovirus']",,,,,['Conflict of interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the mechanism of angiogenesis and developing drugs that target the process has therefore been a major focus for research on cancer therapy. In this study, we screened 114 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs for their effects on angiogenesis in the zebrafish. Among those with positive effects, we chose to focus on Ponatinib (AP24534; Iclusig((R))) for further investigation. Ponatinib is an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and its clinical trial has been approved by FDA for the treatment of the disease. In recent clinical trials, however, some side effects have been reported for Ponatinib, mostly on blood vessel disorders, raising the possibility that this drug may influence angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that Ponatinib was able to suppress the formation of intersegmental vessels (ISV) and subintestinal vessels (SIV) in the zebrafish larvae. The anti-angiogenic effect of Ponatinib was further validated by other bioassays in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), including cell proliferation and migration, tube formation, and wound healing. Further experiments showed that Ponatinib inhibited VEGF-induced VEGFR2 phosphorylation and its downstream signaling pathways including Akt/eNOS/NO pathway and MAPK pathways (ERK and p38MAPK). Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of VEGF signaling at its receptor level and downstream pathways may likely be responsible for the antiangiogenic activity of Ponatinib.",['NOTNLM'],"['HUVEC', 'MAPK', 'angiogenesis', 'eNOS', 'ponatinib']",,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In agreement with previously defined PI3K-inhibitor chemotypes, the 2,3-dihydroimidazo[1,2-c]quinazoline scaffold of copanlisib adopts a flat conformation in the adenine-binding pocket of the catalytic p110 subunit and further extends into a deeper-affinity pocket in contrast to idelalisib, the quinazoline moiety of which is accommodated in a newly created selectivity pocket. Copanlisib shows higher potency than other clinically developed PI3K inhibitors against all four class I isoforms, with approximately tenfold preference for p110alpha and p110delta. Owing to its potency and isoform profile, copanlisib exhibits cell-type-specific cytotoxicity against primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. Moreover, copanlisib differs from idelalisib in regard to intravenous versus oral administration and weekly versus twice-daily dosing. In regard to adverse effects, intermittent intravenous treatment with copanlisib leads to fewer gastrointestinal toxicities compared with continuous oral dosing of idelalisib. In relapsed follicular lymphoma, copanlisib appears more effective and especially better tolerated than other targeted therapies. Copanlisib extends existing treatment options for this subtype of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma and also shows promising response rates in DLBCL, especially of the activated B-cell type.",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell receptor signaling', 'leukemia', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'p110 isoforms', 'targeted therapy']",,,,,"['Disclosure GK has received research funding from Bayer, Roche, and Boehringer', 'Ingelheim.

IgG levels fell near 6g/L at rates of -0.85+/-0.14g/L/year in 51 patients who required treatment for CLL within 4.5+/-0.4years from initial diagnosis and-0.27+/-0.04g/L/year in 40 patients with progressive disease who remained untreated after 8.5+/-0.5years. In contrast, endogenous IgG levels remained above 8g/L in patients with highly indolent disease (n=25) and TNFalpha and beta-2-microglobulin (beta2M) in blood decreased when IgRT was used to increase IgG levels over 9g/L. At 15g/L but not 5g/L, the IgRT product Hizentra(R) inhibited B cell receptor (BCR)-activation, TNFalpha production, and survival in vitro, particularly of CLL cells that spontaneously made little TNFalpha.

It is an indolent disorder but transformation to myelofibrosis (MF), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) has been reported. CASE REPORT: We described a patient with ET whose disease evolved into MDS with fibrosis and complex karyotype after 15 years of stable disease. She was asymptomatic and was on hydroxyurea (HU) treatment until recently when she presented with worsening anaemia. Physical examination showed mild splenomegaly. Full blood picture showed leukoerythroblastic picture with presence of 3% circulating blasts and background of dysplastic features such as hypogranular cytoplasm and nuclear hyposegmentation of neutrophils. The bone marrow aspiration was haemodiluted but revealed presence of 6% blast cells, trilineage dysplasia and predominant erythroid precursors (60%). Trephine biopsy showed no excess of blast cells and normal quantity of erythroid precursors, but there was increased in fibrosis (WHO grade 2) and presence of dysmegakaryopoeisis such as nuclear hypolobation, multinucleation and micromegakaryocytes. Cytogenetic study showed complex karyotype; monosomy of chromosome 2, chromosome 5, chromosome 18 and presence of a marker chromosome (42~44, XX,-2,-5,-18,+mar). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) showed 5q deletion (CSF1R and EGR1). CONCLUSION: The findings were consistent with transformation of ET to MDS with fibrosis and complex karyotype. ET progression to MDS is considered rare. The presence of complex karyotype and fibrosis in MDS are associated with unfavourable outcome.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 30.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematopoietic disorder initiated from a small subset of leukemia stem cell (LSC), which presents unrestricted self-renewal and proliferation. Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is abundantly expressed and plays oncogenic roles in solid cancer and AML. However, whether HOTAIR regulates the self-renewal of LSC is largely unknown. Here, we reported that the expression of HOTAIR was increased in LSC than in normal hematological stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). HOTAIR inhibition by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) decreased colony formation in leukemia cell lines and primary AML blasts. We then investigated the role of HOTAIR in leukemia in vivo. HOTAIR knockdown extends the survival time in U937-transplanted NSG mice. Furthermore, HOTAIR knockdown reduced infiltration of leukemic blasts, decreased frequency of LSC, and prolonged overall survival in MLL-AF9-induced murine leukemia, suggesting that HOTAIR is required for the maintenance of AML. Mechanistically, HOTAIR inhibited p15 expression through zeste homolog 2 (EZH2)-enrolled tri-methylation of Lys 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) in p15 promoter. In addition, p15 partially reversed the decrease of colony and proliferation induced by HOTAIR knockdown, suggesting that p15 plays an important role in the leukemogenesis by HOTAIR. In conclusion, our study suggests that HOTAIR facilitates leukemogenesis by enhancing self-renewal of LSC. HOTAIR might be a potential target for anti-LSC therapy.",,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 Aug 29.,"PURPOSE: To report the feasibility, accuracy, and reliability of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-based total-body irradiation (TBI) treatment in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2015 to 2018, 30 patients with AML or ALL were planned and treated with VMAT-based TBI, which consisted of three isocenters and three overlapping arcs. TBI dose was prescribed to 90% of the planning treatment volume (PTV) receiving 12Gy in six fractions, at two fractions per day. Mean lung and kidney doses were restricted less than 10Gy, and maximum lens dose less than 6Gy. Quality assurance (QA) comprised the verification of the irradiation plans via dose-volume histogram (DVH) based 3D patient QA system. RESULTS: Average mean lung dose was 9.7+/-0.2Gy, mean kidney dose 9.6+/-0.2Gy, maximum lens dose 4.5+/-0.4Gy, mean PTV dose 12.7+/-0.1Gy, and heterogeneity index of PTV was 1.16+/-0.02 in all patients. Grade 3 or more acute radiation toxicity was not observed. When comparing plan and DVH-based 3D patient QA results, average differences of 3.3%+/-1.3 in mean kidney doses, 1.1%+/-0.7 in mean lung doses, and 0.9%+/-0.4 in mean target doses were observed. CONCLUSION: Linac-based VMAT increased the dose homogeneity of TBI treatment more than extended SSD techniques. Partial cone-beam CT and optical surface-guided system assure patient positioning. DVH-based 3D patient dose verification QA was possible with linac-based VMAT showing small differences between planned and delivered doses. It is feasible, accurate, and reliable.",['NOTNLM'],"['*DVH-based 3D patient QA', '*TBI', '*VMAT']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 30.,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been a major threat to global industrial pig farming ever since its emergence in the late 1980s. Identification of sustainable and effective control measures against PRRSV transmission is a pressing problem. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of PRRSV is specifically localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of virus-infected cells which is important for PRRSV replication. In the current study, a new host restricted factor, Moloney leukemia virus 10-like protein (MOV10), was identified as an inhibitor of PRRSV replication. N protein levels and viral replication were significantly reduced in Marc-145cells stably overexpressing MOV10 compared with those in wild-type Marc-145cells. Adsorption experiments revealed that MOV10 did not affect the attachment and internalization of PRRSV. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence co-localization analyses showed that MOV10 interacted and co-localized with the PRRSV N protein in the cytoplasm. Notably, MOV10 affected the distribution of N protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus, leading to the retention of N protein in the former. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that MOV10 inhibits PRRSV replication by restricting the nuclear import of N protein. These observations have great implications for the development of anti-PRRSV drugs and provide new insight into the role of N protein in PRRSV biology.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Moloney leukemia virus 10-like protein', '*Nucleocapsid protein', '*Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus', '*Viral replication']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Human monocytic leukaemia cells were induced by TPA and IL-10 to differentiate M2c macrophages. Subsequently HK-2 cells were co-cultured with the M2c macrophages in Transwell chamber. After 48 h of co-culturing the HK-2 cells were detected in the mRNA and protein expression of E-cadherin, alpha-SMA and vimentin with RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and Western blot respectively. Besides, the migration ability of the HK-2 cells was estimated with Transwell migration assay. ANOVA was used to compare the difference between groups and Student's t-test to conduct multiple comparisons of two groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of alpha-SMA and vimentin of the HK-2 cells were increased but the E-cadherin decreased significantly after 48 h co-culturing with the M2c macrophages (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). And the migration ability of HK-2 cells were also increased significantly (P < 0.05).

Epub 2018 Aug 30.,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Several medicinal plants are traditionally used by the tribal healers of some tribal pockets of Madhya Pradesh (M.P.), India in the treatment of various ailments including TB related symptoms. The information of traditional knowledge of plants is empirical lacking systematic scientific investigation. AIM OF THE STUDY: To provide a scientific rationale for the traditional uses of some medicinal plants in treating prolonged cough, chest complaints and TB by ethnic groups in four districts of the state of M.P., India. The anti-mycobacterial activity of these plants was also investigated against multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mtb. The active plant extracts were also assessed for general cytotoxicity by human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1 macrophages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi structured interviews and guided field-walk methods were used to gather information on medicinal plants used by the tribal traditional healers. The study was carried out in the tribal pockets of Anuppur, Mandla, Umariya and Dindori districts of M.P., India. A total of 35 plant species distributed in 22 families were selected based on folklore uses suggested by the tribal traditional healer. The ethanol extracts of plants were evaluated for anti-mycobacterial activity against Mtb H37Rv and six MDR clinical isolates of Mtb. The anti-mycobacterial activity of plants was determined in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using standard resazurin microtitre plate assay (REMA). The plant extracts found to be active against Mtb were further evaluated for general cytotoxicity against human THP-1 macrophages using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. The selectivity index (SI) of active plant extracts were also calculated on the basis of MIC and cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Out of the 35 plants, 11 plant species showed anti-mycobacterial activity with MIC ranging from 500 to 31.25microg/mL against Mtb H37Rv. The plant extracts also exhibited anti-mycobacterial activity against six multi-drug resistant (MDR) clinical strains of Mtb isolated from sputum samples of pulmonary TB patients. In vitro cytotoxicity of active plant extracts was also assessed in human THP-1 macrophages. The IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) values of most of the plant extracts on THP-1 was found to be higher than MIC values against Mtb, indicating that the THP-1 cells are not adversely affected at concentrations that are effective against Mtb. Significant anti-mycobacterial activity was observed for eleven plants viz., Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br., Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Holorrhena antidysentrica (Roth) Wall. exA.DC., Mallotus philippensis (Lam.) Mull. Arg., Eulophia nuda Lindl., Cocculus hirsutus (L.) Diels, Pueraria tuberosa (Willd.) DC., Cyperus rotundus L., Curcuma caesia Roxb., Sphaeranthus indicus L. and Plumbago zeylanica L. which lends support to their traditional uses. CONCLUSION: The present investigation supports the potential role of plants used by tribal healers as our results have shown that these plants exhibit anti-mycobacterial activity in the acceptable range against Mtb. Our study clearly lends support to the traditional uses of some plants in TB related symptoms as we have found them to exhibit significant in vitro anti-TB activity. To the best of our knowledge, anti-mycobacterial activity in plants against Mtb is being reported for the first time from tribal areas of M.P., India by the current study.",['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-mycobacterial activity', 'MDR', 'Medicinal plants', 'Traditional medicine', 'Tuberculosis']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2018 Aug 30.,"Integrative taxonomy has been generally considered as a goal in systematics for more than a decade. Here, we employed environmental, molecular, and morphological data to evaluate the species boundaries within the short-nosed skink Plestiodon brevirostris from south-central Mexico, one member of the morphologically conservative P. brevirostris group. Our molecular dataset includes one mitochondrial and two nuclear loci. The mitochondrial fragment includes the full length of the gene coding for the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 protein, a segment of the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA, and flanking tRNAs. The nuclear dataset includes fragments of the genes coding for the megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 and RNA fingerprint 35 proteins. We employed phylogenetic reconstruction, analyses of population structure and morphological variation, and species delimitation methods (including the integration of the three kinds of data in a unified probabilistic framework) to evaluate species limits. Our results suggest that P. brevirostris represents four distinct species. The information provided by each kind of data allowed us to discern between alternative explanations for the observed patterns of geographic structure. Two of the newly recognized lineages are poorly differentiated morphologically but apparently differ in environmental preferences and are allopatric.

Epub 2018 Aug 30.,"Esculetin (6,7-dihydrocoumarin) and the flavonoid quercetin (3,5,7,3',4' pentahydroxyflavone) are compounds that could change the balance of redox homeostasis. NB4 leukemia cells were treated with 25muM quercetin for 24h and with esculetin at either 100 or 500muM for different times. Quercetin increased the levels of pro-inflammatory NFkB p65 in the nucleus correspondingly reducing them in the cytosol. The levels of NFkB p65 decreased in the nucleus at high esculetin concentration treatments for long times (19h), concomitantly increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory NFkB p50 in the nucleus. This could suggest formation of inhibitory p50 homodimers possibly related with anti-inflammatory response. Lipoxygenase expression was reduced either by esculetin or quercetin. A significant increase of Nrf2 in the nucleus of NB4 cells treated with 100muM esculetin for 19h was observed. Quercetin increased the levels of Nrf2 in the cytosol reducing them in the nucleus. Superoxide dismutase expression increased in NB4 cells treated with esculetin in contrast with quercetin. All these data support a relevant differential role for NFkB and Nrf2 in anti-inflammatory and redox response when apoptosis was induced by esculetin or quercetin in human leukemia NB4 cells.",['NOTNLM'],"['Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Esculetin', 'Hydrogen peroxide', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Tert-butylhydroperoxide']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To explore the relationship between abnormal DNA methylation and the occurrence and development of AML based on the Gene Expression Database (GEO), this study extracted data related to methylation in AML and identified a methylated CpG site that was significantly different in terms of expression and distribution between the primary cells of AML patients, and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells from normal bone marrow. To further investigate the differences caused by the dysfunction of methylation sites, bioinformatics analysis was used to screen methylation-related biomarkers, and the potential prognostic genes were selected by univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regressions. Finally, five independent prognostic indicators were identified.

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"The present study aimed to assess the clinical impact of BCR-ABL1 transcript levels determined at an earlier time point than the 3-month early molecular response (EMR) in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) patients. BCR-ABL1 transcript levels of CML-CP patients (n = 258; median age, 43 [range, 18-81] years) treated with various tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were determined at 4 weeks (28 +/- 3 days) and at every 3 months of treatment initiation. At 4 weeks, receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that cutoff values of BCR-ABL1 transcripts for achieving major molecular responses (MMRs) by 12 and 60 months were 40.89% and 39.16%, respectively (95% CI, 0.658-0.772 and 95% CI, 0.643-0.758; P < 0.0001). With 40% of BCR-ABL1 transcripts at 4 weeks (very early MR; VEMR), patients with VEMR achieved higher 3-month EMR and 4-week VEMR significantly associated with higher cumulative incidences of 5-year MMR (89.1% vs 72.3%; P < 0.001) and 5-year deep molecular response (DMR) (56.5% vs 29.4%; P = 0.001). Furthermore, event-free survival (EFS)-a (93.0% vs 84.8%; P = 0.068) and EFS-b (71.1% vs 57.9%; P = 0.061) by 5 years were also marginally significant. VEMR and 3-month EMR were achieved in 89 patients, with significantly superior outcomes. In multivariate analyses, lower leukocyte count (P = 0.008) and frontline second-generation TKI therapy size (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with VEMR achievement, but not baseline BCR-ABL1 level and CML duration. In conclusion, the 4-week BCR-ABL1 transcript levels including VEMR could be important to predict long-term outcomes and may provide additional information about innate intrinsic sensitivity to CML among individuals.",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*early molecular response', '*molecular response', '*predictor', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3141-8907', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9810-2050', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8824-7961']",,,,,,['(c) 2018 The Authors.

To clarify which patients with ATLL are likely to benefit from these treatment options and to define patient populations for novel treatments, we performed a nationwide retrospective analysis of 252 Japanese patients who had relapsed ATLL after allo-HSCT. Some long-term survivors remained after tapering and withdrawal of immunosuppressive agents. Thirty-six patients who received donor lymphocyte infusion had a better overall survival (OS) in comparison to those who did not [hazard ratio (HR), 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.43-0.93; P = .02], suggesting the efficacy of a graft-versus-ATLL (GvATLL) effect even after relapse. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that skin lesions at initial relapse of ATLL were independently associated with higher OS (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74; P = .003), indicating that the skin is a susceptible target organ of GvATLL. This study suggested that enhancement of a GvATLL effect is a potential therapeutic option for relapsed disease after allo-HSCT.

Moreover, dysregulation of miR-340 was also found to be associated with drug resistance and predicted patients' survival in various cancers. Herein, we investigated miR-340 expression and its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect miR-340 expression in bone marrow (BM) from 99 newly diagnosed AML patients except for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), 19 AML patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 29 healthy donors. BM miR-340 expression was significantly underexpressed in newly diagnosed AML patients as compared with controls (p = 0.031) and AML patients achieved CR (p = 0.025). No significant differences were observed between miR-340 expression and most of the clinicopathologic features (p > 0.05). However, low miR-340 expression was found to be associated with lower CR rate in both non-APL-AML and cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML; p = 0.001 and 0.031, respectively), and acted as an independent risk factor for CR by logistic regression analysis (p = 0.001 and 0.021, respectively).

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"Though the advancement of chemotherapy drugs alleviates the progress of cancer, long-term therapy with anticancer agents gradually leads to acquired multidrug resistance (MDR), which limits the survival outcomes in patients. It was shown that dihydromyricetin (DMY) could partly reverse MDR by suppressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein (SORCIN) independently. To reverse MDR more effectively, a new strategy was raised, that is, circumventing MDR by the coadministration of DMY and ondansetron (OND), a common antiemetic drug, during cancer chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the interior relation between P-gp and SORCIN was also revealed. The combination of DMY and OND strongly enhanced antiproliferative efficiency of adriamycin (ADR) because of the increasing accumulation of ADR in K562/ADR-resistant cell line. DMY could downregulate the expression of SORCIN and P-gp via the ERK/Akt pathways, whereas OND could not. In addition, it was proved that SORCIN suppressed ERK and Akt to inhibit P-gp by the silence of SORCIN, however, not vice versa. Finally, the combination of DMY, OND, and ADR led to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via resuming P53 function and restraining relevant proteins expression. These fundamental findings provided a promising approach for further treatment of MDR.",['NOTNLM'],"['*P-glycoprotein (P-gp)', '*dihydromyricetin (DMY)', '*multidrug resistance (MDR)', '*ondansetron (OND)', '*soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein (SORCIN)']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4474-6966', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0699-8452']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its delivery is challenging due to its instability. Current approach reports the development and characterization of bendamustine encapsulated PLGA nanoparticles for the effective targeting to leukemic cells. METHODS: The prepared, bendamustine loaded PLGA nanoparticles (BLPNP) were developed and characterized for particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index. The formed nanoparticles were further characterized with the help of electron microscopy for surface morphology. The formed nanoparticles were evaluated for cytotoxicity, cell uptake, ROS and cell apoptosis against THP-1 leukemic cells as a part of in vitro evaluation. In vivo organ bio-distribution and tumor regression studies were performed to track in vivo behaviour of BLPNP. RESULTS: The average particle size was 138.52 +/- 3.25 nm, with 0.192 +/- 0.036 PDI and - 25.4 +/- 1.38 mV zeta potential. TEM images revealed the homogeneous particle size distribution with uniform shape. In vitro release exhibited a sustained drug-release behaviour up to 24 h. Cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells through MTT assay observed IC50 value of 27.8 +/- 2.1 muM for BLPNP compared to pure drug, which was 50.42 +/- 3.4 muM. Moreover, in vitro studies like cell-uptake and cell apoptosis studies further confirmed the higher accumulation of BLPNP in comparison to the pure drug. Organ distribution and tumor regression studies were performed to track in vivo behaviour of bendamustine loaded nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: The overall study described a promising approach in terms of safety, least erythrocytic toxicity, better IC50 value with enhance tumor targeting and regression.",['NOTNLM'],"['PLGA', 'THP-1', 'bendamustine', 'eat', 'nanoparticles']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8947-2749'],,,['Pharm Res. 2018 Oct 11;35(12):231.

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are stem cell disorders with risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Gene expression profiling reveals transcriptional expression of GLI1, of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, in poor-risk MDS/AML. Using a murine model of MDS we demonstrated that constitutive Hh/Gli1 activation accelerated leukemic transformation and decreased overall survival. Hh/Gli1 activation resulted in clonal expansion of phenotypically defined granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) and acquisition of self-renewal potential in a non-self-renewing progenitor compartment. Transcriptome analysis of GMPs revealed enrichment in gene signatures of self-renewal pathways, operating via direct Gli1 activation. Using human cell lines we demonstrated that in addition to canonical Hh signaling, GLI1 is activated in a Smoothened-independent manner. GLI1 knockdown or inhibition with GANT61 resulted in decreased proliferation and clonogenic potential. Our data suggest that GLI1 activation is frequent in MDS during disease progression and inhibition of GLI1 is an attractive therapeutic target for a subset of patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of this mutant enzyme in silico, in vitro, and in vivo using gene edited cell lines. The E1099K mutation altered enzyme/substrate binding and enhanced the rate of H3K36 methylation. As a result, cell lines harboring E1099K exhibit increased H3K36 dimethylation and reduced H3K27 trimethylation, particularly on nucleosomes containing histone H3.1. Mutant NSD2 cells exhibit reduced apoptosis and enhanced proliferation, clonogenicity, adhesion, and migration. In mouse xenografts, mutant NSD2 cells are more lethal and brain invasive than wildtype cells.

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"Acquired docetaxel-resistance of prostate cancer (PCa) remains a clinical obstacle due to the lack of effective therapies. Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) is a pentacyclic triterpenic acid isolated from the fragrant gum resin of the Boswellia serrata tree, which has shown intriguing antitumor activity against human cell lines established from PCa, colon cancer, malignant glioma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the effects of AKBA against docetaxel-resistant PCa in vitro and in vivo as well as its anticancer mechanisms. We showed that AKBA dose-dependently inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant PC3/Doc cells; its IC50 value in anti-proliferation was approximately 17 muM. Furthermore, AKBA dose-dependently suppressed the chemoresistant stem cell-like properties of PC3/Doc cells, evidenced by significant decrease in the ability of mammosphere formation and down-regulated expression of a number of stemness-associated genes. The activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling pathways was remarkably enhanced in PC3/Doc cells, which contributed to their chemoresistant stem-like phenotype. AKBA (10-30 muM) dose-dependently suppressed the activation of Akt and Stat3 signaling pathways in PC3/Doc cells. In contrast, overexpression of Akt and Stat3 significantly attenuated the inhibition of AKBA on PC3/Doc cell proliferation. In docetaxel-resistant PCa homograft mice, treatment with AKBA significantly suppresses the growth of homograft RM-1/Doc, equivalent to its human PC3/Doc, but did not decrease their body weight. In summary, we demonstrate that AKBA inhibits the growth inhibition of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells in vitro and in vivo via blocking Akt and Stat3 signaling, thus suppressing their cancer stem cell-like properties.",['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'Stat3', 'acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid', 'chemoresistant stem cell-like properties', 'docetaxel-resistance', 'prostate cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML with complex karyotype confers a particularly poor prognosis and is associated with morphologic dysplasia. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCI) has been investigated in defining dysplasia within myelodysplastic syndromes, but little is known about immunophenotypic dysplasia in AML and correlation with genetic abnormalities. This study aimed to explore differences in antigen expression by FCI in AML with complex karyotype (AML-CK) and AML with complex karyotype and TP53 mutations (AML-TP53) compared with AML with normal karyotype (AML-NK). METHODS: Twenty-five cases of AML-CK, 13 of which had abnormalities of TP53, were compared with 83 cases of AML-NK using FCI. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated brighter expression of CD34 with decreased CD33 and aberrant expression of CD5 in blasts of AML-CK, while AML-TP53 blasts exhibited brighter expression of CD13. Granulocytes in AML-CK exhibited brighter expression of CD5, CD7, CD10 and CD14, with brighter CD3 also seen in AML-TP53. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that immunophenotypic dysplasia correlates with complex karyotype and TP53 mutation, including increased expression of T-cell antigens.",['NOTNLM'],"['leukaemia, flow cytometry, myelodysplasia, immunophenotyping of leukaemias', 'lymphomas, genetics']",,,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"AIMS: Congenital and cyclical neutropenia are rare inherited diseases that result in recurrent life-threatening bacterial infections due to a deficiency of mature neutrophils. Cyclical neutropenia is usually caused by heterozygous ELANE mutations while congenital neutropenia is genetically heterogeneous with mutations in genes like ELANE, HAX-1, G6PC3 and GFI1. The presence of ELANE mutation aids in the establishment of diagnosis and rules out other secondary causes of neutropenia such as autoimmune cytopenia and evolving aplasia. Further, patients with ELANE mutations are also at a high risk of developing myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukaemia. Hence it is important to screen for these mutations in patients presenting with neutropenia early in life. METHODS: The study included 52 patients who were evaluated for inherited neutropenia. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes and mutation analysis was done by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Ten different missense, frameshift or splice site variants in ELANE gene were identified in 11 patients: c.125C>T (p.Pro42Leu), c.164G>A (p.Cys55Tyr), c.169G>A (p.Ala57Thr), c.179T>C (p.Ile60Thr), c.770C>T (p.Pro257Leu), c.367-8C>A, c.597+1G>A along with three novel mutations c.302T>A (p.Val101Glu), c.468G>T (p.Try156Cys) and c.596delT (Phe199Ser fs*13). Family studies were available for three patients and, in all three instances, the mutation had a de novo origin. CONCLUSION: The widespread distribution of mutations suggests the need to screen all the exons in ELANE gene for proper characterisation of the genotype.",['NOTNLM'],"['ELANE', 'Neutropenia', 'de novo', 'infections', 'mutations']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0362-0278'],,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"PURPOSE: STA-1474, prodrug of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor (HSP90i) ganetespib, previously demonstrated activity in canine preclinical models of cancer; interestingly, prolonged infusions were associated with improved biologic activity. The purpose of this study was to identify the ideal treatment schedule for HSP90i in preclinical models of KIT-driven malignancies and in dogs with spontaneous mast cell tumors (MCT), where KIT is a known driver. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In vitro and murine xenograft experiments and clinical studies in dogs with MCTs were used to define the effects of HSP90i-dosing regimen on client protein downregulation and antitumor activity. RESULTS: Continuous HSP90 inhibition led to durable destabilization of client proteins in vitro; however, transient exposure required >10x drug for comparable effects. In vivo, KIT was rapidly degraded following a single dose of HSP90i but returned to baseline levels within a day. HSP90 levels increased and stabilized 16 hours after HSP90i and were not elevated following a subsequent near-term exposure, providing a functional pool of chaperone to stabilize proteins and a means for greater therapeutic activity upon HSP90i reexposure. HSP90i administered on days 1 and 2 (D1/D2) demonstrated increased biologic activity compared with D1 treatment in KIT or EGFR-driven murine tumor models.

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"Hematologic responses to hypomethylating agents are often delayed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia. Fetal hemoglobin is a potential novel bio-marker of response: recently, we demonstrated that a high fetal hemoglobin level prior to decitabine treatment was associated with superior outcome. Here we investigated whether early fetal hemoglobin induction during decitabine treatment also had prognostic value, and studied the potential of decitabine to induce erythroid differentiation and fetal hemoglobin expression in vitro Fetal hemoglobin levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in patients with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (n=16) and acute myeloid leukemia (n=37) before treatment and after each course of decitabine. Levels above 1.0% were considered induced. Patients achieving complete or partial remission as best response had attained a median fetal hemoglobin of 1.9% after two courses of treatment, whereas the median value in patients who did not reach complete or partial remission was 0.8% (P=0.015). Fetal hemoglobin induction after two courses of decitabine treatment was associated with early platelet doubling (P=0.006), and its subsequent decrease with hematologic relapse. In patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, induction of fetal hemoglobin after course 2 of treatment was associated with longer overall survival: median of 22.9 versus 7.3 months in patients with or without induction of fetal hemoglobin, respectively [hazard ratio=0.2 (95% confidence interval: 0.1-0.9); P=0.03]. In vitro decitabine treatment of two bi-potential myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562 and HEL) resulted in induction of an erythroid (not megakaryocytic) differentiation program, and of fetal hemoglobin mRNA and protein, associated with GATA1 gene demethylation and upregulation. In conclusion, fetal hemoglobin may provide a useful dynamic biomarker during hypomethylating agent therapy in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"Fusion genes involving MEF2D have recently been identified in precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mutually exclusive of the common risk stratifying genetic abnormalities, although their true incidence and associated clinical characteristics remain unknown. We identified 16 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 1 of lymphoma harboring MEF2D fusions, including MEF2D-BCL9 (n=10), MEF2D-HNRNPUL1 (n=6), and one novel MEF2D-HNRNPH1 fusion. The incidence of MEF2D fusions overall was 2.4% among consecutive precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients enrolled onto a single clinical trial. They frequently showed a cytoplasmic mu chain-positive pre-B immunophenotype, and often expressed an aberrant CD5 antigen. Besides up- and down-regulation of HDAC9 and MEF2C, elevated GATA3 expression was also a characteristic feature of MEF2D fusion-positive patients. Mutations of PHF6, recurrent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also showed an unexpectedly high frequency (50%) in these patients. MEF2D fusion-positive patients were older (median age 9 years) with elevated WBC counts (median: 27,300/ml) at presentation and, as a result, were mostly classified as NCI high risk. Although they responded well to steroid treatment, MEF2D fusion-positive patients showed a significantly worse outcome, with 53.3% relapse and subsequent death. Stem cell transplantation was ineffective as salvage therapy. Interestingly, relapse was frequently associated with the presence of CDKN2A/CDKN2B gene deletions. Our observations indicate that MEF2D fusions comprise a distinct subgroup of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a characteristic immunophenotype and gene expression signature, associated with distinct clinical features.",,,,,,,,"[""Tokyo Children's Cancer Study Group (TCCSG)""]",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"Great effort is spent on developing therapies to improve the dire outcomes of those diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. The methods for quantifying response to therapeutic intervention have however lacked sensitivity. Patients achieving a complete remission as defined by conventional cytomorphological methods therefore remain at risk of subsequent relapse due to disease persistence. Improved risk stratification is possible based on tests designed to detect this residual leukemic burden (measurable residual disease). However, acute myeloid leukemia is a genetically diverse set of diseases, which has made it difficult to develop a single, highly reproducible, and sensitive assay for measurable residual disease. Here we present the development of a digital targeted RNA-sequencing-based approach designed to overcome these limitations by detecting all newly approved European LeukemiaNet molecular targets for measurable residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia in a single standardized assay. Iterative modifications and novel bioinformatics approaches resulted in a greater than 100-fold increase in performance compared with commercially available targeted RNA-sequencing approaches and a limit of detection as low as one leukemic cell in 100,000 cells measured, which is comparable to quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, the current gold standard for the detection of measurable residual disease. This assay, which can be customized and expanded, is the first demonstrated use of high-sensitivity RNA-sequencing for measurable residual disease detection in acute myeloid leukemia and could serve as a broadly applicable standardized tool.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 40% of acute myeloid leukemia patients given standard treatment in this cohort had persistent mutations in IDH1/2 Patients with an IDH1/2 mutation had an increased risk of relapse after 1 year of follow-up compared to patients without a detectable IDH1/2 mutation (59% versus 24%; P<0.01). However, a persistent mutation was not associated with a shorter time to relapse. High IDH1/2 mutation burden (mutant allelic frequency >/=10%) did not correlate with relapse rate (77% versus 86% for patients with a low burden, i.e., mutant allelic frequency <10%; P=0.66). Persistent mutations were also observed in NPM1, DNMT3A and FLT3 during remission, but IDH1/2 mutations remained significant in predicting relapse by multivariate analysis. Flow cytometry was comparable and complementary to next-generation sequencing-based assay for predicting relapse.

Epub 2018 Jul 30.,"BACKGROUND: There have been consistent efforts in concomitant administration of chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin beside other more tumor-specific drugs in order to increase sensitivity of tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and reduce necessary chemotherapeutic dosage. Telomerase-targeted therapy for cancer has received great attention because telomerase is expressed in almost all cancer cells but is inactive in most normal somatic cells. The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of telomerase inhibitor MST-312, a chemically modified derivative of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), on doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The pre-B ALL cell lines (NALM-6 and REH) were cultured and treated with MST-312 and doxorubicin, separately and in combination. Cell viability was measured by trypan blue staining and MTT assay. Annexin-V/7-AAD staining by flow cytometry was used for evaluation of apoptosis. Gene expression of hTERT, c-Myc, Bax and Bcl-2, was detected by the quantitative Real-Time PCR. RESULTS: Our results showed that MST-312 exerted dose-dependent short-term cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on pre-B ALL cells. Combination of MST-312 and doxorubicin synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity and apoptosis of both NALM-6 and REH cells. Consistently, apoptosis induction by the combined treatment was associated with significant reduction of Bcl-2, c-Myc and hTERT, and a marked increase of Bax mRNA expression levels, compared with the single treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the synergistic anticancer effect induced by combination of MST-312 and doxorubicin represents a novel treatment strategy for pre-B ALL.",['NOTNLM'],"['Doxorubicin', 'MST-312', 'Telomerase', 'pre-B ALL']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Epub 2018 Jul 29.,"Epigenetic variations can play remarkable roles in different normal and abnormal situations. Such variations have been shown to have a direct role in the pathogenesis of various diseases either through inhibition of tumor suppressor genes or increasing the expression of oncogenes. Enzymes involving in epigenetic machinery are the main actors in tuning the epigenetic-based controls on gene expressions. Aberrant expression of these enzymes can trigger a big chaos in the cellular gene expression networks and finally lead to cancer progression. This situation has been shown in different types of leukemia, where high or low levels of an epigenetic enzyme are partly or highly responsible for involvement or progression of a disease. DNA hypermethylation, different histone modifications, and aberrant miRNA expressions are three main epigenetic variations, which have been shown to play a role in leukemia progression. Epigenetic based treatments now are considered as novel and effective therapies in order to decrease the abnormal epigenetic modifications in patient cells. Different epigenetic-based approaches have been developed and tested to inhibit or reverse the unusual expression of epigenetic agents in leukemia. The reciprocal behavior of miRNAs in the regulation of epigenetic modifiers, while being regulated by them, unlocks a new opportunity in order to design some epigenetic-based miRNAs able to silence or sensitize these effectors in leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Epigenetic therapy', 'Epigenetics', 'Leukemia', 'miRNA']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

RECENT FINDINGS: CMML is a heterogeneous malignant myeloid disorder sharing features of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms and characterized by peripheral blood monocytosis and increased risk of progression to acute leukemia. Its natural course is highly variable and use of CMML-specific prognostic scoring systems is strongly recommended for tailoring treatment. Multiple recent studies have showed that somatic mutations, which are almost always present have a relevant and independent impact on survival but lack a clear role in predicting the response to currently available drugs. SUMMARY: The incorporation of somatic mutations to prognostic scoring systems has improved the prediction of patients' outcomes. Current treatment for CMML remains unsatisfactory. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only curative option but is applicable to a minority of patients. Usually higher-risk patients displaying MDS-like characteristics are treated with hypomethylating agents (HMAs), whereas those with myeloproliferative features generally receive hydroxyurea or HMAs but none of these drugs substantially modify the natural history of CMML. Newer therapies are clearly needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Efforts are underway to assess the global impact of childhood ALL and develop initiatives that can meet the long-term challenge of providing quality care to children with this disease worldwide and improving cure rates globally. This ambitious task will rely on increased collaborative research and international networking so that the therapeutic gains in high-income countries can be translated to patients in low-income and middle-income countries.

Epub 2018 Feb 1.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer stage at diagnosis is crucial for assessing global efforts to increase awareness of childhood cancer and improve outcomes. However, consistent information on childhood cancer stage is absent from population cancer registries worldwide. The Toronto Childhood Cancer Stage Guidelines, compiled through an international consensus process, were designed to provide a standard framework for collection of information on stage at diagnosis of childhood cancers. We aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing the Toronto Guidelines within a national population cancer registry. METHODS: We did a population-based registry study using data from the Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and included data from children aged 0-14 years diagnosed between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2010 with one of 16 childhood cancers listed in the Toronto Guidelines (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumour, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, testicular cancer, ovarian cancer, medulloblastoma, and ependymoma). We extracted data from medical records, and assigned stage according to the Tier 1 criteria (basic) and Tier 2 criteria (more detailed, requiring data from cytology, imaging, and other diagnostic tests, where available) using computer algorithms derived from the Toronto Guidelines. Additionally, expert reviewers independently assigned Tier 2 stage to a random subsample of 160 cases (ten per malignancy type). Feasibility of the guidelines was assessed on the percentage of cases that could be staged, agreement between stage assigned by the algorithms and the expert reviewers, and the mean time (min) taken to collect the required data. FINDINGS: We obtained data for 1412 eligible children. Stage could be assigned according to Tier 2 criteria for 1318 (93%) cases, ranging from 48 (84%) of 57 cases of non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. According to Tier 1 criteria, stage could be assigned for 1329 (94%) cases, ranging from 131 (87%) of 151 cases of acute myeloid leukaemia to 46 (100%) cases of hepatoblastoma. By contrast, stage at diagnosis was recorded by the treating physician for 555 (39%) of the 1412 cases. The computer algorithm assigned the same stage as did one or more independent expert reviewers in 155 (97%) of the 160 cases assessed. The mean time taken to review medical records and extract the required data was 18.0 min (SD 9.5 per case). INTERPRETATION: The Toronto Guidelines provide a highly functional framework that can be used to assign cancer stage at diagnosis using data routinely available in medical records for most childhood cancers. Data on staging have the potential to inform interventions targeting improved diagnosis and survival. FUNDING: Cancer Australia.",,,,,['Lancet Child Adolesc Health. 2018 Mar;2(3):158-159.

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical characteristics of feline acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients diagnosed according to the recent diagnostic criteria for the equivalent canine condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of six cats diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were retrospectively reviewed to extract data on clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes. The lymphoid origin of the tumour cells was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor gene rearrangement, flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Non-specific clinical signs such as lethargy and anorexia were common, and anaemia and thrombocytopenia were also commonly identified. Leucocytosis was observed in four cats and leucopenia was observed in two; the number of lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood samples varied among the cases. Lymphoblasts originated from B-cell lineage in four cats and T-cell lineage in one, and those of another cat were positive for both B-cell marker CD21 and T-cell marker CD8. Five of the six cats were treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, and a partial response was obtained in two. The median overall survival was 55 days (range: 1 to 115). CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia should be considered if lymphoblasts are observed in peripheral blood, even if their number is small. The prognosis for cats that have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is as poor as that for dogs, and further studies are needed to develop effective treatment.",,,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7708-6218'],,,,,,['(c) 2018 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 31.,"BACKGROUND: Survival probability in children, adolescents, and young adults with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has dramatically improved during recent years. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), targeted drugs developed for patients with CML, were introduced in 2001 in England. We here quantify the trends in the ""cure"" proportion according to the year of diagnosis. METHODS: We included all children, adolescents, and young patients with CML (0 to 24 years) diagnosed in England during 1980 to 2005. We fitted mixture cure models to estimate the ""cure"" proportion and the median survival time among the ""uncured"" patients according to the year of diagnosis, adjusted for age at diagnosis. RESULTS: The ""cure"" proportion increased dramatically between 1980 and 2005, from under 10% to over 80%, while conversely, the median survival time of ""uncured"" patients decreased slightly between 1980 and 1999, with the trend from 2000 being uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: The striking improvement of the ""cure"" fraction in young patients with CML since the early 1980s is concomitant with improvement of treatment, especially the allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant and, later, the introduction of TKI. The trends over the last years (2000-2005) remain, however, uncertain and would benefit from further studies with more recent data and updated follow-up.",['NOTNLM'],"['*adolescents and young adults', '*children', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*mixture cure models', '*population-based cure', '*survival', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3010-7525', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9522-8838', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1410-5172']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective: To compare small molecules that induce extrinsic apoptosis in CTCL to identify and analyze compounds that induce high levels of tumor cell death and block tumor cell growth. Design, Setting, and Participants: From November 5, 2014, to January 30, 2018, this study performed high-throughput small molecule screening of 1710 compounds followed by detailed analysis of the ability of gentian violet (GV) to promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of CTCL cells. Exposures: In vitro and ex vivo analyses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting. Main Outcomes and Measures: Apoptosis, cleaved caspases, extrinsic apoptotic death receptors and ligands, cell proliferation, nuclear factor-kappaB expression, and other factors. Results: This study used high-throughput screening to detect cleaved caspase 8 induced in CTCL cells by 1710 unique compounds. The nonprescription, topical antimicrobial remedy GV induced more total apoptosis than did nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine). Furthermore, GV induced 4 to 6 times greater apoptosis in CTCL lines than in normal keratinocytes, suggesting a favorable topical toxicity profile. In addition to increasing caspase 8, GV also upregulated death receptors 4 and 5, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and Fas ligand but not the Fas receptor, TNF receptor, or TNF-alpha ligand. These results are consistent with induction of extrinsic apoptosis via the Fas and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand pathways. Increased phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma1, Ca2+ influx, and reactive oxygen species were also detected, indicating that the mechanism of Fas ligand upregulation involves key elements of the activation-induced cell death pathway. In ex vivo studies, 1-mumol/L GV induced up to 90% CTCL apoptosis in Sezary blood cells. In addition, GV reduced expression of antiapoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 and proproliferative nuclear factor-kappaB components and increased inhibitory kappaB levels. This finding was associated with cell cycle arrest and reduced CTCL tumor cell proliferation. Furthermore, the CTCL killing associated with GV was augmented when used in combination with methotrexate. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that GV attacked tumor viability and growth in CTCL. Although purple at neutral pH, GV can be rendered colorless by altering its pH. These preclinical findings may help to broaden knowledge of the antineoplastic features of GV and provide a rationale for clinical studies of its use as a novel, inexpensive, topical therapy for CTCL that is available worldwide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mechanisms that allow cell differentiation in CML still remain elusive. Here we established tetracycline (Tet)-regulatable p210BCR-ABL-expressing murine 32D myeloid progenitor (32D/TetOff-p210) cells to explore p210BCR-ABL-induced cell death and differentiation. Tet-regulatable overexpression of p210BCR-ABL induced cell death due to the activation of both caspase-1 and caspase-3, coincident with the differentiation from myeloid progenitors into CD11b(+)Ly6C(+)Ly6G(+) cells with segmented nuclei, exemplified as granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC), and the ability to secrete IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and S100A8/A9 into the culture supernatant. Treatment with imatinib almost completely abrogated all these phenotypes. Moreover, overexpression of a sensor of activated caspase-1 based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe enabled us to detect activation of caspase-1 in a human CML cell line, K562. Furthermore, increased numbers of splenic G-MDSC associated with enhancement of S100A8/A9 production were observed in transgenic mice expressing p210BCR-ABL compared with that in wild-type mice. We also propose the novel mode of cell death in this 32D/TetOff-p210 system termed as myeloptosis.",['NOTNLM'],"['Imatinib', 'cell death', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'differentiation', 'p210BCR-ABL']",,,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST All authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, relapses remain important and activation of the complement pathway is one of the mechanisms by which RTX generates the destruction of B cells directly by complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), or indirectly by antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. In this study, the RTX capacity to induce CDC was established in 69 untreated CLL patients, this cohort including 34 patients tested before the initiation of RTX-chemotherapy. In vitro CDC-resistance to RTX predicts lower response rates to RTX-chemotherapy and shorter treatment free survival. Furthermore, the predictive value of CDC-resistance was independent from the clinical, cytogenetic and FcgammaR3A V158F polymorphism status. In contrast, CLL cell resistance to CDC predominates in IGHV unmutated patients and was related to an important alpha2-6 sialyl transferase activity, which in turn increases cell surface alpha2-6 hypersialylation. Suspected factors associated with resistance to CDC (CD20, CD55, CD59, factor H, GM1, and sphingomyelin) were not differentially expressed or recruited between the two CLL groups. Altogether, results provide evidence that testing RTX capacity to induce CDC in vitro represents an independent predictive factor of therapeutic effects of RTX, and that alpha2-6 hypersialylation in CLL cells controls RTX response through the control of the complement pathway. At a time when CLL therapy is moving towards chemo-free treatments, further experiments are required to determine whether performing an initial in vitro assay to appreciate CLL CDC resistance might be useful to select patients.",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'complement-dependent cytotoxicity', 'progression-free survival', 'rituximab', 'sialylation']",,,['Oncotarget. 2018 Aug 28;9(67):32732-32733.

We postulated that cell-cycle kinetics of pre-LSCs may be an important determinant of clonal evolution and therapeutic resistance. Using a doxycycline-inducible H2B-GFP transgene in a mouse model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia to study cell cycle in vivo, we show that self-renewal, clonal evolution and therapeutic resistance are limited to a rare population of pre-LSCs with restricted cell cycle. We show that proliferative pre-LSCs are unable to return to a cell cycle-restricted state. Cell cycle-restricted pre-LSCs have activation of p53 and its downstream cell-cycle inhibitor p21.

Epub 2018 Aug 30.,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the main producers of a key T-cell-stimulatory cytokine, IFNalpha, and critical regulators of antiviral immunity. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by BCR-ABL, which is an oncogenic tyrosine kinase that can be effectively inhibited with ABL-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). BCR-ABL-induced suppression of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 8 was previously proposed to block pDC development and compromise immune surveillance in CML. Here, we demonstrate that pDCs in newly diagnosed CML (CML-pDC) develop quantitatively normal and are frequently positive for the costimulatory antigen CD86. They originate from low-level BCR-ABL-expressing precursors. CML-pDCs also retain their competence to maturate and to secrete IFN. RNA sequencing reveals a strong inflammatory gene expression signature in CML-pDCs. Patients with high CML-pDC counts at diagnosis achieve inferior rates of deep molecular remission (MR) under nilotinib, unless nilotinib therapy is combined with IFN, which strongly suppresses circulating pDC counts. Although most pDCs are BCR-ABL-negative in MR, a substantial proportion of BCR-ABL (+) CML-pDCs persists under TKI treatment. This could be of relevance, because CML-pDCs elicit CD8(+) T cells, which protect wild-type mice from CML. Together, pDCs are identified as novel functional DC population in CML, regulating antileukemic immunity and treatment outcome in CML.Significance: CML-pDC originates from low-level BCR-ABL expressing stem cells into a functional immunogenic DC-population regulating antileukemic immunity and treatment outcome in CML.

Epub 2018 May 11.,"BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants are an important source to identify new active pharmaceutical compounds. Traditionally, the sap of Euphorbia umbellata is widely used to treat cancer and inflammatory conditions. These effects have been attributed to the presence of terpenes and phenolic compounds in the extracts of this plant. Euphol, a tetracyclic triterpene alcohol, is one of the major compounds present in Euphorbia species, and some biological activities have been attributed to this compound. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro cytotoxicity of euphol against Jurkat, HL-60, K-562, B16F10, and HRT-18 cells lines, as well as the biological stability, distribution, metabolism properties in vitro, and the determination of the concentration of euphol in the plasma and liver of rats. METHODS: The MTT reduction assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of euphol against cancer cell lines, and the selectivity index, the morphology and cell cycle assays to evaluate the death mechanisms in K-562 and B16F10 lineages. UHPLC-MS was applied for the in vivo evaluation of the concentration of euphol in plasma and liver, and in vitro metabolic stability in human liver microsomes and S9 fraction, plasma protein binding, and stability in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids assays. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that euphol exhibited cytotoxic effects against a variety of cancer cells lines, selectivity against leukemia and possibly, the mechanism involved is apoptosis. The evaluation of stability, distribution, and metabolism properties showed that euphol was unstable in gastric and intestinal fluids, presenting moderate plasma protein binding with two hours elimination half-life and possible phase II liver metabolism. All the results suggested that further studies could be developed to prove the viability of euphol as an anticancer agent.",['NOTNLM'],"['Cell culture', 'Cytotoxic activity', 'Euphol', 'Euphorbia', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'UHPLC-MS']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

This population has an increased risk of morbimortality, probably secondary to the treatment side effects. The objective was to determine the prevalence and determinants of left ventricular dysfunction in a cohort of long term childhood acute leukemia survivors treated with potentially cardiotoxic therapies. METHODS: Retrospective study with at least 10 years of follow-up, diagnosed between 1999 and 2003. The reduction percentage of the fractional shortening and ejection fraction was calculated from the diagnosis to the end of treatment and 10 years after the end of treatment. The factors associated with their decrease were analyzed. RESULTS: The fractional shortening and ejection fraction experienced a significant decrease 10 years after the end of treatment from 38.16 to 32 and 69.08 to 60.79, respectively. Reduction was more pronounced during the evaluation of the first year after treatment (-10.3% and -8.96%, P <0.05). Associated with high tumor risk and adjuvant treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and total body radiation. No differences were found in the total anthracycline doses received. Patients with the greatest decrease had a lower age at the time of diagnosis (mean 5.7 +/- 4.5 years), 62.5% (5/8) less at 5 years, and 75% received radiotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CONCLUSION: There is already a significant decrease in the fractional shortening and ejection fraction during the first year after the end of the treatment, which is maintained 10 years after the end of treatment.

This disorder is categorized by the presence of autoantibodies that react against proteins, such as desmoplakins, desmogleins, desmocollins, and others that exist in cellular junctions. Paraneoplastic pemphigus can manifest clinically in a variety of ways, ranging from mucositis to lesions involving the skin and pulmonary changes. The diagnosis depends on the correlation between the clinical and histopathologic evaluations. Currently, the treatment of this disease is still very difficult and ineffective. The prognosis is poor, and the mortality rate is very high. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a Caucasian patient who had chronic lymphocytic leukemia and developed paraneoplastic pemphigus with severe impairment of skin and mucosa. The initial diagnostic hypothesis was Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The histopathological examination of the skin biopsy was compatible with paraneoplastic pemphigus, and the definitive diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical-pathological correlation. CONCLUSIONS: With the presence of multiorgan lesions in patients with lymphoproliferative neoplasia, paraneoplastic pemphigus should always be considered among the possible diagnostic hypotheses, because diagnosis and early treatment may allow a better prognosis for the patient.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Paraneoplastic pemphigus', 'Respiratory failure']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4890-1492'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More recently, it was introduced in the setting of non-T cell depleted haploidentical stem cell transplantation (NTD-Haplo). Whether TBF based conditioning provides additional benefit in transplantation from a particular alternative donor type remains to be established. METHODS: This was a retrospective study based on an international European registry. We compared outcomes of de-novo acute myeloid leukemia patients in complete remission receiving NTD-Haplo (n = 186) vs. SUCBT (n = 147) following myeloablative conditioning (MAC) with TBF. Median follow-up was 23 months. Treatment groups resembled in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: SUCBT was associated with delayed engraftment and higher graft failure. In multivariate analysis no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (HR = 1.03, p = 0.92 or HR = 1.86, p = 0.21) and relapse incidence (HR = 0.8, p = 0.65). Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was significantly higher in SUCBT as compared to NTD-Haplo (HR = 2.63, p = 0.001); moreover, SUCBT did worse in terms of overall survival (HR = 2.18, p = 0.002), leukemia-free survival (HR = 1.94, p = 0.007), and GvHD relapse-free survival (HR = 2.38, p = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that TBF-MAC might allow for a potent graft-versus-leukemia, regardless of the alternative donor type. Furthermore, in patients receiving TBF-MAC, survival with NTD-Haplo may be better compared to SUCBT due to decreased NRM.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Conditioning regimens', '*Haploidentical stem cell transplantation', '*Stem cell transplantation', '*Thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine', '*Umbilical cord blood transplantation']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9827-8032'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 29.,"Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) contain a sub-population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are responsible for tumor relapse, metastasis, and chemoresistance. We recently showed that loss of macroH2A1, a variant of the histone H2A and an epigenetic regulator of stem-cell function, in HCC leads to CSC-like features such as resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and growth of large and relatively undifferentiated tumors in xenograft models. These HCC cells silenced for macroH2A1 also exhibited stem-like metabolic changes consistent with enhanced glycolysis. However, there is no consensus as to the metabolic characteristics of CSCs that render them adaptable to microenvironmental changes by conveniently shifting energy production source or by acquiring intermediate metabolic phenotypes. Here, we assessed long-term proliferation, energy metabolism, and central carbon metabolism in human hepatoma HepG2 cells depleted in macroH2A1. MacroH2A1-depleted HepG2 cells were insensitive to serum exhaustion and showed two distinct, but interdependent changes in glucose and lipid metabolism in CSCs: (1) massive upregulation of acetyl-coA that is transformed into enhanced lipid content and (2) increased activation of the pentose phosphate pathway, diverting glycolytic intermediates to provide precursors for nucleotide synthesis. Integration of metabolomic analyses with RNA-Seq data revealed a critical role for the Liver X Receptor pathway, whose inhibition resulted in attenuated CSCs-like features. These findings shed light on the metabolic phenotype of epigenetically modified CSC-like hepatic cells, and highlight a potential approach for selective therapeutic targeting.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Histone variants', '*cancer stem cells', '*hepatocellular carcinoma']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7497-0657', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0434-8533', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1768-3894']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative effectiveness of tumor staging systems for CSCC in a well-defined cohort of patients with CLL. METHODS: This retrospective outcomes study included 454 CSCC tumors among 161 patients with underlying CLL who were evaluated at a single academic medical center. Each tumor was staged according to Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), Union for International Cancer Control eighth edition (UICC8), and American Joint Committee on Cancer seventh edition (AJCC7) and eighth edition (AJCC8) criteria. We compared the effectiveness of tumor risk stratification according to each system. RESULTS: The BWH tumor staging system demonstrated superior risk stratification relative to the AJCC7 criteria (C-index, 0.725 vs 0.615; P = .036) and trended toward improved stratification relative to the AJCC8 (C-index, 0.796 vs 0.732; P = .214) and UICC8 (C-index, 0.725 vs 0.636; P = .096) staging systems.

Epub 2018 Aug 28.,"Hematological malignancies (HM) are a collection of malignant transformations originating from cells in the primary or secondary lymphoid organs. Leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma comprise the three major types of HM. Current treatment consists of bone marrow transplantation, radiotherapy, immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Although, many chemotherapeutic drugs are clinically available for the treatment of HM, the use of these agents is limited due to dose-related toxicity and lack of specificity to tumor tissue. Moreover, the poor pharmacokinetic profile of most of the chemotherapeutics requires high dosage and frequent administration to maintain therapeutic levels at the target site, both increasing adverse effects. This underlines an urgent need for a suitable drug delivery system to improve efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties of conventional therapeutics. Nanomedicines have proven to enhance these properties for anticancer therapeutics. The most extensively studied nanomedicine systems are lipid-based nanoparticles and polymeric nanoparticles. Typically, nanomedicines are small sub-micron sized particles in the size range of 20-200 nm. The biocompatible and biodegradable nature of nanomedicines makes them attractive vehicles to improve drug delivery. Their small size allows them to extravasate and accumulate at malignant sites passively by means of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, resulting from rapid angiogenesis and inflammation. Moreover, the specificity to the target tissue can be further enhanced by surface modification of nanoparticles. This review describes currently available therapies as well as limitations and potential advantages of nanomedicine formulations for treatment of various types of HM. Additionally, recent investigational and approved nanomedicine formulations and their limited applications in HM are discussed.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone marrow microenvironment', '*Drug delivery', '*Hematological malignancies', '*Liposomes', '*Micelles', '*Nanomedicines']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epub 2018 Aug 28.,"PURPOSE: Long-term survivors of Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteosarcoma may be at risk for therapy-related acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (t-AL/MDS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics of 1071 patients with osteosarcoma (n = 757) and ES (n = 314) who were treated between 1985 and 2014. Multivariable competing risk analysis was used to analyze predictors of t-AL/MDS, including a radiation dose (>/=55.8 Gy vs <55.8 Gy) x disease site (pelvis/spine vs other) interaction term. A supplemental nested case-control study was conducted to assess the association between cumulative chemotherapy dose and t-AL/MDS. RESULTS: The median follow-up for surviving patients was 97 months (range, 0.03-380). Twenty patients developed t-AL/MDS, all of whom received chemotherapy and 15 of whom were treated with radiation therapy. Radiation therapy to >/=55.8 Gy was associated with development of t-AL/MDS (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-6.80; P = .015), and there was a significant radiation dose x disease site interaction term (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.70; 95% CI, 2.71-16.53; Pinteraction < .001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of t-AL/MDS in patients receiving >/=55.8 Gy radiation therapy to the pelvis or spine was 5.0% (95% CI, 0.9-14.9) for osteosarcoma and 10.7% for ES (95% CI, 3.3-23.2). In our nested case-control study, cumulative doses of ifosfamide and etoposide were associated with development of t-AL/MDS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with osteosarcoma and ES receiving >/=55.8 Gy of radiation therapy to the pelvis or spine appear to be at increased risk for t-AL/MDS. Treatment with high cumulative doses of chemotherapy may further augment this risk.",,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of each CBC parameter, differential and the neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score using CML and non-CML cases were generated to determine effective cut-off values. They were applied to the review of randomly-selected 45,608 samples for validation. RESULTS: The leukocyte count showed the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC) value (0.909) among the CBC parameters. In the absolute counts of differentials, the AUC was the highest in basophils (0.982), followed by immature granulocytes (IGs) (0.975), which had cut-off values of 0.43x10(9)/L and 0.46x10(9)/L, respectively. The AUC of the NAP score was 0.963 at a cut-off value 122. In the validation, the absolute basophil counts were elevated in 280 samples from 96 cases, including 22 CML cases. In contrast, the absolute IG counts were elevated in 1310 samples from 516 cases, including only 17 CML cases. Three newly-diagnosed CML cases whose data were analyzed sequentially at the CML onset consistently met the basophil criteria before the IG criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute basophil count is effective for screening for CML.",['NOTNLM'],"['Basophils', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'Immature granulocytes', 'Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score', 'Screening']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of our study was to assess the screening rates of HIV, hepatitis B and C, syphilis and human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 among newly-arrived persons in 2014, at Ducos facility in Martinique and the testing process performance. METHODS: This is an observational monocentric study conducted within the prison's health unit. The study population consisted of all individuals incarcerated between 01/01/14 and 31/12/14. At the initial medical visit, HIV and STI testing were proposed to every newcomer. The rate of acceptance was calculated, as well as the screening process performance. RESULTS: In 2014 778 new persons were incarcerated, among those, 461 (59.3%) were tested. The main reasons for missing the testing opportunity were due to organization of the judiciary system (persons on electronic monitoring or day parole, transferred or quickly released before completion of the process) or to individual refusal. Finally, 75 persons did not get their results (all of them negative), 41 of them due to the medical staff work overload. CONCLUSIONS: HIV and STI testing rates among newcomers at Ducos have notable room for improvement. The future availability of combined (HIV, HBV, HCV and syphilis) rapid tests may be very useful in case of short term incarceration, if their cost is not prohibitive. Reaching higher levels of testing will also require more resources.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6345-497X'],,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UCP2 is a mitochondrial carrier protein that creates proton leaks across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Several studies revealed that UCP2 is broadly over-expressed in leukemia, colorectal, lung, ovarian, prostate, testicular, and bladder cancers. However, the effect of genipin still needs to be elucidated in neurological malignancies. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effect of genipin in U87MG and A172 cell lines. The anticancer effect of genipin on these cell lines was measured by microculture tetrazoliumtest (MTT), Trypan blue exclusion, and colony formation assays, in the presence of various concentrations of genipin at different time intervals. We assessed apoptosis and measure intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry. Expression of UCP2 and some of the genes involved in apoptosis was analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results of the MTT assay showed that genipin moderately reduced metabolic activity of both cell lines in dose- and time-dependent manner. Result of Trypan blue exclusion test indicated that the viable cell count decreased in the treated group in a concentration-dependent manner. Genipin also significantly decreased colony formation ability of these cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Result of morphological changes showed that there were significant differences in cell number and morphology in treated groups as compared with the untreated groups. Flow cytometric analysis of U87MG and A172 cells with annexin V/propidium iodide staining, 48 hours after treatment with genipin, displays 22.4% and 26.1% apoptotic population, respectively, in treated cells, in comparison to 7.42% and 9.31% apoptotic cells of untreated cells. After treatment, UCP2 and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL 2 ) genes are downregulated, and BCL 2 associated X protein, BCL 2 antagonist/killer, BCL 2 interacting killer, and Cytochrome c genes are upregulated. Genipin treatment increased mitochondrial ROS levels and also induced apoptosis through caspase-3 upregulation. In conclusion, the antiproliferative effects of genipin on the growth of both glioblastoma cell lines have been shown in all of these assays, and genipin profoundly induced apoptosis in both cell lines via the UCP2-related mitochondrial pathway through the induction of intracellular ROS.",['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'genipin', 'glioblastoma', 'uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0989-4448', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1314-3225', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7687-7464', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6769-6389']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 20.,"Intravenous arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been adopted as the first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Another arsenic compound named the Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (RIF), an oral traditional Chinese medicine containing As4 S4 , has been shown to be highly effective in treating adult APL. In the treatment of pediatric APL, the safety and efficacy of RIF remains to be confirmed. This randomized, multicenter, and noninferiority trial was conducted to determine whether intravenous ATO can be substituted by oral RIF in the treatment of pediatric APL. From September 2011 to January 2017, among 92 patients who were 16 years old or younger with newly diagnosed PML-RARa positive APL, 82 met eligible criteria and were randomly assigned to ATO (n = 42) or RIF (n = 40) group. The remaining 10 patients did not fulfilled eligible criteria because five did not accept randomization, four died and one had hemiplegia prior to arsenic randomization due to intracranial hemorrhage or cerebral thrombosis. Induction and consolidation treatment contained ATO or RIF, all-trans-retinoic acid and low intensity chemotherapy. End points included event-free survival (EFS), adverse events and hospital days. After a median 3-year follow-up, the estimated 5-year EFS was 100% in both groups, and adverse events were mild. However, patients in the RIF group had significantly less hospital stay than those in the ATO group. This interim analysis shows that oral RIF is as effective and safe as intravenous ATO for the treatment of pediatric APL, with the advantage of reducing hospital stay.

Anti-CD20 antibodies such as ofatumumab, which have been developed for cancer treatment and has demonstrated efficacy in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are among the most successful therapies to date. Rational engineering methods can be applied with reasonable success to improve functional characteristics of antibodies. Considering the importance of this issue, we have used in silico modeling approach for the improvement of ofatumumab monoclonal antibody. Four mutated variants of ofatumumab were developed and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells along with the unmodified antibody. Analysis of affinity of the purified antibodies with CD20 showed significant improvement in antigen-binding characteristics of one of the variants compared with the control antibody. This study represents the first step toward development of the second generation ofatumumab antibody with improved affinity.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD20', '*affinity binding', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*monoclonal antibodies', '*ofatumumab']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2565-8231', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9720-5904', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4003-9618', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3296-5881', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2268-6544', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9427-0770']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (Cy/TBI) has emerged as a standard myeloablative regimen but is associated with significant toxicity. We compared outcomes between patients undergoing transplant for ALL at centers using Cy/TBI as standard of care and another center using fludarabine, busulfan, and low-dose TBI (400 cGy) in combination with anti-thymocyte globulin as its standard. Among 146 patients (74 Cy/TBI and 72 Flu/Bu/TBI) there were no significant differences in overall or progression-free survival between groups. Non-relapse mortality was similar (12% vs. 16.7% for Cy/TBI and Flu/Bu/TBI, respectively, p = .62) despite the Flu/Bu/TBI group having significantly worse performance status. Flu/Bu/TBI resulted in significantly lower cumulative incidence of relapse compared with Cy/TBI (2-year point estimate 18.5% vs. 31.5%, p = .05). These results demonstrate similar outcomes for patients receiving Flu/Bu/TBI versus Cy/TBI.

Epub 2018 Aug 29.,"This paper on the biological tests carried out on serum/plasma samples from donors of human body material (HBM) is the result of a project of the working Group of Superior Health Council of Belgium formed with experts in the field of HBM and infectious serology. Indeed, uncertainty about the interpretation of biological test results currently leads to the sometimes unjustified cancelling of planned donations or the rejection of harvested HBM, whilst more sophisticated diagnostic algorithms would still allow the use of organs or HBM that would otherwise have been rejected. NAT tests will not be discussed in this publication. In the first part some general aspects as the need for a formal agreement between the Tissue Establishment l and the laboratory responsible for the biological testing, but also some specifications regarding testing material, the choice of additional biological tests, and some general aspects concerning interpretation and reporting are discussed. In a second part, detailed information and recommendations concerning the interpretation are presented for each of the mandatory tests (human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and syphilis) is presented. A number of not mandatory, but regularly used optional serological tests (e.g. for the detection of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Epstein-Barr virus, human T cell leukemia virus and cytomegalovirus) are also extensively discussed. Although the project was meant to provide clarification and recommendations concerning the Belgian legislation, the majority of recommendations are also applicable to testing of donors of tissues and cells in other (European) countries.",['NOTNLM'],"['Biological test', 'Donor of human body material', 'Interpretation', 'Reporting']",,,,['Cell Tissue Bank. 2018 Oct 26;:.

In 2007, a pivotal phase-2 study of dasatinib as second-line treatment was initiated in 140 Chinese CML patients. This report from the 4-year follow-up revealed that 73% of 59 patients in chronic phase (CML-CP) and 32% of 25 patients in accelerated phase (CML-AP) remained under treatment. The initial dosage of dasatinib for CML-CP and CML-AP patients were 100 mg once daily and 70 mg twice daily (total = 140 mg/ day), respectively. The cumulative major cytogenetic response (MCyR) rate among patients with CML-CP was 66.1% (versus 50.8% at 18 months), and the median time to MCyR was 12.7 weeks. All CML-CP patients who achieved MCyR after a 4-year follow-up also achieved a complete cytogenetic response. The cumulative complete hematological response (CHR) rate among patients with CML-AP was 64% (16/25), with three CML-AP patients achieving CHR between 18 months and 4 years of follow-up; the median time to CHR was 16.4 weeks. The adverse event (AE) profile of dasatinib at 4 years was similar to that at 6 and 18 months. The most frequently reported AEs (any grade) included pleural effusion, headache, and myelosuppression.

A total of 23 patients received HLA-matched sibling donor transplantation (MSDT) and 67 patients received unmanipulated haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) were analyzed in this study. Patients were divided into four groups based on CBFbeta/MYH11 expression prior to transplantation (pre-MRD): with negative (group 1)/positive (group 2) pre-MRD before MSDT; with negative (group 3)/positive (group 4) pre-MRD before haplo-HSCT. The results showed that patients in group 2 had the highest cumulative incidence of relapse (2-year CIR, 40.7%), the lowest leukemia-free survival (2-year LFS, 50.8%), and overall survival (2-year OS, 62.5%). The other three groups of patients had comparable outcomes. The patients were also classified into the other three groups according to CBFbeta/MYH11 value of + 1 month after transplantation: group 5: pre- and post-transplant MRD were both negative; group 6: the value of post-transplant MRD was lower than 0.2%; group 7: the value of post-transplant MRD was higher than 0.2%. Group 7 had the highest CIR and the lowest LFS. These results indicated that AML patients with inv(16) were able to be separated into high-risk and low-risk relapse groups based on peritransplant MRD determined by RQ-PCR-based CBFbeta/MYH11.

Epub 2018 Jun 13.,"The therapeutic effect of targeted kinase inhibitors can be significantly reduced by intrinsic or acquired resistance mutations that modulate the affinity of the drug for the kinase. In cancer, the majority of missense mutations are rare, making it difficult to predict their impact on inhibitor affinity. This complicates the practice of precision medicine, pairing of patients with clinical trials, and development of next-generation inhibitors. Here, we examine the potential for alchemical free-energy calculations to predict how kinase mutations modulate inhibitor affinities to Abl, a major target in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). We find these calculations can achieve useful accuracy in predicting resistance for a set of eight FDA-approved kinase inhibitors across 144 clinically-identified point mutations, achieving a root mean square error in binding free energy changes of 1.10.91.3 kcal/mol (95% confidence interval) and correctly classifying mutations as resistant or susceptible with 888293% accuracy. Since these calculations are fast on modern GPUs, this benchmark establishes the potential for physical modeling to collaboratively support the rapid assessment and anticipation of the potential for patient mutations to affect drug potency in clinical applications.",,,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0542-119X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATLL is typically preceded by decades of clinical latency during which infected cells accumulate selectable traits leading to a malignant transformation. Amongst all the HTLV-1 infected carriers only about 3-5% will develop ATLL. Despite the intensive attempt to improve the overall survival, ATLL remains one of worse prognosis among the hematologic malignancies. FMS like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations are mutations which are frequent among leukemic patients. We aimed to investigate the frequency of FLT3 mutation status in patients with acute type of ATLL which has not been studied yet. Methods: In this case control study 38 patients with acute type of ATLL were retrospectively analyzed between February 2015 and February 2017. Forty HTLV-1 positive patients were also used as control cases. Genomic DNA was extracted according to phenolchloroform protocol and two restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) PCR reactions were set up to detect FLT3/ ITD and FLT3/TKD mutations. Differences between variables were evaluated by the chi-square test and t test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. SPSS software v. 15 was used for statistical analysis. All P values were two sided and values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant. Results: No FLT3 mutations were detected in acute type of ATLL patients. So far, not many studies have shown the frequency of FLT3 mutation in ATLL patients Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that although FLT3 mutations are rather unusual in the acute type of ATLL patients, but other alternative mechanisms associated with ATLL remain to be further investigated. This study was a novel project regarding the analysis of FLT3 mutation in the field of ATLL research.",['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T cell leukemia', 'Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1', 'Iran']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of EMA/EP (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin-D, etoposide, and cisplatin) regimen in the treatment of high-risk GTN as well as patients' outcome. Methods: Hospital charts of all patients with confirmed diagnosis of high-risk GTN who received EMA/EP regimen treatment during a 12-year period (2001-2012) at the tertiary center of comprehensive women's hospital in Tehran, Iran, were reviewed from 2012 to 2013, retrospectively. Results: In this study, 25 patients with GTN who were treated with EMA/EP regimen during the study were identified. Complete remission rate in GTN patients with failure of single agent chemotherapy who were treated with EMA/EP regimen, as the first- line treatment, was 100%, while it was 81% in those with primary high-risk GTN. Overall remission rate in high-risk GTN patients treated with EMA/EP regimen was 88%. Anemia (92%) and leucopenia (72%) were the most common adverse effects of EMA/EP chemotherapy regimen. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and mortality, as the most severe adverse effects of EMA/EP regimen, were seen only in 1 patient. Conclusion: According to the results, EMA/EP regimen could induce complete remission in 88% of patients with high-risk GTN.

Only isolated case reports in the literature described the association between CLL and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) in the same patient. Objectives: We describe a case of CLL characterized by the development of PMF and a review of literature. Methods: We describe an 86-year-old female diagnosed as having CLL and followed by the development of splenomegaly and progressively rising LDH levels 27 months later. A bone marrow biopsy was consistent with the diagnosis of PMF, with positive JAK-2 V617F mutation. We also review the clinical and molecular characteristics of patients with CLL and PMF. Results: Patients with CLL and PMF are usually older. A lead diagnosis of CLL harbored by PMF is the most common clinical course, although concomitant diseases may occur in 31.7% of patients. JAK-2 V617F mutation can be found in 48.7% of patients. Conclusion: This case reported here constitutes an unusual situation of CLL characterized by the development of PMF. Etiologic and pathogenic associations-the role of t (1; 6) and JAK-2 V617F mutation-are discussed.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-0177-908X'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MiRNAs have been involved in regulating gene expression and diverse physiological and pathological processes. Several studies have reported that miR-30a, situated on chromosome 6q.13, is produced by an intronic transcriptional unit. Moreover, miR-30a has demonstrated its role in biological processes, including inhibiting proliferation and metastasis in many tumors, autophagy in chronic myelogenous leukemia, and regulating TGF-b1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. However, based on the pathogenetic relationship between miR-30a and cancer in tumorigenesis, we believe that miR-30a may serve as tumor promising biomarker.

The surroundings of HSCs in the bone marrow create a specific niche or microenvironment where HSCs nest that allows them to retain their unique characteristics and respond rapidly to external stimuli. Ageing is accompanied by reduced regenerative capacity of the organism affecting all systems, due to the progressive decline of stem cell functions. This includes blood and HSCs, which contributes to age-related haematological disorders, anaemia, and immunosenescence, among others. Furthermore, chronological ageing is characterised by myeloid and platelet HSC skewing, inflammageing, and expanded clonal haematopoiesis, which may be the result of the accumulation of preleukaemic lesions in HSCs. Intriguingly, haematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukaemia have a high incidence among elderly patients, yet not all individuals with clonal haematopoiesis develop leukaemias. Here, we discuss recent work on these aspects, their potential underlying molecular mechanisms, and the first cues linking age-related changes in the HSC niche to poor HSC maintenance. Future work is needed for a better understanding of haematopoiesis during ageing. This field may open new avenues for HSC rejuvenation and therapeutic strategies in the elderly.",['NOTNLM'],"['ageing', 'bone marrow', 'clonal haematopoiesis', 'haematopoiesis', 'haematopoietic stem cell niche', 'inflammageing', 'leukaemia']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5896-4238'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 29.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can evade the mouse and human innate immune system by suppressing natural killer (NK) cell development and NK cell function. This is driven in part by the overexpression of microRNA (miR)-29b in the NK cells of AML patients, but how this occurs is unknown. In the current study, we demonstrate that the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) directly regulates miR-29b expression. We show that human AML blasts activate the AHR pathway and induce miR-29b expression in NK cells, thereby impairing NK cell maturation and NK cell function, which can be reversed by treating NK cells with an AHR antagonist. Finally, we show that inhibition of constitutive AHR activation in AML blasts lowers their threshold for apoptosis and decreases their resistance to NK cell cytotoxicity. Together, these results identify the AHR pathway as a molecular mechanism by which AML impairs NK cell development and function. The results lay the groundwork in establishing AHR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents for clinical development in the treatment of AML.",,,,,['Blood. 2018 Oct 25;132(17):1733-1734.

efforts have been devoted toward the uncovering of the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by the normal bone marrow (BM) niche. Previously, we demonstrated that a chemotherapy-induced niche, which is mainly composed of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), protects the residual B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells from the insult of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, the roles of chemotherapy-induced niche on HSCs functions in B-ALL remain unclear. METHODS: We established an oncogenic N-MYC-driven B-ALL mouse model, which were subsequently treated with common chemotherapy drug cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin (DNR). After treatment, the structures of the BM niche were imaged by immunofluorescence staining. Then, the self-renewal and differentiation capability of the MSCs in the BM after Ara-C and DNR treatment were studied by ex vivo culture and gene expression analysis with RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. The effects of chemotherapy-induced niche on the hematopoietic reconstitution of HSCs were determined with series transplantation assay. Furthermore, the cell cycle, ROS level, mitochondrial membrane potential and cell apoptosis of HSCs were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The MSCs, which is the main component of chemotherapy-induced BM niche, have decreased self-renewal capability and are prone to differentiate into adipocytes and chondrocytes. The results of gene expression analysis with RNA-seq showed that the MSCs have reduced levels of cytokines, including SCF, CXCL12, ANGPT1, VCAM1, and IL7. Furthermore, the chemotherapy-induced niche perturbed the hematopoietic reconstitution of HSCs in our N-MYC-driven B-ALL mouse model by promoting HSCs to enter cell cycle and increasing intracellular ROS levels and mitochondrial membrane potential of HSCs, which lead to the cell apoptosis of HSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy-induced BM niche perturbs the hematopoietic reconstitution of HSCs by increasing intracellular ROS level and inducing cell apoptosis.",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; chemotherapy-induced niche', 'Hematopoietic reconstitution', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Mesenchymal stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that this translocation did not generate RUNX1 fusion but aberrantly upregulated RUNX1. This upregulation was attributed to the disruption of long-range chromatin interactions between the RUNX1 P2 promoter and a silencer in the first intron of the gene. Characterization of the silencer revealed a role of SNAG repressors and their corepressor LSD1/KDM1A in mediating the effect.

Less well appreciated was the possible effect of small molecule RITA on p53-null leukemia cells. In this study, we demonstrated that RITA has potent antileukemic properties against p53-null chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived K562 cells. RITA triggered apoptosis through caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. RITA decreased STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, although it did not inhibit phosphorylation of the direct BCR-ABL substrate CrkL. Real-time PCR analysis showed that RITA downregulates antiapoptotic STAT5 target genes Bcl-xL and MCL-1. The downregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), as evidenced by inhibition of IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and its degradation, was associated with inhibition of Akt phosphorylation in RITA-treated cells. Furthermore, consistent with the decrease of mRNA levels, protein levels of the nuclear factor-kappaB-regulated antiapoptotic (cIAP1, XIAP, and Bcl-2) and proliferative (c-Myc) genes were downregulated by RITA in K562 cells. In conclusion, the ability of RITA to inhibit prosurvival signaling pathways in CML cells suggests a potential application of RITA in CML therapeutic protocols.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research paper was to present a retrospective analysis of patients with CLL/SLL whose disease transformed into RS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 217 patients (100 women and 107 men) with CLL/SLL diagnosed in the years 2006-2015 at the Department of Hematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation of the Medical University of Lublin, which transformed into RS. We analyzed clinical, laboratory, immunophenotypic (ZAP-70 and CD38 expression), histopathological, and genetic data (del(17p), del(11q)), which was collected at the time of CLL/SLL diagnosis, and some which was collected at the time of transformation. RESULTS: Richter's syndrome was diagnosed in 4.6% of all CLL and SLL patients. The group of patients with RS consisted of 9 patients with primary CLL and 1 patient with a diagnosis of SLL (8 patients with transformation into DLBCL and 2 patients with transformation into HL). Leukemic lymphocytes showed evidence of peripheral blood lymphocyte membrane expression of ZAP70+/CD38+ (1 patient), of ZAP-70+/CD38- (3 patients), of ZAP-70-/CD38- (1 patient), and of ZAP-70-/CD38+ (5 patients). The deletion of 11q (del(11q)) was documented in 2 patients. In 4 cases, the location of RS was extremely rare (the thyroid gland, liver, skin, bladder, and central nervous system). CONCLUSIONS: Richter's syndrome is a rare, but probable complication of CLL/SLL with an unfavorable prognosis, and it should be taken into account at every stage of the disease, particularly when the course of the disease is aggressive.",['NOTNLM'],"[""Richter's syndrome"", 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'small lymphocytic lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Oct 6.,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 13% of all lung cancer cases. Small cell lung cancer is characterized by frequent relapse, and current treatments lack tumor specificity. Arginine is a non-essential amino acid for human normal cells but critical to some tumor cells that cannot synthesize arginine. Therefore, arginine deprivation has become a potential therapeutic option for selected tumors. BCT-100 is a pegylated arginase that has documented anticancer activity in arginine auxotrophic tumors, such as melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. One of the resistance mechanisms to arginase treatment is overexpression of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1) and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), two important enzymes in the urea cycle. We selected 9 SCLC and 1 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines to determine the growth inhibition effects of BCT-100 and established that cell lines with low expression of ASS1 and OTC are relatively sensitive to BCT-100 treatment. Knocking down OTC in a H841 cell line could potentiate its sensitivity to BCT-100 treatment. Arginine concentration was sharply decreased, accompanied by apoptosis through oxidative stress as well as G1 cell cycle arrest.

Epub 2018 Aug 29.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. Gemcitabine is the standard chemotherapeutic drug used to treat the disease; however, it has a low response rate. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new and safe therapies to enhance sensitivity to gemcitabine in treating pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The synergistic effect of gemcitabine combined with specific B cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) inhibitor ABT-199 against pancreatic cancer was tested using cell viability, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays in vitro and in an MIA Paca-2 xenograft model in vivo. Its underlying mechanism was explored using western blotting analysis of Bcl-2 family proteins. RESULTS: ABT-199 not only enhanced the effect of gemcitabine on cell growth inhibition but also promoted gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Gemcitabine decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 but increased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. ABT-199 downregulated the gemcitabine-induced production of Bcl-2 and increased the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 interacting protein (BIM). Mouse xenograft experiments also confirmed the synergistic effect of gemcitabine and ABT-199 on tumor growth inhibition and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that ABT-199 improved the anti-tumor effect of gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer by downregulating gemcitabine-induced overexpression of Bcl-2. ABT-199 has already been investigated in phase 3 clinical trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia; therefore, it may serve as a potential drug to improve the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer to gemcitabine.",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABT-199', '*Apoptosis', '*Combination therapy', '*Gemcitabine', '*Pancreatic cancer']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5710-0091'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, the function and mechanism of RARalpha in esophageal carcinoma (EC) remain unclear. AIM: To investigate the expression of RARalpha in EC and its effect in the tumorigenesis of EC. METHODS AND RESULTS: In immunohistochemistry study, RARalpha was overexpressed in human EC tissues, and its overexpression was closely related to the pathological differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and clinical stages in EC patients. Functionally, RARalpha knockdown suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of EC cells through downregulating the expression of PCNA, Ki67, MMP7, and MMP9, as well as enhanced drug susceptibility of EC cells to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Mechanistically, RARalpha knockdown inhibited the activity of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway through reducing the phosphorylation level of GSK3beta at Ser-9 and inducing phosphorylation level at Tyr-216, which resulted in downregulation of its downstream targets such as MMP7, MMP9, and P-gP. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that RARalpha knockdown suppressed the tumorigenicity of EC via Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

It controls numerous processes such as protein degradation, DNA repair, and signal transduction pathways. E2 enzymes are associated with a variety of diseases such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. To date, the monitoring of E2 activity for cancer diagnosis is challenging due to its intricate cascade reaction. To surmount this hurdle, we have recently developed a novel strategy for monitoring E2 activities. Here, we describe the concise machinery of ubiquitination with artificial RING finger proteins (ARFs) functioning as E3 enzymes. This machinery enables the simplified monitoring of E2 activities. Furthermore, our system combines a signal accumulation ion-sensitive field-effect transistor biosensor with ARFs, allowing for real-time monitoring of the pathological conditions of cancer cells.

Epub 2018 Aug 28.,"INTRODUCTION: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been demonstrated to prolong survival in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, TKIs may be associated with an increased risk of infections. This study compared healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs among patients with CML receiving dasatinib or nilotinib, with a focus on infection-related economic outcomes. METHODS: Two large administrative databases were used to identify adult patients newly diagnosed with CML who initiated dasatinib or nilotinib as first- (1L) or second-line (2L) therapy and were classified into the following 1L (dasatinib 1L/nilotinib 1L cohorts) or 2L (dasatinib 2L/nilotinib 2L) cohorts based on the initiated 1L/2L TKI therapy. Infection-related HRU and healthcare costs were compared between cohorts, separately for 1L and 2L. RESULTS: Cohorts included 1156 patients in the dasatinib 1L and 677 patients in the nilotinib 1L cohorts, 322 patients in the dasatinib 2L, and 207 in the nilotinib 2L cohorts. In 1L and 2L, infection-related HRU was higher for dasatinib than nilotinib cohorts. Infection-related inpatient (IP) days constituted a larger proportion of all-cause IP days in the 1L/2L dasatinib than 1L/2L nilotinib cohorts (dasatinib 1L/2L: 53%/58%; nilotinib 1L/2L: 50%/46%). Compared to the nilotinib cohort, the dasatinib cohort had higher all-cause total costs per patient per year by US$17,901 in 1L and $28,625 in 2L. Of the total cost difference, infection-related were $6048 (34%) in 1L and $28,192 (99%) in 2L, largely driven by IP cost differences (1L/2L: 96%/98%). CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib was associated with higher HRU and healthcare costs compared to nilotinib, particularly related to infections.

Epub 2018 Aug 29.,"L-asparaginase or ASNase (L-asparagine aminohydrolase, E.C.3.5.1.1) is an enzyme clinically accepted as an antitumor agent to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphosarcoma through the depletion of L-asparagine (L-Asn) resulting in cytotoxicity to leukemic cells. ASNase is also important in the food industry, preventing acrylamide formation in processed foods. Several quantification techniques have been developed and used for the measurement of the ASNase activity, but standard pharmaceutical quality control methods were hardly reported, and in general, no official quality control guidelines were defined. To overcome this lack of information and to demonstrate the advantages and limitations, this work properly compares the traditional colorimetric methods (Nessler; L-aspartic acid beta-hydroxamate (AHA); and indooxine) and the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. A comparison of the methods using pure ASNase shows that the colorimetric methods both overestimate (Nessler) and underestimate (AHA and indooxine) the ASNase activity when compared to the values obtained with HPLC, considered the most precise method as this method monitors both substrate consumption and product formation, allowing for overall mass-balance. Correlation and critical analysis of each method relative to the HPLC method were carried out, resulting in a demonstration that it is crucial to select a proper method for the quantification of ASNase activity, allowing bioequivalence studies and individualized monitoring of different ASNase preparations.

Polysaccharides from marine algae are featured diversity bioactivities. To find the potential effect to prevent ALV-J spread, in this study, polysaccharides from Ulva pertusa (UPPs) and four low molecular weight (Mw) U. pertusa polysaccharides (LUPPs) were prepared and their functions on ALV-J were investigated. Firstly, LUPPs were obtained by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidative degradation. The effects of degradation conditions on Mw of the UPP were also investigated. Results showed that the H2O2 oxidative degradation method could degrade UPP effectively, and the degradation was positively related to H2O2 concentration and temperature and negatively to pH. The chemical characteristics of UPP and LUPPs were also determined. Afterwards, the anti-ALV-J activity of the polysaccharides were carried out in vitro. Results showed that UPP and LUPPs could inhibit ALV-J and LUPP-3 and Mw of 4.3 kDa exerted the strongest suppression. The action phase assay showed that LUPP-3 could bind with the viral particles and prevented ALV-J adsorption onto the host cells. And the ALV-J relative gene and gp85 protein expression were significantly suppressed after being administration with LUPP-3. Therefore, the low Mw polysaccharides from U. pertusa have great potential as an anti-ALV-J drug alternative.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3450-6427', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3941-4337', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6497-462X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8660-4950']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no association between HLA-C alleles and MM risk was found in Asians/Pacific Islanders. Here we identified 316 Chinese patients with MM, and reported the results of our investigation of HLA-C in MM in Chinese population. Methods: We identified 316 Chinese patients with MM diagnosed in our hospital, and typed for HLA-C by using Sanger sequence-based typing. The control was from laboratories of China Marrow Donor Program (CMDP), where HLA high resolution was provided in 564,856 volunteer adult donors. Results: In contrast to the association of MM risk in Whites, we did not find the similar association in Chinese population. Nevertheless, four new associations between the MM risk were identified in Chinese patients. Our data demonstrated that Chinese patients with MM carry significantly increased frequencies of HLA-C*03:03 (FDR = 0.0269), HLA-C*07:63 (FDR = 0.0278) and HLA-C*08:22 (FDR = 0.0442) comparing with controls, while significantly decreased frequency of HLA-C*01:02 (FDR = 0.0414) comparing with controls.

A common first-line therapy offered to qualifying patients includes ibrutinib, an oral covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Treatment of CLL with ibrutinib therapy is generally well tolerated; however, serious opportunistic infections are being reported in patients treated with ibrutinib. In this report, we present a patient with CLL on ibrutinib therapy who developed rapidly declining neurological status concerning for the central nervous system (CNS) process related to his immunocompromised status. Despite multiple testing modalities, no evidence was found to explain the acute changes the patient was experiencing, and he had no improvement with common antimicrobial coverage. The patient ultimately expired, and autopsy of the brain revealed granulomatous amebic encephalitis due to opportunistic infection by Acanthamoeba species. As evidenced by this case, ibrutinib therapy, despite being generally well tolerated, has the potential to predispose patients to opportunistic infections like amebic encephalitis. Amebic encephalitis is a highly lethal CNS infection, and it is important for clinicians to recognize early on the potential for infection in patients on ibrutinib therapy presenting with CNS symptoms.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3321-8570'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, in bilaterian-type animals, HOX genes are organized in gene clusters that encode anatomic segment identity, that is, whether the embryo will form with bilateral symmetry with a head (anterior), tail (posterior), back (dorsal), and belly (ventral). Although HOX genes are known to regulate stem cell (SC) differentiation and HOX genes are dysregulated in cancer, the mechanisms by which dysregulation of HOX genes in SCs causes cancer development is not fully understood. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript was (i) to review the role of HOX genes in SC differentiation, particularly in embryonic, adult tissue-specific, and induced pluripotent SC, and (ii) to investigate how dysregulated HOX genes in SCs are responsible for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed HOX gene expression in CRC and AML using information from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. Finally, we reviewed the literature on HOX genes and related therapeutics that might help us understand ways to develop SC-specific therapies that target aberrant HOX gene expression that contributes to cancer development.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1878-8353', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1335-9149']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimization of graft composition should not only enable a sufficient IR but also improve graft vs. leukemia/tumor effects, overcome infectious complications and, finally, improve patient survival. Especially in haploidentical SCT, the optimization of graft composition is controversial. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of graft manipulation on IR in 40 patients with acute leukemia in remission. We examined the cell recovery post haploidentical SCT in patients receiving a CD34(+)-selected or CD3/CD19-depleted graft, considering the applied conditioning regimen. We used joint model analysis for overall survival (OS) and analyzed the dynamics of age-adjusted leukocytes; lymphocytes; monocytes; CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+), and CD3(+)CD8(+) T cells; natural killer (NK) cells; and B cells over the course of time after SCT. Lymphocytes, NK cells, and B cells expanded more rapidly after SCT with CD34(+)-selected grafts (P = 0.036, P = 0.002, and P < 0.001, respectively). Contrarily, CD3(+)CD4(+) helper T cells recovered delayer in the CD34 selected group (P = 0.026). Furthermore, reduced intensity conditioning facilitated faster immune recovery of lymphocytes and T cells and their subsets (P < 0.001). However, the immune recovery for NK cells and B cells was comparable for patients who received reduced-intensity or full preparative regimens. Dynamics of all cell types had a significant influence on OS, which did not differ between patients receiving CD34(+)-selected and those receiving CD3/CD19-depleted grafts. In conclusion, cell reconstitution dynamics showed complex diversity with regard to the graft manufacturing procedure and conditioning regimen.",['NOTNLM'],"['*CD3/19 depletion', '*CD34 selection', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*children', '*immune reconstitution']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and disease relapse are still a challenge for CML therapy. In this study, we analyzed bone marrow samples from 149 CML patients and 15 control donors, and investigated the affect of AF1q on CML cell survival and engraftment in vitro and in vivo. We found that AF1q/MLLT11 expression was significantly upregulated in CML patients, especially in CD34(+) CML cells. Elevated AF1q expression was associated with disease progression. Knockdown of AF1q enhanced imatinib sensitivity, induced apoptosis, and suppressed growth in CML cells. Moreover, AF1q deficiency sensitized CD34(+) CML cells to imatinib. In contrast, upregulation of AF1q promoted cell survival, protected CML cells from imatinib-induced apoptosis, and increased engraftment of CML cells in vivo. We further identified a positive correlation between AF1q and CD44 expression in chronic phase CML patients and CD34(+) CML cells. Importantly, AF1q contributes to imatinib-resistance in CML by regulating the expression of CD44. These findings reveal a novel BCR-ABL-independent pathway, AF1q/CD44, involves imatinib resistance in CML, thus representing a potential therapeutic target for imatinib-resistant CML patients.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the role of metabolic reprogramming in GC-induced ALL cell death is poorly understood. GCs efficiently block glucose uptake and metabolism in ALL cells, but this does not fully explain the observed induction of autophagy and cell death. Here, we have performed parallel time-course proteomics, metabolomics, and isotope-tracing studies to examine in detail the metabolic effects of GCs on ALL cells. We observed metabolic events associated with growth arrest, autophagy, and catabolism prior to onset of apoptosis: nucleotide de novo synthesis was reduced, while certain nucleobases accumulated; polyamine synthesis was inhibited; and phosphatidylcholine synthesis was induced. GCs suppressed not only glycolysis but also entry of both glucose and glutamine into the TCA cycle. In contrast, expression of glutamine-ammonia ligase (GLUL) and cellular glutamine content was robustly increased by GC treatment, suggesting induction of glutamine synthesis, similar to nutrient-starved muscle. Modulating medium glutamine and dimethyl-alpha-ketoglutarate (dm-alphakg) to favor glutamine synthesis reduced autophagosome content of ALL cells, and dm-alphakg also rescued cell viability. These data suggest that glutamine synthesis affects autophagy and possibly onset of cell death in response to GCs, which should be further explored to understand mechanism of action and possible sources of resistance.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7650-3574', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8100-9562', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6359-1256', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6020-7498']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the contribution of other ancillary pathways stimulated by LIF in ESCs, such as the MAPK and PI3K pathways, is less well understood. We show here that naive-type mouse ESCs express high levels of a novel effector of the MAPK and PI3K pathways. This effector is an isoform of the Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder protein 1) adaptor protein that lacks the N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) membrane-binding domain. Although not essential for rapid unrestricted growth of ESCs under optimal conditions, the novel Gab1 variant (Gab1beta) is required for LIF-mediated cell survival under conditions of limited nutrient availability. This enhanced survival is absolutely dependent upon a latent palmitoylation site that targets Gab1beta directly to ESC membranes.

Epub 2018 Aug 28.,"Combining standard cytotoxic chemotherapy with BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) has greatly improved the upfront treatment of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, due to the development of drug resistance through both BCR-ABL1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, prognosis remains poor. The STAT5 transcription factor is activated by BCR-ABL1 and by JAK2-dependent cytokine signaling; therefore, inhibiting its activity could address both mechanisms of resistance in Ph+ ALL. We show here that genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of STAT5 activity suppresses cell growth, induces apoptosis, and inhibits leukemogenesis of Ph+ cell lines and patient-derived newly diagnosed and relapsed/TKI-resistant Ph+ ALL cells ex vivo and in mouse models. STAT5 silencing decreased expression of the growth-promoting PIM-1 kinase, the apoptosis inhibitors MCL1 and BCL2, and increased expression of proapoptotic BIM protein. The resulting apoptosis of STAT5-silenced Ph+ BV173 cells was rescued by silencing of BIM or restoration of BCL2 expression. Treatment of Ph+ ALL cells, including samples from relapsed/refractory patients, with the PIM kinase inhibitor AZD1208 and/or the BCL2 family antagonist Sabutoclax markedly suppressed cell growth and leukemogenesis ex vivo and in mice. Together, these studies indicate that targeting STAT5 or STAT5-regulated pathways may provide a new approach for therapy development in Ph+ ALL, especially the relapsed/TKI-resistant disease.Significance: Suppression of STAT5 by BCL2 and PIM kinase inhibitors reduces leukemia burden in mice and constitutes a new potential therapeutic approach against Ph+ ALL, especially in tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant disease.

Although BCR-ABL is crucially important for pathogenesis and treatment response, it is thought that some additional factors might be involved in the regulation of these processes. Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has recently been identified to be involved in various diseases including cancer, suggesting that lncRNAs may play a role in BCR-ABL-mediated CML. In this study, we found that nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1), a lncRNA essential for the formation of nuclear body paraspeckles, is significantly repressed in primary CML cells. NEAT1 expression could be restored by inhibiting BCR-ABL expression or its kinase activity in K562 cells. We also demonstrated that NEAT1 is regulated by c-Myc. Knockdown of NEAT1 could promote imatinib (IM)-induced apoptosis, and we demonstrated that the NEAT1-binding paraspeckle protein splicing factor proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ) is required for NEAT1-mediated apoptosis in K562 cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SFPQ regulates cell growth and death pathway-related genes, confirming its function in IM-induced apoptosis. Collectively, these results assign a biological function to the NEAT1 lncRNA in CML apoptosis and may lead to fuller understanding of the molecular events leading to CML.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*CML', '*IM', '*LncRNA NEAT1', '*Paraspeckle', '*SFPQ']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lurbinectedin is a next-generation minor groove binder with preclinical activity against myeloid leukemia cells. A dose-finding phase 1 clinical trial was performed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with further assessment of safety and tolerability. Forty-two patients with relapsed/refractory AML/MDS received lurbinectedin administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion in a 3 + 3 study design. Two dosing schedules were used: 3.5, 5, 7, or 6 mg on days 1 and 8 or 2, 3, 1, or 1.5 mg for 3 consecutive days on days 1 to 3. Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities of rhabdomyolysis (grade 4), hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3), and oral herpes (grade 3) with the day 1 and 8 schedule. Otherwise, adverse events mainly consisted of gastrointestinal manifestations (n = 11), febrile neutropenia/infections (n = 4), pulmonary toxicity (n = 2), and renal failure (n = 2). The most common laboratory abnormalities observed were an increase in creatinine (93%) and anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (100%). Overall, 33 of 42 patients (79%) had reduction in blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow. One patient achieved a partial response and 2 patients a morphologic leukemia-free state. Most (n = 30, 71%) were discontinued due to progressive disease. Early deaths occurred from disease-related causes that were not attributable to lurbinectedin. Four patients with a chromosome 11q21-23 abnormality had significantly greater bone marrow blast reduction than those without such abnormality, with decrease of 31 +/- 14% (n = 4) vs 8 +/- 8% (n = 16), respectively (P = .04).

Epub 2018 Aug 25.,"Clinical outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) from unrelated donors (URDs) approach those of matched related donor (MRD) transplants in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Yet, available data fail to account for differences in pretransplantation outcomes between these donor selection strategies. In this regard, URD allo-HSCT is associated with longer waiting times to transplantation, potentially resulting in higher probabilities of failure to reach transplant. We retrospectively analyzed 108 AML patients accepted for first allo-HSCT from the time of approval to proceed to transplant. Fifty-eight (54%) patients were initially allocated to MRD, while URD search was initiated in 50 (46%) patients. Time to transplant was longer in patients allocated to a URD when compared with patients assigned to an MRD (median 142 days versus 100 days; p < .001). Forty-three of 58 (74%) patients in the MRD group and 35 of 50 (70%) patients in the URD group underwent transplantation (odds ratio [OR], 1.22; p=.63). Advanced disease status at the time of allo-HSCT approval was the only predictor of failure to reach transplantation in the multivariate analysis (OR, 4.78; p=.001). Disease progression was the most common cause of failure to reach allo-HSCT (66.7%) in both the MRD and URD groups. With a median follow-up from transplantation of 14.5 (interquartile range, 5 to 29) months, the 2-year estimate of overall survival (OS) from allo-HSCT was 46% in the MRD group and 57% in the URD group (p=.54). There were no differences in OS according to donor type allocation in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.01; p=.83). When including patients from the time of transplant approval, 2-year OS was 39% in the MRD group versus 42% in the URD group. Our study suggests that allocation of AML patients to URDs may result in comparable clinical outcomes to MRD assignment without a significant increase in the risk of failure to reach transplant.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Matched related donor', '*Unrelated donor']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2018.

Epub 2018 Aug 25.,"The combination of a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) such as tacrolimus (TAC) or cyclosporine (CYSP) with methotrexate (MTX) or with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been commonly used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), but there are limited data comparing efficacy of the 2 regimens. We evaluated 1564 adult patients who underwent RIC alloHCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from 2000 to 2013 using HLA-identical sibling (matched related donor [MRD]) or unrelated donor (URD) peripheral blood graft and received CYSP or TAC with MTX or MMF for GVHD prophylaxis. Primary outcomes of the study were acute and chronic GVHD and overall survival (OS). The study divided the patient population into 4 cohorts based on regimen: MMF-TAC, MMF-CYSP, MTX-TAC, and MTX-CYSP. In the URD group, MMF-CYSP was associated with increased risk of grade II to IV acute GVHD (relative risk [RR], 1.78; P < .001) and grade III to IV acute GVHD (RR, 1.93; P = .006) compared with MTX-TAC. In the URD group, use of MMF-TAC (versus MTX-TAC) lead to higher nonrelapse mortality. (hazard ratio, 1.48; P = .008). In either group, no there was no difference in chronic GVHD, disease-free survival, and OS among the GVHD prophylaxis regimens. For RIC alloHCT using MRD, there are no differences in outcomes based on GVHD prophylaxis. However, with URD RIC alloHCT, MMF-CYSP was inferior to MTX-based regimens for acute GVHD prevention, but all the regimens were equivalent in terms of chronic GVHD and OS. Prospective studies, targeting URD recipients are needed to confirm these results.",['NOTNLM'],"['*Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*Calcineurin inhibitor Tacrolimus', '*Cyclosporine', '*Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis', '*Methotrexate', '*Mycophenolate mofetil', '*Reduced-intensity conditioning']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Epub 2018 Aug 28.,"PURPOSE: Cytoreductive therapy is beneficial in patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) at high risk of thrombosis. However, its value in those lacking high-risk features remains unknown. This open-label, randomized trial compared hydroxycarbamide plus aspirin with aspirin alone in patients with ET age 40 to 59 years and without high-risk factors or extreme thrombocytosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were age 40 to 59 years and lacked a history of ischemia, thrombosis, embolism, hemorrhage, extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >/= 1,500 x 10(9)/L), hypertension, or diabetes requiring therapy. In all, 382 patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to hydroxycarbamide plus aspirin or aspirin alone. The composite primary end point was time to arterial or venous thrombosis, serious hemorrhage, or death from vascular causes. Secondary end points were time to first arterial or venous thrombosis, first serious hemorrhage, death, incidence of transformation, and patient-reported quality of life. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 73 months and a total follow-up of 2,373 patient-years, there was no significant difference between the arms in the likelihood of patients reaching the primary end point (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.42 to 2.25; P = 1.0). The incidence of significant vascular events was low, at 0.93 per 100 patient-years (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.41). There were also no differences in overall survival; in the composite end point of transformation to myelofibrosis, acute myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplasia; in adverse events; or in patient-reported quality of life. CONCLUSION: In patients with ET age 40 to 59 years and lacking high-risk factors for thrombosis or extreme thrombocytosis, preemptive addition of hydroxycarbamide to aspirin did not reduce vascular events, myelofibrotic transformation, or leukemic transformation. Patients age 40 to 59 years without other clinical indications for treatment (such as previous thrombosis or hemorrhage) who have a platelet count < 1,500 x 10(9)/L should not receive cytoreductive therapy.",,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00175838'],,,,"['United Kingdom Medical Research Council Primary Thrombocythemia-1 Study', 'United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute Myeloproliferative Neoplasms', 'Subgroup', 'French Intergroup of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms', 'the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 13.,"In its third edition, the Vancouver Autophagy Symposium presented a platform for vibrant discussion on the differential roles of macroautophagy/autophagy in disease. This one-day symposium was held at the BC Cancer Research Centre in Vancouver, BC, bringing together experts in cell biology, protein biochemistry and medicinal chemistry across several different disease models and model organisms. The Vancouver Autophagy Symposium featured 2 keynote speakers that are well known for their seminal contributions to autophagy research, Dr. David Rubinsztein (Cambridge Institute for Medical Research) and Dr. Kay F. Macleod (University of Chicago). Key discussions included the context-dependent roles and mechanisms of dysregulation of autophagy in diseases and the corresponding need to consider context-dependent autophagy modulation strategies. Additional highlights included the differential roles of bulk autophagy versus selective autophagy, novel autophagy regulators, and emerging chemical tools to study autophagy inhibition. Interdisciplinary discussions focused on addressing questions such as which stage of disease to target, which type of autophagy to target and which component to target for autophagy modulation.

Epub 2018 Sep 11.,"GNF-7, a multitargeted kinase inhibitor, served as a dual kinase inhibitor of ACK1 and GCK, which provided a novel therapeutic strategy for overriding AML expressing NRAS mutation. This SAR study with GNF-7 derivatives, designed to target NRAS mutant-driven AML, led to identification of the extremely potent inhibitors, 10d, 10g, and 11i, which possess single-digit nanomolar inhibitory activity against both ACK1 and GCK. These substances strongly suppress proliferation of mutant NRAS expressing AML cells via apoptosis and AKT/mTOR signaling blockade. Compound 11i is superior to GNF-7 in terms of kinase inhibitory activity, cellular activity, and differential cytotoxicity. Moreover, 10k possessing a favorable mouse pharmacokinetic profile prolonged life-span of Ba/F3-NRAS-G12D injected mice and significantly delayed tumor growth of OCI-AML3 xenograft model without causing the prominent level of toxicity found with GNF-7.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was carried on Circ-VIM in 113 AML patients and 42 healthy controls. Circ-VIM was significantly upregulated in AML compared with control and was positively correlated with white blood cells (WBC) count. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the performance of Circ-VIM expression could serve as a promising biomarker for differentiating AML patients from controls. Significant correlations of Circ-VIM expression were found with WBC and French-American-British classifications. Survival analyses further showed that over-expressed Circ-VIM were associated with markedly shorter overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in whole-cohort AML, nonacute promyelocytic leukemia AML and cytogenetically normal-AML patients. Multivariate analysis also disclosed that Circ-VIM over-expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for OS and LFS in AML patients. Remarkably, Pearson correlation analysis evidenced that the expression of Circ-VIM was positively correlated with VIM expression in all AML patients.

Epub 2018 Sep 10.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare yet deadly cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Presently, induction chemotherapy with the DNA damaging drugs cytarabine (ARA-C) and idarubicin (IDA), known as 7 + 3, is the standard of care for most AML patients. However, 7 + 3 is a relatively ineffective therapy, particularly in older patients, and has serious therapy-related toxicities. Therefore, a diagnostic test to predict which patients will respond to 7 + 3 is a critical unmet medical need. We hypothesize that a threshold level of therapy-induced 7 + 3 drug-DNA adducts determines cytotoxicity and clinical response. We further hypothesize that in vitro exposure of AML cells to nontoxic diagnostic microdoses enables prediction of the ability of AML cells to achieve that threshold during treatment. Our test involves dosing cells with very low levels of (14)C-labeled drug followed by DNA isolation and quantification of drug-DNA adducts via accelerator mass spectrometry. Here, we have shown proof of principle by correlating ARA-C- and DOX-DNA adduct levels with cellular IC50 values of paired sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines and AML cell lines. Moreover, we have completed a pilot retrospective trial of diagnostic microdosing for 10 viably cryopreserved primary AML samples and observed higher ARA-C- and DOX-DNA adducts in the 7 + 3 responders than nonresponders. These initial results suggest that diagnostic microdosing may be a feasible and useful test for predicting patient response to 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy, leading to improved outcomes for AML patients and reduced treatment-related morbidity and mortality.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4238-0446'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Sep 26.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) system lists five morphological categories of systemic mastocytosis (SM): indolent (ISM), smoldering, SM with an associated hematological neoplasm (SM-AHN), aggressive (ASM) and mast cell leukemia (MCL). Recent studies have highlighted the prognostic importance of mutations in SM, including ASXL1, RUNX1, and SRSF2. In contrast, information on incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities in SM and their prognostic relevance, especially in the context of mutations, is limited. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed the cytogenetic findings in 348 consecutive cases of SM (median age 59 years; 53% males); 41% constituted ISM, 45% SM-AHN, 14% ASM and two cases of MCL. Karyotype was abnormal in 53 (15%) cases with incidences of 6% for ISM, 26% for SM-AHN and 8% for ASM (P < .001); among SM-AHN cases, abnormal karyotype incidences were 0% for SM-AHN-lymphoid and 28% for SM-AHN-myeloid (P < .001). Clinical correlative studies disclosed significant associations between abnormal karyotype and male sex (P = .002), age > 60 years (P = .04), thrombocytopenia (P < .001) and anemia (P < .001), but not with the presence of adverse mutations (P = .19). In univariate analysis, abnormal karyotype was associated with inferior survival (HR 3.0, 95% CI 2.0-4.3), specifically confirmed for ASM (HR 4.9, 95% CI 1.1-16.1) and SM-AHN (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7). Sample size adequacy allowed additional multivariable analysis in SM-AHN-myeloid, which disclosed independent prognostic contribution from adverse mutations (P = .003), anemia (P = .003) and thrombocytopenia (P = .001), but not from abnormal karyotype (P = .31). Our observations suggest that mutations are prognostically more relevant than karyotype in SM.",,,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-6998-662X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4605-3821']",,,,,,"['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The peripheral blood of patients with newly diagnosed, untreated metastatic melanoma was analyzed by flow cytometry to correlate the frequency of senescence markers with clinical response as measured by RECIST after 12 weeks of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The loss of surface markers CD27 and CD28 or the expression of Tim-3 and CD57 on T cells was associated with resistance to checkpoint inhibitor blockade, presenting these phenotypes as possible predictive biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

LGLs consist of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells; however, the context and phenotypic/functional features of each type of LGL are unknown. To better define features of these LGLs, we investigated lymphocytosis in CML patients treated with dasatinib. D57-positive and CD4-positive type I T-helper (Th) cells (CD57+ Th cells) rarely occur in CML patients without lymphocytosis and in healthy individuals; however, a substantial increase in the proportion of CD57+ Th cells was observed in CML patients treated with dasatinib. In addition, these cells showed appreciable levels of cytocidal activity via cytotoxic degranulation. Analysis of T-cell receptor alpha and beta sequences showed a skewed T-cell repertoire in the CD57+ Th cells. Furthermore, patients with LGLs and CD57+ Th lymphocytosis achieved stronger molecular responses than did those without lymphocytosis. While further studies are warranted, our observations suggest that dasatinib induces the expansion of CD57+ Th-LGLs, which may play a crucial role in the dasatinib-induced response against Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia.",['NOTNLM'],"['CD57 expression', 'Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Cytotoxic CD4+ T cell', 'Dasatinib', 'Large granular lymphocyte']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main effects of PNS were anti-inflammatory properties, inhibition of platelet aggregation, improvement of blood flow and insulin resistance, and so on. This study was carried out to explore the effects of PNS on macrophage polarization under hyperglycemic conditions. Human acute monocyte leukemia cell line THP-1 cells were induced into macrophages with Phorbol ester (PMA). Macrophages were then divided into five groups as follows: control (5.5mMol/l glucose), hyperglycemia group (15mMol/l glucose), hyperglycemia plus low-dose PNS (20ug/ml), hyperglycemia plus moderate-dose PNS (40ug/ml), and hyperglycemia plus high-dose PNS (60ug/ml). After 48-hour cell culture, the percentages of M1- and M2-polarized macrophages were measured by flow cytometry analysis. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to evaluate the Ym1 and arginase 1 expression in macrophages. Protein expression of arginase 1, NF-kappaB p50, p65, and inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB) alpha phosphorylation in macrophages was identified with Western blotting. PNS, especially the high-dose PNS, remarkably increased M2 phenotype ratio in macrophages cultured with hyperglycemia, and the mRNA expression of Ym1 and arginase 1 in macrophages was also upregulated. Meanwhile, PNS remarkably increased the protein expression of arginase 1 and decreased IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation and subunits of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 from macrophages in culture medium with hyperglycemia. Taken together, our work demonstrated that PNS promote macrophages to transform M2 phenotype under hyperglycemic conditions through downregulating NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",,,['ORCID: 0000-0003-2504-8601'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TCL1 plays a central role in lymphomagenesis as a co-activator of AKT kinases and other recently elucidated interacting protein partners. These include ATM, HSP70 and TP63, which were all confirmed as binding partners of TCL1 from co-immunoprecipitation experiments utilizing endogenously expressed proteins. The nature of these interactions highlighted the role of TCL1 in enhancing multiple signaling pathways, including PI3K and NF-kappaB.

Objective: To quantify the cost of implementing a performance-based MEA at the hospital level. Methods: The analysis involved a hypothetical one-off therapy targeting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Data collection from five NHS Hospital Trusts in England captured costs by task, job band, personnel time and capital investment. We compared the administrative burden of the standard of care (SoC) to that of adopting the therapy with or without an MEA over 10 years. Findings: The 10-year cost for the activities required to support hospital payments for the target patient population in England varied as follows: for the SoC was pound447,353, compared to pound1,117,024 for the novel therapy with MEA, and pound245,317 without MEA. Conclusions: The higher cost associated with the SoC compared to the novel therapy without an MEA, arises from the higher frequency of infusions requiring payments and the associated mandatory data capturing requirements for oncology therapies. The novel therapy with MEA presents the greatest burden due to increased frequency of monitoring in year one to compensate for the greater uncertainty in clinical data and to inform the performance-based reimbursement.",['NOTNLM'],"['Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell therapy', 'Value-based agreements', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'innovative contracting', 'managed entry agreement', 'outcomes-based', 'patient access scheme', 'regenerative medicine', 'reimbursement']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2018 Aug 27.,"DNA mutations are known cancer drivers. Here we investigated whether mRNA events that are upregulated in cancer can functionally mimic the outcome of genetic alterations. RNA sequencing or 3'-end sequencing techniques were applied to normal and malignant B cells from 59 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)(1-3). We discovered widespread upregulation of truncated mRNAs and proteins in primary CLL cells that were not generated by genetic alterations but instead occurred by intronic polyadenylation. Truncated mRNAs caused by intronic polyadenylation were recurrent (n = 330) and predominantly affected genes with tumour-suppressive functions. The truncated proteins generated by intronic polyadenylation often lack the tumour-suppressive functions of the corresponding full-length proteins (such as DICER and FOXN3), and several even acted in an oncogenic manner (such as CARD11, MGA and CHST11). In CLL, the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by aberrant mRNA processing is substantially more prevalent than the functional loss of such genes through genetic events. We further identified new candidate tumour-suppressor genes that are inactivated by intronic polyadenylation in leukaemia and by truncating DNA mutations in solid tumours(4,5). These genes are understudied in cancer, as their overall mutation rates are lower than those of well-known tumour-suppressor genes. Our findings show the need to go beyond genomic analyses in cancer diagnostics, as mRNA events that are silent at the DNA level are widespread contributors to cancer pathogenesis through the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes.",,,,,"['Cancer Discov. 2018 Nov;8(11):OF4.

The refractoriness of the disease is due to the protection offered by the bone marrow niche, making leukemic stem cells impervious to whatever chemotherapy or myeloablative regimen is chosen. Using a mobilizing agent for haematopoietic stem cells, Plerixafor, could sensitise leukemic cells to the myeloablative therapy. This approach was not previously used in a pediatric population, and in adult populations, was used in combination with busulphan with no difference in overall survival. We describe the case of a 4-year-old boy affected by refractory acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplastic changes and monosomy 7. The child had never achieved a remission. We proposed a combined time-scheduled scheme of therapy with plerixafor and melphalan. Combining pharmacokinetics of plerixafor with pharmacokinetics and rapid and elevated myeloablative potential of melphalan in high dosage (200 mg/m(2)), we succeeded in mobilizing more than 85% of stem blasts immediately before infusion of Melphalan. The count of residual blasts after 8 h from melphalan infusion was only 1.3 cells/muL. The child achieved an engraftment at day +32 with full donor chimerism. Sixteen months after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), he is well and in complete remission. Our case suggests that the use of plerixafor before a conditioning therapy with melphalan could induce remission in acute myeloid leukemia refractory to the usual conditioning therapy in pediatric patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated whether bufalin affected immune responses of mice with WEHI-3 cell-generated leukemia in vivo. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with WEHI-3 cells to develop leukemia and then were treated with oral treatment with bufalin at different doses (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. At the end of treatment, all mice were weighted and blood was collected; liver and spleen tissues were collected for cell marker, phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activity and T- and B-cell proliferation measurements by using flow cytometric assays. RESULTS: When compared with the leukemia control group, bufalin increased the body weight, but reduced liver and spleen weights, and reduced CD3, CD16 and Mac-3 cell markers at 0.4 mg/kg treatment and increased CD11b marker at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment. Furthermore, bufalin at 0.4 mg/kg increased phagocytosis by macrophages isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and at 0.1 mg/kg by those from the peritoneal cavity. Bufalin (0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg) increased NK cell cytotoxic activity at effector:target ratio of 50:1. Bufalin increased B-cell proliferation at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg treatment but only increased T-cell proliferation at 0.1 mg/kg. Bufalin increased glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase level at all dose treatments, increased glutamic pyruvic transaminase level only at 0.1 mg/kg treatment, but reduced the level of lactate dehydrogenase at all dose levels in mice with WEHI-3 cell-induced leukemia in vivo.

We report a unique case of chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia presenting with opioid toxicity overlapping with tumour lysis syndrome. The patient was on hydroxyurea-based chemotherapy for the primary disease. She was receiving oral morphine for abdominal pain due to splenomegaly. She was brought to the emergency in unresponsive state with pinpoint pupils. Opioid overdose leading to unconsciousness was suspected as the first diagnosis. Further workup revealed a final diagnosis of tumour lysis syndrome overlapping with opioid overdose. The patient was ventilated and started on naloxone infusion, and supportive measures for managing tumour lysis were added. The patient gradually improved and was extubated on the fifth day of ventilation. This case presents several learning points for the treating physician. Haematological malignancies have a dynamic course of disease with waxing and waning tumour burden during the course of chemotherapy. This fact should be kept in mind when prescribing strong opioids like morphine on outpatient basis to these patients. Massive tumour cell lysis during the course of chemotherapy may precipitate tumour lysis syndrome and may lead to renal dysfunction which makes the patient susceptible to morphine-related adverse effects. Pain physician should keep a watch for therapy-related adverse effects to avoid diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma associated with coexisting features of these two fatal conditions.",['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'pain (palliative care)']",,,,,['Competing interests: None declared.'],,"['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018.
