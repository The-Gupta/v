In 21 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia treated with intensive combination chemotherapy based on an anthracycline and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine infusion, chemotherapy sensitivity of leukemic clonogenic cells was assessed in comparison with that of normal myeloid clonogenic cells by the in vitro continuous exposure to drugs throughout the entire culture period. Analysis of these in vitro data in terms of prediction of achieving clinical complete remission was carried out in comparison with data on 22 cases in which in vitro sensitivity was assessed by the pulse 1-hr exposure. The in vitro sensitivity index, expressed as a log odds ratio, was positive (greater than 0) in 8 of 11 patients achieving complete remission and negative (less than 0) in 7 of 10 patients failing to achieve complete remission, with an overall correlation of 71%. This is at least as good as the pulse exposure method, which has a correlation of 68%. If sensitivity indexes of marginal magnitudes (--1.0 approximately +1.0) are excluded, the correlation increases to 92% (12 of 13 patients). The correlation appears to improve especially for 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine by the continuous exposure method (71%) as compared with the pulse method (57%). This study establishes the feasibility of an in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity testing of leukemic clonogenic cells by continuous in vitro drug exposure and suggests that the continuous exposure method may be better than the pulse method for antimetabolites such as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. The data also suggest that simulation of the in vivo drug schedule may be important in this in vitro test.","['CA16385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have conducted a series of studies with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) in the rat model (Lewis X brown Norway F1 hybrid rats bearing brown Norway myelocytic leukemia) for human acute myelocytic leukemia to examine the factors determining optimum timing of sequential administration of this cell cycle DNA synthesis phase-specific drug. Late-stage disease in this model is not curable with ara-C, but the maximum survival is achieved by rats given serial 2-day courses of ara-C 6 days apart. ara-C given in 2- or 4-day-interval sequences to rats with late-stage disease is more toxic and not more effective. However, Lewis X brown Norway F1 hybrid rats bearing brown Norway myelocytic leukemia in early complete remission are curable with ara-C given in optimum timed sequence. In these experiments, groups of rats in early complete remission were given a 2-day course of ara-C in every-8-hr s.c. injections, and then a second 2-day course was given after 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, or 12-day intervals. The best cure rate of rats surviving toxicity was achieved when sequentially administered 2-day courses of ara-C were given at 2- to 4-day intervals to rats in early complete remission. In the minimal residual disease state, as in late-stage disease, 2- and 4-day-interval sequencing was the most toxic. No significant number of cures of minimal residual disease could be obtained by even the maximum tolerated dose of ara-C given in longer than 6-day-interval sequences or by various continuous or intermittent schedules. The fact that the Lewis X brown Norway F1 hybrid rats bearing brown Norway myelocytic leukemia, while relatively refractory to ara-C, are curable with this drug when used in optimum timed sequence in early remission is encouraging for similar clinical trials in humans and suggests some principles for the design of such trials.","['CA-06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Oxypolarographic tests showed the following. (a) Presence of a prominent glutaminase activity in erythroleukemia and chloroma mitochondria is evidenced by their active glutamine-supported respiratory state 3. (b) Glutamine oxidation is mediated through a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked reaction inhibited by rotenone. (c) Under similar conditions, mitochondria isolated from rabbit bone marrow have shown a feeble glutamine oxidation activity, while in mitochondria from rat liver the activity was not detectable and in those from rat kidney it was prominent as expected. (d) The determination of apparent Km and Vmax values for substrate-supported adenosine triphosphate formation has shown 8- to 10-fold lower Km values for glutamine oxidation as compared to that of glutamate, with virtually the same Vmax for each substrate in each mitochondria.

The excess risk of ANL was 4.1 cases per 1000 patients per year; the cumulative risk of ANL at 10 years was 7.9 +/- 3.2% (S.E.). A case-control study within the NHL cohort revealed that patients treated with both radiation and chemotherapy were at greater risk of ANL than were patients who received single-modality therapy (relative risk, 6.0; p less than 0.05), especially if the therapy included total-body or hemibody radiation. A positive correlation between cumulative radiation dose to the bone marrow and risk of ANL was demonstrated, independent of chemotherapy duration. A similar correlation between chemotherapy dose and risk of ANL was suggested but could not be proven with the available data. An apparent association between ANL risk and indolent NHL histological subtypes was due to the significantly larger amounts of potentially leukemogenic therapy to which these patients were repeatedly exposed. Only one case of ANL occurred among NHL patients whose initial therapy produced a durable complete remission. Our data are compatible with a multistep model of leukemogenesis and also underscore the need for curative NHL treatment regimens which minimize the duration and quantity of therapy required for optimum patient management.",['N01-CP-01054/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The most striking early change shown by flow cytometry in VP-16-213-treated cells was a delay in S-phase transit before arrest of cells in G2. Coinciding with this S-phase delay was a selective inhibition of thymidine incorporation into DNA as well as concentration-dependent scission of DNA strands. Using alkaline elution methods, we were able to detect DNA breakage at concentrations of VP-16-213 well below the level required to demonstrate kinetic effects or inhibition of DNA synthesis. These data suggest that DNA strand scission is the initial event in the sequence of kinetic and biosynthetic changes leading to growth inhibition and death of VP-16-213-treated cells.

Taking colony size into account, histamine content per cell in histamine-positive type II colonies in SM cultures was 1.1 +/- 0.19 pg, compared to 0.29 +/- 0.08 pg in CML and less than or equal to 0.10 in normals and UP. Electron microscopy (EM) of individual colonies revealed electron-dense granules with ultrastructural features of BMC in histamine-positive, but not histamine-negative, colonies. Use of these methods may help to further clarify the nature of BMC precursors and the regulation of their proliferation in bone marrow disorders and allergic states.",,['S0006-4971(20)85639-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

This antibody completely blocks the binding of monoclonal anti-cALLA antibody J-5. Furthermore, antibody 24.1 binds to cALLA with greater affinity and induces a greater degree of antigenic modulation than antibody J-5. With antibody 24.1, we have demonstrated that normal cultured marrow and skin fibroblasts and mature granulocytes express cALLA. By immune precipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, cALLA from fibroblasts has a slightly lower molecular weight and cALLA from granulocytes a slightly higher molecular weight than cALLA from cultured human leukemic cell lines. Quantitative studies indicate, however, that cALLA expression is approximately 3-fold and 20-fold lower, respectively, on normal granulocytes and skin fibroblasts than on NALM-6 cells. cALLA may be expressed by cells with widespread distribution in multiple organ systems. These findings emphasize that differentiation markers that appear to be tumor or tissue specific may be found on cells of diverse origin.","['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-17265/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0006-4971(20)85630-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

In addition to 27 overt erythroleukemias, 724 leukemias, including 329 ALL (103 in relapse), 205 AML, and 109 blast crises of Ph1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia, were analyzed. Twenty cases with a significant proportion of glycophorin-A-positive (gA+) cells were found; 8 of these (5 AML and 3 blast crises of chronic myeloid leukemia, CML) had an obvious erythroid component, but 12 others were diagnosed as AML (2), AMML (1), CML in myeloid blast crisis (4) or megakaryoblastic blast crisis (1), acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (2), or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (2). The latter two patients had no immunologic evidence supporting a diagnosis of ALL and were resistant to chemotherapy. We conclude that AML and ALL only very rarely express gA, and these are probably genuine ""cryptic"" erythroleukemias.

Furthermore, results of polyamine determination by high-pressure liquid chromatography showed that the cellular polyamine content in differentiation-induced cells was lower than those of uninduced cells in early (18 h after inducer treatment) stages of differentiation.

The DMSO-induced differentiation of promyelocytic cells into mature granulocytes caused a fourfold decrease in fluorescence intensity that paralleled the disappearance of S-phase and G2M cells. This suggests that upon myeloid differentiation whereby the cells enter an irreversible quiescent state, the mitochondrial mass of the cells has decreased. This suggestion is corroborated by electron microscopy, which shows a decrease in the number of mitochondria, and by decreases in total mitochondrial protein and cytochrome oxidase activity. The respiratory rate of isolated mitochondria did not change, suggesting that the transmembrane potential remained the same. Undifferentiated cells in exponential phase of growth exhibit an intracellular heterogeneity of fluorescence intensity. This heterogeneity appears to have a cell age basis, as late S/G2M cells, obtained by centrifugal elutriation, yielded twice the fluorescence intensity of early G1 cells.","['CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1083/jcb.96.1.94 [doi]'],PMC2112239,,,,,,,,,

S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses demonstrate that these mRNAs initiate and terminate correctly. Nuclear transcription experiments indicate that induction of hybrid mRNA results at least in part from the increase in the rate of globin gene transcription. Furthermore, the induction appears to be specific for globin genes within an erythroid cell. These results permit the study of expression of the globin gene during erythroid differentiation and suggest that the specific induction of the globin gene is an inherent property of DNA sequences within or flanking the beta-globin genes.

The C-band polymorphism of chromosome #9 in CML was found not to differ in leukemic cells with the Ph1 and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes without the Ph1 and to have a clonal origin, i.e., to arise from a single cell in which the Ph1 translocation has taken place. A comparison of the C-band polymorphism of chromosome #9, survival after diagnosis of the disease, and abnormal chromosomes in addition to the Ph1 indicates some interesting aspects. Patients with the smallest C-band (level 1) on chromosome #9 not involved in the Ph1 translocation and with a relatively large C-band (level 2) on chromosome #9 with the Ph1 translocation (C9-1,2) tend to have no clonal evolution and short survival after diagnosis of the disease.

LDL cholesterol increased after splenectomy, but continued to cycle inversely with the leukocyte count. Receptor-mediated degradation of 125I-labeled LDL (125I-LDL) by mononuclear cells in vitro also showed cyclical changes which were unrelated to the number of immature myeloid cells in the population or the level of plasma cholesterol. 125I-LDL degradation rate was normal or slightly increased during relapse and after remission was achieved, but was greatly increased when tested during periods of remission induction. This patient illustrates that significant changes in plasma total and LDL cholesterol occur in chronic myelocytic leukemia in association with alterations in proliferative state.

The marker tests included the E- and EA-rosette test, immunofluorescence with rabbit-polyclonal antisera against human Ig, kappa, and lambda light chains, thymocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, platelets, lysozyme, (leukemic) myeloblasts, the common ALL antigen, SB cell-line cells (anti-Ia), and a mouse anti-Ia serum. The monoclonal mouse antibodies applied were anti-T-cell antibody (3A1), two anti-granulocyte-monocyte antibodies (OKM1 and B2.12), four antigranulocyte antibodies (MI/N1, UJ 308, B4.3, and B13.9), an antiplatelet antibody (C17.28), anti-HLA heavy chains (w6/32.HLK), anti-Ia antigen (OKI1), and OKT10. AML cells from many patients lacked the expression of myeloid markers, and we found that a correlation existed between the relative maturity of the leukemia subtype and the extent of positivity for these markers. Surface marker analysis discriminated poorly between the ""myeloid"" and ""monocytoid"" subtypes; OKT10 and the ""T-cell marker"" 3A1 were often expressed on AML cells. In two cases of AML, there was an unexpected expression of platelet antigens with the monoclonal antiplatelet antibody. One of them, classified as M1, was ultrastructurally a megakaryoblastic proliferation with a positive reaction for platelet peroxidase. Only with the help of computerized analysis, was it possible to prove a clear correlation between the surface marker profile and the FAB classification.",,['S0006-4971(20)85657-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

We were able to induce erythroid differentiation indirectly by fusing Friend cells that had been exposed briefly to dimethyl sulfoxide prior to fusion with nonerythroid cells that had been treated with ultraviolet light (or other DNA-damaging agents). The results suggest that two distinct reactions are involved in erythroid differentiation in Friend cells in vitro. One reaction, originating from the damaged DNA (or inhibition of DNA replication as a consequence), exhibits an inducible nature, is nonspecific to Friend cells, and is trans-acting. The other reaction is specific to Friend cells and most likely is cis-acting. We also present evidence from the cell fusion experiments that a typical tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, inhibits erythroid differentiation by affecting the latter reaction.

The rate of central-nervous-system relapse was higher in the methotrexate group (23 of 117) than in the irradiation group (8 of 120) (P = 0.01). Among patients with increased risk, radiation offered greater protection to the central nervous system than methotrexate (P = 0.03); there was no difference in the rate of hematologic relapse. In both risk strata the frequency of testicular relapse was significantly lower in the methotrexate group (1 patient) than the radiation group (10 patients) (P = 0.01). Methotrexate offered better protection against systemic relapse in standard-risk patients and better protection against testicular relapse overall, but it offered less protection against relapses in the central nervous system than cranial irradiation.",,['10.1056/NEJM198303033080902 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

This population-based registry covers a 31-county area and has a pediatric base population of 2 million. During the period, approximately 2,300 cases of childhood cancer were diagnosed in the region. Incidence rates for all histologic types combined are similar to rates from other large surveys conducted in the United States and Western Europe. However, certain histology-specific rates in the GDV vary by race. In the GDV nonwhites relative to whites have higher rates of Wilms' tumor, soft tissue sarcomas other than rhabdomyosarcoma, and retinoblastoma. These contrasts are supported by surveys in African populations showing relatively higher rates of these tumors among African black children. GDV whites exceed nonwhites in incidence of acute leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma. African black children also experience low rates of these tumors. The frequency of central nervous system tumors is similar for GDV whites and nonwhites, despite reports of a rarity of these neoplasms in African blacks. Variations in incidence rates reveal population subgroups with particular tumor susceptibilities and may provide clues as to the relative influence of heredity and environment on patterns observed.","['CA-14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26191/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular folate pool was directly proportional to the PteGlu1 in which the cells were incubated. At equilibrium, greater than 95% of the labeled intracellular folate pool chromatographed as polyglutamyl folate, regardless of the exogenous folate concentration. The functional importance of the intracellular folate pool was studied by varying the endogenous pool and the exogenous (media) supply. The ability of the cells to replicate in the absence of exogenous folate was directly proportional to the intracellular polyglutamyl folate pool. The maximal rate of replication, however, required exogenous PteGlu1 in addition. The cell doubling time was the most important determinant of intracellular folate turnover; changes in the intracellular pool size and the extracellular folate concentration had no effect on the turnover time.

Only nine children developed CNS leukemia; five of them in the CNS only and four concurrently in the CNS and another site. Major acute effects of CNS prophylaxis were seizures in seven patients (3%). Sixty-nine children who had a minimum follow-up of 4 yr were evaluable for late effects of therapy. Small cataracts, incomplete regrowth of hair, and learning disabilities were noted. The latter occurred in 18% of patients, an incidence similar to that encountered in a normal community of school-age children. However, the incidence of learning disabilities in patients who were under 5 yr of age at the time of diagnosis was much higher, 35%. We conclude that the combination of cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate was highly efficacious. The incidence and severity of neuropsychologic abnormalities, the principal late morbidity of this treatment program, varies among reporting institutions.

The chloride-36 exchange flux in K562 cells is less than 0.6% of that which would be expected in mature erythrocytes under similar conditions. Unlike red blood cells, K562 cells do not exhibit a high chloride-sulfate selectivity, and various agents that inhibit red blood cell chloride exchange are all much less effective in K562 cells. On the basis of these flux measurements, K562 cells probably contain less than 600 fully functional red blood cell-like band 3 molecules per cell, in contrast to about a million molecules in the mature red blood cell. The possible-existence of greatly altered band 3 molecules with a reduced turnover rate and/or a reduced affinity for chloride and for various inhibitors is unlikely but cannot be completely excluded.

Dual fluorescence techniques disclosed that these cells were heterogenous with respect to the expression of a series of differentiation and activation antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies. Thus, whereas all CALLA+ cells were Ia+ and expressed two activation antigens, J2 and T10, only 30-50% expressed B1 antigen. Furthermore, using methanol-fixed cells, it could be shown that approximately 20% contained intracytoplasmic mu chains (cyto-mu) and that approximately 15% were positive for the terminal transferase enzyme (TdT) marker. The CALLA+ fetal cells thus closely resemble the childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell with respect to surface marker phenotype. A population of CALLA- cells devoid of mature erythroid and myeloid surface markers was found to contain higher numbers of TdT+ cells but lower numbers of cyto-mu, B1, and Ia+ cells than the CALLA+ subset. In vitro analysis of normal, purified CALLA+ cells demonstrated that incubation at 37 degrees C with J5 monoclonal antibody specific for CALLA resulted in the specific modulation of surface antigen. Similar results have previously been obtained with CALLA+ tumor cells. Although phenotypic analysis of CALLA+ cells suggests that these cells are relatively immature lymphoid cells, CALLA+ cells do not appear to contain either myeloid precursor cells (CFU-G/M) or the earliest lymphoid stem cells.",['CA-28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1084/jem.157.1.114 [doi]'],PMC2186888,,,,,,,,,

Patients were classified into 10 groups according to karyotype: no abnormalities (34%), one of the following recurring structural abnormalities [the Philadelphia chromosome (12%), t(4;11) (5%), t(8;14) (5%), 14q+ (4.5%), 6q- (4%)] or, in the remaining cases with abnormalities, the modal number [less than 46 (5%), 46 (12%), 47 to 50 (8%), greater than 50 (9%)]. Response to treatment (achievement of complete remission and remission duration) and survival differed significantly among chromosome groups (p less than 0.002). The best responses were seen in patients with a modal number greater than 50; the poorest responses were found in patients with the t(4;11) and t(8;14). Interestingly, survival for children and adults who had karyotypes with the same specific structural abnormalities [e.g., the Philadelphia chromosome or t(4;11)] was identical. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the karyotypic pattern was an independent prognostic factor even when age, initial leukocyte count, and French-American-British (FAB) type were considered. We conclude that banded chromosome studies should be performed in all patients with ALL at diagnosis to identify those patients who have a pattern associated with a poor prognosis who may require more aggressive therapeutic approaches such as marrow transplantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We scanned 100 consecutive mitotic cells from each of the three preparations and found almost no variation in the incidence of abnormal metaphase cells. However, in this particular case, we noted some disparity between preparations with respect to the quality of diploid mitoses versus that of near-tetraploid mitoses. This finding is discussed with near-tetraploid mitoses. This finding is discussed with regard to bias in selecting metaphase cells for banding analysis in acute leukemia in general. In both of our patients there was a close correlation between the incidence of polyploid mitoses observed in cytogenetic preparations and the incidence of bizarre blast cells found in BM smears on the same date.",['1P50CA-32107-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['S0006-4971(20)74330-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, the differentiated phenotype was defective and varied with the inducing agent and the cell line used. HL60 proved to be the most sensitive to the effect of the inducers. Retinoic acid was better than DMSO, and TPA was better than the medium factors in the ability to induce granulocytic and monocytic differentiation, respectively, in HL60 cells. These findings indicate that the differentiation block in acute myeloid leukemias is heterogeneous and that each cell line has different phenotypic characteristics that are responsible for the extent of differentiation obtained with a given inducer.

There were 5 myeloblastic leukemias, 22 granulocytic leukemias, 17 myelomonocytic leukemias, and 8 monocytic leukemias. Fifty cases were radiation induced and the other 2 were nonirradiated. Each case had leukemic cells with 1 to 10 marker chromosomes. Partially deleted No. 2 chromosomes appeared in 49 cases, including 2 nonirradiated cases. These deleted No. 2 chromosomes were varied in size, and they were classified into 7 types according to morphological features. There was no type-dependent difference in histological or cytological features among the 7 types. It was found that the chromosomal segment lying between Regions 2C and 2D was commonly missing from all of the deleted No. 2 chromosomes. In addition to such No. 2 chromosomes, an anomaly in chromosome 6 was observed in 16 cases, of which 12 cases were granulocytic leukemia. The abnormalities of chromosomes 3 and 9 were next most frequent, appearing in 14 cases each. Besides such structural anomalies, numerical changes involving the Y chromosome (33 cases), chromosome 6(6 cases), and chromosome 15 (4 cases) were also found. Characteristics of the karyotypes of the mouse myeloid leukemia in comparison with other leukemias were noted. The significance of the specific segments of the chromosomes which were commonly missing or trisomic in the karyotypes of neoplasias in mice, rats and humans was discussed. It was suggested that the genesis of myeloid leukemia was greatly influenced by the genetic information on chromosome 2 in mice.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal and tumor-bearing leukemic BALB/c mice were given injections of 125I-, 131I-, or 111In-labeled specific and control immunoglobulins. At various times after injection, gamma camera images were obtained, and targeting to whole organs and to isolated cells was measured. The following observations were made: (a) tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies rapidly targeted to tumor cells (within hr); (b) the ratio of binding to tumor cells as compared to normal cells was highest (63.7 +/- 7.6) at the earliest times (6 hr after injection); (c) specific targeting was reflected by 20-fold shorter half-lives of antibody in the blood of tumor-bearing mice; (d) bound antibody was rapidly catabolized, and the radiolabel was cleared from the target (within hr) and appeared in organs metabolizing or excreting the radioisotope; (e) optimal images of tumors, using either 131I- or 111In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-labeled antibodies, were obtained early after extravascular distribution of the antibody because of the rapid targeting, clearance, and excretion or metabolism of isotope; and (f) changing the immunoglobulin isotype class or fragment had large effects on the half-life of the antibody but did not improve cell targeting uptake ratios or image contrast or alleviate the problem of specific catabolism. These results suggest (a) that diagnostic imaging should be obtained immediately after extravascular distribution of the antibody using short-lived isotopes and (b) that tumoricidal agents coupled to antibodies must act quickly upon targeting. In our system, the radiometal chelate-conjugated monoclonal antibodies appear to be the most versatile and effective at satisfying these criteria.","['1-CP81052/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07309/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

(c) Also during this time, some lethally damaged cells may undergo an early disintegration, so that they are not present to be stained with dye at the end of the culture period. Factors b and c may cause an underestimate of cell kill when the results of the assay are based upon the traditional ""percent viability"" expression. In order to overcome these problems, an internal standard was developed and tested. This was based upon the addition of a constant number of permanently fixed duck erythrocytes to the cultures of cells from two different established tumor cell lines. Results were based upon comparisons of the ratios of ""viable"" tumor cells to duck erythrocytes on permanent cytocentrifuge slides prepared from the cultures. This novel ""ratio"" method was found to be a more sensitive index of drug-induced cell kill than the traditional percent viability method. A standard agar cloning assay gave somewhat higher estimates of cell kill than the ratio method, although both assays were in qualitative agreement for the drugs tested. All three assays demonstrated a clear dose-effect relationship for most of the drugs tested. Dye exclusion assays may have a useful role in chemosensitivity testing in vitro.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This statement is based on experiments using two IgM monoclonal antibodies selected for their ability to bind L1210 leukemia cells (F2-10-23-IgM) and 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma cells (6B6-IgM) specifically, as shown by flow cytofluorometry analysis. The MDP-IgM conjugates, containing 45 MDP molecules per IgM molecule, were prepared by allowing MDP-hydroxy-succinimide ester to react with IgM monoclonal antibodies. The MDP-IgM conjugates are shown to bind to relevant tumor cells and to induce the activation of thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal mouse macrophages leading to 80% growth inhibition of target cells at optimum concentrations of bound MDP. These concentrations of bound MDP were 10 times lower than the concentration of free MDP, giving a maximum activation that is limited to 20% growth inhibition. No macrophage activation was evidenced when tumor cells were incubated in the presence of irrelevant MDP-IgM conjugates and macrophages or when macrophages were preincubated in the presence of MDP-IgM conjugates and then incubated in the presence of relevant or irrelevant tumor cells but in the absence of the MDP-IgM conjugates. The reported results are discussed with reference to the mechanism of activation of macrophage by muramyldipeptide and to the usefulness of such MDP-IgM conjugates as potential antitumor agents in cancer therapy.",,['10.1007/BF00205504 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The present study extends these findings by demonstrating a similar relationship between incorporation of FUra into preribosomal nuclear RNA (45 S and 32 S) and lethal cellular events. The results also demonstrate that the extent of FUra incorporation into preribosomal RNA (prRNA) correlates significantly with inhibition of maturation to cytoplasmic 28 S and 18 S rRNA. These findings suggest that the incorporation of FUra into prRNA alters recognition sites involved in the processing of 45 S and 32 S RNA. These data are further supported by our finding of an enhanced degradation of (FUra)prRNA by RNase III, an enzyme implicated in the maturation of Escherichia coli prRNA and T7 mRNA. These observations suggest that the incorporation of FUra into prRNA is responsible for altered processing to cytoplasmic rRNA and cell lethality.",['CA 28488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In some substrains the inserted viral genome becomes activated at specific stages of embryogenesis and the available evidence suggests that these viral genomes are developmentally regulated. The effect of cellular differentiation on virus expression was investigated by introducing M-MuL V into preimplantation or postimplantation mouse embryos, or into embryonal carcinoma cells (EC cells) in tissue culture. Whereas preimplantation embryos or EC cells did not permit virus expression, efficient replication occurred in postimplantation embryos or in differentiated cells. The viral genomes introduced into early embryos were highly methylated and non-infectious when analysed in the adult. In contrast, viral genomes introduced into postimplantation embryos remained unmethylated and were infectious in a transfection assay. Similarly, de novo methylation occurred in undifferentiated EC cells but not in differentiated derivatives. These results demonstrate an efficient de novo methylation activity which appears to be involved in the repression of genes introduced into pluripotent embryonic cells and is not observed in cells of the postimplantation embryo or in differentiated cells growing in culture. Integration of M-MuL V into the germ line can lead to recessive lethal mutations. This has been shown for the Mov-13 substrain, as animals homozygous at the Mov-13 locus die between Days 13 and 14 of embryogenesis. This suggests that viral integration occurred in a chromosomal region that is active during, and crucial for, embryonic development.",,['10.1002/9780470720790.ch4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

When pretreated with cytostatic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or BCNU, or by X-ray, and then inoculated with P388 or L1210 leukemias, mice died rapidly within a few days. In these systems, thymosin alpha 1 given concomitantly with the cytostatic agents or after X-irradiation prevented rapid death and extended survival, although the mice eventually died with leukemia like normal mice inoculated with cells of the same tumor. Rapid death in the 5-FU-treated mice was also prevented by adoptive transfer of spleen cells from the donor mice if these had been treated with 5-FU plus thymosin alpha 1, but not if they had received 5-FU alone. However, the restorative activity of the donor spleen cells was abrogated by treatment with anti-asialo GM1, but not by treatment with anti-Thy 1 or anti-mouse Ig serum, suggesting that the effector cells in the spleen are NK cells. In fact, thymosin alpha 1, when given concomitantly with 5-FU or after X-irradiation, maintained the NK activity of spleen, which was damaged by treatment with 5-FU or X-irradiation alone.

We have compared the capacity of different allogeneic lymphoid cells to stimulate CMC to fresh (i.e., patient) and cultured (MOLT 4, K562) leukaemic target cells in lymphocytes from an acute leukaemic patient and his HLA-identical siblings. Allogeneic lymphoid cells, and particularly a lymphoblastoid cell line, were effective in stimulating CMC to leukaemia targets. In some instances, however, leukaemia cells derived from the patient, mixed with allogeneic lymphoid cells stimulated synergistic CMC to the patient's leukaemia. We also found that the patient's leukaemia cells alone were able to stimulate CMC in HLA-identical sib lymphocytes to fresh and cultured leukaemia targets. Extra specificities on fresh leukaemia cells were revealed when these cells induced unpredicted CMC on normal lymphocyte targets when added to mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) between related and unrelated lymphocytes. Cytotoxic lymphocytes generated in MLC against the patient's HLA antigens were absorbed by monolayers of lymphocytes and leukaemia cells of the same HLA type as the patient, leaving residual CMC to fresh (patient) and cultured (K562) leukaemia target cells. In addition, CMC to the patient's leukaemia cells, stimulated in lymphocytes from the patient's HLA-identical sib by allogeneic cells, was absorbed by a monolayer of these allogeneic cells. This suggests cross reactivity between determinants on the leukaemia and allogeneic lymphocytes.

In CML, dissociation of the classical and alternative pathway activities was found: activities of the classical pathway and C4 were significantly elevated, whereas activity of the alternative pathway as well as C3 and factor B concentration did not differ significantly from the control values. In CLL, normal or slightly depressed complement levels were found. The concentration of circulating immune complexes measured by both methods was significantly increased as compared to control values. No significant positive or negative correlations were found between the complement levels and the immune complex concentrations determined in the same sera. An association between the clinical course of acute leukaemia and the complement levels was observed: significantly elevated complement titres were found in the blastic stage of the disease, whereas in remission normal values were recorded. The results of complement measurements performed in serum samples obtained before and after combination chemotherapy were compared on 32 occasions. In parallel to a significant decrease in the absolute number of blast cells in the peripheral blood, a normalization of the increased complement levels was observed after treatment.",,['10.1111/j.1365-2257.1983.tb00493.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

This paper specifically investigates the CSF pharmacokinetics of m-AMSA following both intravenous and intraventricular administration in a subhuman primate model. Following intravenous administration, m-AMSA crossed the blood-brain barrier poorly; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations were only 1-3% of systemic concentrations. Intraventricular administration of drug achieved high initial ventricular fluid concentrations, but the drug was rapidly cleared with a half-life of 115 min. Following 500 micrograms of intraventricular drug, CSF concentrations of m-AMSA remained above 1 microM for only 6 h. These data suggest that m-AMSA has potential as an intrathecal agent against meningeal leukemia refractory to more conventional therapy, but detailed toxicology and neurohistopathology will be required before intra-CSF m-AMSA can be considered for human use.",,['10.1089/cdd.1984.1.101 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Staging was done according to the criteria proposed by Wollner and re-staged according to Murphy's criteria. Each patient, regardless of clinical stage and histologic group, was given the same chemotherapy. A total of 28 nonrandomized patients received either cranial irradiation or intermediate-dose intravenous methotrexate as CNS prophylaxis. The complete remission rate was 72.6%. The 3-year actuarial estimate of survival was 73% and the disease-free survival rate was 62% for all responders, and was influenced by stage and main clinical features present at the time of initial presentation. The overall survival rate at 3 years is 52%. Of 26 children who failed to achieve complete remission, 21 had presented with disseminated disease. Also, 20/67 patients who entered remission have suffered relapses: four in the bone marrow, seven in the CNS, and nine with local relapses. Only one of 28 children who received CNS prophylaxis developed CNS disease as the site of first relapse, whereas six of those who received only intrathecal chemotherapy did so. This study confirms the improved outlook in comparison with a historical group for children with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by the use of an intensive multiple-drug regimen and CNS prophylaxis.",,['10.1097/00043426-198424000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, M1 cells were cultured either with 2.0 or 0.15 mM total calcium to examine the effect of calcium on the process of differentiation induced by the vitamin. The 0.15 mM calcium medium greatly enhanced 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3]-induced inhibition of cell growth and suppression of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Addition of Verapamil, a calcium antagonist, to the 2.0 mM calcium medium also elicited similar responses. The absolute number of cells with phagocytic activity induced by 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 was almost identical in media containing either concentration of calcium, and in cultures with or without Verapamil. Culture in the 0.15 mM calcium medium or addition of Verapamil to the 2.0 mM calcium medium did not suppress cell growth nor induce phagocytic activity in the absence of the vitamin. To confirm the preferential effect of calcium on cell growth, M1 cells were pretreated for 3 days with 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 in either the 2.0 or 0.15 mM calcium medium. Then the pretreated cells were washed and subcultured in the absence of 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 in either medium. The growth rate was inhibited much more effectively in the subculture with 0.15 mM calcium than with 2.0 mM calcium. These results suggest that the M1 cells' increased requirement of extracellular calcium, caused by the treatment with 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3, is closely related to cell growth rather than differentiation.",,['10.1210/endo-115-5-1891 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The most striking effect brought on by CI-920 was a marked inhibition of macromolecular synthesis. L1210 leukemia cells exposed to 10 microM CI-920 exhibited a decreased rate of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis within 45 min, and maximal inhibition occurred within 60 min. The reduction in nucleic acid synthesis was not due to precursor depletion, since ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate levels in cells exposed to 10 microM CI-920 for 2 h either remained unchanged relative to control cells or were elevated, suggesting a block more directly at the level of nucleotide incorporation. Nevertheless, CI-920 (50 microM) had no effect on DNA or RNA polymerase activity as assessed in permeabilized L1210 cells. However, if viable cells were exposed to 20 microM CI-920 for 1 h prior to permeabilization and then the polymerases assayed in the absence of drug, there was a 60% depression in enzyme activity. The inhibition of RNA polymerase appears to result from an effect on the enzyme rather than the template, since inhibition of RNA polymerase activity in cell-free systems from drug-treated cells could not be restored by addition of excess DNA template. DNA polymerase, however, was at least partially restored by addition of template and therefore was inconclusive in this respect. The data, then, suggest that CI-920 inhibits nucleic acid synthesis directly at the level of nucleotide incorporation, either by direct inhibition of DNA or RNA polymerase or by inactivation of an essential component of these enzyme systems. Since the drug in its parent form did not inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in cell-free systems the effects may possibly be mediated through conversion of this agent to another chemical form within viable cells.",,['10.1007/BF00269023 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we had proposed that intercalator-induced protein-associated DNA breaks act to reduce DNA torsional strain that results from the intercalator-induced decrease in DNA twist. In such a model, linking number would be expected to decrease. The finding that the DNA linking number increased following m-AMSA treatment suggests that intercalators may block enzymes that normally decrease linking number. Such enzymes would have DNA gyrase like properties. Consistent with this possibility, a DNA gyrase inhibitor, novobiocin, inhibited the restoration of normal linking number and, to a lesser degree, the reversal of protein-associated strand breaks after removal of intercalator.",,['10.1021/bi00308a012 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Mild detergent cell lysis and neutral pH make nucleoid sedimentation an extremely gentle, but sensitive, method to detect DNA scission. DNA breaks reduce the compaction of nucleoids and slow their sedimentation. Nucleoids from m-AMSA-treated cells sedimented as did those from untreated cells, indicating no detectable m-AMSA-dependent alterations in compaction despite an apparent underlying DNA break frequency of approximately 3 per 10(6) nucleotides, as measured by alkaline elution with proteinase. Mild proteinase digestion of cell lysates prior to nucleoid sedimentation unmasked some, but not all, of the underlying breaks. The frequency of DNA-protein cross-links in nucleoids from cells treated with m-AMSA was comparable to the single-strand break frequency produced by m-AMSA in whole cells. These results indicate that m-AMSA-induced DNA-protein cross-links conceal DNA breaks so as to prevent swiveling around the breaks within the nucleoids. This unique sort of DNA scission is consistent with the involvement of topoisomerases in the DNA breaks elicited by intercalators in mammalian cells.",,['10.1021/bi00308a011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Several lines of evidence indicate that this drug penetrates L1210 cells via the reduced folate carrier system. Reduced folates (100 microM) including leucovorin and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate completely protected L1210 cells from growth inhibition by Cl-920. Protective effects were not observed, however, with folic acid, a compound which is transported by a process distinct from that for reduced folates. Cl-920 was a potent inhibitor of methotrexate influx exhibiting a mixture of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition and having a Ki (slope) of 30.0 microM and a Ki (intercept) of 58.8 microM. The inhibition appeared to be irreversible since, after cells were preincubated with drug, the inhibitory effects persisted after cells were washed in drug-free media. The irreversibility could be eliminated, however, by dithiothreitol, suggesting that Cl-920 may interact with a thiol which is essential to this transport system. Cells made 71-fold resistant to Cl-920 by continuous exposure to increasing concentrations of this drug were 245-fold cross-resistant to methotrexate but were collaterally sensitive to the lipophilic antifolate trimetrexate and contained normal levels of dihydrofolate reductase. This mutant cell line had a severely impaired reduced folate carrier system exhibiting methotrexate influx rates of less than 1% of control cells. Finally, inhibition of methotrexate influx by a number of Cl-920 analogues showed that the intact lactone ring and the presence of the phosphate ester were required for maximum interaction with the carrier system and that the degree of inhibition correlated with relative antitumor potency.

Physicochemical studies of this analogue (N-5-dimethyl-9-[(2-methoxy-4-methylsulfonylamino) phenylamino]-4-acridinecarboxamide; NSC 343 499) indicate a slightly increased lipophilicity (estimated log p = 1.10), a decreased acridine base strength (pKa 6.40), and a 16-fold-higher association constant for double-stranded calf thymus DNA (Ka 2.1 X 10(6) M-1 at 0.01 ionic strength). Like amsacrine, the drug binds to DNA by intercalation. Inhibition of cell growth has been monitored by continuous drug exposure assays with a variety of rodent and human cell lines. The concentration for 50% inhibition varied from 6.7 nM (T-47D, a human breast carcinoma line) to 800 nM (P388/ADR, a murine cell line resistant to Adriamycin). N-5-Dimethyl-9-[(2-methoxy-4-methylsulfonylamino) phenylamino]-4-acridinecarboxamide was cytotoxic at growth-inhibitory concentrations and also induced cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase.

It was curative towards i.v.-injected Lewis lung tumor in a proportion of animals when treatment was started on Day 1 or Day 5 after tumor inoculation. It also produced highly significant life extensions against advanced tumors (treatment starting Day 9 after i.v. inoculation or on Day 8 after s.c. inoculation) and was comparable to cyclophosphamide in its effectiveness.

The ID50 against dihydrofolate reductase was comparable for the MTX and AMT analogues (0.04-0.07 microM), whereas the ID50 against folyl polyglutamate synthetase was 3- to 4-fold lower for the AMT analogues (40-60 microM) than for the MTX analogues (100-200 microM). Thus, N10-substitution has a greater effect on binding to folyl polyglutamate synthetase than dihydrofolate reductase. The cytotoxicity of these compounds was assayed in vitro against L1210 cells, and the AMT analogues again proved more potent (ID50 = 0.03-0.05 microM) than the MTX analogues (ID50 = 0.1-0.4 microM). A similarly increased potency was observed for the AMT analogues against L1210 leukemia in vivo. Though differential cell uptake cannot be ruled out as the basis of increased potency, it is possible that part of the activity of the AMT analogues involves interference with the intracellular polyglutamation of reduced folate cofactors, i.e., that they are ""self-potentiating antifolates"". Of the four compounds reported, the most active was N-(4-amino-4- deoxypteroyl )-L-homocysteic acid, which produced a 138% increase in life span (ILS) in L1210 leukemic mice when given on a modified bid X 10 schedule at a dose of 2 mg/kg. A comparable ILS was obtained with AMT itself at 0.24 mg/kg. Thus, replacement of gamma-CO2H by gamma-SO3H in the side chain does not decrease therapeutic effect. However, a higher dose is required, presumably to offset pharmacological differences reflecting the inability of the sulfonate group to be polyglutamated .","['CA 11666/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['10.1021/jm00371a008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

It has potent antileukemic activity in mice. At doses of 25 mg/kg given i.p. once daily for 5 days to mice bearing approximately 10(7) L1210 leukemia cells, Cl-920 is curative in about 10% of the mice. Life span increases in noncured mice are typically in excess of 150%. The unsaturated lactone and phosphate ester moieties are required for activity against L1210 leukemia. Ring hydroxylation or removal of the terminal hydroxyl group have only modest effects on activity. Schedule studies suggest that prolonged exposure to low levels of Cl-920 is considerably more toxic than is daily or intermittent administration. Daily administration produces optimal activity against L1210 leukemia. Administration i.p. and i.v. of Cl-920 produce roughly equal toxicity and equal activity against an i.p. implant of L1210 leukemia. Cl-920 is inactive when given p.o. or s.c. Cl-920 failed to show confirmed activity against the following tumors in mice: M5076 sarcoma, B16 melanoma, and Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma.

Both the proportion of polykaryons in cultures and their size (which reflects the number of nuclei per polykaryon) increase during growth in the presence of 48/80 up to 48 hr; thereafter, the cells lose viability. A predominant number of nuclei in these polykaryons contain a 4C, or higher DNA content. The data indicate that compound 48/80 impairs the cleavage (cytokinesis) and perhaps mitotic processes. Mechanisms by which compound 48/80 induces the described effects are unknown but may be related to the polycationic nature of the polymer and its interaction with the cell membrane.

Working with anti-idiotype antibodies directed against neoplastic lymphocytes, we have shown previously that univalent antibody derivatives with intact Fc-regions can avoid antigenic modulation while retaining the ability to recruit cytotoxic effectors such as complement. Chimeric univalent antibodies represent an extension of this approach. To prepare them Fab' gamma from antibody is linked by thioether bonds to half-cystine in normal Ig of the species to undergo immunotherapy. The derivatives FabIgG and FabFc utilize IgG and Fc gamma respectively as the effector partners of the antibody Fab' gamma. They appear superior to parent antibody in their ability to invoke complement and K-cell killing of target lymphocytes.

Using P388-S cells, the 3H-thymidine index (L.I.) was paralleled by the 3H-AraC index, i.e. any cell in the S-phase of the cycle also incorporated the 3H-AraC into DNA. With the resistant line, the 3H-AraC index was zero in spite of high L.I. This discrepancy between the L.I. and 3H-AraC index could be used to predict the percentage of resistant cells when known mixtures of sensitive and resistant populations were used. The reason for lack of incorporation into DNA by the resistant cells was shown to be the presence of very low levels of the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase in P388-R cells resulting in an inability to phosphorylate AraC to its active form AraCTP. Immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by AraC was directly proportional to the number of sensitive cells present in the population, but was not as accurate a predictor of sensitivity as the 3H-AraC index. Cloning in methylcellulose was found to be the least sensitive predictor of the percentage of sensitive and resistant cells, most likely related to the difference in cloning efficiency of the sensitive and resistant lines.",['CA 5834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

In human and dog sera, the T1/2 of intact PCNU (5-12 min) was similar to BCNU (5-16 min). However, much larger T1/2 values for PCNU (140 min) and BCNU (110 min) were determined for drug incubated in dog brain homogenates. Uptake of 14C-labeled PCNU in L1210 cells was rapid, and tenfold higher than in CCRF-CEM, a human leukemia cell line naturally resistant to BCNU and PCNU. BCNU was shown to induce DNA strand damage in L1210 and to inhibit radioactive thymidine incorporation into DNA and cross-link proteins with DNA in L1210. PCNU, by comparison, only weakly inhibited thymidine incorporation and did not induce DNA strand breakage or produce DNA-protein cross-links in L1210 at reasonable concentrations. The compounds are further differentiated in fetal calf serum by the breakdown products derived from initial concentrations of intact drug that are equipotent; those of BCNU inhibit L1210 growth whereas those of PCNU do not.

When a microsomal preparation from these cells is incubated in vitro with ATP, the principal tyrosine protein kinase substrate is a 56,000-dalton protein, p56. We have found that an activity phosphorylating p56 on tyrosine can also be detected at low levels in microsomes from most, but not all, T lymphoma cell lines and from normal thymic tissue. Only 1 of 30 other lymphoma cell lines was found to contain an elevated level of such a tyrosine protein kinase. An activity that phosphorylated p56 in vitro was not detectable in the cells of other hematopoietic lineages. Anti-peptide antibodies reactive with the site of in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation of p56 allowed us to determine that the apparent abundance of the p56 polypeptide parallels closely the level of the tyrosine protein kinase activity in the cell lines examined. This suggests that p56 is the protein kinase responsible for the elevated tyrosine protein kinase activity in LSTRA cells and that the phosphorylation of p56 observed in vitro results from autophosphorylation. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping revealed that p56 is distinct from the proteins encoded by the cellular genes which are the progenitors of retroviral tyrosine protein kinases, src, yes, fgr, abl, fes, and ros. Additionally, none of these proto-oncogenes was found to be transcribed at elevated levels in LSTRA or Thy19 cells. Like the catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, the cellular and viral forms of p60src, and the protein phosphatase calcineurin B, p56 contains covalently bound fatty acid.","['CA-14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17096/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17289/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/mcb.4.12.2705-2713.1984 [doi]'],PMC369280,,,,,,,,,

Trypanocidal compound 261/115 (2-Amidino-indole-6-carboxamidine) showed species differences in mice and rats, however, in mice no differences were detected after i.p. and s.c. administration. Terminal half-life was 2.4 h and 5 days in mice and rats, respectively. Trypanocidal compound 102/198 [2-(4-Amidinophenyl)indole-6-carboxamidine), DAPI) showed a terminal half-life of 60 days in rats. For both compounds excretion data were determined, accounting for less than 1% in bile in both cases, 36% and 7.5% in urine and 36% and 22.5% in faeces for 261/115 and 102/198, respectively. According to an organ balance and a computer fit of excretion data extensive tissue binding seems to be responsible for this long terminal half-life. This is also suggested by RBC/plasma partitioning data. Since biliary excretion is negligible, direct excretion into the gut might be responsible for the excretion in faeces. For other antileukemic diamidines as well as for analogous diimidazolinyl compounds consisting of two heterocyclic nuclei linked by a double bond plasma pharmacokinetics were determined in mice after i.p. administration. Their terminal half-lives ranged between 3.5 and 10.7 h. For all compounds studied multi-compartmental models could be established. In addition, it could be shown for 261/115 and 150/129 [E)-2.2'-Vinylenedi-1-benzofurane-5-carboxamidine) that their pharmacokinetics were not dose-dependent. In general, imidazolinyl compounds showed higher plasma levels than did their amidine analogues. This property seems to be related to their solubility. However, no correlation could be found between pharmacokinetic properties and antileukemic activity. Therefore other properties like DNA-binding, tissue distribution etc. should be considered in evaluating new strategies for the development of antileukemic compounds.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When the phosphorylation of endogenous substrates was assayed, proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (rather than serine or threonine residues) to a larger extent in normal lymphocytes than in leukaemic cell lines. Separation of labelled endogenous substrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels showed a number of phosphorylated alkali-resistant bands in the range 14-175kd in the lymphoid cell lines; normal lymphocytes exhibited a smaller number of strongly phosphorylated bands. Normal lymphocytes from different individuals showed reproducible patterns of phosphorylated substrates. Normal bone marrow cells and myeloid leukaemia lines showed weak, if any, phosphorylation.

Methotrexate alone was lethal to all normal mice. Inosine at 1.0-7.5 mg/hr could reverse toxicity up to 100% while thymidine at 0.5-7.5 mg/hr was less effective (less than or equal to 86% survival). Combinations of the nucleosides averted toxicity more effectively than either compound alone and in a synergistic manner. From P388 tumor-bearing mice 27% survived methotrexate and eventually died of tumor. Co-infusion of thymidine or inosine decreased the percentage of toxic deaths and caused an increase in life span of more than 50% as compared to untreated tumor-bearing mice. However, the diminishing effect on survival with thymidine and inosine doses above 0.5 mg/hr indicated loss of the antitumor effect of methotrexate. This was also observed with combinations of the nucleosides. The influence of thymidine on the antitumor effect of methotrexate was compared in L1210- and P388-bearing mice (both in ascites) with 13 micrograms/hr methotrexate for 48 hr and 4 mg/hr thymidine for 96 hr. The increase in life span for L1210-bearing mice (8.6 days, 96%) was significantly longer than that with P388-bearing mice (6.1 days, 56%), probably due to biochemical differences between these tumors. It is concluded that co-administration of inosine and/or thymidine allows the use of methotrexate doses otherwise not tolerated, though with loss of anti-tumor effect. The choice of the tumor model may greatly influence the outcome of in-vivo studies on the modulation of methotrexate action by nucleosides.",,['10.1016/0277-5379(84)90146-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

We report here a situation in which methylxanthine-induced reversal of DNA replicon initiation inhibition is not associated with increased cytotoxicity of the alkylator. Murine L1210 leukemia cells were assayed for cytotoxicity following treatment with either L-PAM or cis-DDP in the presence or absence of theophylline. Theophylline increased the cytotoxicity seen after L-PAM treatment but failed to increase the cis-DDP induced cytotoxicity. Analysis of pulse-labeled DNA on alkaline sucrose gradients revealed the expected decrease in DNA replicon initiation in L1210 cells treated with either L-PAM or cis-DDP. Theophylline had no effect on replicon initiation in untreated cells. Theophylline reversed the replicon initiation inhibition in cells treated with either L-PAM or cis-DDP.

At least seven species containing platinum in addition to cisplatin are present 15 min following injection i.p. of 15 mg kg-1. Unchanged cisplatin has been almost completely eliminated from the plasma within 3 hr of dosing; however, metabolite species are still present. The same metabolite species form when cisplatin is incubated in vitro with plasma although in different proportions. After incubation for 24 hr at 37 degrees a mixture of metabolites is produced which contains less than 4% cisplatin. This mixture, when injected i.p. into rats, is nephrotoxic at doses of platinum at which cisplatin is not. The mixture of metabolites has considerably less antitumour activity than cisplatin when tested against the mouse L1210 leukemia assay. Although no metabolite species has been unequivocally identified we present evidence which suggests that amongst the principle metabolite species are an hydrolysis product and methionine substitution products of cisplatin.

The sensitivity of uridine transport to inhibition varied somewhat for the cell lines, Chinese hamster ovary cells being the most sensitive. Maximum inhibition by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate occurred in 10-20 min of incubation at 37 degrees C, and was associated with a decrease in maximum transport velocity without significant change in substrate affinity of the carrier. The development of inhibition of uridine influx correlated with binding of [14C]p-hydroxymercuribenzoate to the cells. Inhibition of transport also roughly correlated with a decreased binding of 6-nitrobenzylthioinosine to high-affinity binding sites on the cells (presumably representing the nucleoside transporter) without affecting binding affinity. Treatment of cells with p-hydroxymercuribenzenesulfonate reduced uridine influx and efflux to a similar extent. Inhibition of uridine transport and binding of [14C]p-hydroxymercuribenzoate were readily reversed by incubation of the cells with dithiothreitol. The results indicate that sulfhydryl groups are essential for the functioning of the nucleoside transporter, perhaps for the binding of substrate. Blockage of the sulfhydryl groups results in a reversible inactivation of the carrier.

In the present studies, the susceptibility of spleen cells from serum-protected mice to the immunosuppressive effects of FLV-infected spleen cells has been examined by means of in vitro assays of antibody production and of natural killing (NK). In contrast to the parallel suppression of both functions in FLV-infected mice and their lack of suppression in serum-protected animals, a dichotomy was observed in the in vitro susceptibility of these activities of spleen cells from serum-protected mice to the suppressive effects of virus-infected splenocytes, implying that more than one mechanism of suppression is operative. Thus, the antibody-producing capability of serum-protected splenocytes was not suppressed by FLV-infected spleen cells, this suppression reflecting the activity of infectious virus, while the NK effector function of serum-protected spleen cells was as susceptible as that of normal splenocytes to suppression by virus-infected spleen cells. This suppression of NK activity is mediated by virus-induced suppressor cells and does not involve free infectious virus, in contrast to suppression of antibody production. These results thus indicate that, while serum therapy inhibits the development of the virus-induced NK suppressor cells found in the spleens of progressively infected mice, splenic NK effectors, which are present, demonstrate full susceptibility to the suppressive effects of such independently generated virus-induced suppressor cells. Preliminary attempts at characterizing these NK suppressors in the spleens of FLV-infected mice indicate that they are not eliminated by treatment with antisera directed against T cells, B cells, macrophages or FLV gp71. However, Percoll fractionation of spleen cells from infected mice has revealed the presence of an expanded (as compared to normal spleen cells) population of cells of density 1.077 which demonstrates high in vitro NK suppressor activity, presumably representing the virus-induced suppressor cells measured in this assay. At the present time, the mechanism of the resistance of serum-protected spleen cells' antibody production to suppression by FLV-infected splenocytes (i.e., by FLV itself) remains undefined.","['5T32-CA-09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-25863/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/ijc.2910340220 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In cancer chemotherapy, however, the advantages of liposome encapsulation of antitumor drugs remain uncertain, with the possible exception of the usefulness of encapsulated 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosine (ara-C), an antitumor drug of a very short half-life. Liposome-encapsulated ara-C has been shown by others to enhance significantly the survival time of mice bearing leukemia, and the enhancement may be attributable to the role of liposomes as a slow release system for ara-C. We now further explore the advantages of two sustained release systems for ara-C, namely the liposome-encapsulated ara-C and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-5'-diphosphate-L-1,2-dipalmitin (ara-CDP-L-dipalmitin, a prodrug of ara-C). Intravenously implanted Lewis lung carcinoma is used as a solid tumor model. The therapeutic effectiveness of the two slow release forms of ara-C given by either i.v. or i.p. injections is examined. Viable tumor cells (1.0 X 10(5) cells/mouse) were inoculated i.v. and treatment was initiated 24 hr later using three schedules of multiple treatments for liposomal ara-C and single or multiple injections of ara-CDP-L-dipalmitin. Liposomal ara-C given by the i.p. route consistently increased the number of cures (greater than 120 days survival). For example, when nine small doses (10 mg/kg) were given on consecutive days by i.p. injections, 50% of mice given liposomal ara-C were cured, compared with 10% cures in the group given ara-C liposomes by i.v. and no cures in mice receiving free ara-C given according to the same schedules. On the other hand, ara-CDP-L-dipalmitin given at a single dose is more effective than an equal dose divided in five injections. However, no cures have been obtained by treatments with ara-CDP-L-dipalmitin.

Cell lines derived from carcinomas were more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil and less sensitive to cytosine arabinoside than was a leukaemic cell line. In general, colon carcinoma lines were most resistant to DNA-intercalating drugs, and a breast carcinoma and leukaemia line most sensitive. In a congeneric series of amsacrine analogues, in vitro patterns of activity against different lines were shown to correlate with activity against the Lewis lung mouse carcinoma in vivo.

No cross-resistance between PHIC and cisplatin could be detected in L1210 leukemia cells resistant to cisplatin.

The effect of TdR on the antitumor activity of DDP was investigated using the ascites P388 murine leukemia model. TdR at 500 mg/kg consistently decreased the recovery of body weight after DDP treatment IP, but did not affect the lethal toxicity of DDP to non-tumor-bearing mice or those with the P388 murine leukemia. This effect was greatest when TdR was injected 30 min prior to DDP and at higher doses of DDP. A 500-mg/kg dose of TdR did not affect the antitumor activity of DDP 5 mg/kg administered on days 1, 5, and 9. Treatment of rats with TdR 500 mg/kg according to various schedules of timing relative to a 5-mg/kg dose of DDP did not consistently affect the DDP-related loss in body weight or nephrotoxicity at day 3. Pretreatment of mice with TdR 1,500 mg/kg 30 min prior to DDP 5 mg/kg (every 4 days X 3) resulted in a slower recovery of body weight, which became more pronounced with increasing doses of DDP. Pretreatment of ascites P388-bearing mice with TdR 1,500 mg/kg increased the number of early deaths when mice were treated with DDP 5 mg/kg (days 1, 5, and 9). These data suggest that the cytotoxicity of DDP is increased by TdR only at higher doses of either drug, but that the antitumor activity against P388 murine leukemia is not affected.","['CA 11520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23272/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1007/BF00401442 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Three apparent types of cross-resistance patterns could be distinguished: specific, pleiotropic, and mixed. Cross-resistance to vindesine developed in parallel with VCR resistance, appearing at the lowest levels of VCR resistance (approximately fivefold). Vinblastine resistance did not become noticeable until VCR resistance was higher (approximately equal to 50-100-fold). Cross-resistance resistance to three other tubulin-binding agents developed in a different pattern, however. While cross-resistance to maytansine was seen in cells of intermediate (approximately equal to 50-fold) resistance to VCR, colchicine cross-resistance occurred only in cells that were highly resistant to VCR (approximately equal to 500-fold). Even at the highest level of VCR resistance (approximately equal to 600-fold), complete sensitivity to podophyllotoxin was retained. Conversely, cross-resistance to the epipodophyllotoxins , teniposide and etoposide, semisynthetic derivatives of podophyllotoxin, was seen in cells that were greater than 50-fold resistant to VCR. The same pattern obtained for the anthracyclines, doxorubicin and daunorubicin. We conclude that resistance to low concentrations of VCR does not uniformly confer cross-resistance to other classes of natural product drugs.","['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the incidence of new malignancies in successive quinquennia after irradiation shows a significantly higher incidence in two periods. Within five years the greater incidence (p less than 0.05) is due mainly to the occurrence of second testicular tumours. In the period 15-19 years after irradiation the higher incidence (p less than 0.01) is accounted for by tumours arising in the urinary and gastro-intestinal tracts.

Hyp permitted growth of both cell lines in the presence of clinically achievable concentrations of all 4 drugs, but the initial culture concentrations of Hyp required were above those found in patients.

This approach is based on our past studies in which we demonstrated that FdCyd is an excellent substrate for mammalian 2'-deoxycytidine kinase, and that H4Urd increases the toxicity of FdCyd in the mouse. Cell culture studies utilizing 2'- deoxytetrahydrouridine which inhibits cytidine deaminase and as 2'- deoxytetrahydrouridine -5'-monophosphate inhibits dCMP deaminase, provide indirect evidence for the pathway that we had proposed in the past, 2'- Deoxytetrahydrouridine antagonized the toxicity of FdCyd to a greater extent than did H4Urd and showed marked antagonism in cytidine deaminase-deficient cells. Cell lines lacking both cytidine and 2'-deoxycytidine-5'-monophosphate deaminase were markedly resistant to FdCyd . Thymidine and deoxyuridine antagonized toxicity in a manner consistent with the proposed pathway of anabolism of FdCyd and consistent with its resulting in the inhibition of thymidylate synthetase. We have established the efficacy of FdCyd + H4Urd chemotherapy utilizing adenocarcinoma 755 and Lewis lung carcinoma in C57BL X DBA/2 F1 mice. An example of an optimum schedule versus Lewis lung carcinoma is FdCyd , 10 to 12 mg/kg, plus H4Urd , 25 mg/kg, coadministered simultaneously, once per day on Days 1 to 7 after tumor implantation. Tumor inhibitions on Days 12, 14, and 16 were 95, 90, and 80%, respectively, with 8% maximum weight loss. Comparative studies were undertaken only with Lewis lung carcinoma and it was established that FdCyd + H4Urd surpasses the efficacies of 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine as well as FdCyd when administered without H4Urd . We propose that the administration of FdCyd with H4Urd can result in preferential, tumor-directed conversion of a nontoxic nucleoside analogue to a toxic antimetabolite by an enzyme that is markedly elevated in human tumor tissue. The analogues of deoxycytidine are resistant to catabolism and are anabolized by a different subset of enzymes than are 5-fluorouracil or 5-fluorodeoxyuridine; therefore, it is a novel approach. Not only are there intrinsic selectivity, metabolic stability, and the advantages that accrue from prodrug therapy in this strategy, but in addition, the potential for an exclusively DNA-directed effect exists. This is in contrast to approaches with 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, in which, in addition to DNA effects, parallel effe",,,,,,,,,,,,

L. Slater and H. L. Ozer, Cell 7:289-295, 1976) and in several of their revertants. This mutation has previously been mapped on the X chromosome. We found that a short incubation of mutant cells at a nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees C) during the early part of the virus cycle (between 0- to 20-h postinfection) greatly inhibited virus production. This effect was not observed in revertant or wild-type cells. Molecular studies by the Southern transfer procedure of the unintegrated viral DNA synthesized in these cells at a permissive (33 degrees C) or nonpermissive temperature revealed that the levels of linear double-stranded viral DNA (8.8 kilobase pairs) were nearly identical in mutant or revertant cells incubated at 33 or 39 degrees C. However, the levels of two species of supercoiled viral DNA (with one or two long terminal repeats) were significantly lower in mutant cells incubated at 39 degrees C than in mutant cells incubated at 33 degrees C or in revertant cells incubated at 39 degrees C. Pulse-chase experiments showed that linear viral DNA made at 39 degrees C could not be converted into supercoiled viral DNA in mutant cells after a shift down to 33 degrees C. In contrast, such conversion was observed in revertant cells. Restriction endonuclease analysis did not detect differences in the structure of linear viral DNA made at 39 degrees C in mutant cells as compared to linear viral DNA isolated from the same cells at 33 degrees C. However, linear viral DNA made at 39 degrees C in mutant cells was poorly infectious in transfection assays. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that this X-linked gene, affecting mouse cell DNA synthesis, is operating in the early phase of murine leukemia virus replication. It seems to affect the level of production of unintegrated linear viral DNA only slightly while greatly reducing the infectivity of these molecules. In contrast, the accumulation of supercoiled viral DNA and subsequent progeny virus production are greatly reduced. Our pulse-chase experiments suggest that the apparent, but not yet identified, defect in linear viral DNA molecules might be responsible for their subsequent impaired circularization.",['CA 23002/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1128/mcb.4.1.151-159.1984 [doi]'],PMC368669,,,,,,,,,

Clonogenic analysis in agar demonstrated that differentiated cells (either spontaneous or induced) irreversibly lost clonogenic potential. This appeared to be an all-or-none process with unaffected cells exhibiting unaltered clonogeneity. A study of the kinetics of colony formation showed that most, if not all, cells completed one division in the presence of butyrate and sometimes several divisions before loss of proliferative potential.

The administration of cyclophosphamide, N4-behenoyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, or 5-fluorouracil alone resulted in a response as great as, or greater than, that induced by 6-MP alone. This and the finding that the 6-MP-induced response was more pronounced upon its delayed rather than its early administration indicate that 6-MP-induced reduction of the tumor burden does not explain this augmentation. The combination of 6-MP and L1210 vaccine was not effective in mice bearing 6-MP-resistant L1210 leukemia; however, an augmented response occurred when the tumor burden was reduced by N4-behenoyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, indicating that reduction of the tumor burden by 6-MP was only partially associated with augmentation of the therapeutic response. Augmentation was associated with vaccine-induced antitumor immunity because it was induced by the combination of 6-MP and concanavalin A-bound, but not concanavalin A-free L1210 vaccine. This augmentation was dependent on the timing of the L1210 vaccine administration. The combination was not effective in mice bearing P388 leukemia, indicating the tumor specificity of the augmentation. These results show that 6-MP not only reduced the tumor burden but also potentiated the vaccine-dependent antitumor immunity, resulting in the induction of an augmented therapeutic response.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these processes involve cytoskeletal proteins, vimentin from intermediate filaments of normal and CLL lymphocytes was investigated using hetero- and monoclonal antisera. The antisera reacted predominantly with a 60-kD polypeptide, following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of total lymphocyte proteins. When lymphocytes were stained by indirect immunofluorescence, normal lymphocytes demonstrated well defined cytoplasmic fibrils that capped spontaneously after contact with a glass surface and incubation at 37 degrees C. This capping was dependent on energy and intact microfilaments. Lymphocytes from patients with CLL showed several patterns. In one group, the initial staining was weak, and few capped cells were present after incubation. Lymphocytes from other patients had either normal or aberrantly organized fibrils in which capping was diminished. In another group, a fibrillar pattern with normal or increased capping was seen. In total, 47% +/- 5.1% (mean +/- SE) of normal lymphocytes capped after a 1-hr incubation at 37 degrees C (n = 12) compared to 21% +/- 5.1% for CLL lymphocytes (n = 20, p less than 0.002).

Virol. 38:952-957, 1981), but causes both fibroblast transformation in vitro and leukemic changes--including spleen focus formation--in adult mice. The fibroblast transforming properties of myeloproliferative sarcoma virus were used to select viral temperature-sensitive mutants at 39.5 degrees C, the nonpermissive temperature. These mutants are temperature sensitive in the maintenance of the transformed state. This was also shown by cytoskeletal changes of the infected cells at permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Viruses released from cells maintained at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperature are temperature sensitive in fibroblast transformation functions. All temperature-sensitive mutants show only a low reversion rate to wild-type transforming function. The myeloproliferative sarcoma virus temperature-sensitive mutants are inefficient in causing leukemic transformation (spleen enlargement, focus formation) in mice at the normal temperature. A method to maintain a low body temperature (33 to 34 degrees C) in mice is described. One temperature-sensitive mutant was checked at low body temperature and did not induce leukemia.

Furthermore, the ability of the compound to bind to DNA appeared to enhance its cytocidal activity. The same model compounds were used to investigate the effect of the quinone group on cellular DNA. DNA single-strand breaks, DNA double-strand breaks, and DNA-DNA cross-linking induced by the model compounds were measured by elution assays. Hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard, which contains a quinone group, induced dose-dependent single-strand and double-strand breaks but no DNA cross-linking. Benzoquinone mustard, which possesses both a quinone moiety and an active alkylating group, produced dose-dependent DNA double-strand breaks but no apparent single-strand breaks. However, this compound produced significant levels of DNA cross-linking, a process which interferes with the assay for single-strand breaks. The relative activity of benzoquinone mustard in inducing DNA double-strand breaks was approximately 15,000-fold greater than that of hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard. Aniline mustard, which has the same alkylating group as does benzoquinone mustard but no quinone function, produced lower levels of DNA-DNA cross-links and no DNA strand breaks. The induction of both DNA single-strand and double-strand breaks by hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard was significantly inhibited by the cell-protective enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase. The cytotoxic activity of hydrolyzed benzoquinone mustard appeared to correlate with the induction of DNA single- and double-strand breaks. These studies provided evidence that the presence of a quinone group in the chemical structure of a compound results in the production of DNA strand breaks. DNA damage was inhibited by superoxide dismutase and catalase, suggesting the involvement of free radicals and active oxygen species. The induction of DNA damage appeared to be enhanced by the ability of the compound to bind to DNA. The induction of strand breaks may correlate with the cytotoxic activity of the quinone agents.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells with the typical ""hairy"" surface were observed infiltrating the red pulp, altering the normal reticular meshwork and causing red blood cell distortion. In the sinuses, hairy cells adhered to the endothelial cells causing sinus dilatation and destruction. Aggregates of hairy cells delimiting pooled erythrocytes were also observed and may represent the ""pseudosinuses"" described in previous light and transmission electron microscopic studies.

Three thousand one hundred and eight bone biopsies of 2629 patients with established MPD were examined to investigate the histologic features of MPD in a large material in order to identify criteria for the histologic classification and differential diagnosis of these disorders. Detailed histologic characteristics were defined for each of the disorders and the results showed that in the majority of cases MPD may be recognized and classified by the initial bone marrow histology. Utilizing the predominant proliferative cell(s) in the bone marrow, PV was categorized into 4 types: 1. the classic, tri-linear type; 2. a bi-linear type with hyperplasia of the erythroid and granulocytic lines; 3. a bi-linear type with hyperplasia of the erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines and 4. a uni-linear type with isolated increased erythrocytic proliferation. CML showed 2 sub-divisions: 1. the granulocytic, uni-linear type and 2. the bi-linear type with proliferation of myeloid and megakaryocytic lines. The former had a tendency to evolve into blastic crisis, while the latter was prone to develop into MF/OMS. It was primarily uni-linear exhibiting increased megakaryocytes. In most cases, MF/OMS was shown (by means of follow-up biopsies) to arise out of those entities of MPD which had included megakaryocytic hyperplasia and to which the proliferation of fibroblasts was secondary. The conclusion is drawn that an initial bone marrow biopsy provides additional diagnostic and prognostic data in this group of haematologic malignancies.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In leukemia patients antibiotics used for prevention and/or therapy of infectious episodes can alter the intestinal microecology, so that the gut can represent the trigger zone for generalized septicemia. Moreover cytotoxic drugs used in these patients can favour intestinal disturbances. In our study we evaluated the in vitro activity of three commonly used antineoplastic drugs (Daunorubicin, Cytosine arabinoside, Methotrexate) against aerobic and anaerobic intestinal bacteria and Clostridium difficile that is the aetiological agent of pseudomembranous colitis. Daunorubicin proved to be the most active inhibiting, in concentration ranging from 16 to 128 micrograms/ml, 50% of Bacteroides strains and 90% of Clostridium difficile and Enterococci strains tested. Methotrexate showed activity only against some Bacteroides strains, while Cytosine arabinoside had no activity at all.

The in vivo bioassays of brains, and the histologic examinations of the livers of leukemic mice show that DM-COOK and DTIC prevent leukemic infiltration in these organs at dosages devoid of cytotoxic effects for peritoneal tumor cells. At a dosage equitoxic with that of dimethyltriazenes, cyclophosphamide causes the absence of tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity and in the brains and livers of mice bearing P388 and L1210 leukemias. DM-COOK and DTIC thus possess a mild or insignificant cytotoxic action together with antimetastatic properties also on mouse transplantable leukemias. The use of DM-COOK appears advantageous over that of cyclophosphamide and DTIC because of a reduced host toxicity, which is particularly evident for cyclophosphamide and DTIC on liver parenchyma and bone marrow.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, further experiments were conducted to test whether ionizing radiations would be able to affect the immunogenic properties of cancer cells in a mouse leukemia model. Male CD2F1 mice were inoculated with histocompatible L1210 Ha leukemia and treated with 400 R of total-body irradiation. A number of transplant generations were carried out with leukemic cells collected from irradiated donors, thus generating a ""radiation treated line"" (RTL). The immunogenicity of RTL cells increased significantly with respect to that of L1210 Ha line as early as 3 passages in vivo. However, no strong transplantation antigens comparable to those elicited by treatment with DTIC were found in RTL cells, even after a number of transplant generations. Combined effects of bis-chloroethyl-nitrosourea and weak anti-RTL responses of the host were markedly synergistic. Moreover, RTL lymphoma acquired strong immunogenic properties after a single cycle of DTIC treatment in vivo.

It has been proposed by several studies that the lymphoreticulo-endothelial system detects and destroys neoantigens such as would be the case in remnant embryonic antigens. It follows that stimulation of the immune system would be desirable at birth to augment the removal of such neoantigens. There are numerous vaccines which stimulate the immune system, and BCG is among the foremost. I propose, therefore, that the mechanism of cancer mortality reduction in those BCG vaccinated at birth was at least in part due to the detection and destruction of embryonic cells or components thereof. To prove this theory, I recommend: Retrospective studies be done in those BCG vaccinated at birth and those not vaccinated for the incidence of cancer and leukemia over the years. Test cells, sera, and urine of those BCG vaccinated and non-vaccinated for the presence of embryonic antigens or antibodies.

Hans Selye, with his stress-adaptation theory, opened the door for the holistic conceptualization of disease. Gotthard Booth laid a solid basis for the demonstration of an often important psychobiological (holistic) aspect of cancer, and also an overall theory of spontaneous regression. Booth was also a leader in demonstrating that severe masked depression generally long precedes cancer. Sir MacFarlane Burnet demonstrated in 1970 in Immunological Surveillance the enormous power and complexity of the cellular immune system, which apparently carries out surveillance against, detects, invades, and destroys many cancer cells daily in the normal human body. Cancer is thus far from a one-way process. The connection of the defensive process to the cerebral cortex is largely a discovery attributable to Selye, and to several Russian scientists. The course and outcome of cancer are notoriously unpredictable when age, sex, and lesion and spread are known. Two surgeons, Everson and Cole, in 1966 thoroughly documented 176 cases (previously published) of histologically proven untreated cancer which underwent proven so-called spontaneous regression. Several investigators, without known contradiction, have found that depression quite regularly long precedes cancer. ""Spontaneous"" regressions are basic.",,"['0306-9877(84)90153-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(84)90153-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

AADRs for HD in Kagoshima Prefecture, which had the highest mortality from HD in Japan in the early period, has decreased drastically and the mortality from HD in Kyushu has not been high in the most recent period. The main reasons for the decreased mortality from HD in Kyushu may be as follows: (1) HD has been more strictly diagnosed by histopathological criteria in recent years; (2) adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) which is prevalent in Kyushu and has similar histopathological features to those of HD may have been diagnosed as HD in the past when the concept of ATLL did not exist.

Budd-Chiari syndrome occurred after treatment by estrogen-progestational drugs in 3 cases and following delivery in one. It was due to a myeloproliferative syndrome in 2 cases and to narrowing of the ostium of the hepatic veins in one. All patients had ascites before operation and 5 had an increased serum activity of transaminases. One patient was operated in emergency for progressive massive liver cytolysis. There was no operative mortality. In all patients ascites cleared after operation and transaminases returned to normal values. There was no chronic encephalopathy. Six patients are alive and well with a follow-up of 5 to 66 months. One patient died of acute myeloblastic leukemia 19 months after mesocaval shunt. A liver biopsy was obtained in 2 patients 18 months and 2 years after operation. Hemorrhagic necrosis and sinusoidal dilatation had disappeared and there was annular fibrosis. These results suggest that portal-systemic shunting is a good treatment of the Budd-Chiari syndrome. Since the natural history of this syndrome is still poorly known, a surgical shunt should be rapidly decided upon.",,,,Resultats des derivations porto-systemiques dans le traitement du syndrome de Budd-Chiari.,,,,,,,,

Daudi cells were the most sensitive to GKT-beta. Two T-cell lines (RPMI-8402, HUT78), three B-cell lines (Raji, P3HR-1, A3/Kawakami), one non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell line (KOPN-1) and one monocytoid cell line (U937) were moderately sensitive to GKT-beta. Although the levels of sensitivity of these cell lines to GKT-beta were different, the cells could be killed by GKT-beta. Morphological changes of the sensitive cells treated with GKT-beta were decrease in mitosis, pyknosis and segmentation of cells. Twelve other cultured cell lines, comprising four T-cell lines, four B-cell lines, one non-T, non-B ALL cell line and three myelomonocytoid cell lines, were not sensitive to GKT-beta. The results indicated that the growth-inhibitory activity of GKT-beta was not always cell lineage-specific or differentiative stage-specific. GKT-beta was instable in vitro and its antiviral activity was reduced to about 10% during the first 24 hr of incubation in culture medium with or without cells. This instability was reflected in a similar reduction of its growth-inhibitory activity. It was demonstrated that GKT-beta had a time-dependent, but not a concentration-denpendent antiproliferative action. This suggests that, in the clinical use of the interferon, direct antiproliferative activity of GKT-beta may be expected only through the use of therapeutic schedules which are suitable for its time-dependent action, such as through daily long-term treatment, but not through a single large-dose therapy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to benzene in the general population is suggested to be several orders of magnitude less than to occupational cohorts. Levels of benzene exposure in the workplace have dropped considerably from that which was manifest in the 1940-1950 decade (e.g., 10-100 ppm) also due to the decreasing use of benzene as a solvent. The effects on humans and animals as well as genetic effects of benzene were also reviewed following an initial consideration of its absorption and elimination.

In 89 cases in the literature, the second neoplasm was either reticulum cell sarcoma or large cell diffuse histiocytic lymphoma (DHL), and there were 61 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD). In a few cases the lymphoma was simultaneously diagnosed, for other cases an association with preexisting CLL was reported. Appearance of lymphoma was associated with leukemia regression for only 4 patients with DHL and 3 with HD. We report one case of B-lymphocyte CLL with macroglobulinemia, treated with melphalan and prednisone, in which DHL developed and the hematologic and histologic signs of CLL and of paraproteinemia remissed. Such patients might constitute a subgroup or a variant of RS. Since the non-Hodgkin malignant lymphomas (NHML) are considered to be monoclonal neoplastic expansion of the B-cell or T-cell lymphocytes, and since in some cases it has been proved that the proliferative cell clone was the same as that of the initial lymphoproliferative disease, RS could be a dedifferentiation or a transformation of CLL, resulting in an aggressive clinical course. The inclusion in this syndrome of CLL cases associated with HD is still controversial. Many of these cases could be giant cell pleomorphic lymphomas, while, on the contrary, in typical cases this association might be merely fortuitous.",,,,Sindrome di Richter.

The results demonstrated the presence in leukaemic cells of an alteration in the incorporation of steroid hormones. This alteration was scarcely modified by incubation with theophylline, which increases cellular concentration of cAMP. On the other hand, it was moderately counteracted by thioproline and was evidently inhibited by flurbiprofen, which also reduced cellular concentrations of prostaglandins, particularly PGE2, with the exception of PGF2 which showed a poor response.

Within the concentration range of 0.1 to 50 microM, the cephalosporins had no effect on L 5178y cell growth. However, Molt-4 cell growth was significantly stimulated by 0.3 to 20 microM cefotaxime and cefodizime but was not influenced by ceftizoxime. Binding studies with [14C]cefotaxime revealed that the Molt-4 cells responding to the drug bind this cephalosporin to their cell surface (1.9 X 10(5) molecules per cell); no significant binding was observed in the assays with L 5178y cells. Determinations of the extractable activities of DNA-synthesizing enzymes from cefodizime-treated Molt-4 cells showed a direct correlation between cell growth and DNA polymerase alpha as well as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase activity; the DNA polymerase beta activity remained unchanged. Cefodizime (0.15 to 50 microM) which was added to mouse spleen cell cultures significantly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into lymphocytes. This stimulatory effect was less pronounced in concanavalin A-stimulated cultures.

The most common haematological features at initial presentation were refractory macrocytic anaemia, reticulocytopenia and associated with either bicytopenia or pancytopenia. The bone marrow was often cellular with megaloblastoid erythropoiesis and in 7 patients (29%), there were ring sideroblasts. Often there was associated dysgranulopoiesis and dysthrombopoiesis Myelodysplastic syndromes appear morphologically to be a heterogenous entity. An attempt to classify them according to the recent proposal of the French-American-British (FAB) Co-operative Group was made. Transformation into acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia occurred in 6 patients (25%). The mean interval between diagnosis and transformation to acute leukaemia was 13 months (range 3-30 months). Acute leukaemia in these patients were refractory to conventional chemotherapy.

In addition, unusual proliferation of epithelium and massive increase and activation of the monocyte-macrophage system were observed. Histochemical analysis permitted histogenetic classification of proliferating, and in part atypical, cell forms. Knowledge of the relevant clinical data is essential otherwise the findings cannot be differentiated with certainty from paraneoplastic epithelial anomalies or atypical cells induced by virus infection.

The hypothesis forms an extrapolation of previously developed concepts used to explain the effect of ionizing radiation and the cytotoxic action of UV light. The crucial potentially lethal lesion is assumed to be a DNA double-strand lesion which may be an interstrand cross-link or a pair of DNA single-strand alkylations, for example. The effect of repair processes is included in the analytical equation derived to describe cell survival. The analysis of several sets of cell survival data for different chemical mutagens is used to demonstrate the applicability of the hypothesis.

In vitro studies have shown, however, that spleen macrophages do not exert the same restorative effect. This in vivo study was designed to further analyze the restorative role of spleen macrophages in virus-induced immunodeficiency. Spleen cells from mice infected with the Friend-associated lymphatic leukemia virus (F-MuLV) were injected into lethally irradiated syngeneic hosts and immediately stimulated with antigen. Since the accessory functions of macrophages are highly resistant to ionizing radiations, the recipients were expected to provide the grafted cells with a supply of splenic accessory cells adequate to restore their immune functions. The primary antibody response of transferred cells was evaluated. Under these conditions, not only spleen macrophages but also peritoneal cells failed to restore the immune reactivity of infected cells, indicating that macrophages alone cannot overcome F-MuLV-induced immunodeficiency in irradiated hosts. Furthermore, irradiated and optimally reconstituted mice proved more susceptible than normal animals to the immunodepressive effect of the virus. These data suggest that additional mechanisms of immunosuppression may operate in irradiated mice and contribute to FLV-induced immunodeficiency. This model, however, may be a sensitive tool for investigating the subtle functional influences that certain viruses exert on the immune system.",,['10.1007/BF02122111 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we attempted to obtain a polysaccharide fraction with antitumor activity against L-1210 leukemia from this alga, on the assumption that the main active substance may be sulfated polysaccharide, especially fucoidan which is mainly composed of L-fucose and ester sulfate. Two kinds of polysaccharide fractions (SKCF and SKCF-F), which contained L-fucose and ester sulfate in the amount of 12.6% and 15.4%, 23.5% and 17.2% respectively, were first prepared starting with extraction with cold-hydrochloric acid, and their antitumor activity was examined. It was found however that they are not effective. Sulfation of SKCF was then carried out. The resulting sulfate (Sulfated SKCF) was observed to contain nearly 50% more ester sulfate than in SKCF and to be effective against L-1210 leukemia showing an ILS value of 26%. Mechanisms of antitumor action of this sulfate were also discussed from the viewpoints of negativity of ester sulfate and of activation of host-mediated immune response as known in antitumor polysaccharide preparations from other sources.",,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient with a diffuse lymphocytic lymphoma had a complete unmaintained remission lasting 6 months. Toxicity was minimal, with mild fever, nausea, and vomiting. These preliminary studies suggest that IFN may be a biological response modifier when used in combination with a cytotoxic agent.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MCNU was shown not only to have a broad antitumor spectrum against all the tumors tested, but also to be effective over a wide range of dosages. The antitumor activity of MCNU was superior to those of GANU and chlorozotocin and similar to those of ACNU and methyl-CCNU. Furthermore, MCNU and other nitrosoureas were evaluated for toxicity in BDF1 female mice with respect to body weight changes. Weight loss in mice given MCNU at a dose lethal to 10% of the mice was relatively mild and the treated mice regained body weight most rapidly to the pretreatment level among all groups receiving the above drugs at equitoxic doses.

According to their apparent function in each of these situations an attempt was made to classify the main physiopathological processes involving the perivascular spaces into 3 distinct groups. The perivascular spaces may be considered as follows: (1) double way route between the parenchyma and the leptomeningeal space (extension to the brain of a meningeal pathological process, drainage of parenchymal wastes); (2) elective location of the inflammatory reaction partly as a result of the presence of connective tissue; (3) site of particular lesions such as dilatation, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear.",,,,Pathologie des espaces perivasculaires du systeme nerveux central.,,,,,,,,

In this paper, sophisticated procedures for finding new potentialities of antibiotic-producing actinomycetes and isolating a novel class of antitumor antibiotics, the saframycins, are described. These antibiotics are satellite antibiotics which are co-produced in minute quantities with streptothricin by a strain of Streptomyces lavendulae. Saframycins, cyano-containing saframycin A in particular, are promising antitumor antibiotics because of their low toxicity to immunologically competent cells and organs, especially the bone marrow. Significant amplification of the yield of saframycin A was attained by the quite unexpected observation that the addition of cyanide to the culture broth significantly increased its production. Subsequent isolation of the saframycin A precursor, decyanosaframycin A or saframycin S, enabled us to prepare two kinds of labeled saframycin A which were critical for the elucidation of the unique molecular action mechanism of the antibiotic. On the basis of studies on saframycin biosynthesis, a method of preparing new saframycin derivatives using resting cells of the producing strain has been developed, and new saframycins with amino functional groups on their N-pyruvoyl side chain were obtained. Their HCl salts are readily soluble in water and are expected to exhibit pharmacodynamic properties different from those of other saframycins.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Marrow biopsies proved reliable in establishing and/or confirming the diagnosis in every patient, when available for review. Regardless of the degree of marrow involvement, the hairy cell infiltrates consistently exhibited wide spacing of their nuclei due to relatively abundant pale to clear cytoplasm. Hairy cells appeared homogeneous and bland, without mitotic activity or prominent nucleoli; nuclear contours characteristically were ovoid and to a lesser extent slightly indented or reniform. The splenic histology of hairy cell leukemia was equally distinctive. The splenic red pulp was diffusely infiltrated by a uniform population of cytologically monotonous mononuclear cells that expanded the red pulp cords, filled the sinuses, and generally led to atrophy or obliteration of the white pulp. Moreover, the clear cytoplasm of hairy cells usually was highlighted in sinusoidal blood-filled lakes. Despite the employment of these characteristic morphologic criteria for the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia in marrow and spleen, these pathologic changes may vary and may be simulated in part by a variety of other hematologic disorders. Accuracy of diagnosis requires not only knowledge of the usual pathologic features of hairy cell leukemia but also knowledge of the unusual. Awareness of these pathologic variations will aid in the improvement of diagnosis and will provide a foundation for understanding the clinical and biologic aspects of hairy cell leukemia.","['CA-09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['0093-7754(84)90076-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

All heteroantisera prepared in rabbits or goats to either fully glycosylated retroviruses or influenza virus were virtually unreactive toward the viral glycoproteins after carbohydrate removal. Analyses with a panel of monoclonal antibodies to purified Rauscher murine leukemia virus gp70 indicated that the reactivity of most of these antibodies improved while the reactivity of others decreased or remain unchanged after carbohydrate removal. Most of the antibodies to synthetic peptide sequences in the influenza virus hemagglutinin also improved in reactivity after carbohydrate removal. These data indicate that carbohydrate side chains on viral glycoproteins influence the immune response to these antigens, and the more native the glycoprotein immunogen, the more dramatic the carbohydrate influence. Thus the immune response to these glycoproteins is not simply a function of the immunogenicity of certain domains over others but rather is a direct measure of carbohydrate influences on the host's perception of the foreign antigen.","['CA25533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1126/science.6505693 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

By time lapse photography this change is seen to start within 10 min of exposure to the TPA and is characterised by slow but continuous extension and retraction of the processes. Apparent phagocytosis of sheep red cells but not of sensitised human red cells occurs. This response to TPA is prevented by cytochalasin D but not by 13 cis-retinoic acid. Lymphocytes from normal individuals and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and lymphoblasts from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia reacted by adhering to each other in small aggregates but did not adhere to the plastic surface. Monocytes adhere to plastic surfaces and respond to TPA by extension and retraction of cytoplasmic folds differing from the long slender processes formed by the HCL cells. Thus HCL cells are different in their response to TPA from both normal lymphocytes and monocytes.",,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1984.tb02232.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In patients with ALL receiving cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate, CFU-GM numbers were significantly lower than in normal individuals; cycles of 'reinduction' chemotherapy (vincristine, prednisolone) caused a 10-fold increase in CFU-GM per ml of blood. In 2 ALL patients a substantial increase in CFU-GM numbers preceded the morphologically detectable relapse. In patients with AML receiving repeated courses of cytosine-arabinoside and 6-mercaptopurine, circulating CFU-GM were likewise reduced. In 6 patients who relapsed, a further reduction of CFU-GM was seen. A complete absence of circulating CFU-GM was observed in 10 of the 23 investigations performed within 6 weeks prior to the morphologically detectable relapse, while such a 'zero'-growth occurred in only 1 of 54 experiments performed during stable remission. In summary, in patients with ALL in remission, circulating CFU-GM are increased following treatment with vincristine and prednisolone. In patients with AML, declining numbers of circulating CFU-GM may predict an imminent relapse.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of T-lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte culture in the presence of macrophages is accompanied by raised neopterin levels in the supernatant. Neopterin may therefore be considered a specific indicator of cell-mediated immunity. Pretreatment analysis of patients with hemopoietic (191), urological (82) and gynecological (224) neoplasia revealed neopterin levels above the upper normal limits, with frequencies ranging from 57% (cervical carcinoma) to 96% (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). In patients with tumors of the genitourinary tract or with hemopoietic neoplasms, urinary neopterin levels were correlated with the tumor burden and became normal when remission was achieved. In gynecological cancer long term follow-up studies showed the value of neopterin excretion levels as a tumor marker. Tumor progression was indicated early by a rising neopterin level. Based on a comparison of different tumor types, the association of cell-mediated immunity and of neopterin excretion levels in less differentiated neoplasm is discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The results and those reported earlier divided the cells into two distinct groups. In mouse P388, L1210 and L929 cells uridine and hypoxanthine had little effect on the transport of each other, supporting the view that nucleosides and hypoxanthine are transported by different carriers. In these cells, hypoxanthine transport was also uniquely resistant to inhibition by dipyridamole (IC50 (50% inhibition dose) greater than 30 microM). In Novikoff and HTC rat hepatoma, Chinese hamster ovary and Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, on the other hand, hypoxanthine and uridine inhibited the transport of each other about 50% at a concentration corresponding to the Michaelis-Menten constant of their transport, and hypoxanthine transport was strongly inhibited by dipyridamole (IC50 = 100 to 400 nM). Although these results are compatible with the view that nucleosides and hypoxanthine are transported by a common carrier in these cells, this conclusion is not supported by the finding that uridine transport is strongly inhibited in some of these cell lines, as in the first group of cells, by nitrobenzylthioinosine, whereas hypoxanthine transport is highly resistant in all cell lines tested. In contrast, the transport of both substrates is highly resistant to inhibition by nitrobenzylthiopurine. The Michaelis-Menten constants for uridine transport are about the same in all cell lines. The Michaelis-Menten constants for hypoxanthine transport are similar to those for uridine transport in some cell lines, but are much higher in others.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",['GM 24468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1007/BF01868718 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Morphology, benzidine staining, and heme synthesis kinetics showed that many erythroblasts from FVP-infected mice were undergoing terminal differentiation, while few erythroblasts from FVA-infected mice showed evidence of terminal differentiation. When cultured in methylcellulose medium, splenic erythroblasts from FVP-infected mice completed differentiation without the addition of erythropoietin (EP) to the medium. However, splenic erythroblasts from FVA-infected mice underwent terminal differentiation in vitro only when EP was added to the medium. From spleens of FVA-infected mice, a population of large, immature-appearing erythroblasts was obtained by separation with velocity sedimentation at unit gravity. Serial studies of the separated erythroblasts which were cultured with EP showed that despite some heterogeneity in their proliferative capacity, they were relatively homogeneous in their degree of differentiation in that they had not begun to synthesize heme or globin. Morphological changes and syntheses of heme and globins were monitored during terminal differentiation induced in vitro by EP. The accumulation of immature erythroblasts in vivo, their responsiveness in vitro to EP, and availability of large numbers of cells (10(8) or more) make the splenic erythroblasts of FVA-infected mice an ideal population of cells with which to study EP-mediated terminal differentiation.

A dark light camera with an image intensified silicon tube (RCA-ISIT), an automatic scanning stage and an autofocus device were fitted to a Leitz-TAS microscope. The camera permitted localization of Feulgen stained nuclei and measurement of area and light intensity by means of incident of light fluorescence in the red. After automatic changes of the Opak-illuminator silver grains were determined by means of polarized incident light reflected from the grains in the blue. A 25 X oil objective (aperture 0.75) yielded sufficient resolution for measurements. The nadir between the proportions of labeled and unlabeled nuclei was calculated from the data of one specimen on a PDP-computer using a new algorithm based on the minimal variance of the logarithm of reflected light per nucleus. Labeling indices determined by visual grain counting and by automatic analysis of the autoradiographs were well correlated (r = 0.87 to 0.92). Visual grain counts/nucleus and reflected light/nucleus correlated well when individual nuclei were compared (r = 0.92 to 0.97) or means of labeled nuclei of various specimens prepared during a 5 year period (r = 0.90 to 0.93). Quenching of nuclear Feulgen fluorescence was minimal. The optimal labeling range is 30-100 grain counts/nucleus.

The anti-LR antibody (humoral) response was defined by both its cytotoxic antibody titer and isotype composition, assessed by a complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay and radioimmune assay, respectively. The cytotoxic thymus (T)-derived lymphocyte response in the spleen was quantitated by 125I release by 125I-IUdR-labelled target cells. Analysis of the sera of tumor-bearing mice indicated that the LR leukemia cells elicited a wide spectrum of anti-tumor antibody isotypes. In mice that mounted a rejection response, the IgM anti-LR response was transient, while in those that did not, the IgM response persisted. Antibody titers for all isotypes remained low until the onset of LR rejection. At that time, high titers of IgG anti-LR antibodies, predominantly of the IgG2a subclass, were detected in sera of tumor-free mice. Thus, the LR rejection response coincided best with the appearance of high titers of IgG2a anti-LR antibodies. A single i.p. injection of viable LR cells elicited a potent cell-mediated immune response; neither the appearance nor the magnitude of the cell-mediated immune response as measured in the spleen correlated well with the onset or the strength of the LR rejection response in the peritoneal cavity. The LR peritoneal cell population grew unabated in the presence of an intense spleen cell-mediated immune response, and the rejection process began at a time when little cellular immunity could be detected. These results suggest that in the rejection response IgM antibodies contribute little, if any, to the process, and the role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes is questionable (uncertain). The rejection of LR cells appears to be primarily mediated by IgG2a antibodies.","['CA-14409/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22664/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/ijc.2910340516 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The biochemical alterations responsible for antineoplastic activity were investigated using the most potent member of this class synthesized to date, the 3,4-dimethoxybenzenesulfonylhydrazone of 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde 1-oxide (3,4-DSP), as the prototype compound. The primary biochemical lesion observed was the production of DNA single-strand breaks, which were analyzed using alkaline elution methodology. This production of DNA damage required the spontaneous chemical formation of a reactive species; thus, ""aging"" of a solution of 3,4-DSP prior to exposure of L1210 leukemia cells in culture markedly decreased the production of DNA single-strand breaks. The chemical production of an alkylating species from 3,4-DSP has been proposed to occur by the intramolecular abstraction of the nitrogen proton by the 1-oxide group, followed by release of arenesulfinic acid to form the potent alkylating species, 1-oxidopyridin-2-yldiazomethane. Replacement of the proton by a methyl group, lack of the 1-oxide group, or replacement of the aldehyde proton by a methyl group increases the chemical stability of the arenesulfonylhydrazones. These modifications have been shown in a previous publication (D .A. Shiba, J. A. May, Jr., and A. C. Sartorelli, Cancer Res., 43: 2023-2029, 1983) to lead to (a) an elimination of alkylating activity and (b) a decrease in in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo anticancer activity. These effects are also accompanied by an inability to produce detectable DNA single-strand breaks. 3,4-DSP caused little or no inhibition of the biosyntheses of DNA, RNA, or protein, as measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine, uridine, or leucine, respectively, into acid-insoluble material; however, consistent with the production of DNA damage, 3,4-DSP inhibited the normal progression of L1210 cells through the cell cycle after a single treatment in vivo with drug (100 mg/kg). Cells were blocked in the G2-M phase of the cell cycle for 6 to 24 hr after exposure to 3,4-DSP; the cell population recovered by 48 hr after exposure and appeared to be progressing normally through the cell cycle.","['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-08797/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic effects as measured by the reduction in splenomegaly were seen with all the radiolabeled proteins tested, but not with 131I-tyrosine. Dose-response curves showed that about 90% reduction in spleen size occurred at 80 muCi injected per animal, irrespective of whether specific or nonrelevant monoclonal antibody was used. Therapeutic efficacy was affected by the size of the 131I-carrier and could be correlated with half-life of carrier protein in vivo.

Cytotoxicity in sensitive cells correlates with the intracellular amount of Rho-123, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Differential resistance coincides with Rho-123 accumulation which in sensitive cells was 20-fold higher than in resistant cells after 180 min of treatment. Sodium azide, which has been shown to inhibit ADM efflux and consequently increase drug accumulation in ADM-resistant cells, did not inhibit Rho-123 efflux. The difference in Rho-123 accumulation between sensitive and resistant cells correlates with cytotoxicity, which is in contrast to what has been found in these cells when treated with either ADM or DNR. Moreover, in contrast to the known effects of ADM and DNR on macromolecular synthesis, Rho-123 in sensitive cells was found to inhibit protein synthesis but had no effect on DNA or RNA synthesis. At Rho-123 doses which inhibited protein synthesis, drug localization changed from mitochondrial specific to generalized cytoplasmic. This effect was never achieved in resistant cells, even with prolonged drug exposure. The relevance of these findings is that different mechanisms of resistance to different drug types can be identified in the same cells even though similar resistance occurs. The similarity in resistance need not share a common mechanism. Although the drugs are effluxed more efficiently in resistant cells, the mechanisms for resistance in each case seem to differ. In the case of ADM and DNR, it appears to be multifactorial, whereas with Rho-123, total intracellular accumulation seems to be most important.",['CA 37109-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The procedure used was a cell synchronization technique involving methotrexate or cytosine-arabinoside and thymidine release. Quantitative analyses were made comparatively between synchronized and nonsynchronized (control) cultures in each patient. Mitotic indices varied with the individual. The average number of G-bands per haploid set increased statistically in 8 cases, and the count was often over 400. Improved chromosomal banding patterns in the synchronized preparation resulted in easy and precise identification of chromosome rearrangements in three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), two with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and three with anemias. Normal cells were more frequently observed in synchronized overnight cultures than in control cultures from two patients with an admixture of normal and abnormal metaphases. There was a slight increase in a minor abnormal clone in the synchronized cultures from one patient.

The results showed a significant correlation between serum deoxythymidine kinase activity (S-TK) and disease status, i.e., higher values were found in patients with progressive disease, compared to those with indolent disease. S-TK also correlated with Rai stage. S-TK values of more than 40 times the normal value were found in some patients. All patients with S-TK greater than 8.4 units had a disease that was or became progressive during the observation period. Within the patient group with indolent disease two groups that differed with regard to prognosis could be distinguished according to their initial S-TK values. In longitudinal studies of 18 patients with indolent disease, S-TK was found to exceed 8.4 units only on one occasion during an observation period of up to 68 months. In patients with indolent disease, a transition to progressive disease was parallelled by an increase in S-TK. Studies of S-TK levels in 18 patients receiving treatment showed that S-TK decreased during successful therapy. S-TK was also found to increase when the disease was reactivated. From these results it is concluded that S-TK could be used as a prognostic marker for the individual CLL patient.

This observation would indicate that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was mainly metabolized to produce 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP), via 5-flu fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine(FdUR). FdUMP would inhibit DNA synthesis by blocking thymidilate synthetase activity, resulting in the death of cancer cells. Thd Pase activity by which 5-FU is converted to FdUR would participate greatly in the antitumor effect of the compounds because of the fact that FdUR has 1,000 times greater antitumor activity than 5-FU. Moreover, some of the fluoropyrimidines are activated by this enzyme to produce 5-FU. It should be emphasized that Thd Pase activity is higher in tumor tissue than in normal tissues. This finding would mean that the compounds would exert a selective (antitumor) activity on cancer cells. In addition, a clinical trial of fluoropyrimidines showed them to be effective when administered to patients in order to maintain a lower effective level of 5-FU in tumor tissues for a longer period of time. Such experiences would also lend more weight the possible of the mode of action of the of fluoropyrimidines mentioned above.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The two techniques were in close agreement both for identification and for the quantitation of the blast cells except in three cases where PPO was present in the absence of the immunological markers.

A diffuse cytoplasmic labelling was observed with anti factor VIII vwF and anti platelet factor 4 (PF 4). In addition, the leukemic maturation was quite similar to normal megakaryocyte differentiation since in micromegakaryocytes the expression of Gp Ib was strong and an intense granular pattern of labelling with anti factor VIII vwF and anti PF 4 was observed. In no case was the leukemic megakaryocytic series labelled by anti-erythroid antibodies, anti myeloid antibodies or J 5, B 1, OKT 11 antibodies.

However, this association has been less clear in the mouse, largely because of difficulties in obtaining highly enriched populations of LGL from normal spleen and blood. We have previously observed that the administration of the biological response modifier (BRM) maleic anhydride divinyl ether (MVE-2) strongly augmented NK activity in lung and liver, and the augmented NK activity coincided with increased resistance to the formation of experimental metastases in these organs. The degree of NK augmentation was most striking in the liver, an unexpected and previously unreported observation. In the present study, both MVE-2 or Corynebacterium parvum induced a dramatic augmentation of liver NK activity, which reached maximum levels 3-5 d after treatment. This augmentation of NK activity in the liver coincided with a large increase in the number of lymphoid cells with the morphological characteristics of LGL that could be isolated from enzymatically digested suspensions of perfused liver. The yield of LGL per liver following BRM treatment corresponded to a 10-50-fold increase as compared to normal mice. LGL were purified from these enzymatically digested suspensions of perfused liver by depletion of adherent cells on nylon wool columns and subsequent enrichment for low-density lymphoid cells by fractionation on Percoll density gradients. The enrichment of LGL correlated with greatly increased NK activity against YAC-1. Conversely, the higher-density fractions were depleted of both LGL and NK activity. This increase in NK activity in the liver was suppressed by in vivo treatment with anti-asialo GM1 (asGM1) serum. This treatment also resulted in a corresponding reduction in both the total number and percentage of LGL. By flow cytometry analysis, the phenotype of the majority of these highly cytolytic LGL isolated from the livers of BRM-treated mice were asGM1+, Thy-1+, Ly-5+, Qa-5+, Mac-1+, and Gma-1+, whereas these LGL were Ly-1-, Lyt-2-, L3T4-, and surface Ig-. We conclude that the livers of BRM-treated mice can provide a rich source of highly active mouse LGL that could be used for further characterization of this lymphocyte subset. Further, these studies imply a potential for BRM therapy of neoplastic or viral diseases through augmentation of organ-associated immune responses.",['N01-CO-23910/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1084/jem.160.5.1431 [doi]'],PMC2187504,,,,,,,,,

Since 25-hydroxycholesterol rapidly stimulated incorporation of [3H]oleate into the cholesteryl ester fraction of these cells, we have tested the possibility that the well-known inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) by 25-hydroxycholesterol might be the indirect consequence of an increased cholesterol esterification rather than a direct effect on HMG-CoA reductase. The experimental results show that progesterone, an inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), when added together with 25-hydroxycholesterol, abolished the increased cholesterol esterification without affecting the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by 25-hydroxycholesterol. Thus, uncoupling cholesterol esterification had no effect on 25-hydroxycholesterol's ability to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. Unexpectedly, pretreatment of P388D1 cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol resulted in no elevation of ACAT activity as measured in broken cell preparations. Therefore, the possibility that 25-hydroxycholesterol stimulated cholesteryl ester formation by increasing the amount of cholesterol available for esterification, rather than by acting directly on ACAT activity, was considered.

These variants show 3- to 14-fold increases in [3H]methotrexate influx compared to parental cells but are unaltered for [3H]methotrexate efflux. This increased influx in each variant is quantitatively reflected in corresponding elevations in intracellular exchangeable levels of drug at steady state, but there is no alteration in membrane potential. The increases in influx are associated with increased values for influx Vmax for a system normally transporting reduced folates and the same increase in the amount of a specific binding component at the cell surface. Otherwise, values for influx Km and specificity for various folate structures are unchanged. This alteration in [3H]methotrexate influx is biochemically and genetically stable, since it is expressed in isolated plasma membrane vesicles and is retained during growth in non-selective medium. Following addition of cycloheximide, the same rate of decay of this transport activity (t 1/2 = 126 +/- 24 to 137 +/- 26 min) was shown for parental and variant cells. From these results we conclude that turnover of this transport property occurs in these cells which is genetically regulated. Also, the elevated transport activity inward for this folate analog in these variant cells is probably the result of a genetic alteration up-regulating the rate of synthesis of the ""putative"" carrier protein itself. The absence of any effect on efflux of [3H]methotrexate in these variants in the face of evidence for increased synthesis of the carrier protein for the system mediating influx of this folate analog is construed as further evidence for the nonidentity of systems mediating each flux that we proposed on the basis of earlier kinetic studies.","['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['S0021-9258(18)90668-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

In vitro cellular 14C-DNR was quantified by means of liquid scintillation spectrometry, whereas in vivo DNR and DOL concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. In vitro intracellular plateau concentrations of DNR were achieved within 1-2 h after continuous exposure to 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 microgram/ml in the majority of cases.

Studies were therefore performed in rat haemopoiesis in order to quantify the cell-killing effect on various phases of the cell cycle. For this purpose, the [3H]thymidine [( 3H]TdR) labelling index and the specific activity of [3H]TdR in the DNA-synthesizing fraction of cells were determined after a non-cytoreductive dose of 25 mg/kg HU, as well as a medium cytoreductive dose of 100 mg/kg. Furthermore, flow cytometric DNA histograms and absolute as well as differential cell counts of femoral bone marrow were performed after 100 mg/kg HU. The results indicate a predominant cell kill in G1 encompassing almost all 2c cells in the proliferative pool, while the S-phase fraction is not even reduced to half its initial value. The specific activity of [3H]TdR in cells synthesizing DNA, as well as the labelling index after HU show an initial dip and a tendency to recovery, as has been observed in many other cell systems. Instead of a complete restoration, however, there is a second depression of these parameters lasting for at least one cell cycle. The results are interpreted as a partly cell-cycle-dependent and partly independent action of HU in this cell system. The independent component may be attributed to the repeatedly described direct interference of HU with DNA. In rat haemopoiesis, therefore, this direct effect of HU on the DNA strands appears to be much more pronounced than in cell-culture systems and other mammalian tissues. In view of these findings, some caution should be taken in using HU for the determination of the S-phase fraction by way of a suicide experiment.",,['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1984.tb00621.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

A dose-dependent fall in plasma thymidine (dThd) (1.43 microM to 0.47 microM) occurred in non-tumour-bearing mice following the administration of CB3717. Further, in mice carrying the L1210/CBRI tumour, the drug's antitumour properties were ablated by co-administration of dThd, an effect consistent with TS being the cytotoxic locus. In vitro studies of protection by dThd against CB3717 cytotoxicity were carried out in an attempt to quantify this reversal. The metabolism of [14C]-dThd was measured in cultures of L1210 cells (10(4)/ml) exposed to a completely cytotoxic dose of CB3717 (50 microM). The cytotoxicity of the drug was only expressed when the dThd concentration (0.5-2 microM) had fallen to less than 0.1 microM in the media. This reduction was due to: (1) dThd incorporation into DNA, (2) catabolism of dThd to thymine. By reducing the initial cell concentration to 10(3)/ml the depletion of dThd was substantially reduced and consequently cells continued to grow for a longer period. The critical concentration of dThd, below which growth in the presence of CB3717 could not be supported was estimated to be between 0.026 and 0.1 microM. Thus even the minimum level of dThd achieved in vivo was still in excess of that required for protection from CB3717 toxicity in vitro. There was a small accumulation of deoxyuridine (dUrd) (approximately 2-fold) in mouse plasma 24 hr after completion of a 5-day course of CB3717 (200 mg/kg) but in vitro studies demonstrated that this was unlikely to modulate CB3717 toxicity in the presence of dThd. We caution against the use of rodent tumour models (or human tumour xenografts) for antitumour or toxicity testing of compounds designed to inhibit the de novo synthesis of thymidylate; they may be misleading because the high dThd levels found in these animals compared with man may mask the cytotoxic effects of these drugs.",,"['0006-2952(84)90089-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(84)90089-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

To characterize the two types of DNA lesions, euoxic mouse leukemia L1210 cells were treated with various antioxidant agents in the presence of 2.8 X 10(-6), X 10(-5), or X 10(-4) M concentrations of ADR. The enzymes superoxide dismutase (200 micrograms/ml) or catalase (250 micrograms/ml), the OH' scavengers dimethyl sulfoxide (70 mM) or ethanol (70 mM), and an inhibitor of superoxide production, 2-deoxy-glucose (1 and 10 mM), reduced the frequency of D-SSB to 18.3 to 68.2% of its level in ADR-treated controls, while the frequency of PA-SSB remained unchanged.

At lower ADR levels, relevant to clinical use, another type of interaction between the drug and DNA prevails, which apparently does not involve a free-radical mechanism.","['CA17263/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19118/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0006-2952(84)90069-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(84)90069-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Tumor cells that develop cytostasis and inhibition of mitochondrial respiration in response to cocultivation with activated macrophages release a significant fraction of their intracellular iron-59 content. Kinetic studies show that specific release of iron-59 from target cells begins 4-6 hours after initiating cocultivation which is the time point that inhibition of DNA synthesis is first detected. Treatment of tumor cells with metabolic inhibitors causing inhibition of respiration, protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, and DNA synthesis to a similar or greater extent than that caused by activated macrophages does not induce release of intracellular iron-59.

Solid-phase radioimmunoassays using purified glycolipids containing sugar sequences found in lacto-N-fucopentaose III demonstrated different binding characteristics for each antibody. PM-81 bound lower concentrations of glycolipids than PMN 29, while PMN 6 required the highest concentration of glycolipids for binding. Autoradiography of thin-layer chromatograms of glycolipid antigens supported these results.

It was one of a number of polycyclic aromatic compounds tested at the American Cyanamid Laboratories and was the most effective and potent derivative synthesized. Mitoxantrone produced significant increases in life span and long-term survivors when tested against P388 and L1210 leukemias, B16 melanoma, and colon tumor 26 transplanted into mice. In comparative animal trials, it proved more effective than most of the other agents tested, including doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, cytarabine, and 5-fluorouracil. It was also active against intravenously implanted L1210 leukemia, in contrast to doxorubicin, though this is considered to have a similar mode of action. Mitoxantrone also demonstrated moderate activity against sublines of the mouse leukemias, which were resistant to anthracyclines. Significant therapeutic synergism against P388 leukemia was observed when mitoxantrone was administered on the same day as methotrexate and cytarabine or in sequence with cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, or vincristine sulfate. Mitoxantrone is active intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, and intravenously, but oral activity has not been demonstrated. Although dose schedule did not appear critical, treatment every 4 days X 3 appeared to be the most effective. The mechanism of action of mitoxantrone has not been fully elucidated, but it is known to inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis. In cell culture, mitoxantrone induces nuclear aberrations with chromosomal scattering and morphologic alterations similar to those induced by doxorubicin. Drug-induced cell kill was not phase specific. Experiments with a resistant human colon carcinoma cell line (WiDr) indicated that resistance may be due to alterations of the cell membrane with decreased uptake. Mitoxantrone has markedly less cardiotoxicity than doxorubicin, and this may be linked to the fact that the drug does not induce free radical formation but inhibits lipid peroxidation.",,['0093-7754(84)90002-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

Similar cells which were fixed within 60 seconds of heating by glutaraldehyde were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The appearance of heated cells was compared with unheated controls which had been stored for one hour at 37 degrees C, 4 degrees C, and 22 degrees C respectively. After a heat treatment of 15 minutes at 43 degrees C the clonogenic fraction is only 0.1 but the appearance of approximately half the cells examined by SEM was unchanged. Virtually every cell heated for 30 minutes at 43 degrees C was abnormal. Progressive changes in the cell membrane were seen, such as loss of microvilli, folding and corrugation of the cell membrane and development of blebs. The lethal injury to cells is probably damage to enzyme systems in the cell membrane and elsewhere in the cell which is expressed as loss of clonogenicity. It is noteworthy that some cells appear to have been sterilised before morphological changes were seen. Two explanations are possible. The lethal injury as expressed by sterilisation may precede morphological changes or alternatively as cells had been heated for only a short time (10 or 15 minutes) and fixed within 60 seconds of heating, insufficient time had elapsed for gross changes to develop.",,,,,,,,,,,,

N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-7), N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W-5), trifluoperazine, and chlorpromazine were found to inhibit LMC (IC50 values = 8.9, approximately 50, 7.4, and 9.4 microM, respectively) at concentrations which were not detectably toxic to either the effector or the target cell. Pimozide inhibited LMC by 50% at 15 microM but caused a substantial decrease in lymphocyte ATP content and viability at this concentration. 1-[Bis(p-chlorophenyl)methyl]-3-[2,4-dichloro-beta-(2,4-dichlorobenzy loxy) phenethyl]imidazolium chloride (R 24 571, calmidazolium), which has been reported to be the most potent antagonist of isolated calmodulin, caused a marked decrease in lymphocyte ATP content and viability at concentrations greater than 4 microM and inhibited LMC only slightly at similar concentrations. Trifluoperazine sulfoxide and chlorpromazine sulfoxide were not inhibitory to LMC at less than or equal to 20 microM. LMC was inhibited in a sustained manner when cytolytic lymphocytes, but not target cells, were pretreated separately with W-7 or chlorpromazine at 37 degrees and were then washed free of exogenous drug prior to the start of the LMC assay. The above cellular effects of the calmodulin antagonists were reduced in magnitude when the serum concentration in the culture medium was increased (from 5% to 20%). The inhibition of LMC by micromolar concentrations of W-7, trifluoperazine, and chlorpromazine, as well as the relative inactivities of W-5 versus W-7 and of the sulfoxide derivatives of trifluoperazine and chlorpromazine, are consistent with calmodulin's being a lymphocyte receptor whose occupancy by Ca2+ is required for the performance of this cytolytic function. However, this conclusion must be tempered by the finding that even W-7, trifluoperazine, and chlorpromazine can exert nonspecific effects on the energy metabolism and viability of the cytolytic lymphocytes at concentrations of drug severalfold higher than those required to inhibit LMC.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The key findings are: (a) Asialo GM1, a major neutral glycolipid constituent of all macrophage populations examined, is accessible to galactose oxidase/NaB3H4 labeling on the surface of TG-elicited and BCG-activated macrophages but not on resident macrophages; (b) GM1 is the predominant ganglioside constituent of the mouse macrophage.

Three partially purified membrane fractions were obtained by sucrose density gradient centrifugation at the final step of purification from crude homogenate. About 96% of the basal and 89% of PGE2-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the homogenate were recovered in three membrane fractions. Two lighter membrane fractions (I and II), which were enriched 11-fold and 8.4-fold in adenylate cyclase activity over crude homogenate, were pooled and subjected to various studies. Results suggested that the basal activity of the membrane preparations has, as in many other cell types, a relatively broad pH optimum (pH 7.5 to 8.5), requires Mg2+, which must be present in excess ATP, and is inhibited by Ca2+. Highly reactive sulfhydryl group(s), which may be present in the lipid bilayer, is required for the adenylate cyclase activity. Because both fluoride ions and GTP augment the enzymatic activity, P388D1 cell membrane adenylate cyclase must possess stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein. The membrane preparations respond to exogeneously added PG by 1.5-fold to 3-fold increase in adenosine 3'-5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production. The magnitude of PG-responsiveness was dependent on the types of PG and the order of potency in stimulation was PGE1 greater than PGE2 greater than PGI2.

Cancer incidence in 14 Utah communities that had used predominantly asbestos-cement piping for transporting their drinking water supplies for 20 years or more were compared to 27 Utah communities that had never used asbestos-cement piping. Cancer incidence was tabulated for 11 cancer sites for the years 1967-1976. Increased Standard Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were found for cancer of the kidney in men (SIR 192) and leukemia (a control site) in women (SIR 203). No increased SIRs were found for the opposite sex at these sites or for the other gastrointestinal sites singly or in combination. There was no increase in age-adjusted cancer incidence for the 11 sites in 4 of the 14 study communities that had used asbestos-cement piping for 30 years or more.

We have attempted to determine whether the differences in tumorigenicity between these two lines of FLC were correlated with any biochemical changes in their cell membranes. Although consistent modifications of FLC membrane gangliosides were detected after FLC multiplied in the peritoneum, the pattern of FLC gangliosides was not a stable characteristic and did not correlate with tumorigenicity. In contrast, analysis of FLC membrane glycoproteins by cell surface labelling techniques (i.e., galactose-oxidase-borohydride techniques and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-fluorography) or by metabolic labelling of glycoproteins with 3H-galactose, revealed consistent differences in the high MW region of the gels between parental in vitro passaged FLC (either 745 or 3Cl-8 cells) and clones derived from in vivo passaged cells. No significant differences in the membrane proteins were detected between in vitro and in vivo passaged FLC when lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-autoradiography were used. It is seen that repeated in vivo passages of FLC resulted in the appearance of different patterns of membrane glycoproteins and that these changes appeared to be associated consistently with the capacity of these cells to grow as tumor ascites and to metastasize to the liver and spleen.",,['10.1002/ijc.2910340317 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Also, the need for an effective organizational background and a close functional connection of transfusion medicine and oncology are not appropriately observed. Whereas the results of studies investigating the prophylactic value of granulocyte transfusions remained negative, mainly due to an inadequate granulocyte dosage, the importance of earlier trials, demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy remains without objection, as subsequent studies also suffer from the transfusion of cells too low for clinical requirements. Granulocyte substitution is only one aspect of the biological defect compensation in the immunocompromised host.

During the past years, the direct transfer of results obtained under these conditions to the cellular behavior displayed in the living organism, has been increasingly challenged. For this reason we have investigated the above mentioned functions of different cell classes localized on glass and in the loose connective tissue. The cells utilized were: fibroblasts and macrophages from normal rat and rabbit mesenteries, V2 rabbit carcinoma cells and L5222 rat leukemia cells. The combination of time-lapse cinematography and scanning electron microscopy revealed that motility and surface features are the same, irrespective of the immediate surrounding. Cellular shape and attachment, on the other hand, are dependent on the substrate. Fibroblasts, macrophages and cells of epithelial origin, including carcinoma cells, flatten on glass, but have a rounded configuration in the tissue. The flat leading lamellae displayed during locomotion on glass, are not evident in cells migrating through tissues. What regards attachment devices, extensively studied on glass, their formation and position within a tissue are, at present, a matter of speculation. Although it can be assumed that a similar process is operable in vivo and in vitro, clarification rests upon the use of ultrahistochemical techniques.",,['10.1016/0309-1651(84)90049-3 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

A limited clinical evaluation of this drug in China revealed antileukemic activity, which prompted clinical trials in the United States. We have treated 43 patients with a variety of refractory malignancies using a daily iv treatment for 5 days at 3-4-week intervals. The starting dose of homoharringtonine was 0.2 mg/m2/day and it was escalated to a maximum of 8 mg/m2/day. The dose-limiting toxic effect was hypotension, which was generally mild with daily dose levels of 3-4.5 mg/m2/day and required no specific treatment besides iv fluid supplements in some patients. Hypotension became increasingly severe at the higher dose levels and resulted in cardiovascular collapse in four of 16 patients treated with dose levels of 5-6 mg/m2/day. A moderately severe degree of myelosuppression was observed with homoharringtonine doses of greater than or equal to 3 mg/m2. Myelosuppression was clearly related to the extent of prior treatment and was minimal in patients who had not received extensive prior treatment. Gastrointestinal toxic effects of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were observed in approximately two-thirds of the patients but these side effects were generally mild and self-limited. Drug-related fever and alopecia were also observed in some patients. No major responses were observed, although three patients with solid tumors evidenced minor responses and three of five patients with acute leukemia showed some degree of antileukemic activity. For phase II studies of homoharringtonine in solid tumors, a daily dose of 3 mg/m2 for 5 days in patients with extensive prior treatment and 4 mg/m2/day for 5 days in patients with good bone marrow reserve will be utilized. The daily dose must not exceed 4 mg/m2 to avoid serious hypotension; further dose escalations should be accomplished by extending the number of days of treatment beyond 5 days.",['N01-CM-27550/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The overall standardized risk ratio comparing IF with EF is 1.3, implying a 30% excess mortality in IF, a nonsignificant difference. For males the risk ratio is 1.7 and significant, whereas for females it is 0.6, a nonsignificant reduction in risk with IF therapy. Extension-free survival was significantly better in the EF group than in the IF within 2 years after treatment, and that benefit persists to the current follow-up, with extension-free survivals of 42% IF and 64% EF at 5 years. The risk ratio is 1.7. Favorable survival is significantly correlated with initial characteristics of female sex, age younger than 40 years, and histologic type nodular sclerosis or lymphocyte predominance.

Using alkaline elution to assay single-strand breaks in isolated L1210 nuclei, we have further characterized conditions influencing this putative intranuclear reaction. We have found drug activity to be dependent on magnesium and pH and to be stimulated by low concentrations of ATP (0.05-1 mM), an effect which was not observed with a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP. Heat-labile activity in a nuclear non-histone protein extract was critical to VP-16-mediated DNA damage.

Histology, more specifically the abnormal localization of immature precursors (ALIP), cytology and karyotype analysis were correlated with survival time and the prognostic value of these factors was determined. The presence or absence of ALIP proved to be highly significant in predicting the duration of survival (P = 0.007): the presence of ALIP predisposes patients to early death with high probability of developing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), whereas the absence of ALIP carries a better prognosis with more long-term survivors and low probability of transformation to AML. The presence or absence of ALIP was not correlated with increased mortality from infection and/or bleeding. In contrast with ALIP, the main histological parameter, we were not able to obtain statistically significant prognostic information for cytology (FAB classification) or karyotype analysis (normal or abnormal chromosomes). We conclude that bone marrow biopsy provides useful information for the prognosis of MDS and that the presence of ALIP has greater predictive value than the more commonly used parameters deduced from cytology and karyotype.",,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb06079.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The assay, performed according to the technique already described, involves in vitro incubation of a tumor cell suspension with various concentrations of antitumor drugs for 1 h and evaluation of drug-induced cell damage by addition to the cultured cells of 125I-deoxyuridine 48 h after pharmacological treatment. Results are expressed as percent inhibition of the isotope incorporation with respect to untreated controls. Preliminary results demonstrated that this assay is able to evidence differential chemosensitivity exhibited in vivo by murine leukemias. The present study reports the results obtained using comparatively P388 and P388/ADR, a subline of P388 murine leukemia with acquired resistance to Adriamycin in vivo. We found that P388/ADR exhibited resistance to ADR and DNR at all the concentrations tested, whereas P388 was highly sensitive. Cross-resistance of P388/ADR was also found to some structurally dissimilar agents, i.e. VCR and Act-D. These in vitro results correlate well with much data in the literature concerning the characteristics of resistance and cross-resistance exhibited in vivo by P388/ADR. These results suggest the possibility of using a similar in vitro assay for predicting the in vivo drug resistance of human leukemias.",,,,Valutazione in vitro della chemiosensibilita' di una leucemia sperimentale murina resa resistente in vivo alla adriamicina.,,,,,,,,

This might be explained by transfer of a part of the population of the bone marrow cells from Go phase due to the cytotoxic damages of the proliferating cells. The DNA synthesis stimulation in the bone marrow was most likely associated with the toxic effect of the drugs. No correlation between the cardiotoxicity and inhibition of the DNA synthesis in the heart cells of the mice was observed. The nitroxyl radical showed no biological activity on this model. The average lifespan of the mice treated with the nitroxyl radical was the same as that of the control animals. A decrease in the incorporation of 2-14C-thymidine into DNA of the tumor, bone marrow and heart was observed in the tumor carriers with development of the tumor.",,,,Vliianie rubomitsina i ego paramegnitnogo analoga na sintez DNK.,,,,,,,,

The patient was admitted to the University Hospital with an unknown fever and suspicion of leukemia. He expired on the 13th day of hospitalization. Postmortem examination revealed generalized miliary tuberculosis. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was established only after autopsy. Difficulty in diagnosis of miliary tuberculosis is discussed. Also discussed is a probable association of acute interstitial nephritis with chemotherapy or miliary tuberculosis. Leukemoid reaction is thought to be associated with miliary tuberculosis. The present case reminds us that miliary tuberculosis should never be forgotten when treating a patient having a fever of unknown origin. Cases with tuberculosis were compiled from the Annual of Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan during 1974 through 1981. There were 3,242 cases of tuberculosis (1.4%) out of 235,095 autopsies recorded in the Annual of Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan during the above 8 years. Of 3,242 cases 618 were miliary tuberculosis. The latter figure indicates 19.0% of all tuberculosis and 0.26% of all autopsies. Although all age groups were not spared, the 7th and 8th decades were more affected than the others. Tuberculosis has markedly declined since the advent of antituberculous antibiotics. But, autopsy cases with tuberculosis have not recently decreased in number. Clearly, increased awareness of the continuing presence of tuberculosis is needed.",,['10.7888/juoeh.6.75 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The time dependencies are initially left unspecified and the data on leukemia mortality--up to the end of 1978--are used to infer them. Several findings based on T65 revised doses (T65DR) are obtained. First, it is shown that the fits to the data of time-dependent L (linear in gamma dose)-Q (quadratic in gamma dose)-L (linear in neutron dose), L-L, and Q-L dose-response models are significantly improved (P less than 0.001) by using the corresponding time-dependent dose-response models. Second, it is shown that the increased risk of leukemia mortality due to gamma irradiation decreases in time while the increased risk due to neutron exposure decreases more slowly, if at all, in time. Consequently, relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of neutrons is shown to increase in time (P = 0.002) and the current definition of RBE as a time-independent quantity is therefore challenged. It is demonstrated with time-dependent models that the L-L model has a poor fit (P = 0.01) to the data for the first 7 years of study, but has an adequate fit for the remaining 21 years. In contrast the Q-L model has an adequate fit for the entire follow-up period (P greater than 0.30).",,,,,,,,,,,,

With 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) plus longwave ultraviolet light (UVA) as the lesion-inducing agent, however, it is easy to manipulate the relative frequency of different DNA adducts by means of a special experimental protocol (the tap-and-test protocol) and this can be used to measure repair of DNA adducts. Three classes of photoadducts are produced by 8-MOP plus UVA treatment: 3,4-cyclobutane monoadducts, 4',5'-cyclobutane monoadducts, and 8-MOP-DNA interstrand crosslinks. A monoadduct is formed when a photoactivated 8-MOP molecule reacts with a pyrimidine base. An 8-MOP-DNA interstrand crosslink is formed when an existing monoadduct is photoactivated to react with another pyrimidine base on the opposite DNA strand. Thus monoadducts are formed by absorption of one photon of light and crosslinks by absorption of two. In the tap-and-test experiments, cells were exposed to UVA in the presence of 8-MOP and then re-exposed to UVA in the absence of free 8-MOP so that only crosslinks can be produced by the second UVA treatment. By means of this technique we have previously shown that DNA crosslinks are much more effective than monoadducts at producing chromosomal damage (sister-chromatid exchanges and micronuclei) but not mutations (Liu-Lee et al., 1984). If L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells were able to remove monoadducts, incubation prior to the second UVA treatment should lead to decreases in the effect of re-irradiation, because fewer monoadducts would be available for crosslink formation. In this way, we have found that psoralen monoadducts are repaired in these cells and that about 70% of those capable of crosslink formation are removed or otherwise made unavailable for crosslink formation in 6 h.",,"['0167-8817(84)90068-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-8817(84)90068-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, stromal cells were derived from normal progenitors in a patient with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia whose clone showed differentiative expression confined to cells in the granulocytic lineage. Mixing experiments demonstrated that the G6PD type displayed by the adherent marrow stromal cells was not obscured by contaminating non-adherent hematopoietic cells or marrow fibroblasts.

A small group of virus strains induce acute leukemias and transform hematopoietic cells in vitro. We have shown that cells transformed in vitro by erythroblastosis and myeloblastosis viruses resemble in vivo transformed cells in their phenotype of differentiation. The erythroblastosis virus AEV carries two cell-derived oncogenes termed erbA and erbB. The analysis of AEV using deletion mutants showed that erbB is the main oncogene which is capable of inducing a ""mild"" form of erythroleukemia. The added action of the erbA oncogene leads to an aggressive, more ""advanced"" form of erythroleukemia. The erbA oncogene itself, however, does not exhibit any detectable biological activity. Using temperature sensitive mutants of AEF we could also show that erbB, together with erbA, blocks the differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells.

The strategy for treatment of leukemia is that one achieves cure by destruction of all leukemic cells, through this cannot be verified with present technology. The incidence of CNS-leukemia and the factors influencing this complication have been studied in a group of 131 cases with acute childhood leukemia. The overall incidence of CNS-leukemia was 30% in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 8% in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). However, cumulative incidence of CNS-leukemia calculated by modified Life-Table Method showed 56.8% in children who survived over 48 months after diagnosis of ALL. It was considered that the chief cause of the increased incidence of this complication was prolongation of survival. The CNS-leukemia was significantly greater in patients with under 10 year of age (p greater than 0.05), high initial leukemic cell counts (p less than 0.025), high appearance rate of leukemic cells in peripheral blood (over 50%) (p less than 0.005), and hepatosplenomegaly, especially lymph node enlargement (p less than 0.05). Blood-borne metastasis was considered to be probably the chief route of leukemic infiltration to the CNS. Between 1972 and 1978, 153 children with ALL were treated with multiple methods of CNS-prophylaxis, and were analyzed in relation to treatment regimens, age, sex and initial hematologic status. Patients received CNS-prophylaxis; Group I: three doses of intrathecal methotrexate (MTX 12 mg/m2) and hydrocortisone (HDC 12 mg/m2), Group II: same as in Group I followed by cyclic MTX and HDC, Group III: same as in Group I plus 2,400 rads of cranial irradiation. CNS-leukemia terminated complete remission 25 of 153 patients (16.3%). The cumulative incidence of CNS-leukemia at 4 year calculated by the Kaplan-Meier Method was 40.5% in Group I, 26.9% in Group II, and 14.5% in Group III. Development of CNS-leukemia was more frequent in male than in female (p less than 0.05), and in patients with initial high leukocyte counts (WBC greater than 25,000/mm3). We conclude that the combination of cranial irradiation and intrathecal MTX and HDC was highly efficacious. However, more intensive CNS-prophylaxis should be needed for such a high risk patients in male with high initial WBC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, the absolute differential in mobility of loaded and unloaded carrier (assumed from the extent of transstimulation obtained) varied substantially among the anions examined. No stimulation was obtained with Cl-, and stimulation was twofold with Pi, SO2-4 and methotrexate and fourfold with 1,L5-CHO-folate-H4.

Glycosylation of persilylated as well as nonsilylated 3-bromoallopurinol with 1-O-acetyl-2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-D-ribofuranose (4) provided the key intermediate 3-bromo-1-(2,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidin-4(5H)-one (5a). Similar glycosylations of 3-cyanoallopurinol and 3-(methylthio)allopurinol furnished the corresponding protected N-1 glycosyl derivatives (5b and 5c). Debenzoylation of these nucleosides (5a-c) gave the corresponding 3-bromo-, 3-cyano-, and 3-(methylthio)allopurinol nucleosides (6a-c). The site of glycosylation and anomeric configuration of 6a and 6c were assigned on the basis of spectral studies as well as conversion to allopurinol ribonucleoside, whereas the structural assignment of 6b was made by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Conventional functional group transformation of 5a and 5b provided a number of novel 3-substituted allopurinol nucleosides, which included 10a and 18a-d.

About 20 cases have occurred in each 5-year period since 1950, but 31 were seen between 1955 and 1959. Correspondingly, an excessive number of children born in the period 1954 to 1958 have developed medulloblastomas. A relationship to polio vaccine contaminated with SV40 virus may exist. Children with medulloblastomas had an increased number of immediate family members with brain tumors, leukemia, and childhood cancer when compared to controls. In this series, the male to female ratio was 1.33:1. Average age at diagnosis was 6 1/2 years, with most children being diagnosed at 3 years old and fewer cases appearing in each successive hemidecade from birth to 20 years of age. Probability of survival at 6 months was 0.687; at 1 year, 0.444; at 2 years, 0.314; and at 5 years, 0.222. Survival probability was statistically significantly better in the years 1968 to 1977 than in previous decades, in part due to fewer autopsy diagnoses and lowered operative mortality, but also due to a decreased mortality rate in children several years after diagnosis. Fifty-one percent were treated with operation and irradiation, 17% with operation alone, 12% with irradiation alone, and 5% with operation, irradiation, and chemotherapy. Fifteen percent were not treated. One- and 5-year survival rates in patients with operation and irradiation were, respectively, 0.615 and 0.307; with operation, 0.125 and 0.042; with irradiation, 0.688 and 0.277; and with operation, irradiation, and chemotherapy, 0.857 and 0.643. All seven children who received chemotherapy were diagnosed after 1968, and five are still alive. Perhaps due to short follow-up time, the course and mortality rate of children treated with all three modalities were not statistically significantly different from those of children treated since 1968 with operation and radiation therapy.",,['10.3171/jns.1984.61.4.0657 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

ASTA Z 7557 is a newly synthesized ""activated cyclophosphamide"" that circumvents the need for hepatic activation and has good stability. The critical cytotoxic lesions after exposure to bifunctional alkylating agents presumably are DNA interstrand crosslinks (ISC). We have, therefore, examined the formation and apparent removal of ISC after in vitro treatment with ASTA Z 7557 by use of the highly sensitive alkaline elution technique. Survival of murine L1210 cells was determined after 1 hour in vitro exposure with a D 37 value of 5.7 micrograms/ml (from the initial shoulder part of the survival curve) and a Do value of 1.5 micrograms/ml (from the exponential part of the curve). Previous labelling of L1210 cells by 125IUdR simplified the alkaline elution procedure but there was some cytotoxicity of the radiochemical itself with a reduction of cloning efficiency from 77% to 61%. The maximum of ISC was observed at 6 h after initiation of treatment with much of the damage apparently removed at 24 h. The simultaneous presence of DNA single strand breaks (SSB), however, confounds the analysis of DNA damage at 24 h and early cytolysis and unaided death of human lymphocytes often preclude the analysis of macromolecular damage at this time. Human peripheral blood cells isolated from patients with leukemic or lymphoproliferative diseases showed a remarkable heterogeneity with regard to the formation of ISC at 3 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,['10.1007/BF00232346 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

A decrease in the accessibility of DNA to several dyes, especially pronounced in the case of some intercalators, was observed in differentiated cells. After extraction of nuclear proteins with HCl there was an increase in DNA accessibility, of varying degree depending on the fluorochrome and the difference between differentiated and nondifferentiated cells was abolished for most of the intercalating dyes. The increase was the lowest for DAPI (45%), the highest for 7-amino-actinomycin D (13-fold), and in general was higher for the intercalating dyes that unwind DNA than for dyes binding externally to the double helix.

When VEP13+ cells were enriched by rosette formation using VEP13 coated ox red blood cells all the NK activity was recovered in the VEP13+ cell preparation, whereas the VEP13- subset was devoid of it, despite of the fact that there was a remainder (7-13%) of HNK-1+ cells. These VEP13- HNK-1+ cells were found to also bear the T3 antigen but lack the M1 antigen. Thirty-eight to sixty-eight per cent of VEP13+ enriched cell population expressed the HNK-1 antigen too. When these cells were further separated into HNK-1+ and HNK-1- cells by means of the FACS thus yielding the VEP13+ HNK-1+ and VEP13+HNK-1- subsets, it could be demonstrated that both populations were able to mediate natural killing against K-562 target cells thus indicating existence of an HNK-1- natural killer cell population.

DM-COOK appeared comparably or slightly more effective in L1210, P388, and M5 tumors in the mouse. However, when the treatment of mice bearing M5 with DM-COOK was combined with surgical removal of the primary tumor, the host's life-span was highly significantly prolonged. The two drugs showed similar activity in an M5 variant selected for resistance to cyclophosphamide. In L1210 Ha, a leukemia that is spontaneously resistant to DTIC, DM-COOK was not effective. Both DM-COOK and DTIC caused transient leukopenia with a maximum WBC fall of 57% and 71% compared with control values. DM-COOK's greater chemical stability might be an advantage, as the decomposition of DTIC is thought to lead to products responsible for some toxic effects in humans.

As neoplastic diseases are heterogeneous in regard to each cell subpopulation's response to a given therapy, a multimodality treatment approach should enhance the changes of all subpopulations of cells being killed. The potential of hyperthermia as a treatment modality for cancer was first predicted following observations that several types of cancer cells were more sensitive to temperatures in excess of 41 degrees than were their normal cell counterparts. Beyond these studies, there now is preclinical evidence as well as the clinical suggestion that hyperthermia potentiates radiation and/or drugs for the treatment of cancer. As most cancers refractory to conventional therapy are systemic diseases, the proposal that whole-body hyperthermia in combination with other therapies be used to treat metastatic disease is an inherently attractive approach. The basis and the practicality of this proposal is presented here with suggestions for its application to current preclinical and clinical research.","['P30 CA14520-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA35361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples were taken at various intervals, and the radioactivity in plasma was determined. The concentration of total radioactivity in plasma decreased rapidly postinjection, independently of the dose, and could not be readily resolved into a series of exponential terms with a high degree of confidence. Coadministration with polyinosinic acid in a 1:1 ratio significantly decreased the clearance of radioactive compounds from the plasma; moreover, the clearance of radioactivity decreased with increasing dose. Complexing with polyinosinic acid also decreased the rate of degradation of [35S]MPC as evidenced by an increase of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable fraction (i.e., oligonucleotides larger than five to ten nucleotide units), from 0.45 to 0.92 of the total radioactivity in plasma 60 min postinjection. The plasma clearance and organ distribution of radioactivity following injection of [35S]MPC were determined in normal and leukemic RFM/Un mice. About 90% of the 35S radioactivity was removed from the plasma in 5 and 10 min, respectively, in these two groups of mice, and the residual plasma levels of radioactivity at any given time were twice as high in the leukemic group throughout an observation period of 1 hr. Organ distribution studies demonstrated significantly greater (per mg tissue) accumulation of radioactivity in the livers and spleens of the leukemic versus normal mice at all time points, while the corresponding data for the kidneys were similar for the two groups. Another study, comparing the radioactivity in suspended and washed spleen cells harvested 60 min postinjection, indicated that 4 to 10 times more MPC and/or 35S-labeled oligonucleotides were localized and bound intracellularly in the spleens of the leukemic mice. These studies of the pharmacokinetic properties and metabolic degradation of [35S]MPC suggest that this polynucleotide may be protected from degradation by complexing with polyinosinic acid and that preferential accumulation of [35S]MPC occurs in organs infiltrated by leukemic cells.",['CA-06695-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

AZQ can undergo a reduction-oxidation cycle of the quinone function; this could generate free radicals which could produce DNA damage, especially DNA strand scission. The second reactivity, based on the two aziridine groups, could produce alkylation reactions that could produce DNA cross-links. DNA strand breakage and cross-linking were measured by alkaline elution and were compared with cell killing assayed by colony survival. Among the cell strains studied (human IMR-90, VA-13, and HT-29 and mouse L1210), marked differences were found in the magnitudes of DNA strand breakage and interstrand cross-linking produced by AZQ. Most striking, IMR-90 cells exhibited substantial strand breakage and little or no interstrand cross-linking, whereas the reverse was true for HT-29 cells. Cell killing correlated well with interstrand cross-linking but did not correlate with strand scission in these cell lines.

Selection of resistant cells was based on an in vitro-in vivo procedure as follows. Ascitic cells were taken from a leukemic mouse and incubated in vitro with the dimer for 1 hr. They were then injected into mice. After the development of the ascites, L1210 cells were collected and the process was repeated 13 times, until establishment of the resistance. Cloned resistant cells have maintained their resistance for 18 months of in vitro culture. The effects of two dimers (NSC 335153 and NSC 335154) on cell viability, growth, colony formation, and cell cycle progression were investigated on parental and resistant L1210 cells. The cross-resistance of these two L1210 cell lines to several cytotoxic agents was estimated. Several observations indicate that the mechanism of action of these dimers might be different from that of monointercalating agents: (a) these drugs induce a delayed toxicity (growth arrest occurring five generations after drug exposure) in sensitive but not in resistant cells; (b) cells exposed to the dimers arrested almost randomly in all phases of the cell cycle, whereas the corresponding monomer provokes a block in the G2 + M phase. Resistant cells were cross-resistant to 7H-pyridocarbazole monomer, Adriamycin, and vincristine but not to 6H-pyridocarbazole monomer derivatives, actinomycin D, and methotrexate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of cells to HCHO resulted in DNA-protein cross-links (DPC) and DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) in all cell types. DPC were induced at similar levels and were also removed by all cell types, with a half removal time of 2 to 3 hr. HCHO caused more SSB in the normal cell types than in the xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts. However, in all cell types, including the xeroderma pigmentosum cells, HCHO-induced DNA SSB and DPC were removed at comparable rates. By excision repair of HCHO-induced DNA damage, normal cells generated SSB that were also readily repaired. HCHO was only moderately cytotoxic to normal bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts at concentrations that induced substantial DNA damage. HCHO enhanced the cytotoxicity of both ionizing radiation and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in both cell types. The results indicate that most DPC caused by HCHO can be removed without the involvement of DNA excision repair.

These studies indicate the complexity of the HCHO-induced DNA damage and its repair and that HCHO may enhance the cytotoxicity of chemical and physical carcinogens in human cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A nontoxic concentration of quinidine increased VCR cytotoxicity in these resistant tumor cells about 50 to 80 times, and the drug in combination with VCR could completely reverse VCR resistance of these cell lines. Quinidine also enhanced the cytotoxicity of Adriamycin, especially in the Adriamycin-resistant subline of P388 leukemia; this enhancement (8-fold) was less than that of VCR toxicity in the VCR-resistant tumor line. When administered daily for 10 days with VCR, quinidine at doses of 50 to 125 mg/kg significantly enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of VCR in P388/VCR-bearing mice. Some other antiarrhythmic agents also showed similar effects in vitro, but these effects were considerably lower than that of quinidine. Quinidine increased the cellular levels of VCR and daunomycin in VCR-resistant sublines of mouse and human tumors and the ADM-resistant mouse tumor line in vitro, respectively. Quinidine also enhanced the cellular accumulation of VCR in P388/VCR cells in vivo. Thus, the therapeutic effect observed in P388/VCR-bearing mice might be due to the enhanced accumulation of VCR in P388/VCR cells by quinidine. The increase of cellular accumulation of VCR was partly explained by inhibition of efflux of VCR and daunomycin from the resistant tumor cells. The mechanism of this phenomenon is discussed in relation to previous findings on calcium channel blockers.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical diagnoses were chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in 5 cases (patients 1-5) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in patient 6. Three Ph1 variants were clear complex translocations, involving chromosomes #9, #22, and a third chromosome, i.e., #16, #11, or #14. The other three Ph1 variants appeared as ""simple"" translocations between chromosome #22 and chromosome #19, #4, or #12 when G- or Q-banding were used. When studied with high resolution R-banding, a small deletion of the terminal part of one chromosome #9 was visible, strongly suggesting that these variants were also complex translocations, i.e., t(9;19;22)(q34;p13;q11),t(4;9;22) (p16;q34;q11), and t(9;12;22)(q34;p13;q11). In the latter two cases, using in situ hybridization techniques, we demonstrated the presence of c-abl sequences on the Ph1 chromosome. This proved the involvement of 9q34 in these two variants. Our proposal is that most, and probably all, variants of Ph1 are complex translocations involving part of 9q34 and that the conjunction of a specific region of 22q11 with a specific segment of 9q34 (carrying the c-abl protooncogene) is essential for the development of Ph1 + CML.",,"['0165-4608(84)90083-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(84)90083-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

We measured the concentration of Ara-C in serum, and found that the maximum concentration reached a peak (52-132 ng/ml; mean 84.2 ng/ml) at 15 min following injection. These concentrations can be considered sufficient to inhibit DNA synthesis.

Of particular interest was the absence of differences in language-based measures of verbal memory and the presence of group differences on measures of memory for spatial material.

The majority of the leukemic cells had not left the spleen and liver within 48 hr. Liver radioactivity fell transitorily up to the third hr after the initial rise. The clearance curve of radioactivity from the blood showed a plateau or the appearance of a ""hump"" from 1 to 5 hr after injection of labeled leukemic cells. These results might reflect recirculation of a portion of the leukemic cells between these organs and the bloodstream. In a patient with acute monoblastic leukemia.

Especially the differentiation between benign and malignant tumors is not clear enough.

Statistical evaluation indicated a treatment-related response, particularly for the male rats, in the 100- and 33-ppm exposure groups. After 24 months of exposure, histologic findings confirmed hematologic evidence that exposure to EtO resulted in an increased prevalence of mononuclear cell leukemia, which is a neoplasm that is common in aged Fischer 344 rats. This increase was dose related and increased for each of the three exposure concentrations. The percentage of female rats with multiple neoplasms was also greater in all three exposure groups than in controls.

We have been investigating the relationship between c-myc expression and the terminal differentiation of cultured mouse erythroleukaemia (MEL) cells. We find that the level of c-myc messenger RNA shows a rapid biphasic change in MEL cells induced to differentiate by dimethyl sulphoxide or hypoxanthine.

When immunoprecipitates that formed between ASS and 125I-labeled lymphocyte surface glycoproteins were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it was found that ASS precipitated a 72K molecular weight (MW) glycoprotein from T cells but not from B cells. On the one hand, it was shown by functional studies that T cells sensitive to the cytotoxic effect of ASS contained T cells that could aid the immunoglobulin synthesis of B cells induced by pokeweed mitogen.

Megakaryocytes and platelets lacked alpha-granules while the plasma thromboglobulin level was three times the normal level. This suggested that the alpha-granular proteins were synthesized but not retained in alpha-granules. If this occurs, the increased marrow levels of platelet-derived growth factor and factor 4 would favor the proliferation of fibroblasts and the synthesis of collagen, and thereby promote myelofibrosis. After therapy-induced remission, the number of marrow megakaryocytes decreased, the alpha-granules were normally produced, the plasma beta-thromboglobulin level was normal and the myelofibrosis disappeared. These observations suggest that during acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, an acquired gray-platelet syndrome occurs and that the local excretion of alpha-granule proteins triggers the myelofibrosis.",,['10.1016/0145-2126(82)90048-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

We, therefore, investigated the relationship of immunoregulatory mononuclear cell subpopulations and disease activity in inactive and active CLL. The absolute number of T cells is increased in both groups compared to controls and a significant increase (p less than 0.001) in the number of monocytes was found in active patients. When the number of Fc gamma bearing T cells was compared to the number of B cells, active patients revealed a 993% decrease and inactive patients a 93% decrease compared to controls. Inactive patients also revealed increased proliferation when stimulated (PHA) after 48 hours in media alone compared to fresh cells. The active group revealed no increase in preincubated (PHA) stimulated cultures. As this suggested the possibility of immunoregulatory differences, suppressor cells were studied. Con A induced suppressor cells decreased proliferation of PHA stimulated cultures in inactive and control groups but had no effect in active patients. Isolated fresh autochthonous T cells (1:1) decreased PHA-induced proliferation 86% in the inactive group, 50% in the control group but had no effect in active patients. Pre-incubation (48 hr) followed by T cell separation revealed decreased Fc gamma T cells and abrogation of this suppressive effect in both inactive and control groups. Finally, isolated adherent cells decreased PHA stimulation by 86% in active patients but had insignificant effects on preincubated PHA stimulated cultures in the other groups. These data suggest that inactive CLL is characterized by a population of T suppressor cells that are more active than similar numbers of this population in control cultures. This population is short-lived and correlated with the Fc gamma bearing T cell population. This population appears inactive or non-functional in active CLL where adherent suppressor cells are increased.","['CA 18602/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 15389/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

HMG 14 and 17, but not HMB 1 and 2, were phosphorylated in the nuclei of all cell lines with a serine being the site of modification for both proteins in Ehrlich ascites cells. Phosphorylation of HMG 14 and 17 was greatly reduced in cultured cells at plateau phase in comparison to log phase cells, suggesting that modification of HMG 14 and 17 is growth-associated. However, phosphorylation was not linked to DNA synthesis, since incorporation of 32P did not vary through G1 and S phase in synchronized Chinese hamster ovary cells. Treatment of HT-29 or Ehrlich ascites cells with sodium butyrate reduced HMG phosphorylation by 30 and 70%, respectively. The distribution of the phosphorylated HMG proteins in chromatin was examined using micrococcal nuclease and DNase I. 32P-HMG 14 and 17 were preferentially associated with micrococcal nuclease-sensitive regions as demonstrated by the release of a substantial fraction of the phosphorylated forms of these proteins under conditions which solubilized less than 3% of the DNA.

In order to systematically study the mechanisms of resistance to 5-fluorouracil and its nucleoside derivatives, several cell lines resistant to these drugs have been derived from murine leukemia cells by a one-step mutation and selection procedure. Logarithmically growing suspension cultures of L1210 and P388 cells were treated with ethyl methanesulfonate, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, or ICR-191 at concentrations which result in 20 to 30% cell survival. After a 10-day expression time, mutagenized cells were plated into soft-agarose medium that contained 10(-5) M 5-fluorouracil, 10(-5) M 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, or 10(-6) M 5-fluorouridine. Twenty stable clones were isolated and found to be 5- to 28-fold resistant to growth inhibition by 5-fluorouracil, 4,000- to 25,000-fold resistant to 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, or 8- to 220-fold resistant to 5-fluorouridine. The clones retain their drug-resistant phenotype after repeated passaging in the absence of selection. Since the biochemical changes responsible for resistance to one drug can render the cells collaterally sensitive to other drugs, the growth-inhibitory effects of antimetabolites that inhibit other steps in pyrimidine metabolism were examined in the wild-type cells and in the fluoropyrimidine-resistant sublines. Although cross-resistance to 5-azacytidine was found in L1210 cells selected for resistance to 5-fluorouridine, none of the cell lines tested demonstrated collateral sensitivity to methotrexate, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, 5-azacytidine, or N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most authors have attributed MPR to immature or defective control on bone marrow development. In this report serial cytomorphologic and chromosomal findings in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of a child with the MPR suggests that MPR may be due to a spontaneously regressing clone of malignant cells. At the height of the myeloproliferative response, chromosomal studies demonstrated a clone of blast-like cells with a 21-22 translocation consistent with Down Syndrome and an X-8 translocation which was present only in the initial peripheral blood analysis harvested at 24 hours but was not present in the 72 hours samples. This X-8 translocation was not demonstrated in bone marrow or peripheral blood samples obtained at random times throughout the one year followup. During this period there was complete resolution of the MPR. In addition the chromosomes from one cell demonstrated several double minutes at the time of the MPR. Double minutes have previously been reported only in malignant diseases, especially tumors of neural origin and leukemia. These findings raise questions about the benign origin of the MPR and support the idea the MPR may be the result of a spontaneously regressing clone of malignant cells.","['AM 719305/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07468/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1002/ajh.2830110411 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In the first way, thawed cells were plated after the removal of DMSO by washing the cell suspension, in the second, cell suspensions were cultured after a simple 1:1 dilution of DMSO with medium. The number of CFU-C per 2 X 10(5) cells plated was higher washing out the DMSO in all the groups studied. However, the absolute numbers of CFU-C contained in the whole ampoules after the freezing procedures was approximately the same with both methods.

The supernatants from suppressive precultured cells were not suppressive. The suppressor cells also inhibited the response of allogeneic SPC beyond H-2 compatibility. The induction of the suppressor cells did not require the presence of antigen but required fetal calf serum (FCS) or both FCS and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME). The suppressor cells were generated from the nylon-wool adherent, radiation-sensitive T cell population. On the other hand, the suppressor cells were nylon-wool nonadherent, relatively radiation-sensitive T cells. Actively antibody-producing cells were not affected by the suppressor cells.

The monoclonal antibody, OKT17, recognizes a cell surface antigen present on the majority of resting normal peripheral T cells. In contrast, OKT17 is unreactive with normal B cells, B cell lines, T cell lines, or SIg+ CLL. Interestingly, after activation, the antigen recognized by OKT17 is lost from a subset of OKT4+ cells. We took advantage of this finding to explore further the functional heterogeneity within activated OKT4+ cells. Evidence was obtained that the PWM-activated OKT4+ subset remaining after depletion of OKT17-reactive T cells (OKT4+ 17-) contains radiosensitive helperr cells but is devoid of suppressor cells. In contrast, the activated OKT4+ 17+ population contains potent radiosensitive suppressor cells as well as radioresistant helpe cells. Taken together, these studies suggest that the OKT17 monoclonal antibody can differentiate two functionally mature, activated OKT4+ human T cells: OKT4+ OKT17+ radiosensitive suppressor cells and OKT4+ 17- radiosensitive helper cells.","['11524/PHS HHS/United States', 'AI 14969/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, even in groups with good qualitative agreement distinct quantitative differences indicated different molecular mechanisms of the formation of SCEs and breaks. Additional information supporting the importance of these differences for the validity of both indicator systems has been derived from the results obtained using strong clastogens exhibiting a low or no SCE-inducing activity and vice versa, from special observations on chromosomal breakage syndromes, and from studies on the action of known co- and anti-clastogens on SCE-induction by chemical mutagens. As a result, it has been suggested that the SCE-technique should be considered as a valuable additional method for cytogenetic mutagenicity testing, which, however, is not adequate to replace the classical methods of analysis of structural chromosome damage.",,['10.1007/BF00294917 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,283

CTL were generated against H-2b splenocytes, and STL were obtained following a 5-day lymphocyte culture without stimulator cells. A progressive and severe impairment of the generation of both CLT and STL was found from 2 weeks onward after infection, being almost totally abolished 3-4 weeks after virus challenge. Suppressor cells (SC) capable of inhibiting CTL generation was detected in FLV-P bearing mice. Suppressor activity was unaffected by anti-Thy 1.2 serum and complement but was removed following iron-magnet depletion or passage through nylon-wool column. Moreover complete recovery of the competence of CTL generation was attained when FLV-P infected splenocytes were passed through nylon-wool column.

Blasts were studied in co-culture for their effects on the proliferative responses of normal allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin. Mitomycin C-treated null cell ALL blasts from two of five children suppressed the proliferative responses of normal responder cells by 80% and 58% whereas those from two other children enhanced the responses by 118% and 31%. T-cell leukemic blasts from one patient with T-cell ALL exhibited helper cell activity (26%) and T-leukemic blasts from the other demonstrated suppressor cell activity (53%). The helper cell activity of leukemic blasts was associated with stimulating capacity of null blasts in one-way mixed lymphocyte reactions. In six of seven cases, incubation of blast cells with concanavalin A (20 microgram/ml) for 48 hours prior to co-culture with responder cells did not result in the generation of significant suppressor cell activity. Our study suggests that leukemic blasts from certain patients with 'null' and T-cell ALL may possess spontaneous helper or suppressor cell immunoregulatory activity. This functional heterogeneity of leukemic blasts may help in subclassifying the ALL.","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17404/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-19267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19820101)49:1<43::aid-cncr2820490111>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The characteristics of these two effector cell types have also been investigated. It was demonstrated that fresh NK cells lose their NK lytic activity when cultured alone. Cell lines not susceptible to lysis by fresh NK cells are lysed by MLC-induced NK cells.

Bone marrow aspirations were near-dry tap and marrow biopsy revealed primary myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). Their course was short with a blood picture similar to that of leukaemia. They expired 2 months and 21/2 months after diagnosis, respectively. The cases were thought to represent an acute childhood variant of MMM. Cytogenetic study of circulating white cells by 24 h culture without phytophaemagglutinin stimulation revealed aneuploidy in both cases, the first case showing marked aneuploidy with a predominant karyotype of 50,XX,+8,+19,+19,+21 and the second case a mosaic of 47,XX,+G/48,XX+G,+G. The karyotype of phytohaemagglutinin stimulated lymphocytes was 47,XX,+G in both cases.

The sugars N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, galactose, glucose, fucose, and one unknown sugar (possibly xylose) have been identified in purified preparations of HMGs 14 and 17. Furthermore, the fucose-specific lectin Ulex europeus agglutinin I bound both to the isolated HMGs and to monomer nucleosomes containing HMGs released from ""active chromatin"" by micrococcal nuclease digestion. Selective alkaline borohydride reductive cleavages of the HMGs suggested that the oligosaccharide prosthetic groups are primarily bound to these proteins by N-glycosidic linkages. The unexpected finding that the HMGs contain covalently bound complex carbohydrate moieties allows for a potentially great amount of variability and specificity in these proteins that may have important biological implications.",['1-R01-GM26702/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],['10.1073/pnas.78.11.6704 [doi]'],PMC349118,,,,,,,,,

Compared to rapidly growing cells, levels of HMG1 and HMG2 were decreased in mouse neuroblastoma cells that had been induced to differentiate by serum deprivation. This comparison revealed a reciprocal relationship between these HMG proteins and H10, a histone known to be in higher concentrations in nondividing cells. When cell growth was inhibited by means of density inhibition, however, HMG1 and -2 levels were not affected in either HeLa or mouse neuroblastoma cells, even though H10 did not accumulate. This observation establishes that HMG1 and -2 contents are not correlated with mitotic rate per se. Treatment of mouse neuroblastoma by sodium butyrate, which stops cell division without commitment to differentiation, had no effect on the level of HMG1 and -2. However, the level was decreased by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and dimethyl sulfoxide treatments, which, like serum deprivation, induced irreversible morphological differentiation in the neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, induction of differentiation (hemoglobin synthesis) in Friend erythroleukemic cells by dimethyl sulfoxide showed a decrease in the contents of HMG1 and -2. These observations suggest that preferential loss of HMG1 and -2 in mouse neuroblastoma and Friend erythroleukemia cells may be related to commitment of these cells to differentiation.","['GM 20338/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T01 GM 0031/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1073/pnas.78.10.5988 [doi]'],PMC348962,,,,,,,,,

The malignant tumor is, according to this theory, considered to be a special type of excess scar tissue of fetal or near fetal age, the fetal blood supply of which prevents the activation of those specialized killer cells which were believed to eliminate excess scar tissue. Therefore, it is assumed that if the specialized killer cells of a malignant tumor patient are activated artificially, they would cause malignant tumor regression in vivo. This method of treatment is called autobiotherapy because it utilizes biological products from the patient to treat his own malignant tumor. Preliminary evidence is presented in support of autobiotherapy of malignant tumor disease.The peripheral leucocytes of 27 malignant tumor patients were activated separately by incubation in a serum-free medium containing the respective tumor cells or material. The effect of the injection of the activated leucocytes or their products, termed tumor leucocyte cultures (TLC), was studied in five patients with Kaposi sarcoma, five with carcinoma of the breast, four with carcinoma of the cervix, three with soft tissue sarcoma, two with carcinoma of the lung, two with carcinoma of the maxillary antrium, and a miscellaneous group of six patients. In 52 percent of cases, there was significant tumor regression. Tumor regression was most marked in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, carcinoma of the cervix, pharynx, and pancreas, one patient with a slow growing fibrosarcoma, one patient with a metastatic breast carcinoma, and also in one patient with myelogenous leukemia. However, not all the types of tumor studied responded satisfactorily to autobiotherapy. The reasons for the differences in response to autobiotherapy remain to be determined. Even so, the positive results obtained indicate that autobiotherapy is worthy of further research as an alternative in controlling malignant tumor disease.",,,PMC2552711,,,,,,,,,

In this study we reacted alpha chains purified from tumor cells with proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes and compared the products by using differential labeling procedures. A variety of proteolytic enzymes cleave the chain into two similar-sized fragments, alpha 1 and alpha 2. The alpha 1 fragment behaves as if it were slightly larger on electrophoresis through polyacrylamide gels and is rich in carbohydrate as determined by incorporation of [14C]glucosamine. Less incorporation is observed into alpha 2 but it, like alpha 1, binds to concanavalin A. Labeling of the surface proteins on intact cells by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination leads to preferential, perhaps exclusive, labeling of the alpha 2 fragment. The relative proportion of incorporated 3H-labeled amino acids and radioactive Bolton--Hunter reagent suggests that the polypeptide portions of alpha 1 and alpha 2 are similar in size. From these and other data we propose that the alpha chain may be U-shaped.

When 5MeN was present throughout the expression and selection of 6-thioguanine resistant mutants, the MNU-induced mutation frequency was reduced in duplicate experiments from 15.6 and 12.0 to 7.0 mutants per 10(4) survivors per mM MNU. At the same level of survival, cells treated with 5MeN had approximately 12 times fewer mutants than untreated cells. The rate of removal of the promutagenic lesion O6-methylguanine from DNA was enhanced approximately 2-fold, whereas that of 7-methylguanine was unaffected by the incubation of MNU treated cells with 5MeN. Since 5MeN is a potent inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, this may imply that in normal cells it is specific ADP-ribosylation of the repair enzyme causing the removal of O6-methylguanine, rather than a more general modification of chromatin structure, that limits the rate of repair of the promutagenic lesion. 5MeN also stimulated unscheduled DNA synthesis in MNU treated cells, implying that an earlier observation that 5MeN prevented rejoining of strand breaks induced by repair of alkyl lesions, probably resulted from inhibition of ligation and not the failure of DNA polymerase to replace bases removed by repair nucleases.",,['10.1093/carcin/2.10.1013 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The proliferative responses of MLCs were less than normal when the stimulating cells originated from B cells of patients with CLL. The degree of stimulation provided by the B cells from the patients with CLL inversely correlated with the peripheral white cell count. Lymphocytes from patients providing a poor stimulatory signal in the MLC tended to have less ""Ia-like"" antigen than lymphocytes giving a moderate level of stimulation. B lymphocytes from patients with CLL which stimulated poorly in the MLC also failed to generate specific cytotoxic cells even when provided with a normal proliferative trigger. These data suggest that B lymphocytes from cases of CLL with markedly elevated leucocyte counts may have a diminished concentration of both ""Ia-like"" and serum defined antigens.",,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1981.tb07242.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Restriction enzyme mapping demonstrated tht the deleted segments frequently abutted a long terminal repeat (LTR) sequence, whereas the inverted segments were usually flanked by LTR sequences, suggesting that many of the variants arose as a consequence of M-MuLV DNA molecules integrating within their own DNA. Nucleotide sequencing also suggested that most of the variant inserts were generated by autointegration. One of the recombinant M-MuLV DNA inserts contained a large inverted repeat of a unique M-MuLV sequence abutting an LTR. This molecule was shown by nucleotide sequencing to have arisen by an M-MuLV DNA Molecule integrating within a second M-MuLV DNA molecule before cloning. The autointegrated M-MuLV DNA had generally lost two base pairs from the LTR sequence at each junction with target site DNA, whereas a four-base-pair direct repeat of target site DNA flanked the integrated viral DNA. Nucleotide sequencing of preintegration target site DNA showed that this four-base-pair direct repeat was present only once before integration and was thus reiterated by the integration event. The results obtained from the autointegrated clones were supported by nucleotide sequencing of the host-virus junction of two cloned M-MuLV integrated proviruses obtained from infected rat cells. Detailed analysis of the different unique target site sequences revealed no obvious common features.","['CA-14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['10.1128/JVI.40.1.164-172.1981 [doi]'],PMC256606,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M10386', 'GENBANK/M18077']",

Consistent with these results was the finding that synchronized L1210 cells exposed to 6-TG were the most susceptible to the cytotoxic action of the 6-thiopurine during G1/S and S phase. However, G2 phase cells were also sensitive to 6-TG indicating that at least two metabolic lesions are responsible for the production of cytotoxicity.

It was suggested that the enhanced antitumor transplantation resistance caused by BU was due to enhanced T-cell immune responses to tumor cells.

Studies on permeabilized leukaemic and normal lymph-node cells, and assays on partially purified phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase enzymes, revealed that the enhanced glycolysis of the tumour cells was due to the predominance of glycolytic isoenzymes relatively insensitive to the natural metabolic inhibitors. The glycolytic enzyme hexokinase showed decreased activity in leukaemic conditions, owing to a subcellular translocation of its bulk from the cytosol to the mitochondrial fraction.

They also were reactive in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity but had no reactivity in natural killer cell assays. These cells were studied in this report with several heteroantisera and monoclonal antibodies. Results indicate that these T-CLL cells express a T cell antigenic pattern (OKT-3+) and the majority are Ia positive. They also react with the OKT-8 reagent (a reagent detecting the subset of T cells that contains the cytotoxic/suppressor cells), whereas they are negative with OKT-4 (which reacts with the subset of T cells that contains helper cells) and OKT-6 (thymocyte) antibodies. Heteroantisera also support the results obtained with monoclonal reagents. Despite some recent evidence showing that a high percentage of T gamma cells may belong to the monocyte-myeloid lineage, these T-CLL cells were negative with OKM-1, a monoclonal antibody reported to detect a monomyeloid antigen. These results suggest that a distinct subpopulation of suppressor T cells can be identified by membrane-marker phenotyping.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases G-6-PD showed normal kinetics, electrophoretic mobility and thermostability suggesting that a decreased enzyme synthesis was possible for the deficient enzyme activity. In each case studied, at least one of the PK properties was modified, either in affinity for phosphoenol pyruvate, thermal stability or electrophoretic mobility, indicating a primary or secondary molecular abnormality. In some patients PFK had significantly increased affinity for citrate inhibitor; however, neither the quantity nor quality of the M subunits seemed to be altered. Thus it appears that chemotherapy can induce qualitative as well as quantitative red cell enzyme abnormalities by different mechanisms. These are similar to those observed in spontaneous leukaemia and preleukaemic states. Such a similarity poses the question of whether or not the red cell enzyme abnormalities induced by chemotherapy could be considered as the first sign of secondary leukaemia due to treatment by oncostatic drugs.",,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1981.tb01419.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In order to identify an eventual suppressor mechanism in animals with progressively growing tumors, experiments were initiated in C57BL/6 mice bearing either a murine sarcoma virus (MSV) tumor or Moloney virus-induced lymphoma (MBL2). Progressive tumor growth was induced (a) in viremic animals first infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus (M.Mu LV), then inoculated as adult with MSV; (b) in nonviremic animals injected with MBL2 lymphoma cells. In the absence of tumor cells, viremia induces specific tolerance for which there is no evidence for suppressor cells. In tumor-bearing mice, specific suppressor T cells are detected which are able to inhibit the generation of anti-FMR cytolytic T lymphocytes in vitro and enhance the tumor growth in vivo. In addition to the specific suppressor T cells, a nonspecific suppressive activity mediated by metastatic T lymphoma cells is demonstrated in the spleens of lymphoma-bearing animals.

The best known transferrins are the serotransferrins from animal sera, lactoferrins from milk, and conalbumin from egg-white. The iron-deficient transferrins will inhibit the growth of certain bacteria and fungi by making iron unavailable for bacterial metabolism. Such activity is abolished if the transferrin is saturated with iron. Many organisms can produce small molecular-weight iron-binding compounds called siderophores that can successfully utilize the iron sequestered by the transferrins. Such organisms are very virulent. Overwhelming evidence is now available to indicate that the transferrins play an important role in mammalian host-defense mechanisms. Thus, iron injections into animals infected with virulent bacteria result in increased death rates, and parenteral iron administration to human infants predisposes them to fatal septicemia. On the other hand, in cases of systemic infection, the organism responds by lowering its total serum iron, so as to make the serotransferrin present less saturated with iron. This phenomenon is called nutritional immunity. The iron apparently moves into the storage tissues from the circulation, and furthermore, it is withheld from circulation by the reticuloendothelial system. Laboratory results in such cases indicate low total serum iron levels and high unsaturated iron-binding activity values, thus increasing the bacteriostatic effects of the serotransferrins. Increased lactoferrin levels are observed in the milks of mastitic cattle.",,['10.1007/978-1-4615-9200-6_8 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,50

The lymph nodes of such mice are not invaded with tumor cells and contain normal numbers of T and B cells. Nevertheless, at the peak of tumor burden in the spleen and blood (approximately 8 to 12 wk after injection with tumor cells), the lymph node cells from the tumor-bearing mice display markedly decreased responsiveness both to allogeneic cells and to antigens. In addition, small numbers of lymph node cells from the tumor-bearing mice suppress primary antibody responses of normal lymph node cells. This nonspecific suppression of antibody responses is mediated by a G-10 Sephadex adherent, non-T, non-B cell present in the nodes of the tumor-bearing mice.

On the basis of their metabolic activation, biochemical effects on pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, and biological toxicity, we hve established that incubation of S-49 cells with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine produces only DNA-directed toxicity (thymidylate synthetase inhibition), incubation with 5-fluorouracil (FUra) + thymidine only RNA-directed toxicity, and incubation with FUra alone produces both DNA- and RNA-directed toxicity. The DNA component of 5-fluoropyrimidine toxicity causes immediate growth inhibition of asynchronous S-49 cell cultures, which is self-limited within 12 hr both by the accumulation of intracellular deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate competing for thymidylate synthetase binding and by the excretion of deoxyuridine into the cell medium which competes with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine uptake. The RNA-directed component causes growth inhibition and cell kill after a delay of 1 doubling time in asynchronous cultures. Studies with cells synchronized by centrifugal elutriation indicate that the RNA-directed FUra effects are expressed only in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and cause rapid cell lysis, while the DNA-directed component is specific to the S phase. Experiments using continuous exposure of synchronized cells to FUra alone demonstrate that the activities of the RNA- and DNA-directed components interact with each other. Specifically, DNA-directed toxicity arrests cells in S phase, preventing them from progressing into G1 where RNA-directed toxicity is expressed, which may account for the augmentation of FUra toxicity by thymidine as reported in other systems.",['GM16496/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

A time course of uptake of total radioactivity revealed a greater cell/medium distribution ratio of activity in cells treated with chloroethyl-labeled chlorozotocin compared to cells treated with the glucose-labeled compound. Thin-layer chromatographic analysis showed that uptake of intact chlorozotocin was identical in cells treated with either glucose- or chloroethyl-labeled drug and that the cell/medium distribution ratio never exceeded unity. Accumulation of 14C-chlorozotocin was not inhibited by an excess of unlabeled chlorozotocin, the structural analogs glucose and glucosamine, or several metabolic inhibitors or by sodium ion depletion. These observations, together with the relatively low temperature quotient for the uptake process, suggested that chlorozotocin uptake occurs by passive diffusion. In cells treated with glucose-labeled chlorozotocin, a bicyclic urethan derivative and polar metabolites soluble in trichloroacetic acid were formed. In cells exposed to chloroethyl-labeled drug, nonpolar as well as polar metabolites were noted. Formation of metabolites from the glucose moiety was impeded by the presence of an excess of unlabeled chlorozotocin, the structural analogs glucose and glucosamine, the glucose transport inhibitors phlorizin and phloretin, the metabolic inhibitor m-chlorophenyl carbonyl cyanide hydrazone and by sodium depletion. Appearance of metabolites arising from the chloroethyl moiety was also blocked by the presence of m-chlorophenyl carbonyl cyanide hydrazone and by sodium ion depletion. These results suggested that metabolism of chlorozotocin in L51789Y lymphoblasts appears to be enzyme mediated.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation was detected by increases in viable cell counts and [3H]dT incorporation in mixed lymphocyte-leukaemia-cell cultures. CMC detected on cultured cell-line targets (CCL) including K562 was generally much stronger than on fresh leukaemia cells, and correlated with stimulation of [3H]dT uptake in the responding lymphocytes. Leukaemias which were resistant as targets to CMC were able competitively to inhibit CMC on K562, though not as efficiently as blocking by K562 itself. With one leukaemia, blocking of CMC increased as the level of CMC on K562 was amplified by greater numbers of stimulating cells in the sensitization phase. This suggests that in certain cases blocking of effector cells by acute-leukaemia cells may depend upon the state of activation of the effector cells. Lymphocytes from a leukaemia patient in remission, treated with allogeneic leukaemia-cell immunotherapy and stimulated in vitro with immunizing leukaemia cells, developed strong anti-leukaemic CMC. A non-immunized patient's lymphocytes did not respond in this way, despite comparable levels of CMC on K562 in both patients. Dual stimulation of unprimed normal lymphocytes and remission lymphocytes with allogeneic or autologous leukaemias and various cell lines, amplified anti-leukaemic CMC, but did not markedly alter CMC or CCL. These data do not formally exclude the mediation of in vitro-stimulated anti-leukaemic CMC by NK-like cells, but suggest that such effector cells differ qualitatively from NK-like cells detected in the absence of anti-leukaemic CMC.",,['10.1038/bjc.1981.24 [doi]'],PMC2010526,,,,,,,,,
