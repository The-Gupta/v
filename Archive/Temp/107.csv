Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a unique disease entity caused by the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type 1 (HTLV-I), the only retrovirus known to cause cancer in humans. Viral lymphomas behave aggressively and disproportionally affect immunocompromised individuals and those living in underdeveloped regions. These diseases are often difficult to treat with conventional approaches. Despite recent advancements using cytotoxic, lymphoma-specific, and adoptive therapies, the long-term outcome of patients with gamma-herpesvirus lymphomas occurring in severely immunocompromised patients and ATLL continues to be poor. Lytic-inducing therapies targeting NF-kappaB, and viral and tumor cell epigenetic mechanisms afford the advantage of exploiting the intrinsic presence of oncogenic viruses to eradicate infected tumor cells. In this review, viral-related lymphomas and newly emerging clinical approaches targeting viral latency are discussed.","['Ramos, Juan Carlos', 'Lossos, Izidore S']","['Ramos JC', 'Lossos IS']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology-Hematology, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, FL, 33136, USA. jramos2@med.miami.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA112217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1-P01-CA-128115-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2U01CA121947-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA122105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA128115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA122105/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA109335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA121947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-112217-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'HIV', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/drug therapy', 'Virus Latency']",PMC4041592,['NIHMS473738'],2011/07/28 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11912-011-0186-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2011 Oct;13(5):416-26. doi: 10.1007/s11912-011-0186-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, cell viabilities were evaluated for a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (SW480 cells) and a human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells). Apoptotic mechanisms induced by the protein extracts of PO and VV were evaluated for SW480 cells. The viabilities of THP-1 and SW480 cells decreased in a concentration-dependent manner after 24 h of treatment with the protein extracts of CL, PO or VV. Apoptosis analysis revealed that the percentage of SW480 cells in the SubG(1) phase (a marker of apoptosis) was increased upon PO and VV protein-extract treatments, indicating that oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation existed concomitantly with cellular death. The PO and VV protein extracts induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, glutathione (GSH) depletion and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) loss in SW480 cells. Pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine, GSH or cyclosporine A partially prevented the apoptosis induced by PO protein extracts, but not that induced by VV extracts, in SW480 cells. The protein extracts of CL, PO and VV exhibited therapeutic efficacy against human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and human monocytic leukemia cells. The PO protein extracts induced apoptosis in SW480 cells partially through ROS production, GSH depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, the protein extracts of these mushrooms could be considered an important source of new anti-cancer drugs.","['Wu, Jin-Yi', 'Chen, Chi-Hung', 'Chang, Wen-Huei', 'Chung, King-Thom', 'Liu, Yi-Wen', 'Lu, Fung-Jou', 'Chen, Ching-Hsein']","['Wu JY', 'Chen CH', 'Chang WH', 'Chung KT', 'Liu YW', 'Lu FJ', 'Chen CH']","['Graduate Institute of Biomedical and Biopharmaceutical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, National Chiayi University, A25-303 Room, Life Sciences Hall, 300 Syuefu Road, Chiayi 60004, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC3139501,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/07/28 06:01,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2009/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1093/ecam/neq057 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2011;2011:982368. doi: 10.1093/ecam/neq057.

It represents one of the most common genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, little is known about its clinical relevance in the treatment outcome for this leukemia. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clarify the biologic and prognostic impact of K-RAS mutations in relation to the dose of cytarabine (ara-C) used in postinduction consolidation chemotherapy in adult AML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised of 71 de novo AML patients with male/ female ratio 1.4:1; their ages ranged from 21-59 years with a median of 37 years. They were subjected to full clinical evaluation, routine laboratory investigations, cytogenetic studies by G-banding (Giemsa staining), and K-RAS mutation detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The patients were randomized into two groups according to the ara-C dose used in consolidation treatment, the high the dose ara-C (HDAC) group receiving 400 mg ara-C and-low-dose ara-C (LDAC) group receiving 100 mg ara-C; they were followed over a period of five years. RESULTS: Mutations in the K-RAS gene (mutRAS) were detected in 23 patients (32%) with the remaining 48 patients (68%) having wild-type RAS (wtRAS). The percent of blast cells was significantly lower in mutRAS compared to wtRAS patients (P </= 0.001) while M4 subtype of AML and Inv(16) frequencies were significantly higher in mutRAS compared to wtRAS patients (P = 0.015) and (P = 0.003), respectively. The patients were followed up for a median of 43 months (range 11-57 months). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between mutRAS and wtRAS (P = 0.326). Within the mutRAS patients treated with HDAC, cumulative OS was significantly higher than those treated with LDAC (P = 0.001). This was not the case in the wtRAS group (P = 0.285). There was no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between mutRAS and wtRAS groups (P = 0.923). mutRAS patients treated with HDAC had a statistically higher cumulative DFS than mutRAS patients treated with LDAC (P = 0.001). Patients with wtRAS also benefited from HDAC, but to a lesser extent. Among patients with wtRAS, those treated with HDAC showed higher cumulative and median DFS than patients treated with LDAC (P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that adult AML patients carrying mutations in the K-RAS gene benefit from higher ara-C doses more than wtRAS patients, so pretreatment mutation detection could be an important predictor for treatment strategy and survival of adult AML patients. These findings counter the prevailing bias that oncogene mutations lead to more aggressive behavior in human malignancies.","['Ahmad, Ebtesam I', 'Gawish, Heba H', 'Al Azizi, Nashwa Ma', 'Elhefni, Ashraf M']","['Ahmad EI', 'Gawish HH', 'Al Azizi NM', 'Elhefni AM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, Hematology and Oncology Unit of Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Sharkia, Egypt.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC3143910,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/07/28 06:01,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S12602 [doi]', 'ott-4-115 [pii]']",ppublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2011;4:115-21. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S12602.

METHODS: A total of 207 children with ALL were immunophenotyped by 4-color flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Among the 207 patients enrolled in this study, 146 cases were also subjected to karyotype analysis by R-banding technology. RESULTS: Of the 207 children with ALL, 11.6% were identified as T-ALL and 88.4% as B-ALL. Among B-ALL, 6.6% were identified as Pro-B ALL, 67.2% as Com-B ALL, 24.0% as Pre-B ALL, and 2.2% as mature-B ALL. Myeloid antigen (MyAg) expression was documented in 42.5% of the 207 cases analyzed and CD13 was the most commonly expressed MyAg (31.4%). No difference was observed in the expression of MyAg between the groups of patients with T-ALL (41.7%) and B-ALL (42.6%). Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 84 of 146 (57.5%) children. The clinical and biological characteristics of ALL patients between the MyAg(+) and MyAg(-) groups showed that a higher percentage of patients with high WBC count (>50x10(9)/L) and higher CD34 positivity were found to be correlated with MyAg(+) ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the distribution of ALL in Chinese children was similar to the general distribution pattern in other countries. Unlike previous studies, we found that the expression of MyAg in children with T-ALL and B-ALL was comparable, and the percentage of patients with a high WBC count (>50x10(9)/L) and CD34 positivity in MyAg(+) was higher than that in MyAg(-) ALL types, but no differences were found with regard to other clinical features.","['Tong, Haixia', 'Wang, Qiushi', 'Lu, Chunwei', 'Liu, Zhuogang', 'Hu, Yanping']","['Tong H', 'Wang Q', 'Lu C', 'Liu Z', 'Hu Y']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University, Liaoning, China. tonghx2009@163.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China', '*Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology', 'Prognosis']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182198dd7 [doi]', '00043426-201108000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Aug;33(6):437-41. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3182198dd7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dominant-negative Ikaros isoform 6 (Ik6), one of its common subtypes, is overexpressed in leukemia patients and is associated with unfavorable prognosis in childhood B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). This study was to identify specific isoforms, especially Ik6, in Chinese pediatric patients with ALL. The mRNA expression of Ikaros was detected in 88 children with previously untreated ALL by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequencing of the PCR products was performed to identify specific isoforms. The expression of fusion genes was determined by using multiplex RT-PCR. The functional isoforms Ik1, Ik2/3, and dominant negative isoforms Ik4, 6, 8, 9, 10 identified by nested RT-PCR were further confirmed by sequence analysis. In the 88 cases, the Ik6 was found to be overexpressed in 8 of 70 cases of B-lineage ALL and in 1 of 18 cases of T-lineage ALL patients. Among Ik6 B-lineage ALL patients, 3 had expression of BCR/ABL fusion gene and 1 had HOX11 expression.

Two of the 3 patients who only received chemotherapy had GHD. Of the 20 patients, 17 started with GH therapy and 14 completed the 2-year study period. At several time points, bone mineral density (BMD) was measured. Psychological functioning was assessed. At the start of the study, standard deviation scores of height, insulin-like growth factor-1, lumbar spine, and femoral neck BMD were all below -1. After 2 years of GH therapy, total body BMD and lean mass were significantly higher (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively), whereas the percentage fat was significantly lower (P < 0.02). Several psychological measures improved significantly after 2 years. In conclusion, GH therapy during 2 years in young adult survivors of childhood ALL did have a number of benefits, such as improvement of total body bone density and body composition.

Such alloreactive NK cells do not express CD94/NKG2A but express inhibitory KIRs, specific for HLA class I allotypes, present in the donor but lacking in the recipient. This review is focused on the role of the activating KIR2DS1 receptor (specific for the C2-epitope of HLA-C) in haplo-HSCT. Recent data indicate that KIR2DS1 expression in HSC donors may represent a remarkable advantage in alloreactive NK responses. This is a result of a substantial increase in the NK-mediated capability to kill, not only recipients' leukemic cells but also DCs and T cell blasts. The beneficial effects mediated by alloreactive KIR2DS1(+) NK cells may occur after de novo expression of CCR7 upon interaction with allogeneic, KIR ligand-mismatched CCR7(+) cells. As a consequence, they can be redirected to LNs, where they can prevent priming of donor T cells and induction of GvHD. Finally, KIR2DS1 expression may also significantly amplify the size of the alloreactive NK cell subset by switching a subset of ""not alloreactive"" NK cells into potent alloreactive cells.","['Marcenaro, Emanuela', 'Carlomagno, Simona', 'Pesce, Silvia', 'Della Chiesa, Mariella', 'Moretta, Alessandro', 'Sivori, Simona']","['Marcenaro E', 'Carlomagno S', 'Pesce S', 'Della Chiesa M', 'Moretta A', 'Sivori S']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KIR2DS1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, CCR7/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0311137 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0311137 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2011 Oct;90(4):661-7. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0311137.

These proteins sense molecules and stimuli from the cellular/tissue environment and initiate signaling cascades to elicit appropriate cellular responses. Recent literature reports suggest an important function of AhR in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology. However, the molecular mechanisms by which AhR signaling regulates HSC functions are unknown. In previous studies, we and others reported that treatment of mice with the AhR agonist 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) compromises the competitive reconstitution of bone marrow (BM) cells into irradiated host animals. Additional studies indicated a requirement for AhR in hematopoietic cells and not marrow microenvironment cells. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that TCDD-mediated phenotypic and functional changes of HSCs are a result of changes in gene expression that disrupt stem cell numbers and/or their migration. TCDD treatment to mice increased the numbers of phenotypically defined HSCs in BM. These cells showed compromised migration to the BM in vivo and to the chemokine CXCL12 in vitro, as well as increased expression of the leukemia-associated receptors CD184 (CXCR4) and CD44. Gene expression profiles at 6 and 12 h after exposure were consistent with the phenotypic and functional changes observed. The expressions of Scin, Nqo1, Flnb, Mmp8, Ilf9, and Slamf7 were consistently altered. TCDD also disrupted expression of other genes involved in hematological system development and function including Fos, JunB, Egr1, Ptgs2 (Cox2), and Cxcl2. These data support a molecular mechanism for an AhR ligand to disrupt the homeostatic cell signaling of HSCs that may promote altered HSC function.","['Casado, Fanny L', 'Singh, Kameshwar P', 'Gasiewicz, Thomas A']","['Casado FL', 'Singh KP', 'Gasiewicz TA']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['R03 ES016606/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES01247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07026/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES007026/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES016606/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES004862/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES04862/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007026/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/physiology']",PMC3187533,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['mol.111.071381 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.111.071381 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2011 Oct;80(4):673-82. doi: 10.1124/mol.111.071381.

We report here the results of a phase I and pharmacological study of the cytarabine + tanespimycin combination in adults with recurrent or refractory acute leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients received cytarabine 400 mg/m(2)/day continuously for 5 days and tanespimycin infusions at escalating doses on days 3 and 6. Marrow mononuclear cells harvested before therapy, immediately prior to tanespimycin, and 24 hours later were examined by immunoblotting for Hsp70 and multiple Hsp90 clients. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were treated at five dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose was cytarabine 400 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days along with tanespimycin 300 mg/m(2) on days 3 and 6. Treatment-related adverse events included disseminated intravascular coagulation (grades 3 and 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (grade 4), and myocardial infarction associated with prolonged exposure to tanespimycin and its active metabolite 17-aminogeldanamycin. Among 21 evaluable patients, there were two complete and four partial remissions. Elevations of Hsp70, a marker used to assess Hsp90 inhibition in other studies, were observed in more than 80% of samples harvested 24 hours after tanespimycin, but down-regulation of Chk1 and other Hsp90 client proteins was modest. CONCLUSIONS: Because exposure to potentially effective concentrations occurs only for a brief time in vivo, at clinically tolerable doses tanespimycin has little effect on resistance-mediating client proteins in relapsed leukemia and exhibits limited activity in combination with cytarabine.

However, there has been no recent comprehensive overview of these genetic aberrations in one large pediatric acute myeloid leukemia cohort. DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the different genetic aberrations, their associations and their impact on prognosis in a large pediatric acute myeloid leukemia series (n=506). Karyotypes were studied, and hotspot regions of NPM1, CEPBA, MLL, WT1, FLT3, N-RAS, K-RAS, PTPN11 and KIT were screened for mutations of available samples. The mutational status of all type-I and type-II aberrations was available in 330 and 263 cases, respectively. Survival analysis was performed in a subset (n=385) treated on consecutive acute myeloid leukemia Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group and Dutch Childhood Oncology Group treatment protocols. RESULTS: Genetic aberrations were associated with specific clinical characteristics, e.g. significantly higher diagnostic white blood cell counts in MLL-rearranged, WT1-mutated and FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the distribution of these aberrations between children below and above the age of two years. Non-random associations, e.g. KIT mutations with core-binding factor acute myeloid leukemia, and FLT3-ITD with t(15;17)(q22;q21), NPM1- and WT1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia, respectively, were observed. Multivariate analysis revealed a 'favorable karyotype', i.e. t(15;17)(q22;q21), t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22). NPM1 and CEBPA double mutations were independent factors for favorable event-free survival. WT1 mutations combined with FLT3-ITD showed the worst outcome for 5-year overall survival (22+/-14%) and 5-year event-free survival (20+/-13%), although it was not an independent factor in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Integrative analysis of type-I and type-II aberrations provides an insight into the frequencies, non-random associations and prognostic impact of the various aberrations, reflecting the heterogeneity of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. These aberrations are likely to guide the stratification of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia and may direct the development of targeted therapies.","['Balgobind, Brian V', 'Hollink, Iris H I M', 'Arentsen-Peters, Susan T C J M', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Harbott, Jochen', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'von Bergh, Anne R M', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Zemanova, Zuzana', 'Stary, Jan', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['Balgobind BV', 'Hollink IH', 'Arentsen-Peters ST', 'Zimmermann M', 'Harbott J', 'Beverloo HB', 'von Bergh AR', 'Cloos J', 'Kaspers GJ', 'de Haas V', 'Zemanova Z', 'Stary J', 'Cayuela JM', 'Baruchel A', 'Creutzig U', 'Reinhardt D', 'Pieters R', 'Zwaan CM', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC3186309,,2011/07/28 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2010.038976 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2010.038976 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Oct;96(10):1478-87. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2010.038976.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective survey of invasive aspergillosis cases was undertaken between January 2004 and December 2009 in the hematology department of a university hospital. Meetings with clinicians, mycologists and infection control practitioners were organized monthly to confirm suspected aspergillosis cases. Demographic characteristics, clinical and complementary examination results were recorded prospectively. Information on hospitalization was extracted from administrative databases. Invasive aspergillosis diagnosis followed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria, and proven and probable IA cases were retained. A descriptive analysis was conducted with temporal trends of invasive aspergillosis incidence assessed by adjusted Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, 4,073 hospitalized patients (78,360 patient-days) were included in the study. In total, 127 (3.1%) patients presented invasive aspergillosis. The overall incidence was 1.6 per 1,000 patient-days (95% confidence interval: 1.4, 1.9) with a decrease of 16% per year (-1%, -28%). The incidence was 1.9 per 1,000 patient-days (1.5, 2.3) in acute myeloid leukemia patients with a decrease of 20% per year (-6%, -36%). Serum Aspergillus antigen was detected in 89 (71%) patients; 29 (23%) had positive cultures, and 118 (93%), abnormal lung CT scans. One-month mortality was 13%; 3-month mortality was 42%. Mortality tended to decrease between 2004 and 2009. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive aspergillosis incidence and mortality declined between 2004 and 2009.

A germline Janus kinase 2 haplotype designated as the 46/1 haplotype has been reported to be associated with an inherited predisposition to myeloproliferative neoplasms, and also to acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of the 46/1 haplotype on disease characteristics and treatment outcome in acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Janus kinase 2 rs12343867 single nucleotide polymorphism tagging the 46/1 haplotype was genotyped by LightCycler technology applying melting curve analysis with the hybridization probe detection format in 176 patients with acute myeloid leukemia under 60 years diagnosed consecutively and treated with curative intent. RESULTS: The morphological subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with maturation was less frequent among 46/1 carriers than among non-carriers (5.6% versus 17.2%, P = 0.018, cytogenetically normal subgroup: 4.3% versus 20.6%, P = 0.031), while the morphological distribution shifted towards the myelomonocytoid form in 46/1 haplotype carriers (28.1% versus 14.9%, P = 0.044, cytogenetically normal subgroup: 34.0% versus 11.8%, P = 0.035). In cytogenetically normal cases of acute myeloid leukemia, the 46/1 carriers had a considerably lower remission rate (78.7% versus 94.1%, P = 0.064) and more deaths in remission or in aplasia caused by infections (46.8% versus 23.5%, P = 0.038), resulting in the 46/1 carriers having shorter disease-free survival and overall survival compared to the 46/1 non-carriers. In multivariate analysis, the 46/1 haplotype was an independent adverse prognostic factor for disease-free survival (P = 0.024) and overall survival (P = 0.024) in patients with a normal karyotype. Janus kinase 2 46/1 haplotype had no impact on prognosis in the subgroup with abnormal karyotype. CONCLUSIONS: Janus kinase 2 46/1 haplotype influences morphological distribution, increasing the predisposition towards an acute myelomonocytoid form. It may be a novel, independent unfavorable risk factor in acute myeloid leukemia with a normal karyotype.","['Nahajevszky, Sarolta', 'Andrikovics, Hajnalka', 'Batai, Arpad', 'Adam, Emma', 'Bors, Andras', 'Csomor, Judit', 'Gopcsa, Laszlo', 'Koszarska, Magdalena', 'Kozma, Andras', 'Lovas, Nora', 'Lueff, Sandor', 'Matrai, Zoltan', 'Meggyesi, Nora', 'Sinko, Janos', 'Sipos, Andrea', 'Varkonyi, Andrea', 'Fekete, Sandor', 'Tordai, Attila', 'Masszi, Tamas']","['Nahajevszky S', 'Andrikovics H', 'Batai A', 'Adam E', 'Bors A', 'Csomor J', 'Gopcsa L', 'Koszarska M', 'Kozma A', 'Lovas N', 'Lueff S', 'Matrai Z', 'Meggyesi N', 'Sinko J', 'Sipos A', 'Varkonyi A', 'Fekete S', 'Tordai A', 'Masszi T']","['Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, St Istvan and St Laszlo Hospital, Budapest, Hungary. nahajevszky@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/enzymology/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",PMC3208678,,2011/07/28 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.043885 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.043885 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Nov;96(11):1613-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.043885.

The median number of infused NK cells was 2.74 x 10(6)/Kg. T cells were < 10(5)/Kg. No NK cell-related toxicity, including GVHD, was observed. One of the 5 patients with active disease achieved transient CR, whereas 4 of 5 patients had no clinical benefit. Both patients in molecular relapse achieved CR that lasted for 9 and 4 months, respectively. Three of 6 patients in CR are disease free after 34, 32, and 18 months. After infusion, donor NK cells were found in the peripheral blood of all evaluable patients (peak value on day 10). They were also detected in BM in some cases. Donor-versus-recipient alloreactive NK cells were shown in vivo by the detection of donor-derived NK clones that killed recipient's targets. Adoptively transferred NK cells were alloreactive against recipient's cells, including leukemia. In conclusion, infusion of purified NK cells is feasible in elderly patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia.

Immunogenetic support from a series of 807 cases.,3088-95,10.1182/blood-2011-03-343434 [doi],"We examined 807 productive IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ gene rearrangements from mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cases, by far the largest series to date. The IGHV gene repertoire was remarkably biased, with IGHV3-21, IGHV4-34, IGHV1-8, and IGHV3-23 accounting for 46.3% of the cohort. Eighty-four of 807 (10.4%) cases, mainly using the IGHV3-21 and IGHV4-34 genes, were found to bear stereotyped heavy complementarity-determining region 3 (VH CDR3) sequences and were placed in 38 clusters. Notably, the MCL stereotypes were distinct from those reported for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Based on somatic hypermutation (SHM) status, 238/807 sequences (29.5%) carried IGHV genes with 100% germ line identity; the remainder (569/807; 70.5%) exhibited different SHM impact, ranging from minimal (in most cases) to pronounced. Shared replacement mutations across the IGHV gene were identified for certain subgroups, especially those using IGHV3-21, IGHV1-8, and IGHV3-23. Comparison with other entities, in particular CLL, revealed that several of these mutations were ""MCL-biased."" In conclusion, MCL is characterized by a highly restricted immunoglobulin gene repertoire with stereotyped VH CDR3s and very precise SHM targeting, strongly implying a role for antigen-driven selection of the clonogenic progenitors. Hence, an antigen-driven origin of MCL could be envisaged, at least for subsets of cases.","['Hadzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Darzentas, Nikos', 'Murray, Fiona', 'Delfau-Larue, Marie-Helene', 'Pedersen, Lone Bredo', 'Lopez, Alba Navarro', 'Dagklis, Antonis', 'Rombout, Paul', 'Beldjord, Kheira', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Dreyling, Martin H', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Tsaftaris, Athanasios', 'Mavragani-Tsipidou, Penelope', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Groenen, Patricia', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Papadaki, Theodora', 'Campo, Elias', 'Geisler, Christian', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Hadzidimitriou A', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Darzentas N', 'Murray F', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Pedersen LB', 'Lopez AN', 'Dagklis A', 'Rombout P', 'Beldjord K', 'Kolstad A', 'Dreyling MH', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Tsaftaris A', 'Mavragani-Tsipidou P', 'Rosenwald A', 'Ponzoni M', 'Groenen P', 'Ghia P', 'Sander B', 'Papadaki T', 'Campo E', 'Geisler C', 'Rosenquist R', 'Davi F', 'Pott C', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Agrobiotechnology, Center for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epitopes/*genetics/physiology', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', '*Immunogenetics/methods', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*etiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40665-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-03-343434 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 15;118(11):3088-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-03-343434.

However, it was recently demonstrated that expression of both lymphoid- and myeloid-related genes could be detected in myeloid progenitors. Furthermore, these progenitors were able to give rise to T and B lymphocytes, in addition to myeloid cells. Yet, it was not known whether these progenitors were multipotent at the clonogenic level or there existed heterogeneity within these progenitors with different lineage potential. Here we report that previously defined CMPs possess T-lineage potential, and that this is exclusively found in the Flt3(+)CD150(-) subset of CMPs at the clonal level. In contrast, we did not detect B-lineage potential in CMP subsets. Therefore, these Flt3(+)CD150(-) myeloid progenitors were T/myeloid potent. Yet, Flt3(+)CD150(-) myeloid progenitors are not likely to efficiently traffic to the thymus and contribute to thymopoiesis under normal conditions because of the lack of CCR7 and CCR9 expression. Interestingly, both Flt3(+)CD150(-) and Flt3(-)CD150(-) myeloid progenitors are susceptible to Notch1-mediated T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Hence, gain-of-function Notch1 mutations occurring in developing myeloid progenitors, in addition to known T-lineage progenitors, could lead to T-ALL oncogenesis.","['Chi, Anthony W S', 'Chavez, Alejandro', 'Xu, Lanwei', 'Weber, Brittany N', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Schaffer, Andras', 'Wertheim, Gerald', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Izon, David', 'Bhandoola, Avinash']","['Chi AW', 'Chavez A', 'Xu L', 'Weber BN', 'Shestova O', 'Schaffer A', 'Wertheim G', 'Pear WS', 'Izon D', 'Bhandoola A']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA009140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1 HL099758/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RC1HL099758/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AJ059621/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 AI047833/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI047833/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '169535-43-7 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptprc protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family Member 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",PMC3172791,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40696-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-309989 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 8;118(10):2723-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-309989.

Although the combination of sorafenib with doxorubicin (DOX) is presently being investigated in a phase III randomized trial, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of their interaction. Because DOX causes cell death through upregulation of the MEK/ERK pathway, and sorafenib has an opposite influence on the same cascade, we hypothesized that co-treatment with these drugs may lead to an antagonistic effect. DOX treatment arrested proliferation and induced autophagic cell death in Hep3B cells, whereas apoptotic changes were not conspicuous. Sorafenib alone affected viability and caused massive mitochondrial degradation. However, when added together with DOX, sorafenib facilitated cell cycle progression, increased survival, and reduced autophagy. To evaluate the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, we examined the expression of ERK1/2, protein kinase B (Akt), and cyclin D1, as well as the members of Bcl-2 family. ERK1/2 activation induced by DOX was suppressed by sorafenib. Similarly, ERK targeting with the selective inhibitor U0126 impaired DOX-induced toxicity. Treatment with sorafenib, either alone or in combination with DOX, resulted in Akt activation. The role of sorafenib-induced degradation of cyclin D1 in the suppression of DOX efficiency is discussed. In conclusion, MEK/ERK counteraction, stimulation of survival via Akt and dysregulation of cyclin D1 could contribute to the escape from DOX-induced autophagy and thus promote cancer cell survival. The use of MEK/ERK inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutics, intended to enhance anticancer efficacy, requires the consideration of possible antagonistic effects.","['Manov, Irena', 'Pollak, Yulia', 'Broneshter, Rinata', 'Iancu, Theodore C']","['Manov I', 'Pollak Y', 'Broneshter R', 'Iancu TC']","['Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. irmanov@tx.technion.ac.il']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Benzenesulfonates/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/agonists/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08271.x [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2011 Sep;278(18):3494-507. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2011.08271.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 The Authors Journal compilation (c) 2011 FEBS.'],,,,,,,,,

Cyclin D1 overexpression is a hallmark of mantle cell lymphoma, whereas cyclins D2 and D3 have not been shown to be closely associated with any particular subtype of lymphoma. In the present study, we found that cyclin D2 was specifically overexpressed in the proliferation centers (PC) of all cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) examined (19/19). To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying this overexpression, we immunohistochemically examined the expression of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, p15, p16, p18, and p27 in the PC of six patients. Five cases showed upregulation of NF-kappaB expression, which is known to directly induce cyclin D2 by binding to the promoter region of CCND2. All six PC examined demonstrated downregulation of p27 expression. In contrast, upregulation of p15 expression was detected in five of six PC examined. This discrepancy suggests that unknown cell cycle regulatory mechanisms involving NF-kappaB-related pathways are also involved, because NF-kappaB upregulates cyclin D2 not only directly, but also indirectly through c-Myc, which is believed to downregulate both p27 and p15. In conclusion, cyclin D2 is overexpressed in the PC of CLL/SLL and this overexpression is due, in part, to the upregulation of NF-kappaB-related pathways.","['Igawa, Takuro', 'Sato, Yasuharu', 'Takata, Katsuyoshi', 'Fushimi, Soichiro', 'Tamura, Maiko', 'Nakamura, Naoya', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Orita, Yorihisa', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Yoshino, Tadashi']","['Igawa T', 'Sato Y', 'Takata K', 'Fushimi S', 'Tamura M', 'Nakamura N', 'Maeda Y', 'Orita Y', 'Tanimoto M', 'Yoshino T']","['Department of Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (CCND2 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cyclin D2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Palatine Tonsil/metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02046.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Nov;102(11):2103-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02046.x.

It has been shown that APL is associated with a reciprocal chromosomal translocation, involving chromosomes 15 and 17, which fuses the gene encoding the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene. The resultant PML-RARalpha fusion protein plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of APL. Although there are many subtypes of AML, all are typically managed using a standard chemotherapy regimen of an anthracycline plus cytarabine arabinoside (CA). Despite high rates of complete remission following standard chemotherapy, most patients relapse and long-term disease-free survival is only 30-40%. The introduction of drugs such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) that promote progenitor differentiation by directly inhibiting the PML-RARalpha fusion protein has changed the treatment paradigm for APL and markedly improved patient survival. The purposes of the present review are to provide the latest results and future directions of clinical research into APL and to illustrate how new therapies, such as ATRA plus anthracycline-based induction and consolidation therapy, risk-adapted therapy, salvage therapy containing arsenic trioxide-based regimens, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, have improved the treatment outcomes for APL patients.","['Kamimura, Tomohiko', 'Miyamoto, Toshihiro', 'Harada, Mine', 'Akashi, Koichi']","['Kamimura T', 'Miyamoto T', 'Harada M', 'Akashi K']","['Department of Hematology, Harasanshin Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan. toshmiya@intmed1.med.kyushu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/*trends', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*trends', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/surgery', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy/*trends', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02045.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Nov;102(11):1929-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02045.x.

On the sixth postpartum day, remission induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside was started. On the seventh postpartum day, massive uterine bleeding of more than 1300 mL suddenly occurred. As administration of cytotoxic agents may induce disseminated intravascular coagulation, we should take care to avoid uterine bleeding after chemotherapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia cases treated soon after delivery.","['Aoki, Aiko', 'Yoneda, Noriko', 'Yoneda, Satoshi', 'Miyazono, Takayoshi', 'Sugiyama, Toshiro', 'Saito, Shigeru']","['Aoki A', 'Yoneda N', 'Yoneda S', 'Miyazono T', 'Sugiyama T', 'Saito S']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,J Obstet Gynaecol Res,The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,9612761,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Postpartum Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1447-0756.2011.01598.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Obstet Gynaecol Res. 2011 Nov;37(11):1759-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1447-0756.2011.01598.x.

We found a gain of overall methylation in AML samples with a further increase at relapse. Regional hypermethylation as assessed by array analysis could be confirmed by both MSP and pyrosequencing. Additionally, large-scale methylation analysis identified interesting candidate genes. Cluster analysis indicated that cytogenetic subgroups seemed to be characterized by additional distinct epigenetic modifications and that basic DNA methylation patterns remain at relapse. Therefore, promoter hypermethylation is a frequent event in AML and is accentuated at relapse. Array-based methylation analysis determined distinct methylation profiles for non-malignant controls and AML samples with specific chromosomal aberrations and can identify target genes for further evaluation.","['Wilop, Stefan', 'Fernandez, Agustin F', 'Jost, Edgar', 'Herman, James G', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Galm, Oliver']","['Wilop S', 'Fernandez AF', 'Jost E', 'Herman JG', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Esteller M', 'Galm O']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaetsklinikum Aachen, RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstrasse 30, Aachen, Germany. swilop@ukaachen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.20 (GNMT protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.20 (Glycine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cluster Analysis', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glycine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Recurrence']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2014/05/10 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08801.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Oct;155(1):65-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08801.x.

Involved in regulation of differentiation and proliferation, IRF-1 acts as a tumor suppressor gene and is inactivated by deletion of its one or more exons (exon skipping) in many hematological malignancies, including acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). DNA samples, extracted from peripheral blood, taken from 50 Kashmiri AML subjects, were analysed using the polymerase chain reaction and compared with examples of age and gender matched healthy controls from the same population. Three different exon regions (2, 3 and 4) of the IRF-1 gene that were previously shown to be prone to deletion were selected for amplification and analysis. Deletion was observed in 31(62%) out of 50 AML patients (p=0.016). Exon 3 was most frequently deleted (58%), followed by exon 2 (28%), while exon 4 was least affected (12%), providing insights into critical roles in leukemogenesis. The number of deleted exons was variable, but single exon deletions were more frequent (30%). Of interest, IRF-1 gene deletions were not observed in 19 (38%) patients. In our study, the frequency of deletions of these three exons was slightly higher than in an Indian population (52%), but lower than in Sweden in Europe (95%). This study also explored the prevalence and clinical profile of IRF-1 deletions in AML patients. Adults had a significantly higher incidence than children (p=0.0168) and IRF-1 deletions were associated with low Hb (p< 0.0001), high TLC (p=0.0033) and a low platelet count (p=0.0076).","['Khan, Tanzeela', 'Ganai, Bashir Ahmad', 'Masood, Akbar', 'Samoon, Jeelani', 'Beigh, Sabha Rasool', 'Qazi, Falak']","['Khan T', 'Ganai BA', 'Masood A', 'Samoon J', 'Beigh SR', 'Qazi F']","['Department Of Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Hazratbal, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genotyping Techniques/methods', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/28 06:00,2012/07/03 06:00,['2011/07/28 06:00'],"['2011/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2011;12(4):1035-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a model of murine leukemia, c-JUN prevents the epigenetic silencing of the cell cycle kinase CDK6. In the absence of c-JUN, CDK6 is down-regulated and the 5'region of the gene is methylated. Down-regulation of CDK6 results in significantly delayed leukemia formation. Here we show that c-JUN is also involved in protecting the promoter region of the tumor suppressor p16(INK4a), which is consistently methylated over time in c-JUN deficient cells. In cells expressing c-JUN, p16(INK4a) promoter methylation is a less frequent event.

To provide an estimate of the effect of BMT and PBSCT on clinical outcomes in patients with hematological malignancies, we conducted a meta-analysis based on time-to-event data from 17 randomized controlled trials. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), from 1972 through July 2010, and conference proceedings through July 2009 and reference lists, without any language restriction, of randomized trials that compared the transplant outcomes after BMT and PBSCT in patients with hematological malignancies were searched for details. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. The outcomes examined were engraftment, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), leukemia-free-survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS). Compared to PBSCT, BMT had lower neutrophil (HR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.80 to 2.42; p < 0.00001) and platelet (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.78 to 4.30; p < 0.00001) engraftment. BMT was associated with a significant decrease in the development of grades II-IV (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.90; p = 0.002) and III-IV (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.84; p = 0.001) acute GVHD as well as overall (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.83; p < 0.0001) and extensive (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.91; p = 0.002) chronic GVHD. BMT was associated with a higher incidence of relapse (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.74; p = 0.0004). Comparable TRM (1.08; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.10; p = 0.81), LFS (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.30; p = 0.73), and OS (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.39; p = 0.65) were demonstrated for both treatments. An inverse linear relationship was observed between the acute GVHD difference (PBSCT minus BMT) and the outcome of OS (p = 0.016). Our meta-analysis suggest that BMT leads to slower hematological recovery, increasing rates of relapse, and a lower risk of GVHD, but no significant difference in LFS and OS. A lower incidence of acute GVHD is associated with a superior OS.","['Chang, Ying-Jun', 'Weng, Cui-Lian', 'Sun, Li-Xia', 'Zhao, Yun-Tao']","['Chang YJ', 'Weng CL', 'Sun LX', 'Zhao YT']","['Department of Hematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China. pk200608@126.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Databases, Factual', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/prevention & control/*surgery', 'Humans', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/27 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1299-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Mar;91(3):427-37. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1299-8.

We performed a search of the PUBMED database using the MESH terms ""neoplasms"" AND ""acidosis, lactic"", limited to the English language, and written between the years 2000 and 2010. A total of 31 cases were retrieved. These cases were identified and reviewed. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and treatment options are discussed. Type B lactic acidosis is most commonly seen in patients with lymphoma or leukemia. Although formal prospective trials are lacking, type B lactic acidosis in patients with cancer seems to be a marker of poor prognosis regardless of the treatment offered and may be invariably fatal. Future research should focus on potential therapy based on the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to type B lactic acidosis in cancer patients.","['Ruiz, Juan P', 'Singh, Ashok K', 'Hart, Peter']","['Ruiz JP', 'Singh AK', 'Hart P']","['Department of Medicine, John H.

The accumulation of genetic alterations is closely associated with the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes toward acute myeloid leukemia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of mutations in the points most frequent for mutations (hotspot mutations) in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and nucleophosmin (NPM1), which are involved in leukemia and other cancers, in a population of Brazilian MDS patients. METHODS: Fifty-one myelodysplastic syndromes patients were included in the study. According to French-American-British classification, the patients were distributed as follows: 31 with refractory anemia, 8 with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, 7 with refractory anemia with excess blasts, 3 with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation and 2 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Bone marrow samples were obtained and screened for the presence of hotspot mutations using analysis based on amplification with the polymerase chain reaction, sequencing, fragment size polymorphisms or restriction enzyme digestion. All patients were screened for mutations at the time of diagnosis, and 5 patients were also screened at the time of disease progression. RESULTS: These results show that hotspot mutations in the PI3K, JAK2, FLT3 and NPM1 genes are not common in MDS patients; nevertheless, JAK2 mutations may be present in myelodysplasia during disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that hotspot mutations in the PI3K, JAK2, FLT3 and NPM1 genes are not common in MDS patients; nevertheless, JAK2 mutations may be present in myelodysplasia during disease progression.","['Machado-Neto, Joao Agostinho', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'Lazarini, Mariana', 'Campos, Paula de Melo', 'Pagnano, Katia Borgia Barbosa', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene', 'Costa, Fernando Ferreira', 'Saad, Sara T Olalla']","['Machado-Neto JA', 'Traina F', 'Lazarini M', 'Campos Pde M', 'Pagnano KB', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Costa FF', 'Saad ST']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, National Institute of Blood, University of Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Clinics (Sao Paulo),"Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)",101244734,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC3109377,,2011/07/27 06:00,2012/06/09 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1807-59322011000500014 [pii]', '10.1590/s1807-59322011000500014 [doi]']",ppublish,Clinics (Sao Paulo). 2011;66(5):793-9. doi: 10.1590/s1807-59322011000500014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biodistribution, in vivo stability and radiotoxicity.",214-20,10.3413/nukmed-0385-11-02 [doi],"UNLABELLED: The aim of this study is to verify the in vivo stability, to determine the biodistribution and to estimate the unspecific radiotoxicity of an (211)At-labelled CD33-antibody ((211)At-antiCD33) in mice with a view to therapeutic application in treating leukaemia. ANIMALS, METHODS: (211)At was produced via the (209)Bi(a,2n)(211)At reaction and was linked via 3-(211)At-succinimidyl-benzoate to the antiCD33-antibody. The biodistribution and the in vivo stability in serum were determined after i.v.-injection in NMRI nu/nu-mice. For toxicity experiments, mice received either three times 315-650 kBq (211)At-antiCD33 or unlabelled antibody and NaCl-solution respectively. RESULTS: (211)At-antiCD33 showed a characteristic biodistribution complying with the unspecific antibody retention in the reticular endothelial system. The largest proportion of radioactivity remained in blood and blood-rich tissues with a minor accumulation in the thyroid and stomach. After 21 h, >85% of activity in serum still represented intact antibody. Mice showed no difference in unspecific toxicity of (211)At-labelled antibodies over six months compared to those treated with unlabelled antibody and NaCl-solution respectively, with regard to histopathologic lesions, survival time, behaviour and haemograms. CONCLUSION: The radiolabelling method yielded adequate in vivo stability of (211)At-antiCD33. Biodistribution with rapid elimination of free (211)At via kidneys and urine complies with requirements for targeted therapy. Activity doses potentially required for treatment do not elicit radiotoxicity to normal organs in mice. Further development is required to enhance the apparent specific activity and to verify the efficacy in an adequate animal model before phase I clinical studies in leukaemia can be envisaged.","['Walte, Almut', 'Sriyapureddy, S', 'Krull, D', 'Petrich, T', 'Meyer, G-J', 'Knapp, W H']","['Walte A', 'Sriyapureddy S', 'Krull D', 'Petrich T', 'Meyer GJ', 'Knapp WH']","['Klinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany. almut.walte@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Nuklearmedizin,Nuklearmedizin.

JAK2 mutations, such as the common V617F substitution and the less common exon 12 mutations, are frequently detected in such tumor cells and have been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria published by the World Health Organization since 2008. However, the mechanism by which these mutations contribute to MPN development is poorly understood. We examined gene expression profiles of MPN patients focusing on genes in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway using low-density real-time PCR arrays. We identified the following 2 upregulated genes in MPN patients: a known target of the JAK-STAT axis, SOCS3, and a potentially novel target, SPI1, encoding PU.1. Induction of PU.1 expression by JAK2 V617F in JAK2-wildtype K562 cells and its downregulation by JAK2 siRNA transfection in JAK2 V617F-positive HEL cells supported this possibility. We also found that the ABL1 kinase inhibitor imatinib was very effective in suppressing PU.1 expression in BCR-ABL1-positive K562 cells but not in HEL cells. This suggests that PU.1 expression is regulated by both JAK2 and ABL1. The contribution of the two kinases in driving PU.1 expression was dominant for JAK2 and ABL1 in HEL and K562 cells, respectively. Therefore, PU.1 may be a common transcription factor upregulated in MPN. PU.1 is a transcription factor required for myeloid differentiation and is implicated in erythroid leukemia. Therefore, expression of PU.1 downstream of activated JAK2 may explain why JAK2 mutations are frequently observed in MPN patients.","['Irino, Tamotsu', 'Uemura, Munehiro', 'Yamane, Humitsugu', 'Umemura, Shigeto', 'Utsumi, Takahiko', 'Kakazu, Naoki', 'Shirakawa, Taku', 'Ito, Mitsuhiro', 'Suzuki, Takayo', 'Kinoshita, Kazuo']","['Irino T', 'Uemura M', 'Yamane H', 'Umemura S', 'Utsumi T', 'Kakazu N', 'Shirakawa T', 'Ito M', 'Suzuki T', 'Kinoshita K']","['Shiga Medical Center for Adults, Moriyama, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Neoplasms/*blood/enzymology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/enzymology/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation/*genetics']",PMC3138766,,2011/07/27 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0022148 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-03401 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e22148. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0022148.

Particularly salient is the demonstration that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the rat (rESCs) can contribute to germline transmission, permitting generation of gene-modified rats as is now done using mouse ESCs (mESCs) or mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs; miPSCs). However, determinations of whether rat iPSCs (riPSCs) can contribute to germ cells are not published. Here we report the germline competency of riPSCs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We generated riPSCs by transducing three mouse reprogramming factors (Oct3/4, Klf4, and Sox2) into rat somatic cells, followed by culture in the presence of exogenous rat leukemia inhibitory factor (rLIF) and small molecules that specifically inhibit GSK3, MEK, and FGF receptor tyrosine kinases. We found that, like rESCs, our riPSCs can contribute to germline transmission. Furthermore we found, by immunostaining of testis from mouse-rat interspecific chimeras with antibody against mouse vasa homolog, that riPSCs can contribute to embryonic development with chimera formation in mice (rat-mouse interspecific chimeras) and to interspecific germlines. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data clearly demonstrate that using only three reprogramming factors (Oct3/4, Klf4, and Sox2) rat somatic cells can be reprogrammed into a ground state. Our generated riPSCs exhibited germline transmission in either rat-rat intraspecific or mouse-rat interspecific chimeras.","['Hamanaka, Sanae', 'Yamaguchi, Tomoyuki', 'Kobayashi, Toshihiro', 'Kato-Itoh, Megumi', 'Yamazaki, Satoshi', 'Sato, Hideyuki', 'Umino, Ayumi', 'Wakiyama, Yukiko', 'Arai, Mami', 'Sanbo, Makoto', 'Hirabayashi, Masumi', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu']","['Hamanaka S', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Kobayashi T', 'Kato-Itoh M', 'Yamazaki S', 'Sato H', 'Umino A', 'Wakiyama Y', 'Arai M', 'Sanbo M', 'Hirabayashi M', 'Nakauchi H']","['Japan Science Technology Agency, Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology, Nakauchi Stem Cell and Organ Regeneration Project, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Chimera/metabolism', 'Chimerism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Species Specificity']",PMC3137610,,2011/07/27 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0022008 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-06622 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e22008. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0022008.

There is growing evidence that imatinib-resistant leukemic cells present abnormal glucose metabolism but the impact on mitochondria has been neglected. Our work aimed to better understand and exploit the metabolic alterations of imatinib-resistant leukemic cells. Imatinib-resistant cells presented high glycolysis as compared to sensitive cells. Consistently, expression of key glycolytic enzymes, at least partly mediated by HIF-1alpha, was modified in imatinib-resistant cells suggesting that imatinib-resistant cells uncouple glycolytic flux from pyruvate oxidation. Interestingly, mitochondria of imatinib-resistant cells exhibited accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates, increased NADH and low oxygen consumption. These mitochondrial alterations due to the partial failure of ETC were further confirmed in leukemic cells isolated from some imatinib-resistant CML patients. As a consequence, mitochondria generated more ROS than those of imatinib-sensitive cells. This, in turn, resulted in increased death of imatinib-resistant leukemic cells following in vitro or in vivo treatment with the pro-oxidants, PEITC and Trisenox, in a syngeneic mouse tumor model. Conversely, inhibition of glycolysis caused derepression of respiration leading to lower cellular ROS.

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) produces a generalized inflammatory reaction, including mobilization of SPCs, increased local production of chemoattractants in the ischemic myocardium, as well as neural and humoral signals activating the SPC egress from the BM. Several types of circulating BM cells were identified in the peripheral blood, including hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, mesenchymal stromal cells, circulating angiogenic cells and pluripotent very small embryonic-like cells; however, the contribution of circulating cells to the myocardial and endothelial repair is still unknown. The number and function of these cells is impaired in patients with diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, but can be improved by physical exercise and use of statins. The mobilization of SPCs in acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary artery disease seems to predict the clinical outcomes in selected groups of patients. Interpretation of the findings has to incorporate other factors that modulate the process of mobilization, such as coexisting diseases, age and medications. This review discusses the mobilization of SPCs in acute ischemia (MI, stroke), as well as in stable cardiovascular disease, and highlights the possibility of using the SPC as a marker of cardiovascular risk.","['Wojakowski, W', 'Landmesser, U', 'Bachowski, R', 'Jadczyk, T', 'Tendera, M']","['Wojakowski W', 'Landmesser U', 'Bachowski R', 'Jadczyk T', 'Tendera M']","['Third Division of Cardiology, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland. wojtek.wojakowski@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/pathology/*therapy', 'Exercise', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans']",,,2011/07/27 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011184 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.184 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):23-33. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.184.

In multiple myeloma (MM), the interleukin-6/JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (IL-6/JAK/STAT) pathway has been the focus of research for a number of years and IL-6 has an established role in MM drug resistance. JAKs therefore make a rational drug target for anti-MM therapy. CYT387 is a novel, orally bioavailable JAK1/2 inhibitor, which has recently been described. This preclinical evaluation of CYT387 for treatment of MM demonstrated that CYT387 was able to prevent IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and greatly decrease IL-6- and insulin-like growth factor-1-induced phosphorylation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). CYT387 inhibited MM proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner in 6/8 HMCL, and this was not abrogated by the addition of exogenous IL-6 (3/3 HMCL). Cell cycling was inhibited with a G(2)/M accumulation of cells, and apoptosis was induced by CYT387 in all HMCL tested (3/3). CYT387 synergised in killing HMCL when used in combination with the conventional anti-MM therapies melphalan and bortezomib. Importantly, apoptosis was also induced in primary patient MM cells (n=6) with CYT387 as a single agent, and again synergy was seen when combined with conventional therapies.","['Monaghan, K A', 'Khong, T', 'Burns, C J', 'Spencer, A']","['Monaghan KA', 'Khong T', 'Burns CJ', 'Spencer A']","['Malignant Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '6O01GMS00P', '(N-(cyanomethyl)-4-(2-((4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl)amino)-4-pyrimidinyl)benzamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",,,2011/07/27 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011175 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Dec;25(12):1891-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.175.

Conversely, whereas activated B cells have been described as IL-15-responding cells, the cellular and molecular context sustaining this effect remains unexplored. In this study, we found that, whereas human B cells could not respond to soluble IL-15, monocytes and lymphoid tissue-derived macrophages but not stromal cells efficiently trans-present IL-15 to normal B cells and cooperate with T-cell-derived CD40L to promote IL-15-dependent B-cell proliferation. Furthermore, CD40L signaling triggers a Src-independent upregulation of STAT5 expression and favors a Src-dependent phosphorylation of STAT5 in response to IL-15. In follicular lymphoma (FL), immunohistochemical studies reported a strong relationship between malignant B cells, infiltrating macrophages and T cells. We show here an overexpression of IL-15 in purified tumor-associated macrophages, and STAT5A in purified tumor B cells. Moreover, FL B cells respond to IL-15 trans-presented by monocytes/macrophages, in particular, in the presence of CD40L-mediated signaling. This cooperation between IL-15 and CD40L reinforces the importance of tumor microenvironment and unravels a mechanism of FL growth that should be considered if using IL-15 as a drug in this disease.","['Epron, G', 'Ame-Thomas, P', 'Le Priol, J', 'Pangault, C', 'Dulong, J', 'Lamy, T', 'Fest, T', 'Tarte, K']","['Epron G', 'Ame-Thomas P', 'Le Priol J', 'Pangault C', 'Dulong J', 'Lamy T', 'Fest T', 'Tarte K']","['INSERM U917, Universite Rennes 1, Institut Federatif de Recherche 140 Genomique Fonctionnelle Agronomie Sante, Rennes, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-15)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'CD40 Ligand/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",,,2011/07/27 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011179 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.179 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):139-48. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.179.

In this study, we established this kind of association by confirming significant differences in genotype distribution of rs41275794 (P= 0.0005) and rs12976445 (P= 0.001) within the pri-miR-125a in 217 Han Chinese patients of RPL compared with 431 controls. Based on this observation, two-locus haplotypes were constructed and the A-T haplotype was found to be associated with an increased risk of RPL (OR=2.84, 95%C.I. 1.98-4.07, P=0.0000000057). Further analysis showed that the levels of pre- and mature- miR-125a were down-regulated in the cells transfected with the A-T haplotype, which was consistent with in vivo detection that the level of mature miR-125a was lower in 30 pregnant women with A-T haplotype than that with G-C haplotype. During in vitro RNA processing assays, we found a similar decrease in the amount of pre-miR-125a and decline in binding capacity of nuclear factors to pri-miR-125a with A-T haplotype. More importantly, the reduction in miR-125a, as a consequence of A-T haplotype, further led to less efficient inhibition of target genes, LIFR and ERBB2, which play important roles in the embryo implantation and decidualization. Thus, our data collectively suggest that two common polymorphisms in pre-miR-125a might contribute to the genetic predisposition to RPL by disrupting the production of miR-125a, which consequently interfered in the expression and function of target genes of miR-125a.","['Hu, Yi', 'Liu, Chun-Mei', 'Qi, Lu', 'He, Tian-Zhu', 'Shi-Guo, Liu', 'Hao, Chan-Juan', 'Cui, Yi', 'Zhang, Ning', 'Xia, Hong-Fei', 'Ma, Xu']","['Hu Y', 'Liu CM', 'Qi L', 'He TZ', 'Shi-Guo L', 'Hao CJ', 'Cui Y', 'Zhang N', 'Xia HF', 'Ma X']","['Reproductive and Genetic Center of National Research Institute for Family Planning, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,"['0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Abortion, Habitual/ethnology/*genetics', 'Asians', 'Case-Control Studies', 'China', 'Embryo Implantation/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics']",,,2011/07/27 06:00,2013/01/18 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['16034 [pii]', '10.4161/rna.8.5.16034 [doi]']",ppublish,RNA Biol. 2011 Sep-Oct;8(5):861-72. doi: 10.4161/rna.8.5.16034.

In this study, we identified salinomycin as a potent inhibitor of the Wnt signaling cascade. In Wnt-transfected HEK293 cells, salinomycin blocked the phosphorylation of the Wnt coreceptor lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) and induced its degradation. Nigericin, another potassium ionophore with activity against cancer stem cells, exerted similar effects. In otherwise unmanipulated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with constitutive Wnt activation nanomolar concentrations of salinomycin down-regulated the expression of Wnt target genes such as LEF1, cyclin D1, and fibronectin, depressed LRP6 levels, and limited cell survival. Normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes resisted salinomycin toxicity. These results indicate that ionic changes induced by salinomycin and related drugs inhibit proximal Wnt signaling by interfering with LPR6 phosphorylation, and thus impair the survival of cells that depend on Wnt signaling at the plasma membrane.","['Lu, Desheng', 'Choi, Michael Y', 'Yu, Jian', 'Castro, Januario E', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Carson, Dennis A']","['Lu D', 'Choi MY', 'Yu J', 'Castro JE', 'Kipps TJ', 'Carson DA']","['University of California at San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA 92093-0820, USA. delu@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],"['U19 CA113318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81534-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA113318-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (LDL-Receptor Related Proteins)', '0 (LRP6 protein, human)', '0 (Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '62UXS86T64 (salinomycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'LDL-Receptor Related Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor-Related Protein-6', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",PMC3156152,,2011/07/27 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1110431108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1110431108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Aug 9;108(32):13253-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1110431108.

Here we explore two novel multidimensional fractionation strategies for analysis of phosphopeptides. In the first technique we utilize aliphatic ion pairing agents to improve retention of phosphopeptides at high pH in the first dimension of a two-dimensional RP-RP. The second approach is based on the addition of strong anion exchange as the second dimension in a three-dimensional reversed phase (RP)-strong anion exchange (SAX)-RP configuration. Both techniques provide for automated, online data acquisition, with the 3-D platform providing the highest performance both in terms of separation peak capacity and the number of unique phosphopeptide sequences identified per mug of cell lysate consumed. Our integrated RP-SAX-RP platform provides several analytical figures of merit, including: (1) orthogonal separation mechanisms in each dimension; (2) high separation peak capacity (3) efficient retention of singly- and multiply-phosphorylated peptides; (4) compatibility with automated, online LC-MS analysis. We demonstrate the reproducibility of RP-SAX-RP and apply it to the analysis of phosphopeptides derived from multiple biological contexts, including an in vitro model of acute myeloid leukemia in addition to primary polyclonal CD8(+) T-cells activated in vivo through bacterial infection and then purified from a single mouse.","['Ficarro, Scott B', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Carrasco-Alfonso, Marlene J', 'Garg, Brijesh', 'Adelmant, Guillaume', 'Webber, James T', 'Luckey, C John', 'Marto, Jarrod A']","['Ficarro SB', 'Zhang Y', 'Carrasco-Alfonso MJ', 'Garg B', 'Adelmant G', 'Webber JT', 'Luckey CJ', 'Marto JA']","['Department of Cancer Biology and Blais Proteomics Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 NS047572/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HG004233/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01NS047572/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50HG004233/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Automation, Laboratory', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Extracts/chemistry', 'Cell Fractionation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Listeriosis/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Phosphoproteins/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/chemistry/isolation & purification/metabolism']",PMC3226414,,2011/07/27 06:00,2012/03/06 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-9476(20)30108-0 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.O111.011064 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2011 Nov;10(11):O111.011064. doi: 10.1074/mcp.O111.011064.

PFOA and PFOS promoted IgE-mediated release of granule components of RBL2H3 cells at 10-300muM. At low concentrations (<30muM), the fluorosurfactants failed to induce degranulation, but promoted IgE-mediated degranulation without affecting cell viability. The absence of extracellular Ca(2+) removed the promoting effect of the fluorosurfactants on IgE-mediated degranulation. On the other hand, the fluorosurfactants at high concentrations (>100muM) induced release of granule components without IgE-mediated activation in parallel with cell death. Pretreatment of tetradecanoyl-phorbol-acetate, a protein kinase C activator, inhibited both the promoting effect of the fluorosurfactants at low concentration on IgE-mediated degranulation and cell death-associated granule component release by high concentration of the fluorosurfactants. These findings indicate that PFOA and PFOS affect granule component release of mast cells by two different mechanisms, namely enhancement of active degranulation machinery at low concentrations and cell lysis at high concentrations.","['Yamaki, Kouya', 'Yoshino, Shin']","['Yamaki K', 'Yoshino S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kobe Pharmaceutical University, Kobe, Hyogo 658-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,9612020,,,,,,2010/03/01 00:00,2010/03/01 00:01,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2009/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2009/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2009/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/03/01 00:01 [medline]']","['S1382-6689(10)00008-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.etap.2009.12.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol. 2010 Mar;29(2):183-9. doi: 10.1016/j.etap.2009.12.009.

METHODS: An immunohistochemical assay was used to detect the expression of LIF and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) in the human dental pulp. The proliferation of DPCs was examined by culturing human primary DPCs in the presence of LIF with different doses or the neutralizing antibody to LIF. Western blot was performed to assay the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) in the presence or absence of LIF and/or AG 490, a specific inhibitor of Jak2. The odontoblastic differentiation of DPCs was determined using the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assay, quantification of bone sialoprotein (BSP) and dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) gene expression, and mineralization nodule formation. RESULTS: LIF and LIFR were present in the odontoblasts and DPCs. LIF induced proliferation of DPCs, which was inhibited by the LIF neutralizing antibody and AG 490. LIF induced phosphorylation of Jak2 and Stat3 but not in the presence of the AG490. ALP activity of DPCs, in the absence or presence of mineralization induction medium, was inhibited by LIF. Furthermore, the mineralization nodule formation and the expression of BSP and DSPP were inhibited by LIF. This inhibition on differentiation was attenuated by the AG490. CONCLUSIONS: LIF and LIFR are expressed in the human dental pulp. LIF promotes the proliferation of DPCs, and the odontoblastic differentiation is inhibited via the Jak2-Stat3 signaling pathway.","['Zhou, Yi', 'Qian, Mingbo', 'Liang, Youde', 'Liu, Yi', 'Yang, Xu', 'Jiang, Tao', 'Wang, Yining']","['Zhou Y', 'Qian M', 'Liang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Yang X', 'Jiang T', 'Wang Y']","[""Key Laboratory for Oral Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, School and Hospital of Stomatology, Wuhan University, Wuhan City, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Endod,Journal of endodontics,7511484,"['0 (Antibodies, Neutralizing)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '0 (dentin sialophosphoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Antibodies, Neutralizing/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcification, Physiologic/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Dental Pulp/*cytology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin-Binding Sialoprotein/analysis', 'Janus Kinase 2/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/analysis/physiology', 'Odontoblasts/*cytology', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/analysis', 'Sialoglycoproteins/analysis', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",,,2011/07/27 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2010/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0099-2399(11)00243-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.joen.2011.02.031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endod. 2011 Jun;37(6):819-24. doi: 10.1016/j.joen.2011.02.031.

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that constitute a major component of the innate immune system. NK cells are mainly modulated through different receptors and cytokines. The killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) represent the largest category of NK cell receptors. KIR function is mainly regulated by binding both classical MHC I (human leukocyte antigen, HLA A, B and C) and also non-classical MHC. Some KIRs are specific to certain HLA subtypes. Questions about how the NK cells sense self-antigen, infection, and altered cells, and how a protective immune response can be induced are being answered at the molecular level. Research has revealed the central role of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as B-cell malignancies, with the emergence of recent developments for KIR characterization, disease monitoring, and treatment. In this paper, we report three recent patents focused on KIR applications: the first one is targeted at the determination of the complex KIR haplotypes by using next generation sequencing; the second patent represents a practical approach for genotyping and treatment of the main KIR-related autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases; and the last patent describes the possible contributions of KIR to promising combination immunotherapies.","['De Re, Valli', 'Caggiari, Laura', 'De Zorzi, Mariangela', 'Toffoli, Giuseppe']","['De Re V', 'Caggiari L', 'De Zorzi M', 'Toffoli G']","['Laboratory of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Molecular Oncology and Translational Medicine (DOMERT), Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, National Cancer Institute, Via F.

However, little is known regarding the impact that dietary components and nutritional supplements have on the mechanisms of resistance that malignant cells develop to chemotherapeutic agents. The increased fortification of cereals, grains and bread with folic acid (FA) has resulted in a marked rise in folate levels in blood and tissues. Vitamin fortification that includes FA is rather commonly used by cancer patients, but FA is also used to protect against pemetrexed induced side effects in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma or that of the antifolate methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, the reduced folate leucovorin (LV, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate) is also used along with 5-fluorouracil in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Likewise, LV is used to reduce toxicity of methotrexate in the treatment of leukemia. FA can also increase efficacy of unrelated regimens, containing cisplatin. Hence there is growing evidence that dietary supplements as folic acid, can mimic, intensify, or attenuate the effects of unrelated chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this review is to highlight some new insights in the cellular and molecular mechanisms affected by folate status, leading to chemotherapy resistance, especially towards antifolates in colorectal cancer treatment. This encompasses the effect of folate status on drug export, as well as on the increased expression of mutated target enzymes involved in folate metabolism and on the augmentation of cellular folate pools that impair polyglutamylation of antifolates, ultimately affecting treatment efficacy.","['Porcelli, Letizia', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Azzariti, Amalia', 'Paradiso, Angelo', 'Jansen, Gerrit', 'Peters, Godefridus J']","['Porcelli L', 'Assaraf YG', 'Azzariti A', 'Paradiso A', 'Jansen G', 'Peters GJ']","['Clinical Experimental Oncology Laboratory, National Cancer Institute Giovanni Paolo II, Viale Orazio Flacco, 65, 70124 Bari, Italy. porcelli.letizia@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/27 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2011/07/27 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDM/E-Pub/000189 [pii]', '10.2174/138920011798062274 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2011 Dec;12(10):975-84. doi: 10.2174/138920011798062274.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite that immunosuppressed children are suggested to require 2 doses of vaccine to achieve seroconversion, conflicting results are reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroconversion status and mean antibody titers at first year after single dose and double doses of varicella vaccination in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Patients with leukemia in remission for at least 1 year who were seronegative for varicella-zoster virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) were vaccinated. Titers above the cutoff level (0.65) were accepted as seroconversion. Seventeen patients were vaccinated with single dose whereas 24 patients were vaccinated with double doses. Mean prevaccination antibody titers were 0.56 +/- 0.05 in patients with single dose and 0.51 +/- 0.08 in patients with double doses (P > .05, Student t test). The mean antibody titers at first year were 0.61 +/- 0.05 in patients with single-dose vaccination (P > .05, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and 1.48 +/- 0.04 in patients with double doses (P < .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

It has been shown that propofol exhibits anticancer activities. However, there is no available information to address propofol-induced cytotoxic effects and affected gene expressions on murine leukemia cells. Therefore, we investigated the effects of propofol on the levels of protein and gene expression, which are associated with apoptotic death in mouse leukemia RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. Results indicated that propofol induced cell morphological changes, cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated that propofol promoted Fas, cytochrome c, caspase-9 and -3 active form and Bax levels, but inhibited Bcl-xl protein level which led to cell apoptosis. Furthermore, cDNA microarray assay indicated that propofol significantly enhanced 5 gene expressions (Gm4884; Gm10883; Lce1c; Lrg1; and LOC100045878) and significantly suppressed 26 gene expressions (Gm10679; Zfp617; LOC621831; LOC621831; Gm5929; Snord116; Gm3994; LOC380994; Gm5592; LOC380994; Gm4638; LOC280487; Gm4638; Tex24; A530064D06Rik; BC094916; EG668725; Gm189; Hist2h3c2; Gm8020; Snord115; Gm3079; Olfr198; Tdh; Snord115; and Olfr1249).

High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis is a newly established technique without the requirement of any gel-based post-PCR handling. METHODS: An asymmetric PCR with unlabeled specific probe was developed and combined to HRM analysis o screen for JAK2 V617F mutation. RESULTS: Heterozygous mutation was easily distinguished from homozygous JAK2 for the obvious shape change. Homozygous JAK2 mutant can be also well separated from wild-type JAK2 in the presence of internal temperature calibrators. The easily recognizable and maximal sensitivity of HRM analysis was 5% for the detection of JAK2 V617F mutation, higher than 25% of direct sequencing. In the test of blind screening of 223 samples (111 Ph- MPNs, 60 Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia, and 52 acute myeloid leukemia), JAK2 V617F mutations were found in 78 (70%) patients with MPNs, but in none with chronic and acute myeloid leukemia. HRM analysis of all cases was fully concordant with the results of PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: The HRM method with unlabeled probe could be used as convenient, sensitive and reliable diagnostic test for detection of JAK2 V617F mutation.","['Cao, Hong-Cui', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun', 'Yao, Dong-Ming', 'Li, Yun', 'Yang, Jing', 'Chen, Qin', 'Chai, Hai-Yan', 'Xiao, Gao-Fei']","['Cao HC', 'Lin J', 'Qian J', 'Yao DM', 'Li Y', 'Yang J', 'Chen Q', 'Chai HY', 'Xiao GF']","[""State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/enzymology/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Temperature']",PMC6647611,,2011/07/26 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcla.20474 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2011;25(4):300-4. doi: 10.1002/jcla.20474.,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism remains unclear, and there have never been reports about the inhibitory effects of amino acids in human monocytes/macrophages. We investigated the inhibitory effects of amino acids on cytokine production or expression of adhesion molecules that are involved in inflammatory diseases, in human monocytes/macrophages. METHODS: We examined the inhibitory effects of cysteine, histidine or glycine on the induction of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) and production of interleukin-8 (IL-8) in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). RESULTS: Cysteine, histidine and glycine significantly reduced the activation of NF-kappaB in THP-1 cells stimulated with TNF-alpha. In addition, cysteine and histidine significantly inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 and production of IL-8 in THP-1 cells and PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cysteine and histidine exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in THP-1 cells, and may be responsible for the efficacy of treatment in inflammatory bowel diseases.","['Hasegawa, Shunji', 'Ichiyama, Takashi', 'Sonaka, Ichiro', 'Ohsaki, Ayami', 'Hirano, Reiji', 'Haneda, Yasuhiro', 'Fukano, Reiji', 'Hara, Masami', 'Furukawa, Susumu']","['Hasegawa S', 'Ichiyama T', 'Sonaka I', 'Ohsaki A', 'Hirano R', 'Haneda Y', 'Fukano R', 'Hara M', 'Furukawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Minamikogushi, Ube, Yamaguchi, 755-8505, Japan. shunji@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Although the viral transactivator protein Tax has been proposed to play a critical role in leukemogeneis, additional cellular events are required for the development of ATL. One of the genetic events of the disease is inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. The CDKN2A locus on chromosome 9p encodes 2 cell cycle regulatory proteins, p14ARF and p16INK4a, which share exon 2 using different reading frames. The p14ARF and p16INK4a genes have been implicated as tumor suppressor genes by their frequent mutation, deletion or promoter hypermethylation in a variety of human tumors. In this report, we describe the expression status of p14ARF and p16INK4a in 9 ATL cell lines (MT1, MT2, OKM3T, F6T, K3T, Oh13T, S1T, Su9T01 and HUT102). By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), expression of p14ARF was not detected in one cell line (OKM3T), while expression of p16INK4a was not detected in 6 cell lines (OKM3T, MT1, MT2, Oh13T, S1T and Su9T01). In the OKM3T cell line, the shared exon 2 of the p14ARF/p16INK4a gene was deleted; however, the p16INK4a gene, was epigenetically inactivated in 5 other cells lines. In primary tumor cells obtained from ATL patients, p14ARF expression was absent in 6 of the 11 samples. We confirmed the methylation of the p16INK4a gene in MT1 and MT2 cells using the methylation-specific PCR (MSP) method. Treatment with 2.0 microM of Azacitidine (AZA), a demethylating agent, for 72 h restored p16INK4a transcript expression and induced growth inhibition in MT2 cells. Our results demonstrate that p16INK4a is epigenetically silenced in ATL. AZA offers a potential new therapeutic approach to improve the poor outcomes associated with ATL.","['Uenogawa, Kumi', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Hayakawa, Satoshi', 'Sawada, Umihiko', 'Aizawa, Shin', 'Yamamoto, Tatsuo', 'Takeuchi, Jin']","['Uenogawa K', 'Hatta Y', 'Arima N', 'Hayakawa S', 'Sawada U', 'Aizawa S', 'Yamamoto T', 'Takeuchi J']","['Department of Hematology and Rheumatology, Nihon University, School of Medicine, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Methylation/*drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2011.756 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2011 Nov;28(5):835-9. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2011.756.

Most information on CLL immunoglobulins (Igs), such as the definition of stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs), was derived from germline unmutated Igs. In particular, detailed studies on the distribution and nature of mutations in paired heavy- and light-chain domains of CLL clones bearing mutated Igs are lacking. To address the somatic hyper-mutation dynamics of CLL Igs, we analyzed the mutation pattern of paired IGHV-diversity-joining (IGHV-D-J ) and immunoglobulin kappa/lambda variable-joining (IGK/LV-J ) rearrangements of 193 leukemic clones that displayed >/= 2% mutations in at least one of the two immunoglobulin variable (IGV ) genes (IGHV and/or IGK/LV ). The relationship between the mutation frequency in IGHV and IGK/LV complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FRs) was evaluated by correlation analysis. Replacement (R) mutation frequency within IGK/LV chain CDRs correlated significantly with mutation frequency of paired IGHV CDRs in lambda but not kappa isotype CLL clones. CDRs of IGKV-J rearrangements displayed a lower percentage of R mutations than IGHVs. The frequency/pattern of mutations in kappa CLL Igs differed also from that in kappa-expressing normal B cells described in the literature.

This study aimed to evaluate in vitro anti-leukemic activity of dichloromethane extract/fraction number 7 (DCM/F7) from T. flagelliforme tuber on human T4 lymphoblastoid (CEMss) cell line. The DCM extract of tuber has been fractionated by column chromatography. The obtained fractions were evaluated for its cytotoxicity toward CEMss cells as well as human primary blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Assessment of apoptosis produced by the most active fraction was evaluated by various microscopic techniques and further confirmation of apoptosis was done by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Phytochemical screening was done by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results shows that 7 out of 12 fractions showed significant cytotoxicity against the selected cell line CEMss, in which fractions DCM/F7, DCM/F11 and DCM/F12 showed exceptional activity with 3, 5 and 6.2 mug ml(-1), respectively. Further studies in the non-cancerous PBL exhibited significant selectivity of DCM/F7 compared to other fractions. Cytological observations showed chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage, abnormalities of cristae, membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic extrusions and formation of apoptotic bodies as confirmed collectively by double-staining of acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI), SEM and TEM. In addition, DCM/F7 has increased the cellular DNA breaks on treated cells. GC-MS revealed that DCM/F7 contains linoleic acid, hexadecanoic acid and 9-hexadecanoic acid. The present results indicate that T. flagelliforme possess a valuable anti-leukemic effect and was able to produce distinctive morphological features of cell death that corresponds to apoptosis.","['Mohan, Syam', 'Bustamam, Ahmad', 'Ibrahim, Siddig', 'Al-Zubairi, Adel S', 'Aspollah, Mohammed', 'Abdullah, Rasedee', 'Elhassan, Manal Mohamed']","['Mohan S', 'Bustamam A', 'Ibrahim S', 'Al-Zubairi AS', 'Aspollah M', 'Abdullah R', 'Elhassan MM']","['UPM-MAKNA Cancer Research Laboratory, Institute of Bioscience, 43400 UPM Serdang, University Putra Malaysia, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,PMC3135625,,2011/07/26 06:00,2011/07/26 06:01,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2009/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2010/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1093/ecam/neq010 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2011;2011:421894. doi: 10.1093/ecam/neq010.

Mutations in p53 are rarely found in these diseases before acute leukemia transformation, but this does not rule out a role for p53 deregulation in disease progression. Using Ba/F3-EPOR cells and ex vivo cultured CD34(+) cells from MPN patients, we demonstrate that expression of JAK2(V617F) affected the p53 response to DNA damage. We show that E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 accumulated in these cells, due to an increased translation of MDM2 mRNA. Accumulation of the La autoantigen, which interacts with MDM2 mRNA and promotes its translation, was responsible for the increase in MDM2 protein level and the subsequent degradation of p53 after DNA damage. Downregulation of La protein or cell treatment with nutlin-3, a MDM2 antagonist, restored the p53 response to DNA damage and the cytokine-dependence of Ba/F3-EPOR-JAK2(V617F) cells. Altogether, these data indicate that the JAK2(V617F) mutation affects p53 response to DNA damage through the upregulation of La antigen and accumulation of MDM2. They also suggest that p53 functional inactivation accounts for the cytokine hypersensitivity of JAK2(V617F) MPN and might have a role in disease progression.","['Nakatake, M', 'Monte-Mor, B', 'Debili, N', 'Casadevall, N', 'Ribrag, V', 'Solary, E', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Plo, I']","['Nakatake M', 'Monte-Mor B', 'Debili N', 'Casadevall N', 'Ribrag V', 'Solary E', 'Vainchenker W', 'Plo I']","['INSERM UMR 1009, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (SS-B antigen)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Ribonucleoproteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011313 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.313 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Mar 8;31(10):1323-33. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.313.

This contrasts with most cell types where STAT3 signalling induces differentiation. We find that STAT3 binding across the pluripotent genome is dependent on Brg1, the ATPase subunit of a specialized chromatin remodelling complex (esBAF) found in ESCs. Brg1 is required to establish chromatin accessibility at STAT3 binding targets, preparing these sites to respond to LIF signalling. Brg1 deletion leads to rapid polycomb (PcG) binding and H3K27me3-mediated silencing of many Brg1-activated targets genome wide, including the target genes of the LIF signalling pathway. Hence, one crucial role of Brg1 in ESCs involves its ability to potentiate LIF signalling by opposing PcG. Contrary to expectations, Brg1 also facilitates PcG function at classical PcG targets, including all four Hox loci, reinforcing their repression in ESCs. Therefore, esBAF does not simply antagonize PcG. Rather, the two chromatin regulators act both antagonistically and synergistically with the common goal of supporting pluripotency.","['Ho, Lena', 'Miller, Erik L', 'Ronan, Jehnna L', 'Ho, Wen Qi', 'Jothi, Raja', 'Crabtree, Gerald R']","['Ho L', 'Miller EL', 'Ronan JL', 'Ho WQ', 'Jothi R', 'Crabtree GR']","['Program in Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS046789-07S1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS46789/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD055391/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI60037/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA ES102625/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046789-07/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD055391-02/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD055391-04/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD055391-01A1/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046789-09/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD055391-03/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046789-06/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046789-09S1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046789-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046789/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01HD55391/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI060037/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD055391-05/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046789-08/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'ZIA ES102625-02/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Smarca4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics/physiology', 'DNA Helicases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'Pregnancy', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3155811,['NIHMS300649'],2011/07/26 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2010/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ncb2285 [pii]', '10.1038/ncb2285 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2011 Jul 24;13(8):903-13. doi: 10.1038/ncb2285.,20110724,,,['Nat Cell Biol. 2011 Aug;13(8):886-8.

During erythropoiesis, pluripotent adult human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate into oligopotent progenitors, committed precursors and mature red blood cells. This process is regulated for a large part at the level of gene expression, whereby specific transcription factors activate lineage-specific genes while concomitantly repressing genes that are specific to other cell types. Studies on transcription factors regulating erythropoiesis are often performed using human and murine cell lines that represent, to some extent, erythroid cells at given stages of differentiation. However transformed cell lines can only partially mimic erythroid cells and most importantly they do not allow one to comprehensibly study the dynamic changes that occur as cells progress through many stages towards their final erythroid fate. Therefore, a current challenge remains the development of a protocol to obtain relatively homogenous populations of primary HSCs and erythroid cells at various stages of differentiation in quantities that are sufficient to perform genomics and proteomics experiments. Here we describe an ex vivo cell culture protocol to induce erythroid differentiation from human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells that have been isolated from either cord blood, bone marrow, or adult peripheral blood mobilized with G-CSF (leukapheresis). This culture system, initially developed by the Douay laboratory, uses cytokines and co-culture on mesenchymal cells to mimic the bone marrow microenvironment. Using this ex vivo differentiation protocol, we observe a strong amplification of erythroid progenitors, an induction of differentiation exclusively towards the erythroid lineage and a complete maturation to the stage of enucleated red blood cells. Thus, this system provides an opportunity to study the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation as hematopoietic stem cells progress along the erythroid lineage. Studying erythropoiesis at the transcriptional level also requires the ability to over-express or knockdown specific factors in primary erythroid cells. For this purpose, we use a lentivirus-mediated gene delivery system that allows for the efficient infection of both dividing and non-dividing cells. Here we show that we are able to efficiently knockdown the transcription factor TAL1 in primary human erythroid cells. In addition, GFP expression demonstrates an efficiency of lentiviral infection close to 90%. Thus, our protocol provides a highly useful system for characterization of the regulatory network of transcription factors that control erythropoiesis.","['Palii, Carmen G', 'Pasha, Roya', 'Brand, Marjorie']","['Palii CG', 'Pasha R', 'Brand M']","['The Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute.']",['eng'],['MOP-82813/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques/*methods', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",PMC3168199,,2011/07/26 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['2813 [pii]', '10.3791/2813 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2011 Jul 16;(53). pii: 2813. doi: 10.3791/2813.,20110716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, to examine whether 8-NH(2)-Ado had the ability to enhance the radiation-induced cell killing in solid tumor cells, human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were irradiated in the presence and absence of 8-NH(2)-Ado. 8-NH(2)-Ado significantly increased reproductive cell death and apoptosis in A549 cells exposed to X-rays. When peptide inhibitors against caspase-3, -8, and -9 were utilized to evaluate the involvement of caspases, all inhibitors suppressed the enhancement of radiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that not only mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signal transduction pathways but also death receptor-mediated pathways were involved in this enhancement of apoptosis. In addition, in the cells exposed to the treatment combining X-irradiation and 8-NH(2)-Ado, reduction of the intracellular ATP concentration was essential for survival, and down-regulation of the expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as survivin and XIAP was observed. These results indicate that 8-NH(2)-Ado has potential not only as an anti-tumor drug for leukemia and lymphoma but also as a radiosensitizing agent for solid tumors.","['Meike, Shunsuke', 'Yamamori, Tohru', 'Yasui, Hironobu', 'Eitaki, Masato', 'Matsuda, Akira', 'Inanami, Osamu']","['Meike S', 'Yamamori T', 'Yasui H', 'Eitaki M', 'Matsuda A', 'Inanami O']","['Laboratory of Radiation Biology, Department of Environmental Veterinary Sciences, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiat Res,Journal of radiation research,0376611,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '3868-33-5 (8-aminoadenosine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/chemistry', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Peptides/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Propidium/pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'X-Rays']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jrr/10188 [pii]', '10.1269/jrr.10188 [doi]']",ppublish,J Radiat Res. 2011;52(4):456-63. doi: 10.1269/jrr.10188.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, the mechanism of apoptosis induced by treatment with ATO alone or in combination with BrMC was studied in U937, HL-60, and Jurkat cells. Our results demonstrated that BrMC cooperated with ATO to induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells. This co-treatment caused mitochondrial transmembrane potential dissipation and stimulated the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as evidenced by cytochrome c release, down-regulation of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and Bcl-XL, and up-regulation of Bax. BrMC alone or in combination with ATO, decreased Akt phosphorylation as well as intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) content. The thiol antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and exogenous GSH restored GSH content and attenuated apoptosis induced by co-treatment with ATO plus BrMC. In contrast, the non-thiol antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole and mannitol failed to do so. These findings suggest that GSH depletion explains at least in part the potentiation of ATO-induced apoptosis by BrMC.","['Xiao, Guangfen', 'Tang, Xueyuan', 'Yao, Chenjiao', 'Wang, Chenghong']","['Xiao G', 'Tang X', 'Yao C', 'Wang C']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (8-bromo-7-methoxychrysin)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2012/01/31 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/31 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr065 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmr065 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2011 Sep;43(9):712-21. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmr065.

An extensive variety of cell culture experiments have identified effects of growth factors, cytokines, and drugs on Bcl-2 family functions, but in vivo studies have tended to focus on the role of one or two particular members in development and organ homeostasis. Thus, the ability of physiologically relevant contexts to modulate canonical dependencies that are likely to be more complex has yet to be investigated systematically. In this study, we report findings derived from a pool-based shRNA assay that systematically and comprehensively interrogated the functional dependence of leukemia and lymphoma cells upon various Bcl-2 family members across many diverse in vitro and in vivo settings.

Notably, our results reveal an unexpected role for the extrinsic death pathway as a tissue-specific modifier of therapeutic response. In particular, our findings show that particular tissue sites of tumor dissemination play critical roles in demarcating the nature and extent of cancer cell vulnerabilities and mechanisms of chemoresistance.","['Pritchard, Justin R', 'Gilbert, Luke A', 'Meacham, Corbin E', 'Ricks, Jennifer L', 'Jiang, Hai', 'Lauffenburger, Douglas A', 'Hemann, Michael T']","['Pritchard JR', 'Gilbert LA', 'Meacham CE', 'Ricks JL', 'Jiang H', 'Lauffenburger DA', 'Hemann MT']","['The Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA128803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128803-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA112967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1-U54-CA112967/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics']",PMC3165087,['NIHMS314067'],2011/07/26 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-1014 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Sep 1;71(17):5850-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-1014.

However, the mechanisms underlying Mll-mediated hematopoiesis during embryogenesis remain largely unclear. Here, we investigate the role of mll during zebrafish embryogenesis, particularly hematopoiesis. Mll depletion caused severe defects in hematopoiesis as indicated by a lack of blood flow and mature blood cells as well as a significant reduction in expression of hematopoietic progenitor and mature blood cell markers. Furthermore, mll depletion prevented the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors. In addition, we identified the N-terminal mini-peptide of Mll that acted as a dominant negative form to disrupt normal function of mll during embryogenesis. As expected, mll knockdown altered the expression of a subset of Hox genes. However, overexpression of these down-regulated Hox genes only partially rescued the blood deficiency, suggesting that mll may target additional genes to regulate hematopoiesis. In the mll morphants, microarray analysis revealed a dramatic up-regulation of gadd45alphaa. Multiple assays indicate that mll inhibited gadd45alphaa expression and that overexpression of gadd45alphaa mRNA led to a phenotype similar to the one seen in the mll morphants. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that zebrafish mll plays essential roles in hematopoiesis and that gadd45alphaa may serve as a potential downstream target for mediating the function of mll in hematopoiesis.","['Wan, Xiaoyang', 'Hu, Bo', 'Liu, Jing-xia', 'Feng, Xi', 'Xiao, Wuhan']","['Wan X', 'Hu B', 'Liu JX', 'Feng X', 'Xiao W']","['Key Laboratory of Aquatic Biodiversity and Conservation, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (GADD45 protein)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blood Circulation/drug effects', 'Conserved Sequence/genetics', 'Embryonic Development/drug effects/genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Zebrafish/*genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC3190926,,2011/07/26 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)78230-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.253252 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Sep 23;286(38):33345-57. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.253252.

CYP2E1 gene function was evaluated by mRNA expression and enzyme activity. DNA damage was measured by Single-Cell Gel Electrophoresis (SCGE). RESULTS: Among the four SNPs, cells with rs2070673TT and rs2030920CC showed higher levels of CYP2E1 transcription and enzymatic activity than the other genotypes in the same SNP site. Cells with higher gene expression genotypes also showed higher comet rates compared with lower gene expression genotypes.

After characterization and validation of miR-10a, which was specifically upregulated in nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutant AML samples, functional consequences of miR-10a overexpression were further delineated in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Microarray analysis of miRNAs in bone marrow samples from AML (IR) patients with NPM1 mutations and healthy donors was performed to detect differential expression patterns. After validation of miRNA expression specific for NPM1 mutation in AML patients by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, a functional target gene search was conducted using complementary DNA microarray data from samples transfected with miR-10a. Potential target gene validation was done using transient transfection of K562 cells followed by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS: In comparison with wild-type samples, NPM1 mutant AML samples were shown to markedly overexpress miR-10a. Subsequent in vitro miR-10a overexpression induced differential gene expression as determined by microarray analysis. Here the murine double minute 4 (MDM4) gene turned out as a candidate gene for miR-10a. Validation of MDM4 in leukemic cells revealed a robust negative relationship between miR-10a overexpression and MDM4 downregulation. Furthermore, we determined an inverse association between miR-10a and MDM4 expression in AML (IR) samples with respect to their NPM1 mutational status. CONCLUSIONS: miR-10a expression is highly characteristic for AML (IR) patients with NPM1 mutations and may influence its biological properties in AML by interfering with the p53 machinery partly regulated by MDM4.","['Ovcharenko, Dmitriy', 'Stolzel, Friedrich', 'Poitz, David', 'Fierro, Fernando', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Kelnar, Kevin', 'Davison, Timothy', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Brown, David', 'Illmer, Thomas']","['Ovcharenko D', 'Stolzel F', 'Poitz D', 'Fierro F', 'Schaich M', 'Neubauer A', 'Kelnar K', 'Davison T', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Thiede C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Brown D', 'Illmer T']","['Asuragen Inc., Austin, Tx., USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN10 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Risk', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00365-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Oct;39(10):1030-1042.e7. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.07.008.

A case-only design was conducted in 123 Chinese children with sporadic AL. Industrial plants in the vicinity were recorded and, if present, their size and proximity to the usual place of residence of AL children was evaluated. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed across the AL study group adjusting for age, gender, parental education, occupation and smoking, indoor and outdoor pesticide use, presence of television sets, refrigerators, microwave ovens and furniture material in children's rooms, and electric transformers, power lines, and telecommunication transmitters within 500 m. This analysis revealed an interaction between the GSTT null allele and industrial plants within 500 m of the residences of childhood AL patients (interaction odds ratio, COR=2.96, 95% CI: 1.09-8.01). Furthermore, the COR for the interaction between GSTT null and industrial plants within 50 m was 5.99 (95% CI: 1.41-25.45).

To analyze the potential risk of the perfluorinated acids to humans and the environment, different in vitro toxicity test systems were employed. The cytotoxicity of the chemicals towards two different types of mammalian cell lines and one marine bacteria was investigated. The viability of cells from the promyelocytic leukemia rat cell line (IPC-81) and the rat glioma cell line (C6) was assayed calorimetrically with WST-1 reagent. The evaluation was combined with the Vibrio fischeri acute bioluminescence inhibition assay. The biological activity of the compounds was also determined at the molecular level with acetylcholinesterase and glutathione reductase inhibition assays. This is the first report of the effects of perfluorinated acids on the activity of purified enzymes. The results show these compounds have a very low acute biological activity. The observed effective concentrations lie in the millimole range, which is well above probable intracellular concentrations. A relationship was found between the toxicity of the perfluorinated carboxylic acids and the perfluorocarbon chain length: in every test system applied, the longer the perfluorocarbon chain, the more toxic was the acid. The lowest effective concentrations were thus recorded for perfluorononanoic and perfluorodecanoic acids.","['Mulkiewicz, E', 'Jastorff, B', 'Skladanowski, A C', 'Kleszczynski, K', 'Stepnowski, P']","['Mulkiewicz E', 'Jastorff B', 'Skladanowski AC', 'Kleszczynski K', 'Stepnowski P']","['Faculty of Chemistry, University of Gdansk, Sobieskiego 18, PL-80-952 Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,9612020,,,,,,2007/05/01 00:00,2007/05/01 00:01,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2006/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2007/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/01 00:01 [medline]']","['S1382-6689(06)00153-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.etap.2006.11.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Environ Toxicol Pharmacol. 2007 May;23(3):279-85. doi: 10.1016/j.etap.2006.11.002.

We showed that MGBG treatment significantly affected gamma-radiation-induced cell cycle transition (G(1)/G(0)-->S-->G(2)/M) and thus gamma-radiation-induced cell death. As determined by micronuclei and comet assay, we showed that it sensitized the cytotoxic effect induced by gamma-radiation. One of the reasons is that polyamine depletion by MGBG treatment did not effectively protect against the chemical (OH) or physical damage to DNA caused by gamma-radiation. Through in vitro experiment, we confirmed that DNA strand breaks induced by gamma-radiation was prevented more effectively in the presence of polyamines (spermine and spermidine) than in the absence of polyamines. MGBG also blocks the cell cycle transition caused by gamma-radiation (G(2) arrest), which helps protect cells by allowing time for DNA repair before entry into mitosis or apoptosis, via the down regulation of cyclin D1, which mediates the transition from G(1) to S phase of cell cycle, and ataxia telangiectasia mutated, which is involved in the DNA sensing, repair and cell cycle check point. Therefore, the abrogation of G(2) arrest sensitizes cells to the effect of gamma-radiation. As a result, gamma-radiation-induced cell death increased by about 2.5-3.0-fold in cells treated with MGBG. However, exogenous spermidine supplement partially relieved this gamma-radiation-induced cytotoxicity and cell death. These findings suggest a potentially therapeutic strategy for increasing the cytotoxic efficacy of gamma-radiation.","['Kim, Jin Sik', 'Lee, Jin', 'Chung, Hai Won', 'Choi, Han', 'Paik, Sang Gi', 'Kim, In Gyu']","['Kim JS', 'Lee J', 'Chung HW', 'Choi H', 'Paik SG', 'Kim IG']","['Department of Radiation Biology, Environment Radiation Research Group, Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute, P.O.

Few studies regarding the neuroprotective and neurobehavioral effects of propofol have been conducted, and the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Because I/R may result in neuronal apoptosis, the apoptosis regulatory genes B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) may be involved in the neuroprotective process. In this study, 120 Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (sham, I/R-induced, and propofol-treated). Cerebral ischemia was induced by clamping the bilateral common carotid arteries for 10min. Propofol (1.0mg/kg/min) was administered intravenously for 1h before the induction of ischemia. Neuronal damage was evaluated by neurobehavioral scores and histological examination of the brain sections at the level of the dorsal hippocampus at 6h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 4days, 5days, 6days, and 7days after I/R. The apoptotic rate of hippocampal neurons was detected by flow cytometry. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was evaluated using immunohistochemical and Western blot methods. The results of this study showed that neurobehavioral scores were higher in propofol-treated rats compared with I/R-induced rats with no propofol treatment. Moreover, the hippocampal expression of Bcl-2 was significantly higher, while the expression of Bax was significantly lower in propofol-treated rats compared with I/R-induced rats at 24h after ischemia. Hence, this study suggests that the neuroprotective effects of propofol against neuronal apoptosis may be a consequence of the regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax.","['Xi, Hong-Jie', 'Zhang, Tian-Hua', 'Tao, Tao', 'Song, Chun-Yu', 'Lu, Shu-Jun', 'Cui, Xiao-Guang', 'Yue, Zi-Yong']","['Xi HJ', 'Zhang TH', 'Tao T', 'Song CY', 'Lu SJ', 'Cui XG', 'Yue ZY']","['Department of Anesthesiology, China and Heilongjiang Key Laboratory for Anesthesia and Critical Care, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Brain Res,Brain research,0045503,"['0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Anesthetics, Intravenous/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Behavior, Animal/*drug effects', 'Brain Ischemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism', 'Propofol/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reperfusion Injury/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2011/12/17 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-8993(11)01231-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.brainres.2011.06.060 [doi]']",ppublish,Brain Res. 2011 Sep 2;1410:24-32. doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2011.06.060.

Incubation of macrophage-like differentiated THP1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages with wild-type PLTP in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or interferon gamma (IFNgamma) significantly increased nuclear levels of active signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, pSTAT3(Tyr705) (p<0.01). Similar results were obtained in the presence of a PLTP mutant without lipid transfer activity (PLTP(M159E)), suggesting that PLTP-mediated lipid transfer is not required for activation of the STAT3 pathway. Inhibition of ABCA1 by chemical inhibitor, glyburide, as well as ABCA1 RNA inhibition, reversed the observed PLTP-mediated activation of STAT3. In addition, PLTP reduced nuclear levels of active nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkappaB) p65 and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in conditioned media of differentiated THP1 cells and human monocyte-derived macrophages.

21782509,NLM,MEDLINE,20111005,20211020,1474-5488 (Electronic) 1470-2045 (Linking),12,8,2011 Aug,"Height and cancer incidence in the Million Women Study: prospective cohort, and meta-analysis of prospective studies of height and total cancer risk.",785-94,10.1016/S1470-2045(11)70154-1 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown that taller people are at increased risk of cancer, but it is unclear if height-associated risks vary by cancer site, or by other factors such as smoking and socioeconomic status. Our aim was to investigate these associations in a large UK prospective cohort with sufficient information on incident cancer to allow direct comparison of height-associated risk across cancer sites and in relation to major potential confounding and modifying factors. METHODS: Information on height and other factors relevant for cancer was obtained in 1996-2001 for middle-aged women without previous cancer who were followed up for cancer incidence. We used Cox regression models to calculate adjusted relative risks (RRs) per 10 cm increase in measured height for total incident cancer and for 17 specific cancer sites, taking attained age as the underlying time variable. We also did a meta-analysis of published results from prospective studies of total cancer risk in relation to height. FINDINGS: 1 297 124 women included in our analysis were followed up for a total of 11.7 million person-years (median 9.4 years per woman, IQR 8.4-10.2), during which time 97 376 incident cancers occurred. The RR for total cancer was of 1.16 (95% CI 1.14-1.17; p<0.0001) for every 10 cm increase in height. Risk increased for 15 of the 17 cancer sites we assessed, and was statistically significant for ten sites: colon (RR per 10 cm increase in height 1.25, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), rectum (1.14, 1.07-1.22), malignant melanoma (1.32, 1.24-1.40), breast (1.17, 1.15-1.19), endometrium (1.19, 1.13-1.24), ovary (1.17, 1.11-1.23), kidney (1.29, 1.19-1.41), CNS (1.20, 1.12-1.29), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1.21, 1.14-1.29), and leukaemia (1.26, 1.15-1.38). The increase in total cancer RR per 10 cm increase in height did not vary significantly by socioeconomic status or by ten other personal characteristics we assessed, but was significantly lower in current than in never smokers (p<0.0001). In current smokers, smoking-related cancers were not as strongly related to height as were other cancers (RR per 10 cm increase in height 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09, and 1.17, 1.13-1.22, respectively; p=0.0004). In a meta-analysis of our study and ten other prospective studies, height-associated RRs for total cancer showed little variation across Europe, North America, Australasia, and Asia. INTERPRETATION: Cancer incidence increases with increasing adult height for most cancer sites. The relation between height and total cancer RR is similar in different populations.

Clinical trials of K5Is revealed dose-limiting neutropenia, or loss of neutrophils, for which the molecular mechanism is unclear. We investigated the effects of a K5I on HL60 cells, a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line that is often used to model dividing neutrophil progenitors in cell culture. We found K5I treatment caused unusually rapid death of HL60 cells exclusively during mitotic arrest. This mitotic death occurred via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway with molecular events that include cytochrome c leakage into the cytoplasm, caspase activation, and Parp1 cleavage. Bcl-2 overexpression protected from death. We probed mitochondrial physiology to find candidate triggers of cytochrome c release, and observed a decrease of membrane potential (DeltaPsim) before mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Interestingly, this loss of DeltaPsim was not blocked by overexpressing Bcl-2, suggesting it might be a cause of Bax/Bak activation, not a consequence. Taken together, these results show that K5I induces intrinsic apoptosis during mitotic arrest in HL60 with loss of DeltaPsim as an upstream event of MOMP.","['Tang, Yangzhong', 'Orth, James D', 'Xie, Tiao', 'Mitchison, Timothy J']","['Tang Y', 'Orth JD', 'Xie T', 'Mitchison TJ']","['Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. yangzhong_tan@hms.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['P01 CA139980-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA139980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA139980-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA139980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA139980-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (EMD 534085)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KIF11 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinolines)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.4.4 (Kinesins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinesins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'RNA Interference']",PMC3155259,['NIHMS303130'],2011/07/26 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(11)00301-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2011.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2011 Nov 1;310(1):15-24. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2011.05.024.

In this study, we isolated and characterized GCSCs from a gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 and found their enhanced capabilities of invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. We further studied the expression of molecules related to epithelial-mesenchymal and invasion in GCSCs and found there were decreased E-cadherin, but increased vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), in these cells.

To test the hypothesis whether survival and differentiation of erythroleukemia cells are under control of alpha1-adrenergic signalling, we examined alpha1-adrenoceptor expression of erythroleukemia cells and compared the in vitro effects of alpha-adrenergic antagonists with those of agonists. We discovered that alpha1-adrenergic agonists suppress both erythroid differentiation and growth of erythroleukemia cells concomitant with lipofuscin accumulation, autophagy and necrotic cell death. alpha1-adrenergic agonists also inhibit the in vitro growth of physiologic hematopoietic progenitors obtained from umbilical cord blood with high selectivity for the erythroid lineage. Interestingly, the observed effects could not be related to alpha1-adrenoceptors, even though agonists and antagonists displayed opposing effects regarding cellular growth and differentiation of erythroleukemia cells. Our data suggest that the effects of alpha1-adrenergic drugs are related to a non-adrenoceptor binding site, controlling the fate of erythroid progenitor cells towards differentiation and cell death. Since the observed effects are not mediated through adrenoceptors, the physiologic relevance of our data remains unclear, so far. Nevertheless, the identification of the still unknown binding site(s) might disclose new insights into regulation of erythroid differentiation and cell death.","['Fuchs, Robert', 'Schraml, Elisabeth', 'Leitinger, Gerd', 'Stelzer, Ingeborg', 'Allard, Nathalie', 'Haas, Helga Susanne', 'Schauenstein, Konrad', 'Sadjak, Anton']","['Fuchs R', 'Schraml E', 'Leitinger G', 'Stelzer I', 'Allard N', 'Haas HS', 'Schauenstein K', 'Sadjak A']","['Institute of Pathophysiology and Immunology, Center of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Graz, Heinrichstrasse 31A, Graz, Austria. robert.fuchs@medunigraz.at']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Adrenergic alpha-Agonists)', '0 (Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Oxathiins)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '92642-94-9 (benoxathian)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'H231GF11BV (Naphazoline)', 'XM03YJ541D (Prazosin)']",IM,"['Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Glycophorins/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration/drug effects', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Megakaryocyte Progenitor Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Naphazoline/pharmacology', 'Necrosis/chemically induced', 'Oxathiins/pharmacology', 'Prazosin/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1/genetics']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2010/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-4827(11)00281-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2011 Oct 1;317(16):2239-51. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.07.005.

Data regarding relapse mechanisms after transplantation is scarcely available. We investigated genomic aberrations (GAs) in 21 patients undergoing related and unrelated HLA-matched transplantation in leukemic blasts before transplant and at relapse after transplantation. We found a higher number of GAs after transplantation, suggesting increased genomic instability during relapse. Two of 21 patients showed a large homozygous region spanning the whole HLA-locus on chromosome 6p in the relapse sample. In both patients sequence-based HLA typing of the blasts revealed a loss of the patient-specific allele at the mismatched locus leading to homozygosity for the HLA haplotype shared by the patient and the donor. In addition, GAs were found in critical regions such as 12p13, 13q12.2, and 17p13. Our results suggest that escape from immunologic surveillance may be a relevant mechanism of relapse after transplantation in patients with GAs on chromosome 6p. A combination of continuous immunologic pressure mediated by donor T cells and clonal evolution of myeloid leukemia may result in acquired GAs after transplantation.","['Waterhouse, Miguel', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Pantic, Milena', 'Emmerich, Florian', 'Bertz, Hartmut', 'Finke, Jurgen']","['Waterhouse M', 'Pfeifer D', 'Pantic M', 'Emmerich F', 'Bertz H', 'Finke J']","['Section of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany. miguel.waterhouse@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Loci', '*Genome-Wide Association Study', '*Genomic Instability', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00302-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.07.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Oct;17(10):1450-1459.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.07.012.

Hematopoiesis represents one of the most experimentally tractable mammalian organ systems and, therefore, has historically tended to be at the forefront of applying new technologies within biomedical research. The combination of massive parallel sequencing technologies with chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) permits genome-scale characterization of histone modification status and identification of the complete set of binding sites for transcription factors. Because transcription factors have long been recognized as essential regulators of cell fate choice in hematopoiesis, ChIP-Seq technology has rapidly entered the arena of modern experimental hematology. Here we review the biological insights gained from ChIP-Seq studies performed in the hematopoietic system since the earliest studies just 4 years ago. A surprisingly large number of different approaches have already been implemented to extract new biological knowledge from ChIP-Seq datasets. By focusing on successful insights from multiple different approaches, we hope to provide stimulating reading for anyone wanting to utilize ChIP-Seq technology within their particular research field.","['Wilson, Nicola K', 'Tijssen, Marloes R', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Wilson NK', 'Tijssen MR', 'Gottgens B']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0800784/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900729/1/National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of', 'Animals in Research/United Kingdom', 'G0900951/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/*methods', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Forecasting', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",,,2011/07/26 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00362-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Oct;39(10):961-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.07.005.

METHODS: The data of 25 relapsed patients received the second allogeneic transplantation as a salvage therapy in Institute of Hematology Peking University between October 1999 and March 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Twenty-four patients relapsed at 8.8 (1 - 55) months after the first transplantation, except one received the second transplantation as prophylaxis therapy. They received the second transplantation after 3 (0.3 - 20) months' therapy. The median time between the 2 transplants was 10.6 (0.6 - 59.0) months. RESULTS: Most of the patients were given the conditioning regimen including total body irradiation (TBI, 700 - 779 cGy) or modified busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BUCY, BU 12 mg). All patients survived more than 30 days and achieved sustained white blood cell engraftment. Sinus obstructive syndrome, irradiation dermatitis and acute myocardial infraction were occurred in 3 patients and recoverable. Until January 31 in 2011, with a median observation period of 9.1 (2.0 - 131.1) months, 8 patients had been living with a overall survival (OS) of 30.9%. Twelve patients relapsed at a median 4.4 months and 10 died of it. The other 7 patients died of transplant related complications. The non-relapsed mortality was 35.1%.

METHODS: The expression of HO-1 in 20 drug-resistant CML patients was detected by RT-PCR. Different concentrations of hemin were used to induce HO-1 expression of K562/A02-IM, HO-1 expression at different time was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V/PI staining, and MTT assay was used to detect viability of K562/A02-IM cells after induction or inhibition of HO-1 gene by hemin and zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP). RESULTS: RT-PCR showed that HO-1 was expressed in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs). When treated with hemin at different concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40 micromol/L) for 16 h, the expression of HO-1 in K562/A02-IM was increased in a dose-dependent manner, and peaked at 20 micromol/L of hemin for 16 h.

PATIENTS/METHODS: We included patients less than 14 years of age admitted to one of 18 hospitals in Madrid, Spain, between May 1 and November 30, 2009 and diagnosed with pH1N1 by polymerase chain reaction. A retrospective chart review was conducted and data were compared by age, presence of high-risk medical conditions, and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission. RESULTS: A total of 517 pH1N1 cases were included for final analysis. One hundred and forty-two patients (27.5%) had predisposing underlying illnesses, with immunosuppression (36 children, 7%) and moderate persistent asthma (34, 6.6%) being the most common ones. Patients with underlying medical conditions had longer hospital stays [median 5, interquartile range (IQR) 3-8 days, versus median 4, IQR 3-6, P < 0.001] and required intensive care (20.4% versus 5.9%, P < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation more frequently than previously healthy children. Globally, intensive care was required for 51 patients (10%) and invasive mechanical ventilation for 12 (2%). Pediatric intensive care unit admission was significantly associated with abnormal initial chest X-ray [Odds Ratio (OR) 3.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-8.5], underlying neurological condition (OR 3.1, CI 1.2-7.5) and immunosuppression (OR 2.9, 1.2-6.8).

The studies that met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by two independent reviewers for methodological validity using standardized critical appraisal instruments. Proportional meta-analysis based on DerSimonian-Laird weights using a random effects model was used for statistical pooling through Stats Direct. Heterogeneity is assessed using Cochran Q. When statistical pooling is not possible, the findings were presented in narrative summary. Rapid rituximab infusion is safe for non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients at a 90 min regimen.

The authors undertook a case-control study to examine the relationship between family and personal medical history and meningioma risk. METHODS: The authors compared the personal and first-degree family histories of 1124 patients with meningioma (age range 20-79 years) in Connecticut, Massachusetts, North Carolina, the San Francisco Bay Area, and 8 Houston counties between May 1, 2006, and February 26, 2010, and the histories of 1000 control individuals who were frequency-matched for age, sex, and geography. RESULTS: The patients were more likely than the controls to report a first-degree family history of meningioma (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.6-11.5), and there was an even stronger association in younger cases. The patients were less likely than controls to report immune conditions including allergy (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7) but were more likely to report a history of thyroid cancer (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.02-21.5) or leukemia (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.2-24.1) (most after radiotherapy). Among women, patients were more likely than controls to report hormonally related conditions--uterine fibroid tumors (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.5), endometriosis (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.5-2.1), and breast cancer (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: The influence of genetics, the immune system, and radiation near the head on meningioma risk is suggested in the authors' findings; the role of hormones is intriguing but requires further study.","['Claus, Elizabeth B', 'Calvocoressi, Lisa', 'Bondy, Melissa L', 'Schildkraut, Joellen M', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Wrensch, Margaret']","['Claus EB', 'Calvocoressi L', 'Bondy ML', 'Schildkraut JM', 'Wiemels JL', 'Wrensch M']","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520-8034, USA. elizabeth.claus@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA109473/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109468/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA151933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109468-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109745/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109461-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109475-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109473-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109745-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA108473/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/statistics & numerical data', '*Family Health', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medical History Taking/*statistics & numerical data', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Meningioma/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3241000,['NIHMS319212'],2011/07/26 06:00,2012/01/26 06:00,['2011/07/26 06:00'],"['2011/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3171/2011.6.JNS11129 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 2011 Dec;115(6):1072-7. doi: 10.3171/2011.6.JNS11129.

ATL is also believed to develop in HTLV-1 carriers who acquire infection perinatally. ATL cells have been reported to frequently harbor defective provirus. In our study, PVLs for three different regions of HTLV-1 provirus (5'LTR-gag, gag and pX) were measured in 309 asymptomatic carriers with different infection routes. PVLs for the pX region in 21 asymptomatic carriers with maternal infection was significantly higher than in 24 carriers with spousal infection. Among 161 carriers with relatively high pX PVLs (equal to or greater than 1 copy per 100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells), 26 carriers (16%) had low gag PVL/pX PVL (less than 0.5) and four (2%) had low 5'LTR-gag PVL/pX PVL (less than 0.5). Low gag PVL/pX PVL ratio, which reflects deficiency and/or polymorphism of HTLV-1 proviral DNA sequences for the gag region, was also associated with maternal infection. These data suggest that HTLV-1 carriers with maternal infection tend to have high PVLs, which may be related to provirus with deficiency and/or the polymorphism of proviral DNA sequences. In addition, there is a possibility that this ratio may be used as a tool to differentiate the infection routes of asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers, which supports the need for a large scale study.","['Ueno, Shiro', 'Umeki, Kazumi', 'Takajo, Ichiro', 'Nagatomo, Yasuhiro', 'Kusumoto, Norio', 'Umekita, Kunihiko', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Okayama, Akihiko']","['Ueno S', 'Umeki K', 'Takajo I', 'Nagatomo Y', 'Kusumoto N', 'Umekita K', 'Morishita K', 'Okayama A']","['Department of Rheumatology, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Carrier State/virology', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/*virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Viral Load']",,,2011/07/23 06:00,2012/05/05 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.26289 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2012 May 15;130(10):2318-26. doi: 10.1002/ijc.26289.

TLS is characterized by metabolic and electrolyte imbalances that include hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Identification of risk groups as well as early detection of TLS is crucial for the establishment of appropriate strategies of prophylaxis and treatment. METHODS: A review of the peer-reviewed literature on TLS between 1990 and 2011 was conducted via a systematic search of the PubMed database using the keywords ""TLS"" [AND] ""management,"" ""risk evaluation,"" ""prophylaxis,"" and ""treatment."" An expert opinion-based approach was used to review the national and international recommendations and guidelines on the topic. RESULTS: The PubMed search produced 90 results, all of which were evaluated. These studies, together with a recent international consensus panel provided recommendations for evaluating the risk of TLS and providing prophylaxis.

The p53 family proteins are involved in many important cellular functions, including tumor suppression (p53 and p73), the development of epithelial cell layers (p63), and the development of central nervous system and immune system (p73). Studies on p53-like proteins in low organisms have demonstrated that their primordial functions are to maintain the genomic integrity of germ cells and ensure faithful development and reproduction. In vertebrates, the p53 family proteins retain these functions in reproduction and at the same time have developed additional important functions in reproduction, such as the regulation of embryonic implantation (p53). p53 regulates embryonic implantation through transcriptional regulation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). p63, in particular TAp63, is a main regulator to protect the fidelity of female germ cells during meiotic arrest. p73, in particular TAp73, regulates the ovary function and the quality of oocytes. Loss of p53, p63, or p73 genes in female mice leads to a significant decrease in fertility. These functions of the p53 family proteins in reproduction provide a plausible explanation for positive evolutionary selection observed in a group of single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in the p53 family genes. A better understanding of the functions of the p53 family proteins in reproduction may lead to new strategies for fertility treatment.","['Hu, Wenwei', 'Zheng, Tongsen', 'Wang, Jiabei']","['Hu W', 'Zheng T', 'Wang J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Institute of New Jersey, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA147892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA147892-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC3135638,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/07/23 06:01,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601911408892 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601911408892 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2011 Apr;2(4):420-30. doi: 10.1177/1947601911408892.,,['NOTNLM'],"['female germ cells', 'implantation', 'p53', 'p63', 'p73']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pharmacological doses of retinoic acid relieve transcriptional repression inducing terminal differentiation/apoptosis of the leukemic blasts. APL blasts often harbor additional recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, and significantly, APL prevalence is increased in Latino populations. These observations suggest that multiple genetic and environmental/dietary factors are likely implicated in APL. We tested whether dietary or targeted chemopreventive strategies relieving PML-RARA transcriptional repression would be effective in a transgenic mouse model. Surprisingly, we found that 1) treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-azacytidine, results in a striking acceleration of APL; 2) a high fat, low folate/choline-containing diet resulted in a substantial but nonsignificant APL acceleration; and 3) all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is ineffective in preventing leukemia and results in ATRA-resistant APL. Our findings have important clinical implications because ATRA is a drug of choice for APL treatment and indicate that global demethylation, whether through dietary manipulations or through the use of a pharmacologic agent such as 5-azacytidine, may have unintended and detrimental consequences in chemopreventive regimens.","['Scaglioni, Pier Paolo', 'Cai, Lu Fan', 'Majid, Samia M', 'Yung, Thomas M', 'Socci, Nicholas D', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Kopelovich, Levy', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo']","['Scaglioni PP', 'Cai LF', 'Majid SM', 'Yung TM', 'Socci ND', 'Kogan SC', 'Kopelovich L', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['N01CN25122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA071692/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA071692-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA112325/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC3111249,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/07/23 06:01,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601911410300 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601911410300 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2011 Feb;2(2):160-5. doi: 10.1177/1947601911410300.,,['NOTNLM'],"['5-azacytidine', 'APL', 'ATRA', 'Western diet', 'chemoprevention']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has long been recognized that AML is a clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by a multitude of chromosomal abnormalities and gene mutations, which translate to marked differences in responses and survival following chemotherapy. The cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations associated with AML are not mutually exclusive and often coexist in the leukemic cells. AML is a disease of the elderly, with a mean age of diagnosis of 70 years. Adverse cytogenetic abnormalities increase with age, and within each cytogenetic group, prognosis with standard treatment worsens with age. In the past 20 years, there has been little improvement in chemotherapeutic regimens and hence the overall survival for patients with AML. A huge unmet need exists for efficacious targeted therapies for elderly patients that are less toxic than available chemotherapy regimens. The multitude of chromosomal and genetic abnormalities makes the treatment of AML a challenging prospect. A detailed understanding of the molecular changes associated with the chromosomal and genetic abnormalities in AML is likely to provide a rationale for therapy design and biomarker development.

Interestingly, although less studied, PML seems to play a key role also in immune response to viral infection. Herein, we report that Pml(-/-) mice spontaneously develop an atypical invasive and lethal granulomatous lesion known as botryomycosis (BTM). In Pml(-/-) mice, BTM is the result of impaired function of macrophages, whereby they fail to become activated and are thus unable to clear pathogenic microorganisms. Accordingly, Pml(-/-) mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock as a result of an ineffective production of cytokines and chemokines, suggesting a role for PML in the innate immune Toll-like receptor (TLR)/NF-kappaB prosurvival pathway.

The process is regulated by a number of transcription factors that regulate the differentiation along the distinct lineages and dictate the genetic program that defines each mature phenotype. Myc was first discovered as the oncogene of avian leukemogenic retroviruses; it was later found translocated in human lymphoma. From then on, evidence accumulated showing that c-Myc is one of the transcription factors playing a major role in hematopoiesis. The study of genetically modified mice with overexpression or deletion of Myc has shown that c-Myc is required for the correct balance between self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Enforced Myc expression in mice leads to reduced HSC pools owing to loss of self-renewal activity at the expense of increased proliferation of progenitor cells and differentiation. c-Myc deficiency consistently results in the accumulation of HSCs. Other models with conditional Myc deletion have demonstrated that different lineages of hematopoietic cells differ in their requirement for c-Myc to regulate their proliferation and differentiation. When transgenic mice overexpress c-Myc or N-Myc in mature cells from the lymphoid or myeloid lineages, the result is lymphoma or leukemia. In agreement, enforced expression of c-Myc blocks the differentiation in several leukemia-derived cell lines capable of differentiating in culture. Not surprising, MYC deregulation is recurrently found in many types of human lymphoma and leukemia. Whereas MYC is deregulated by translocation in Burkitt lymphoma and, less frequently, other types of lymphoma, MYC is frequently overexpressed in acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia, through mechanisms unrelated to chromosomal translocation, and is often associated with disease progression.","['Delgado, M Dolores', 'Leon, Javier']","['Delgado MD', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina and Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Universidad de Cantabria-CSIC, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC3092227,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/07/23 06:01,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601910377495 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601910377495 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2010 Jun;1(6):605-16. doi: 10.1177/1947601910377495.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Myc', 'differentiation', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most tumors require many mutations to explain the cancer phenotype, making it difficult to identify the gene(s) that confer the reproductive fitness to the clone. Moreover, the impact of any oncogene is context dependent: it can increase the fitness of particular stages of cell differentiation but not other stages. In addition, the fitness advantage of an oncogene is not irreversible: sometimes it can be reversed with targeted therapy, for example. The understanding of these dynamical processes and their consequences may be greatly simplified when addressed from an evolutionary perspective. Using the dynamics of chronic myeloid leukemia-perhaps the best understood human neoplasm-as an example, we show how three fundamental evolutionary behaviors provide insights into the dynamics of this disease: (1) BCR-ABL does not affect the reproductive success of any cell within the stem cell pool (resulting therefore in neutral drift), (2) BCR-ABL expression gives a fitness (selective) advantage to progenitor cells, and (3) imatinib therapy reduces the fitness of progenitor cells expressing the oncogene (selective disadvantage) and consequently leads to significant reductions in disease burden. These three different evolutionary dynamics scenarios based on the interpretation of mutation and gene expression as potentially leading to a fitness imbalance of cell populations clearly explain the course of the disease, providing as such a better grasp of cancer dynamics and the role of related therapies.","['Dingli, David', 'Traulsen, Arne', 'Lenaerts, Tom', 'Pacheco, Jorge M']","['Dingli D', 'Traulsen A', 'Lenaerts T', 'Pacheco JM']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC3092198,,2010/04/01 00:00,2010/04/01 00:01,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601910371122 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601910371122 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2010 Apr;1(4):309-15. doi: 10.1177/1947601910371122.,,['NOTNLM'],"['clonal expansion', 'mutant fitness', 'oncogenes', 'selection', 'small-molecule inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The small molecule inhibitor, PKC412, targets mutant FLT3 and is currently in late-stage clinical trials. However, the identification of PKC412-resistant leukemic blast cells in the bone marrow of AML patients has propelled the development of novel and structurally distinct FLT3 inhibitors that have the potential to override drug resistance and more efficiently prevent disease progression or recurrence. Here, we present the novel first-generation ""type II"" FLT3 inhibitors, AFG206, AFG210, and AHL196, and the second-generation ""type II"" derivatives and AST487 analogs, AUZ454 and ATH686. All agents potently and selectively target mutant FLT3 protein kinase activity and inhibit the proliferation of cells harboring FLT3 mutants via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition. Cross-resistance between ""type I"" inhibitors, PKC412 and AAE871, was demonstrated. While cross-resistance was also observed between ""type I"" and first-generation ""type II"" FLT3 inhibitors, the high potency of the second-generation ""type II"" inhibitors was sufficient to potently kill ""type I"" inhibitor-resistant mutant FLT3-expressing cells. The increased potency observed for the second-generation ""type II"" inhibitors was observed to be due to an improved interaction with the ATP pocket of FLT3, specifically associated with introduction of a piperazine moiety and placement of an amino group in position 2 of the pyrimidine ring. Thus, we present 2 structurally novel classes of FLT3 inhibitors characterized by high selectivity and potency toward mutant FLT3 as a molecular target. In addition, presentation of the antileukemic effects of ""type II"" inhibitors, such as AUZ454 and ATH686, highlights a new class of highly potent FLT3 inhibitors able to override drug resistance that less potent ""type I"" inhibitors and ""type II"" first-generation FLT3 inhibitors cannot.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Roesel, Johannes', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Bold, Guido', 'Imbach, Patricia', 'Florsheimer, Andreas', 'Caravatti, Georgio', 'Jiang, Jingrui', 'Manley, Paul', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Roesel J', 'Furet P', 'Bold G', 'Imbach P', 'Florsheimer A', 'Caravatti G', 'Jiang J', 'Manley P', 'Ray A', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematologic Neoplasia, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R37 CA036167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036167-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,PMC3092267,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/07/23 06:01,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2010/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1947601910396505 [doi]', '10.1177_1947601910396505 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2010 Oct;1(10):1021-32. doi: 10.1177/1947601910396505.,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'drug potency', 'drug resistance', 'leukemia', 'neoplasia', 'structure affinity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODOLOGY: In this study, we have assessed global transcript expression in E-cadherin null (Ecad-/-) ES cells cultured in either the presence or absence of LIF and compared these to the parental cell line wtD3. RESULTS: We show that LIF has little effect on the transcript profile of Ecad-/- ES cells, with statistically significant transcript alterations observed only for Sp8 and Stat3. Comparison of Ecad-/- and wtD3 ES cells cultured in LIF demonstrated significant alterations in the transcript profile, with effects not only confined to cell adhesion and motility but also affecting, for example, primary metabolic processes, catabolism and genes associated with apoptosis. Ecad-/- ES cells share similar, although not identical, gene expression profiles to epiblast-derived pluripotent stem cells, suggesting that E-cadherin expression may inhibit inner cell mass to epiblast transition. We further show that Ecad-/- ES cells maintain a functional beta-catenin pool that is able to induce beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transactivation but, contrary to previous findings, do not display endogenous beta-catenin/TCF-mediated transactivation. We conclude that loss of E-cadherin in mouse ES cells leads to significant transcript alterations independently of beta-catenin/TCF transactivation.","['Soncin, Francesca', 'Mohamet, Lisa', 'Ritson, Sarah', 'Hawkins, Kate', 'Bobola, Nicoletta', 'Zeef, Leo', 'Merry, Catherine L R', 'Ward, Christopher M']","['Soncin F', 'Mohamet L', 'Ritson S', 'Hawkins K', 'Bobola N', 'Zeef L', 'Merry CL', 'Ward CM']","['Core Technology Facility, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['BB/E017355/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadherins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/genetics']",PMC3136471,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0021463 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-00989 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e21463. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021463.

We report that the SUMO interaction motifs of PML, Sp100 and hDaxx are required for recruitment of these repressive proteins to HSV-1 induced foci, which also contain SUMO conjugates and PIAS2beta, a SUMO E3 ligase. SUMO modification of PML and elements of its tripartite motif (TRIM) are also required for recruitment in cells lacking endogenous PML. Mutants of PML isoform I and hDaxx that are not recruited to virus induced foci are unable to reproduce the repression of ICP0 null mutant HSV-1 infection mediated by their wild type counterparts.

In this study we used conditional onco-ALK (NPM-ALK and TPM3-ALK) mouse MEF cell lines (ALK+ fibroblasts) and transgenic models (ALK+ B-lymphoma) to investigate the involvement and regulation of angiogenesis in ALK tumor development. First, we observed that ALK expression leads to downregulation of miR-16 and increased Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels. Second, we found that modification of miR-16 levels in TPM3-ALK MEF cells greatly affected VEGF levels. Third, we demonstrated that miR-16 directly interacts with VEGF mRNA at the 3'-untranslated region and that the regulation of VEGF by miR-16 occurs at the translational level. Fourth, we showed that expression of both the ALK oncogene and hypoxia-induced factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) is a prerequisite for miR-16 downregulation.

This study focuses on these compounds and compares their abilities to affect the DNA and viability of cells in culture, but also their potencies to chemically oxidise the DNA nucleoside deoxyguanosine (dG). To study the vitamins' strict chemical oxidation potencies, dG was exposed to vitamin solution and the amount of the oxidation product 8'-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) formed was estimated using a high-performance liquid chromatography system with electrochemical and ultraviolet detection. The vitamin's ability to cause DNA damage to promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL-60), as detected by strand breaks, alkaline labile sites and formamido pyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG)-sensitive sites was, after vitamin exposure, measured using the comet assay and cytotoxicity was estimated using trypan blue staining. The results highlight that vitamin A and C compounds found in supplements do have different properties, chemically as well as in a cellular system. Among the vitamin C compounds, ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate stood out causing both oxidation to dG and cytotoxicity to cells. The vitamin A compounds retinol, retinyl acetate and retinal (a breakdown product found in vivo) caused oxidation of dG, while retinal was the only compound causing cytotoxicity, giving rise to an almost complete cell death. beta-carotene caused, as the only vitamin compound, a small increase in FPG-sensitive sites. It is concluded that even though the compounds are found under the same name (vitamin A or C), they do have different properties linked to oxidation, cytotoxicity and DNA damage.","['Bergstrom, Therese', 'Bergman, Jan', 'Moller, Lennart']","['Bergstrom T', 'Bergman J', 'Moller L']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, SE-141 83 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.2.2.23 (DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Ascorbic Acid/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/*metabolism', '*Dietary Supplements', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Vitamin A/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,2011/07/23 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['ger041 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/ger041 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2011 Nov;26(6):735-44. doi: 10.1093/mutage/ger041.

However, there is long-standing concern that these lengthy and complex documents are not fit-for-purpose. This has been supported recently through the application of a performance-based approach to testing and improving readability called user testing. This method is now widely used to improve patient medicine leaflets--determining whether people can find and understand key facts. This study applied for the first time a controlled design to determine whether a PIS developed through user testing had improved readability over the original, using a sheet from a UK trial in acute myeloid leukemia (AML16). METHODS: In the first phase the performance of the original PIS was tested on people in the target group for the trial. There were three rounds of testing including 50 people in total--with the information revised according to its performance after each of the first 2 rounds. In the second phase, the revised PIS was compared with the original in a parallel groups randomised controlled trial (RCT) A total of 123 participants were recruited and randomly allocated to read one version of the PIS to find and show understanding of 21 key facts. RESULTS: The first, developmental phase produced a revised PIS significantly altered in its wording and layout. In the second, trial phase 66% of participants who read the revised PIS were able to show understanding of all aspects of the trial, compared with 15% of those reading the original version (Odds Ratio 11.2; Chi-square = 31.5 p < .001). When asked to state a preference, 87.1% participants chose the revised PIS (Sign test p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The original PIS for the AML16 trial may not have enabled valid consent. Combining performance-based user testing with expertise in writing for patients and information design led to a significantly improved and preferred information sheet. User testing is an efficient method for indicating strengths and weaknesses in trial information, and Research Ethics Committees and Institutional Review Boards should consider requesting such testing, to ensure that PIS are fit-for-purpose.","['Knapp, Peter', 'Raynor, David K', 'Silcock, Jonathan', 'Parkinson, Brian']","['Knapp P', 'Raynor DK', 'Silcock J', 'Parkinson B']","['Department of Health Sciences, University of York, UK. peter.knapp@york.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med,BMC medicine,101190723,,IM,"['Aged', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Comprehension', 'Consent Forms/*standards', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'United Kingdom']",PMC3152894,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['1741-7015-9-89 [pii]', '10.1186/1741-7015-9-89 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med. 2011 Jul 21;9:89. doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-9-89.,20110721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stromal cells alone did not augment Luc activity, taken as an index of NF-kappaB, but Luc activity was synergistically upregulated by the combination of stromal cells and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB DNA binding, rapidly induced the apoptosis of Ph+ALL cells, indicating that NF-kappaB is necessary for the growth and survival of these cells. However, the DHMEQ-induced suppression of NF-kappaB activity and the apoptosis of leukemia cells were attenuated by the presence of stromal cells and TNF-alpha. In NOD-SCID mice transplanted with NF-kappaB/Luc reporter-containing Ph+ALL cell lines and monitored periodically during the progression of the leukemia, murine TNF-alpha was significantly expressed in lesions in which the leukemia cells emitted a significant NF-kappaB signal. These results support the notion that TNF-alpha also triggers microenvironmental upregulation of NF-kappaB activity in vivo. Collectively, the results indicated that TNF-alpha-stimulated microenvironment may contribute to the survival and progression of Ph+ALL cells through the synergistic upregulation of NF-kappaB activity.","['Tsai, Hui-Jen', 'Kobayashi, Seiichiro', 'Izawa, Kiyoko', 'Ishida, Takaomi', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Umezawa, Kazuo', 'Lin, Sheng-Fung', 'Tojo, Arinobu']","['Tsai HJ', 'Kobayashi S', 'Izawa K', 'Ishida T', 'Watanabe T', 'Umezawa K', 'Lin SF', 'Tojo A']","['Division of Molecular Therapy, Advanced Clinical Research Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cyclohexanones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cyclohexanones/pharmacology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/physiology', 'Transgenes', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*pharmacology']",,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/12/20 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02039.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Nov;102(11):2014-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02039.x.

Pim kinases are critical downstream effectors of the ABL (ableson), JAK2 (janus kinase 2), and Flt-3 (FMS related tyrosine kinase 1) oncogenes and are required by them to drive tumorigenesis. Recent investigations have established that the Pim kinases function as effective inhibitors of apoptosis and when overexpressed, produce resistance to the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, rapamycin . Overexpression of the PIM kinases has been reported in several hematological and solid tumors (PIM 1), myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia (PIM 2) and adenocarcinomas (PIM 3). As such, the Pim kinases are a very attractive target for pharmacological inhibition in cancer therapy. Novel small molecule inhibitors of the human Pim kinases have been designed and are currently undergoing preclinical evaluation.","['Swords, Ronan', 'Kelly, Kevin', 'Carew, Jennifer', 'Nawrocki, Stefan', 'Mahalingam, Devalingam', 'Sarantopoulos, John', 'Bearss, David', 'Giles, Francis']","['Swords R', 'Kelly K', 'Carew J', 'Nawrocki S', 'Mahalingam D', 'Sarantopoulos J', 'Bearss D', 'Giles F']","['Cancer Therapy and Research Center, Institute for Drug Development, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, 7979 Wurzbach Road, San Antonio, TX 78229, USA. swordsr@uthscsa.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Targets,Current drug targets,100960531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (SGI 1776)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (proto-oncogene proteins pim)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/physiology', 'Pyridazines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2011/07/23 06:00,2012/06/12 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2010/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2010/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2010/04/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/12 06:00 [medline]']","['BSP/CDT/E-Pub/00337 [pii]', '10.2174/138945011798829447 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Targets. 2011 Dec;12(14):2059-66. doi: 10.2174/138945011798829447.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, cytotoxic effects of flavones (apigenin and luteolin) on two different cancer cell lines, including human chronic myelogenous erythroleukaemia (K562) and bladder carcinoma (RT112), were determined, and the molecular mechanisms responsible for their cytotoxic effects were studied. The results of an MTT assay showed that luteolin and apigenin were able to induce cytotoxicity in K562 and RT112 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cytotoxic potency of luteolin was higher than that of apigenin. Flow-cytometry and DNA-fragmentation analysis indicated that the cytotoxicity induced by luteolin and apigenin was mainly due to apoptosis, with minor cell-cycle perturbations. This apoptotic response was characterized by an increase of the sub-G1 fraction of treated cells, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase proteolysis, typical ladder of DNA fragmentation, and Annexin V-positive cells. In conclusion, luteolin and apigenin exert cytotoxic effects in different cancer cell lines in which apoptosis plays an important role. Thus, flavones could be considered as potential chemotherapeutic agents.","['Kilani-Jaziri, Soumaya', 'Frachet, Veronique', 'Bhouri, Wissem', 'Ghedira, Kamel', 'Chekir-Ghedira, Leila', 'Ronot, Xavier']","['Kilani-Jaziri S', 'Frachet V', 'Bhouri W', 'Ghedira K', 'Chekir-Ghedira L', 'Ronot X']","['Unite de Pharmacognosie/Biologie Moleculaire 99/UR/07-03 , Faculte de Pharmacie de Monastir, Monastir, Tunisie.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apigenin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Luteolin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,2011/07/23 06:00,2012/04/06 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01480545.2011.564180 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2012 Jan;35(1):1-10. doi: 10.3109/01480545.2011.564180.

Defining prognostic parameters potentiating division of patients in groups with favorable and unfavorable prognosis which could help the benefit assessment of early treatment, improve treatment effects, and potentiate treatment modification for each patient. AIM: To analyze the bone-marrow (BM) pattern and immunophenotypic score at diagnosis of B-CLL and determine the correlation of BM pattern with the clinical stage of disease and immunophenotypic score. METHODS: A sample of 40 untreated patients with B-CLL was divided into two groups: group with clinical stage Binet A and group with clinical stages Binet B and Binet C. BM patterns were observed as a diffuse, interstitial, nodular and mixed. BM immunophenotyping included CD5, CD23, CD22, and CD20 as an indirect indicator of FMC7. RESULTS: The overall sample mean age was 62.88 years +/- 11.10, without significant difference in the age of two compared groups (63.15 +/- 10.53 years vs. 62.60 +/- 11.50 years) (t = 0.16, df= 38, p = 0.88). Proportion of men was significantly higher in stages Binet B and C (12/20) compared to stage Binet A (5/20) (Z=2.24, p=0.025). The percentage of women was higher than men in Binet A stage (75% vs. 25%). The BM patterns in Binet A stage were observed as follows: mixed 50% (10/20), interstitial 30% (6/20), nodular 15% (3/20) and diffuse 5% (1/20). The BM patterns in Binet B and C stages were observed as follows: diffuse 50% (10/20), mixed 40% (8/20), interstitial 5% (1/20) and nodular 5% (1/20). Clinical stage and the BM patterns were significantly associated (c2=8.02, p=0,005). The chance for non-diffuse patterns was 19 times higher in stage Binet A compared to stages Binet B and C, respectively, analyzing 95% CI at least 2 times higher (95% CI: 2.02-866.6). Immunophenotypic score in total sample was observed as follows: score 4: 5% (2/40), score 3: 72.5% (29/40), score 2: 20% (8/40) and score 1: 2,5% (1/40). Immunophenotypic score 3 and > 3 had 77.5% of patients (31/40), but there was no significant association between the immunophenotypic score and the BM patterns (c2=0.76, p=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: Diffuse BM pattern was significantly associated with the clinical stages Binet B and C, compared to non-diffuse BM patterns which were significantly associated with the clinical stage Binet A. Diffuse BM pattern represent the parameter of progressive disease compared to the non-diffuse BM patterns which are more often represented in stable disease. Immunophenotypic score improves diagnostic accuracy of B-CLL, but should not be used as a prognostic parameter of B -CLL.","['Jahic, Azra', 'Iljazovic, Ermina', 'Arnautovic-Custovic, Aida', 'Halilbasic, Alma', 'Simendic, Vlastimir', 'Zabic, Aida']","['Jahic A', 'Iljazovic E', 'Arnautovic-Custovic A', 'Halilbasic A', 'Simendic V', 'Zabic A']","['Department of Hematology, Clinic for Oncology, Hematology and Radiotherapy, University Clinical Center Tuzla, 75000 Tzla, Tlrnovac b.b., Bosnia and Herzegovina. azrasong1@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Bosnia and Herzegovina,Med Arh,Medicinski arhiv,0400722,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5455/medarh.2011.65.132-136 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Arh. 2011;65(3):132-6. doi: 10.5455/medarh.2011.65.132-136.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD45 is stably expressed on all leukocytes and their precursors, and therefore the liver and spleen constitute major antigen sinks. Thus, as the red marrow is the target organ, in radioimmunotherapy with anti-CD45 antibody, preloading with unlabeled antibody is a method to increase the absorbed dose to the target cells. In a previous study, a method to individually determine the optimal preload for five patients with acute leukemia was developed. Here, this method is examined and improved using two pretherapeutic measurement series and a refined pharmacokinetic model. METHODS: To obtain the biodistribution of 111In-labeled anti-CD45 antibody under different saturation conditions, two measurement series one with and one without preloading were conducted in five patients. For each patient, two physiologically based pharmacokinetic models were fitted to the data and the corrected Akaike information criterion was used to identify the model, which was empirically most supported. The resultant parameter values were compared to values reported in the literature. To individually determine the optimal amount of unlabeled antibody for therapy, computer simulations for preloads ranging from 0 to 60 mg were performed based on the estimated parameters of each patient. The prediction power of the model was assessed by comparing the simulated therapeutic serum curves to the actual 90Y measurements. RESULTS: Visual inspection showed good fits and the adjusted R2 was >0.90 for all patients. All parameters were in a physiologically reasonable range. The relative deviation of the predicted area under the therapeutic serum curve and the measured curve was 15%-33%. The optimal preloading increased the marrow-over-liver selectivity up to 3.9 fold compared to the simulated biodistribution using a standard dose (0.5 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: The presented method can be used to individually determine the optimal preload and the corresponding residence times in radioimmunotherapy with anti-CD45 antibody.","['Kletting, Peter', 'Kull, Thomas', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Luster, M', 'Reske, Sven N', 'Glatting, Gerhard']","['Kletting P', 'Kull T', 'Bunjes D', 'Luster M', 'Reske SN', 'Glatting G']","['Klinik fur Nuklearmedizin, Universitat Ulm, D-89070 Ulm, Germany. peter.kletting@uniklinik-ulm.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Models, Biological', 'Premedication/*methods', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/23 06:00,2011/08/24 06:00,['2011/07/23 06:00'],"['2011/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1118/1.3581059 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Phys. 2011 May;38(5):2572-8. doi: 10.1118/1.3581059.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through their role in both innate and adaptive immunity, DCs play a major part in transplant engraftment and rejection and in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Preferentially tolerogenic or immunogenic DC subtypes offer targets for immunotherapy, to optimize transplant success rates and prolong disease-free and overall survival. Cord blood DCs are immature and preferentially tolerogenic, due to maternal-fetal tolerance, leading to better graft acceptance and immune reconstitution and explaining the lower incidence and severity of GvHD in CB transplantation, despite donor-host mismatching. Manipulation of DC maturation and cell loading with tumor-antigens can direct antitumor immunity and target minimal residual disease, as demonstrated for acute myeloid leukemia, optimizing the graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Pereira, Marta Isabel', 'Paiva, Artur']","['Pereira MI', 'Paiva A']","['Clinical Hematology Department, Coimbra University Hospitals, Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Stem Cells Int,Stem cells international,101535822,,,,PMC3137980,,2011/07/22 06:00,2011/07/22 06:01,['2011/07/22 06:00'],"['2011/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/22 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4061/2011/539896 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Int. 2011;2011:539896. doi: 10.4061/2011/539896.

METHODS: The mortality and cancer incidence 1972-2006 experienced by a cohort of 2,171 male and female workers employed for at least one year in two plants producing medical equipment sterilised with EtO were investigated. Individual cumulative exposure to EtO was assessed by occupational hygienists. Cause-specific standardized rate ratios were calculated using the regional general population as a comparison for mortality (SMR) and cancer incidence (SIR). Internal Poisson-regression analyses were performed for selected causes. RESULTS: The median cumulative exposure to EtO was 0.13 ppm-years. The overall cancer incidence was close to unity (SIR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.08). Eighteen cases of lymphohaematopoietic cancer were observed (SIR 1.25, 95% CI 0.74-1.98). A healthy worker effect was indicated from a significantly decreased overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Internal analyses found significantly increased rate ratios for breast cancer for the two upper quartiles of cumulative exposure as compared to the lowest 50% of the cohort (IRR 2.76, 95% CI 1.20-6.33 and IRR 3.55, 95% CI 1.58-7.93).

Wogonin has been shown to induce apoptosis in different cancer cells and to suppress growth of human cancer xenografts in vivo. However, its direct targets remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that wogonin and structurally related natural flavones, for example, apigenin, chrysin and luteolin, are inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) and block phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II at Ser(2). This effect leads to reduced RNA synthesis and subsequently rapid downregulation of the short-lived anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) resulting in apoptosis induction in cancer cells. We show that genetic inhibition of Mcl-1 or CDK9 expression by siRNA is sufficient to mimic flavone-induced apoptosis. Pull-down and in silico docking studies demonstrate that wogonin directly binds to CDK9, presumably to the ATP-binding pocket. In contrast, wogonin does not inhibit CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 at doses that inhibit CDK9 activity. Furthermore, we show that wogonin preferentially inhibits CDK9 in malignant compared with normal lymphocytes. Thus, our study reveals a new mechanism of anti-cancer action of natural flavones and supports CDK9 as a therapeutic target in oncology.","['Polier, G', 'Ding, J', 'Konkimalla, B V', 'Eick, D', 'Ribeiro, N', 'Kohler, R', 'Giaisi, M', 'Efferth, T', 'Desaubry, L', 'Krammer, P H', 'Li-Weber, M']","['Polier G', 'Ding J', 'Konkimalla BV', 'Eick D', 'Ribeiro N', 'Kohler R', 'Giaisi M', 'Efferth T', 'Desaubry L', 'Krammer PH', 'Li-Weber M']","['Tumor Immunology Program (D030), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Flavanones/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Flavones/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Scutellaria baicalensis/chemistry', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3199715,,2011/07/22 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/22 06:00'],"['2011/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['cddis201166 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2011.66 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2011 Jul 21;2:e182. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2011.66.,20110721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought that targeting these self-renewing cells for destruction will block tumor progression and stop relapse, greatly improving patient prognosis. The most common way to determine the frequency of self-renewing cells within a tumor is a limiting dilution cell transplantation assay, in which tumor cells are transplanted into recipient animals at increasing doses; the proportion of animals that develop tumors is used the calculate the number of self-renewing cells within the original tumor sample. Ideally, a large number of animals would be used in each limiting dilution experiment to accurately determine the frequency of tumor-propagating cells. However, large scale experiments involving mice are costly, and most limiting dilution assays use only 10-15 mice per experiment. Zebrafish have gained prominence as a cancer model, in large part due to their ease of genetic manipulation and the economy by which large scale experiments can be performed. Additionally, the cancer types modeled in zebrafish have been found to closely mimic their counterpart human disease. While it is possible to transplant tumor cells from one fish to another by sub-lethal irradiation of recipient animals, the regeneration of the immune system after 21 days often causes tumor regression. The recent creation of syngeneic zebrafish has greatly facilitated tumor transplantation studies. Because these animals are genetically identical, transplanted tumor cells engraft robustly into recipient fish, and tumor growth can be monitored over long periods of time. Syngeneic zebrafish are ideal for limiting dilution transplantation assays in that tumor cells do not have to adapt to growth in a foreign microenvironment, which may underestimate self-renewing cell frequency. Additionally, one-cell transplants have been successfully completed using syngeneic zebrafish and several hundred animals can be easily and economically transplanted at one time, both of which serve to provide a more accurate estimate of self-renewing cell frequency. Here, a method is presented for creating primary, fluorescently-labeled T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in syngeneic zebrafish, and transplanting these tumors at limiting dilution into adult fish to determine self-renewing cell frequency. While leukemia is provided as an example, this protocol is suitable to determine the frequency of tumor-propagating cells using any cancer model in the zebrafish.","['Blackburn, Jessica S', 'Liu, Sali', 'Langenau, David M']","['Blackburn JS', 'Liu S', 'Langenau DM']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, USA.']",['eng'],"['5T32CA09216-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '3 K01 AR055619-03S1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 AR055619-01A1/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 AR055619/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA/administration & dosage/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Microinjections', 'Neoplasm Transplantation/*methods', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Zebrafish']",PMC3196193,,2011/07/22 06:00,2012/04/19 06:00,['2011/07/22 06:00'],"['2011/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['2790 [pii]', '10.3791/2790 [doi]']",epublish,J Vis Exp. 2011 Jul 14;(53):e2790. doi: 10.3791/2790.,20110714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESEARCH TOPICS: The Childcare Database comprises individually linked Danish register-based data on childcare attendance, childcare facility characteristics, child and family characteristics, and infectious disease hospitalisations. The database includes about 1 million children aged 0-5 years and has, since the creation, been linked with separate disease registers on atopic disease, pneumococcal disease, and childhood cancers. The present paper is a review of epidemiological studies based on the Childcare Database. Studies of childhood infections confirmed that childcare attendance dramatically increases the risk, but emphasised that the increased risk is often transient and confined to subsets of children. Studies of childhood cancers showed that early childhood infections are likely to reduce the risk of childhood leukaemia and that this risk reduction applies to all children. CONCLUSION: The Childcare Database is a unique data source for studying the association between childcare attendance and health outcomes. Further linkage with Danish registers is possible on an individual level. The studies based on the Childcare Database confirm and extend previous findings of an increased risk of infection associated with childcare attendance, as well as point towards a possible protective role of early infections in childhood cancer.","['Kamper-Jorgensen, Mads', 'Benn, Christine Stabell', 'Wohlfahrt, Jan']","['Kamper-Jorgensen M', 'Benn CS', 'Wohlfahrt J']","['Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. maka@sund.ku.dk']",['eng'],['243149/European Research Council/International'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Sweden,Scand J Public Health,Scandinavian journal of public health,100883503,,IM,"['*Child Day Care Centers', '*Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Registries/standards', 'Risk Factors']",,,2011/08/04 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/07/22 06:00'],"['2011/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['39/7_suppl/126 [pii]', '10.1177/1403494810395826 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Public Health. 2011 Jul;39(7 Suppl):126-30. doi: 10.1177/1403494810395826.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the machine learning methods that have been applied to significant gene selection focus on the classification ability rather than the selection ability of the method. These methods also require the microarray data to be preprocessed before analysis takes place. The objective of this study is to develop a hybrid genetic algorithm-neural network (GANN) model that emphasises feature selection and can operate on unpreprocessed microarray data. METHOD: The GANN is a hybrid model where the fitness value of the genetic algorithm (GA) is based upon the number of samples correctly labelled by a standard feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). The model is evaluated by using two benchmark microarray datasets with different array platforms and differing number of classes (a 2-class oligonucleotide microarray data for acute leukaemia and a 4-class complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray dataset for SRBCTs (small round blue cell tumours)). The underlying concept of the GANN algorithm is to select highly informative genes by co-evolving both the GA fitness function and the ANN weights at the same time. RESULTS: The novel GANN selected approximately 50% of the same genes as the original studies. This may indicate that these common genes are more biologically significant than other genes in the datasets. The remaining 50% of the significant genes identified were used to build predictive models and for both datasets, the models based on the set of genes extracted by the GANN method produced more accurate results. The results also suggest that the GANN method not only can detect genes that are exclusively associated with a single cancer type but can also explore the genes that are differentially expressed in multiple cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the GANN model has successfully extracted statistically significant genes from the unpreprocessed microarray data as well as extracting known biologically significant genes. We also show that assessing the biological significance of genes based on classification accuracy may be misleading and though the GANN's set of extra genes prove to be more statistically significant than those selected by other methods, a biological assessment of these genes is highly recommended to confirm their functionality.","['Tong, Dong Ling', 'Schierz, Amanda C']","['Tong DL', 'Schierz AC']","['The John van Geest Cancer Research Centre, School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University, UK. dong.tong@ntu.ac.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",,,2011/07/22 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['S0933-3657(11)00092-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.artmed.2011.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 2011 Sep;53(1):47-56. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2011.06.008.

The potential influence of As(2)O(3) on cytotoxicity was examined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay and the intracellular mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Adriamycin (ADM) was examined by flow cytometry. The gene expression of mdr1 mRNA was determined by RT-PCR. The change of cellular expression levels of drug resistant-related proteins, including P-gp, bcl-2, Topo-II, and GST-pi, were measured by Western-blotting or immunocytochemistry assay. Data showed As(2)O(3) at non-cytotoxic concentration (2muM) significantly increased the cytotoxicity of ADM on K562/A02 cells. Cotreatment of As(2)O(3) and ADM significantly increased the ADM MFI than ADM alone (P<0.01). Following pretreatment of K562/A02 cells with As(2)O(3), the expression of Topo-II was increased while the expression of GST-pi and bcl-2 was decreased. No obvious alternation of expression of mdr1 mRNA or P-gp was observed. Thus, low dose As(2)O(3) partially reduced drug resistance to ADM in K562/A02 cells via multiple mechanisms, which selectively inhibited the efflux pump GST-pi but not P-gp, as well as modulated the expression of MDR-related proteins such as Topo-II and bcl-2, in line with previous studies. In conclusions: The effect of As(2)O(3) on reducing MDR may have wide clinical application in chemotherapy regimens for leukemia.","['Zhao, Dianfeng', 'Jiang, Yanfang', 'Dong, Xiaoyan', 'Liu, Ziling', 'Qu, Beibei', 'Zhang, Yongfeng', 'Ma, Ning', 'Han, Qingkun']","['Zhao D', 'Jiang Y', 'Dong X', 'Liu Z', 'Qu B', 'Zhang Y', 'Ma N', 'Han Q']","['Department of Hematologic Neoplasms, the First Affiliated Hospital, Jilin University, 71 Xinmin Avenue, Changchun, 130021, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2011/07/22 06:00,2012/01/26 06:00,['2011/07/22 06:00'],"['2010/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0753-3322(11)00055-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2011 Aug;65(5):354-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2011.04.016.

Minimal residual disease was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with homo/heteroduplex analysis using consensus primers to IgH and TCR genes. MRD in the CSF at diagnosis was detected by PCR in 46.8% of children with no puncture accident or morphological involvement. In patients treated with GBTLI-ALL-93 a significantly lower 5-year event-free survival (EFS) was demonstrated for those with CSF involvement, in univariate (p = 0.01) and multivariate (p = 0.04) analysis. This observation was not true for patients treated with the more intensive protocol GBTLI-ALL-99 (p = 0.81).

We have established a stable CCN3 expression model in the human K562 CML cell line and have further validated the role for CCN3 in the leukaemogenic process. K562 cells stably transfected with CCN3 (K562/CCN3; 2.25 x 10(6) copies per 50 ng cDNA) demonstrated over 50% reduction in cell growth in comparison to cells stably transfected with empty vector (K562/control; p = 0.005). K562/CCN3 cells had reduced colony formation capacity (reduced by 29.7%, p = 0.03) and reduced mitogenic signalling in comparison to K562/control cells (reduced by 29.5% (p = 0.002) and 37.4% (p = 0.017) for phosphorylation levels of ERK and AKT respectively). K562/CCN3 cells showed an accumulation of events within the subG(0) phase of the cell cycle and increased apoptosis was confirmed by a three-fold increase in annexin V binding (p < 0.05). K562/CCN3 cells exposed to Imatinib (1 muM and 5 muM) showed an increase in events within the subG(0) phase of cell cycle over 96 h and mirrored the enhanced cell kill demonstrated by Annexin staining. Wild type K562 cells treated with recombinant human Ccn3 (10 nM) in combination with Imatinib (5 muM) also displayed enhanced cell kill (p = 0.008). K562/CCN3 cells displayed increased adhesion to matrigel (2.92 +/- 0.52 fold increase compared to K562/control) which was commensurate with increased expression of the alpha 6 and beta 4 integrins (6.53 +/- 0.47 and 1.94 +/- 0.07 fold increase in gene expression respectively (n = 3, p < 0.05)). CCN3 restores cellular growth regulatory properties that are absent in CML and sensitises CML cells to imatinib induced apoptosis. CCN3 may provide novel avenues for the development of alternate therapeutic strategies.","['McCallum, Lynn', 'Lu, Wanhua', 'Price, Susan', 'Lazar, Noureddine', 'Perbal, Bernard', 'Irvine, Alexandra E']","['McCallum L', 'Lu W', 'Price S', 'Lazar N', 'Perbal B', 'Irvine AE']","['School of Biomedical and Biological Sciences, Portland Square, University of Plymouth, Drake Circus, Plymouth, PL4 8AA, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Cell Commun Signal,Journal of cell communication and signaling,101308338,,,,PMC3271200,,2011/07/21 06:00,2011/07/21 06:01,['2011/07/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12079-011-0142-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Commun Signal. 2012 Mar;6(1):27-35. doi: 10.1007/s12079-011-0142-2.

Like other inhibitors, for example vorinostat and belinostat, CG200745 has the hydroxamic acid moiety to bind zinc at the bottom of catalytic pocket. Firstly, we analyzed its inhibitory activity against histone deacetylase (HDAC) in hormone-dependent LNCaP cells and hormone-independent DU145 and PC3 cells. CG200745 inhibited deacetylation of histone H3 and tubulin as much as vorinostat and belinostat did. CG200745 also inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells, increased sub-G1 population, and activated caspase-9, -3 and -8 in LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells. These results indicate that CG200745 induces apoptosis. Next, we examined the effect of CG200745 on cell death induced by docetaxel in DU145 cells in vitro and in vivo. Compared to mono-treatment with each drug, pre-treatment of DU145 cells with docetaxel followed by CG200745 showed synergistic cytotoxicity, and increased the apoptotic sub-G1 population, caspase activation, and tubulin acetylation. Moreover, the combination treatment decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-(XL). Docetaxel and CG200745 combination reduced tumor size in the DU145 xenograft model. These preclinical results show that combination treatment with docetaxel and new HDACI, CG200745, potentiated anti-tumor effect in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) cells via activation of apoptosis.","['Hwang, Jung Jin', 'Kim, Yong Sook', 'Kim, Taelim', 'Kim, Mi Joung', 'Jeong, In Gab', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Choi, Jene', 'Jang, Sejin', 'Ro, Seonggu', 'Kim, Choung-Soo']","['Hwang JJ', 'Kim YS', 'Kim T', 'Kim MJ', 'Jeong IG', 'Lee JH', 'Choi J', 'Jang S', 'Ro S', 'Kim CS']","['Institute for Innovative Cancer Research, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, Seoul 138-736, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0', '(N1-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-N8-hydroxy-2-((naphthalene-1-loxy)methyl)oct-2-ened', 'iamide)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Docetaxel', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Naphthalenes/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Taxoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/21 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2011/07/21 06:00'],"['2011/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9718-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Aug;30(4):1434-42. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9718-1.

An increase in our understanding of the biology of CLL has led to the development of a wide range of therapies aimed at specific defects in this disease. B-cell receptor signaling is aberrantly increased in CLL, and so many of these drugs target key steps in these pathways. Antitumor immunity is also impaired, and a number of strategies are being developed to repair this acquired immune dysfunction.

The relaxivity, the biodistribution, T(1) relaxation times, and signal enhancement of the contrast agents are presented and the results are compared. METHODS: After preparation of contrast agents, the animal studies were performed. The cells (2x10(6) cells) were injected subcutaneously in the both flanks of mice. Two to three weeks after tumor implantation, when the tumor diameter was 2-4 mm, mice were injected with the different contrast agents. The animals were sacrificed at 24 hr post IP injection followed by removal of critical organs. The T(1) relaxation times and signal intensities of samples were measured using 11.4 T magnetic field and Gd concentration were measured using UV-spectrophotometer. RESULTS: For Gd-H, the percent of Gd localized to the tumors measured by UV-spect was 28, 23 and 21 in leukemia, melanoma and breast cells, respectively.

Metabolic syndrome was defined using the modified version of Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) crite-ria. Insulin resistance was defined based on the homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA-IR). RESULTS: The mean age of participates was 10.4 years (range 6-19 years) and the mean interval since completion of chemotherapy was 35 months. Twenty percent (11/55) of survivors (10 male, 1 female) met criteria for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Obesity was observed in one forth of patients and nearly 3/4 of obese patients had metabolic syndrome. High serum insulin levels were found in 16% of participants and in 63% of obese survivors. The mean insulin levels in survivors with metabolic syndrome was three-times more than those without (28.3 mu/l vs. 9.57 mu/l, p = 0.004).

In this study, we characterized pathophysiologic properties of two murine leukemia virus-type ERV (MuLV-ERV) env genes cloned from the ovary of C57BL/6J mice. The two env genes (named ENV(OV1) and ENV(OV2)), with 1,926 bp coding region, originated from two MuLV-ERV loci on chromosomes 8 and 18, respectively. ENV(OV1) and ENV(OV2) were ~75 kDa and predominantly expressed on the cell membrane. They were capable of producing pseudotype murine leukemia virus virions. Tropism trait and infectivity of ENV(OV2) were similar to the polytropic env; however, ENV(OV1) had very low level of infectivity. Overexpression of ENV(OV2), but not ENV(OV1), exerted cytotoxic effects and induced expression of COX-2, IL-1beta, IL-6, and iNOS. These findings suggest that the ENV(OV1) and ENV(OV2) are capable of serving as an env protein for virion assembly, and they exert differential cytotoxicity and modulation of inflammatory mediators.","['Lee, Young-Kwan', 'Chew, Alex', 'Greenhalgh, David G', 'Cho, Kiho']","['Lee YK', 'Chew A', 'Greenhalgh DG', 'Cho K']","['Shriners Hospitals for Children Northern California and Department of Surgery, University of California, Davis, 2425 Stockton Boulevard, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 GM071360/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mediators Inflamm,Mediators of inflammation,9209001,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Female', '*Genes, env', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Viral Tropism']",PMC3134291,,2011/07/21 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2011/509604 [doi]'],ppublish,Mediators Inflamm. 2011;2011:509604. doi: 10.1155/2011/509604.

The small molecule inhibitor ABT-737 binds with high affinity to BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W but with low affinity to MCL-1, BFL-1, and BCL-B. The active analog of ABT-737, navitoclax, has shown a high therapeutic index in lymphoid malignancies; developing a predictive marker for it would be clinically valuable for patient selection or choice of drug combinations. Here we used RT-PCR as a highly sensitive and quantitative assay to compare expression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 genes that are known to be targeted by ABT-737. Our findings reveal that the relative ratio of MCL-1 and BFL-1 to BCL-2 expression provides a highly significant linear correlation with ABT-737 sensitivity (r = 0.6, P < .001). In contrast, antiapoptotic transcript levels, used individually or in combination for high or low affinity ABT-737-binding proteins, could not predict ABT-737 sensitivity. The (MCL-1 + BFL-1)/BCL-2 ratio was validated in a panel of leukemic cell lines subjected to genetic and pharmacologic manipulations. Changes after ABT-737 treatment included increased expression of BFL-1 and BCL-B that may contribute to treatment resistance.

Herein, we report a case study in which the plasma concentration of the CYP2C9 substrate (S)-warfarin, and not the CYP3A4 substrate (R)-warfarin, increased with itraconazole coadministration. CASE: A 67-y-old man received an allogenic bone marrow transplant for acute lymphoid leukemia. He was taking oral itraconazole (200mg/day) and was started on a warfarin dose of 2.0mg/day. The plasma concentrations of (S)- and (R)-warfarin 3 days after starting warfarin administration were 216 and 556 ng/mL, respectively (INR 0.98), and after 10 days, the concentrations were 763 and 545 ng/mL, respectively (INR 2.43). On day 11 after withdrawal of itraconazole, the concentrations of (S)- and (R)-warfarin were 341 and 605ng/mL, respectively (INR 1.38). The concentration of (R)-warfarin was not affected by itraconazole; however, the final (S)-warfarin concentration had increased 7.3-fold. The (S)-warfarin/(S)-7-hydroxywarfarin ratio decreased to 2.45 from 8.40 after discontinuation of itraconazole. The permeability of warfarin enantiomers across Caco-2 cells was not influenced by itraconazole and showed no difference between enantiomers. CONCLUSIONS: Careful INR monitoring is necessary for warfarin co-administration with itraconazole. Further examination is necessary to elucidate mechanisms of the interaction between warfarin and itraconazole.","['Miura, Masatomo', 'Takahashi, Naoto', 'Kanno, Syu-ichi', 'Kato, Shoutaro', 'Nara, Miho', 'Itoh, Mitsugu', 'Saitoh, Hirobumi', 'Yoshioka, Tomoko', 'Kameoka, Yoshihiro', 'Fujishima, Naohito', 'Tagawa, Hiroyuki', 'Hirokawa, Makoto', 'Sawada, Kenichi']","['Miura M', 'Takahashi N', 'Kanno S', 'Kato S', 'Nara M', 'Itoh M', 'Saitoh H', 'Yoshioka T', 'Kameoka Y', 'Fujishima N', 'Tagawa H', 'Hirokawa M', 'Sawada K']","['Department of Pharmacy, Akita University Hospital, Akita, Japan. m-miura@hos.akita-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Clin Chim Acta,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,1302422,"['304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '5Q7ZVV76EI (Warfarin)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (CYP2C9 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases/blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C9', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/*administration & dosage/blood/chemistry', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Warfarin/*administration & dosage/blood/chemistry']",,,2011/07/21 06:00,2013/07/09 06:00,['2011/07/21 06:00'],"['2011/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/07/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-8981(11)00369-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cca.2011.06.035 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chim Acta. 2011 Oct 9;412(21-22):2002-6. doi: 10.1016/j.cca.2011.06.035.

AIN is characterized by chronic neutropenia, which spontaneously resolves within several months to a few years, and mild infections. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of antibodies directed against neutrophil antigens. The human neutrophil antigen (HNA) system is a polymorphic system, which includes five antigen groups with different polymorphisms. In AIN, antibodies are mostly directed against HNA-1 (or against a specific allele of HNA-1) and HNA-4. Here, we present a series of 116 infants with AIN. We observed that anti-neutrophil antibodies were present in 60% cases; directed against HNA-1a in 73% of cases. In addition, we showed there was a bias in the HNA allele distribution in these infants because the frequency of the HNA-1a allele was greater in comparison with controls.","['Audrain, Marie', 'Martin, Jerome', 'Fromont, Patricia', 'Prie, Nolwen', 'Thomas, Caroline', 'Muller, Et Jean-Yves']","['Audrain M', 'Martin J', 'Fromont P', 'Prie N', 'Thomas C', 'Muller EJ']","[""Laboratoire d'immunologie, CHU de Nantes, France. marie.audrain@chu-nantes.fr""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Allergy Immunol,Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,9106718,"['0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (neutrophil-specific antigen NA1, human)']",IM,"['*Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/immunology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Isoantibodies/*blood/immunology', 'Isoantigens/*genetics/*immunology', 'Male', '*Neutropenia/genetics/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",,,2011/07/21 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/21 06:00'],"['2011/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-3038.2010.01117.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Allergy Immunol. 2011 Aug;22(5):494-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3038.2010.01117.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,

Serum selenium was below the UK normal reference range in 45% of patients, and correlated with serum albumin (r=0.24-0.46, P<0.001-0.003) in all tumour types. Independent predictors of presentation selenium were; French-American-British subtype and albumin (P<0.001 for both) in AML, haemoglobin (P=0.002) and B-symptoms (P=0.01) in HL, and albumin (P<0.001) in FL. In AML and HL, response to first line therapy was lower in patients with low serum selenium, but selenium was no longer predictive of response when other variables were entered into a multivariate model. Low selenium was also associated with a worse overall survival in FL [Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4, 4.0] and a trend to a worse overall survival in AML (HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.96, 2.13) by univariate Cox regression analysis, but not by multivariate analysis. In conclusion, low serum selenium is associated with a worse outcome in patients with haematological malignancies, but is not independently predictive, suggesting that it reflects other factors.","['Stevens, Jane', 'Waters, Rachel', 'Sieniawska, Christina', 'Kassam, Shireen', 'Montoto, Silvia', 'Fitzgibbon, Jude', 'Rohatiner, Ama', 'Lister, Andrew', 'Joel, Simon']","['Stevens J', 'Waters R', 'Sieniawska C', 'Kassam S', 'Montoto S', 'Fitzgibbon J', 'Rohatiner A', 'Lister A', 'Joel S']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Selenium/*blood', 'Serum Albumin/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/21 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/07/21 06:00'],"['2011/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08744.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Aug;154(4):448-56. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08744.x.

Most tumors activate telomerase, but a significant minority, mainly of mesenchymal origin, uses a recombination-based, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. We investigated the presence of ALT in 34 Wilms tumor (WT) samples from 30 patients by using two approaches: (i) the detection of ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies (APBs) by combined PML immunofluorescence and telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization and (ii) the assessment of terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length distribution by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. In parallel, telomerase activity (TA) was determined by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Based on APB expression, ALT was detectable in five samples as the sole TMM and in six samples in association with telomerase. Seventeen samples only expressed TA and in six cases no known TMM was appreciable. Results of TRF length distribution were available in 32 cases, and a concordance between APB and TRF data in defining the ALT phenotype was found in 26/32 cases (81%). The study provides the first evidence of the presence of ALT in WT, and indicates that in a small but defined fraction of cases (about 15%) ALT is the only TMM that supports the development of WT.","['Venturini, Lorenza', 'Daidone, Maria Grazia', 'Motta, Rosita', 'Collini, Paola', 'Spreafico, Filippo', 'Terenziani, Monica', 'Piva, Luigi', 'Radice, Paolo', 'Perotti, Daniela', 'Zaffaroni, Nadia']","['Venturini L', 'Daidone MG', 'Motta R', 'Collini P', 'Spreafico F', 'Terenziani M', 'Piva L', 'Radice P', 'Perotti D', 'Zaffaroni N']","['Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis', 'Wilms Tumor/enzymology/*genetics/pathology']",,,2011/07/20 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.20903 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2011 Oct;50(10):823-9. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20903.

Protooncogene MYC induces cell growth and proliferation, inhibits differentiation and represses p21(CIP). However, both molecules are involved in processes of polyploidisation, cell size increase, differentiation and senescence. It is unclear why MYC has a dual role in differentiation. We have previously shown that overexpression of p21(CIP) in K562 myeloid cells induces megakaryocytic differentiation with polyploidy. We have now investigated the requirements for p21(CIP) to block mitosis and induce differentiation in the presence of overactivated MYC. Silencing and over-expression studies showed that p21(CIP) is required to induce differentiation. However, the expression of p21(CIP) needs to be transient to irreversibly inhibit mitosis but not DNA replication, what leads to polyploidy. Transient overexpression of p21(CIP) caused early down-regulation of mitotic Cyclins and up-regulation of G1/S Cyclins D and E, changes typical of endoreplication. Interestingly, over-activation of MYC did not release the proliferative block imposed by p21(CIP) and instead, accelerated cell size increase, megakaryocytic differentiation and polyploidisation. Our data suggests that in some systems p21(CIP) takes part in a mitosis control driving MYC-induced cellular growth into differentiation.","['Munoz-Alonso, Maria J', 'Ceballos, Laura', 'Bretones, Gabriel', 'Frade, Pilar', 'Leon, Javier', 'Gandarillas, Alberto']","['Munoz-Alonso MJ', 'Ceballos L', 'Bretones G', 'Frade P', 'Leon J', 'Gandarillas A']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidad de Cantabria, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Mitosis/*physiology', 'Polyploidy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc/metabolism']",,,2011/07/20 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22935 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 May;227(5):2069-78. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22935.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

Growth inhibition of A20 cells (H-2(d), murine B-lymphoma/leukemia, and Balb/c origin) induced by PDT/Photodithazine was evaluated by EZ-Cytox assay. After PDT, changes in cell morphology were assessed by light microscopy. Induction of apoptosis, as well as changes in the cell cycle, were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. A20 cells were injected into Balb/c mice through the tail veins, and PDT was performed. A total of 10 mg kg(-1) body weight of Photodithazine concentration was injected intravenously. After 5 min, micro photofibers (diameter, 200 mum) were inserted into the tail veins and irradiated at 1,200 J with a laser. PDT inhibited growth of A20 cells and resulted in marked morphological changes. PDT also induced apoptosis and G1 arrest. In a leukemia mouse model, systemic PDT increased the survival rate (p < 0.01). This is the first report of the effects of systemic PDT in a leukemia animal model. PDT has been applied only locally in most cases, for example to solid tumors.

As a result, BM is enriched for proteolytic enzymes and the soluble form of the terminal product of CC activation, the membrane attack complex C5b-C9 (MAC). At the same time, proteolytic enzymes induced in irradiated BM impair the chemotactic activity of alpha-chemokine stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). As SDF-1 is considered a crucial BM chemoattractant for transplanted hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), we sought to determine whether other factors that are resistant to proteolytic enzymes have a role in this process, focusing on proteolysis-resistant bioactive lipids. We found that the concentrations of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) increase in the BM after conditioning for transplantation and that both S1P and, as we show here for the first time, C1P are potent chemoattractants for HSPCs. Next, we observed that C5-deficient mice that do not generate MAC show impaired engraftment of HSPCs. In support of a role for MAC in homing and engraftment, we found that soluble MAC enhances in a CR3 (CD11b/CD18)-dependent manner the adhesion of HSPCs to BM stromal cells and increases the secretion of SDF-1 by BM stroma. We conclude that an increase in BM levels of proteolytic enzyme-resistant S1P and C1P and activation of CC, which leads to the generation of MAC, has an important and previously underappreciated role in the homing of transplanted HSPCs.","['Kim, C H', 'Wu, W', 'Wysoczynski, M', 'Abdel-Latif, A', 'Sunkara, M', 'Morris, A', 'Kucia, M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Kim CH', 'Wu W', 'Wysoczynski M', 'Abdel-Latif A', 'Sunkara M', 'Morris A', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Institute at the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA106281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK074720-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (ceramide 1-phosphate)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Complement System Proteins/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Lipids/*physiology', 'Lysophospholipids/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proteolysis', 'Sphingosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",PMC3197954,['NIHMS303058'],2011/07/20 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011185 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.185 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):106-16. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.185.

Flavopiridol and dinaciclib are cyclin-dependent kinase 7 and 9 inhibitors that transcriptionally inhibit expression of Mcl-1. We have investigated the ability of flavopiridol and dinaciclib to sensitize a panel of leukemia cell lines to vinblastine and paclitaxel. Both drugs acutely sensitized most of the leukemia lines to vinblastine, with 100% apoptosis in 4 h. Furthermore, dinaciclib sensitized freshly isolated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to vinblastine. This rapid induction of apoptosis was attributed to vinblastine-mediated activation of JNK because (a) flavopiridol and dinaciclib failed to induce apoptosis when combined with non-JNK activating concentrations of vinblastine; (b) JNK inhibitors suppressed JNK activity and prevented apoptosis; (c) flavopiridol did not potentiate apoptosis induced by paclitaxel which does not activate JNK in these cells; and (d) Jurkat cells failed to activate JNK in response to vinblastine and were not sensitive to combinations of vinblastine and flavopiridol or dinaciclib. The rapid induction of apoptosis by this combination in multiple cell systems but not in normal lymphocytes provides justification for performing a clinical trial to assess the efficacy in patients.","['Bates, Darcy J P', 'Salerni, Bethany L', 'Lowrey, Christopher H', 'Eastman, Alan']","['Bates DJ', 'Salerni BL', 'Lowrey CH', 'Eastman A']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 09658/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA50224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indolizines', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridinium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology']",PMC3173732,,2011/07/20 06:00,2012/01/26 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [medline]']","['16909 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.12.4.16909 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 Aug 15;12(4):314-25. doi: 10.4161/cbt.12.4.16909.

In general, chemotherapy is the only effective mean of correcting malignancy-related LA by cytoreduction of the tumor cells while at the same time decreasing malignant liver involvement leading to improved clearance of lactic acid. LA is rare in patients with malignancies and is usually associated with high mortality because of advanced disease process and high tumor burden. Increased awareness of this complication in certain malignancies is important because early initiation of chemotherapy may decrease LA and perhaps prolong survival.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with acute leukemia (11 with acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) received sorafenib on days 1 to 7 and then concurrently with cytarabine (1 g/m(2)) and clofarabine (stratum one: 40 mg/m(2), n = 10; stratum two [recent transplantation or fungal infection]: 20 mg/m(2), n = 2) on days 8 to 12. Sorafenib was continued until day 28 if tolerated. Two sorafenib dose levels (200 mg/m(2) and 150 mg/m(2) twice daily) were planned. Sorafenib pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were performed on days 7 and 8. RESULTS: At sorafenib 200 mg/m(2), two of four patients in stratum one and one of two patients in stratum two had grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction and/or rash as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). No DLTs were observed in six patients in stratum one at sorafenib 150 mg/m(2). Sorafenib inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4E-BP1 in leukemia cells. The rate of sorafenib conversion to its metabolite sorafenib N-oxide was high (mean, 33%; range, 17% to 69%). In vitro, the N-oxide potently inhibited FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD; binding constant, 70 nmol/L) and the viability of five AML cell lines. On day 8, sorafenib decreased blast percentages in 10 of 12 patients (median, 66%; range, 9% to 95%). After combination chemotherapy, six patients (three FLT3-ITD and three FLT3 wild-type AML) achieved complete remission, two (both FLT3-ITD AML) had complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, and one (FLT3 wild-type AML) had partial remission. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine is tolerable and shows activity in relapsed/refractory pediatric AML.","['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Li, Lie', 'Furmanski, Brian D', 'Mascara, Gerard P', 'Heym, Kenneth M', 'Christensen, Robbin', 'Onciu, Mihaela', 'Shurtleff, Sheila A', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Campana, Dario', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Inaba H', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Li L', 'Furmanski BD', 'Mascara GP', 'Heym KM', 'Christensen R', 'Onciu M', 'Shurtleff SA', 'Pounds SB', 'Pui CH', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Campana D', 'Baker SD']","[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. hiroto.inaba@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138744/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Benzenesulfonates/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Sorafenib']",PMC3158600,,2011/07/20 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.7427 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7427 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug 20;29(24):3293-300. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7427.

The mechanisms underlying GVL resistance are unknown. Previously, we found that alloreactive T cell targeting of GVL-sensitive bcr-abl-induced mouse CP-CML (mCP-CML) required TCR-MHC interactions and that multiple and redundant killing mechanisms were in play. To better understand why BC-CML is resistant to GVL, we performed a comprehensive analysis of GVL against mouse BC-CML (mBC-CML) induced by the retroviral transfer of the bcr-abl and NUP98/HOXA9 fusion cDNAs. Like human BC-CML, mBC-CML was GVL resistant, and this was not due to accelerated kinetics or a greater leukemia burden. To study T cell recognition and killing mechanisms, we generated a panel of gene-deficient leukemias by transducing bone marrow from gene-deficient mice. T cell target recognition absolutely required that mBC-CML cells express MHC molecules. GVL against both mCP-CML and mBC-CML required leukemia expression of ICAM-1. We hypothesized that mBC-CML would be resistant to some of the killing mechanisms sufficient to eliminate mCP-CML, but we found instead that the same mechanisms were effective against both types of leukemia, because GVL was similar against wild-type or mBC-CML genetically lacking Fas, TRAIL-R, Fas/TRAIL-R, or TNFR1/R2 or when donor T cells were perforin(-/-). However, mCP-CML, but not mBC-CML, relied on expression of programmed death-1 ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1/L2) to resist T cell killing, because only GVL against mCP-CML was augmented when leukemias lacked PD-L1/L2. Thus, mBC-CML cells have cell-intrinsic mechanisms, distinct from mCP-CML cells, which protect them from T cell killing.","['Matte-Martone, Catherine', 'Venkatesan, Srividhya', 'Tan, Hung Sheng', 'Athanasiadis, Ioanna', 'Chang, Julia', 'Pavisic, Jovana', 'Shlomchik, Warren D']","['Matte-Martone C', 'Venkatesan S', 'Tan HS', 'Athanasiadis I', 'Chang J', 'Pavisic J', 'Shlomchik WD']","['Department of Medicine, Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA096943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096943-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA096943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CM020049/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*immunology', 'Genes, abl/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/immunology', 'Retroviridae', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC3150287,['NIHMS305440'],2011/07/20 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1100311 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1100311 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Aug 15;187(4):1653-63. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100311.

BCL-2, its anti-apoptotic relatives MCL-1 and BCL-XL, and the proapoptotic BH3-only ligand BIM were found to be coexpressed at relatively high levels in a substantial proportion of heterogeneous breast tumors, including clinically aggressive basal-like cancers. To determine whether the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 that neutralizes BCL-2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W had potential efficacy in targeting BCL-2-expressing basal-like triple-negative tumors, we generated a panel of primary breast tumor xenografts in immunocompromised mice and treated recipients with either ABT-737, docetaxel, or a combination. Tumor response and overall survival were significantly improved by combination therapy, but only for tumor xenografts that expressed elevated levels of BCL-2. Treatment with ABT-737 alone was ineffective, suggesting that ABT-737 sensitizes the tumor cells to docetaxel. Combination therapy was accompanied by a marked increase in apoptosis and dissociation of BIM from BCL-2. Notably, BH3 mimetics also appeared effective in BCL-2-expressing xenograft lines that harbored p53 mutations. Our findings provide in vivo evidence that BH3 mimetics can be used to sensitize primary breast tumors to chemotherapy and further suggest that elevated BCL-2 expression constitutes a predictive response marker in breast cancer.","['Oakes, Samantha R', 'Vaillant, Francois', 'Lim, Elgene', 'Lee, Lily', 'Breslin, Kelsey', 'Feleppa, Frank', 'Deb, Siddhartha', 'Ritchie, Matthew E', 'Takano, Elena', 'Ward, Teresa', 'Fox, Stephen B', 'Generali, Daniele', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Huang, David C S', 'Visvader, Jane E', 'Lindeman, Geoffrey J']","['Oakes SR', 'Vaillant F', 'Lim E', 'Lee L', 'Breslin K', 'Feleppa F', 'Deb S', 'Ritchie ME', 'Takano E', 'Ward T', 'Fox SB', 'Generali D', 'Smyth GK', 'Strasser A', 'Huang DC', 'Visvader JE', 'Lindeman GJ']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Taxoids)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/classification/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Docetaxel', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Taxoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3286989,,2011/07/20 06:00,2012/04/13 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1104778108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1104778108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2012 Feb 21;109(8):2766-71. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1104778108.

Signals that activate either the Bcl-2- or death receptor-regulated apoptosis pathways can provide powerful stimuli for neutrophils to undergo cell death, but whether they act cooperatively in parallel or directly cross-talk in neutrophils is not known. Previous studies suggested that Bcl-2 family proteins are not required for Fas-induced cell death in neutrophils, but did not examine whether they could modulate its rapid onset. By monitoring the rate of change in neutrophil viability associated with activation of the Fas-triggered death receptor pathway using real-time cell imaging, we show that the Bcl-2-related proteins Bid, Bax, and Bak accelerate neutrophil apoptosis but are not essential for cell death. Increased Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 expression prevents efficient induction of apoptosis by Fas stimulation indicating that the Bcl-2-regulated apoptosis pathway can directly interfere with Fas-triggered apoptosis. Fas has been shown to initiate NFkappaB activation and gene transcription in cell lines, however gene transcription is not altered in Fas-activated Bid(-/-) neutrophils, indicating that apoptosis occurs independently of gene transcription in neutrophils. The specification of kinetics of neutrophil apoptosis by Bid impacts on the magnitude of neutrophil IL-1beta production, implicating a functional role for the Bcl-2-regulated pathway in controlling neutrophil responses to FasL. These data demonstrate that the intrinsic apoptosis pathway directly controls the kinetics of Fas-triggered apoptosis in neutrophils.","['Croker, Ben A', ""O'Donnell, Joanne A"", 'Nowell, Cameron J', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Dewson, Grant', 'Campbell, Kirsteen J', 'Rogers, Kelly L', 'Hu, Yifang', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'White, Michael', 'Lackovic, Kurt', 'Cengia, Louise H', ""O'Reilly, Lorraine A"", 'Bouillet, Philippe', 'Cory, Suzanne', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Roberts, Andrew W']","['Croker BA', ""O'Donnell JA"", 'Nowell CJ', 'Metcalf D', 'Dewson G', 'Campbell KJ', 'Rogers KL', 'Hu Y', 'Smyth GK', 'Zhang JG', 'White M', 'Lackovic K', 'Cengia LH', ""O'Reilly LA"", 'Bouillet P', 'Cory S', 'Strasser A', 'Roberts AW']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia. croker@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['R01 CA043540-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA043540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA022556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA022556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA022556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA022556-34/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fas protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/*metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*metabolism', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",PMC3156212,,2011/07/20 06:00,2011/10/19 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1110358108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1110358108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Aug 9;108(32):13135-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1110358108.

In this study, we assess the activity and the mechanism of action of the prototype cell division cycle kinase 7 (Cdc7) inhibitor, PHA-767491, which inhibits the initiation of DNA replication but also has cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) inhibitory activity. We have studied the effects of this dual Cdc7/Cdk9 inhibitor in both quiescent CLL cells and CLL cells that have been induced to proliferate using a cellular coculture system that mimics the lymph node microenvironment. We find that this compound, originally developed as a DNA replication inhibitor, is particularly active in promoting mitochondrial dependent apoptosis in quiescent CLL cells purified from peripheral blood of patients regardless of recognized risk factors. In this setting, apoptosis is preceded by a decrease in the levels of Mcl-1 protein and transcript possibly due to inhibition of Cdk9. Following stimulation by CD154 and interleukin-4, CLL cells become highly chemoresistant, reenter into the cell cycle, reexpress Cdc7 kinase, a key molecular switch for the initiation of DNA replication, replicate their DNA, and undergo cell division. In this context, treatment with PHA-767491 abolished DNA synthesis by inhibiting Cdc7 but is less effective in triggering cell death, although Mcl-1 protein is no longer detectable. Thus, dual Cdc7/Cdk9 inhibition has the potential to target both the quiescent and actively proliferating CLL populations through two distinct mechanisms and may be a new therapeutic strategy in CLL.","['Natoni, Alessandro', 'Murillo, Laura S', 'Kliszczak, Anna E', 'Catherwood, Mark A', 'Montagnoli, Alessia', 'Samali, Afshin', ""O'Dwyer, Michael"", 'Santocanale, Corrado']","['Natoni A', 'Murillo LS', 'Kliszczak AE', 'Catherwood MA', 'Montagnoli A', 'Samali A', ""O'Dwyer M"", 'Santocanale C']","['National Centre of Biomedical Engineering and Science and Centre for Chromosome Biology, National University of Ireland Galway, University Road, Galway, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PHA 767491)', '0 (Piperidones)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (CDC7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD40 Ligand/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperidones/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2011/07/20 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-10-1119 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-1119 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2011 Sep;10(9):1624-34. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-10-1119.

The illness can occur in an aggressive or chronic form. We studied cell lines from human and rat NK-cell leukemias (aggressive NK-cell leukemia) as well as samples from patients with chronic NK-cell leukemia to investigate pathogenic mechanisms. Here we report that Mcl-1 was overexpressed in leukemic NK cells and that knockdown of Mcl-1 induced apoptosis in these leukemic cells. In vitro treatment of human and rat NK leukemia cells with FTY720 led to caspase-dependent apoptosis and decreased Mcl-1 expression in a time- and-dose-dependent manner. These biologic effects could be inhibited by blockade of reactive oxygen species generation and the lysosomal degradation pathway. Lipidomic analyses after FTY720 treatment demonstrated elevated levels of sphingosine, which mediated apoptosis of leukemic NK cells in vitro. Importantly, systemic administration of FTY720 induced complete remission in the syngeneic Fischer rat model of NK-cell leukemia. Therapeutic efficacy was associated with decreased expression of Mcl-1 in vivo.

We recently reported that resistance could be explained, in part, by internalization of rituximab (type I anti-CD20) from the surface of certain B-cell malignancies, thus limiting engagement of natural effectors and increasing mAb consumption. Internalization of rituximab was most evident in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), but the extent of internalization was heterogeneous within each disease. Here, we show that the inhibitory FcgammaRIIb on target B cells promotes this process and is largely responsible for the observed heterogeneity across a range of B-cell malignancies. Internalization correlated strongly with FcgammaRIIb expression on normal and malignant B cells, and resulted in reduced macrophage phagocytosis of mAb-coated targets. Furthermore, transfection of FcgammaRIIb into FcgammaRIIb negative Ramos cells increased internalization of rituximab in a dose-dependent manner. Target-cell FcgammaRIIb promoted rituximab internalization in a cis fashion and was independent of FcgammaRIIb on neighboring cells. It became phosphorylated and internalized along with CD20:anti-CD20 complexes before lysosomal degradation. In MCL patients, high FcgammaRIIb expression predicted less durable responses after rituximab-containing regimens. Therefore, target-cell FcgammaRIIb provides a potential biomarker of response to type I anti-CD20 mAb.","['Lim, Sean H', 'Vaughan, Andrew T', 'Ashton-Key, Margaret', 'Williams, Emily L', 'Dixon, Sandra V', 'Chan, H T Claude', 'Beers, Stephen A', 'French, Ruth R', 'Cox, Kerry L', 'Davies, Andrew J', 'Potter, Kathleen N', 'Mockridge, C Ian', 'Oscier, David G', 'Johnson, Peter W M', 'Cragg, Mark S', 'Glennie, Martin J']","['Lim SH', 'Vaughan AT', 'Ashton-Key M', 'Williams EL', 'Dixon SV', 'Chan HT', 'Beers SA', 'French RR', 'Cox KL', 'Davies AJ', 'Potter KN', 'Mockridge CI', 'Oscier DG', 'Johnson PW', 'Cragg MS', 'Glennie MJ']","['Tenovus Research Laboratory, Cancer Sciences Division, Southampton University School of Medicine, General Hospital, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['G0800457/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'C328/A2737/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'C328/A2738/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (FCGR2B protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Line, Tumor/immunology/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Endocytosis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/20 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40745-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-330357 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 1;118(9):2530-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-330357.

An internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain of Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) contributes to transformation and is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we demonstrate that, as compared with wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), Flt3-ITD more rapidly undergoes degradation through the proteasomal and lysosomal pathways in model hematopoietic 32D cells and in human leukemic MV4-11 cells. The Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylaminodemethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) preferentially induced the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Flt3-ITD autophosphorylated on Tyr-591 in these cells. The E3 ubiquitin ligases c-Cbl and to a lesser extent Cbl-b facilitated at least partly Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of autophosphorylated Flt3-ITD when coexpressed in 293T cells. Moreover, c-Cbl and Cbl-b facilitated degradation of Flt3-ITD in 293T cells and significantly enhanced the 17-AAG-induced decline in autophosphorylated Flt3-ITD. The enhancement of Flt3-ITD degradation was also observed in 32D cells inducibly overexpressing c-Cbl or Cbl-b. Furthermore, overexpression of loss-of-function mutants of both c-Cbl (c-Cbl-R420Q) and Cbl-b (Cbl-b-C373A) together in 32D cells retarded the degradation of autophosphorylated Flt3-ITD and significantly inhibited the 17-AAG-induced degradation of Flt3-ITD to confer the resistance to cytotoxicity of 17-AAG on these cells. These results suggest that c-Cbl as well as Cbl-b may play important roles in Hsp90 inhibitor-induced degradation of Flt3-ITD through the ubiquitin proteasome system and in regulation of the basal expression level of Flt3-ITD in leukemic cells.","['Oshikawa, Gaku', 'Nagao, Toshikage', 'Wu, Nan', 'Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Oshikawa G', 'Nagao T', 'Wu N', 'Kurosu T', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.

Terminally differentiated cells are eliminated, at least in part, by apoptosis, whereas part of the apoptotic machinery, including one or several caspases, is required to go through very specific steps of the differentiation pathways. A number of hematological diseases involve a deregulation of this machinery, which in most cases is a decrease in cell sensitivity to pro-apoptotic signals through over-expression of anti-apoptotic molecules. In some situations however, e.g. in the erythroid lineage of low grade myelodysplastic syndromes, cell sensitivity to apoptosis is increased in a death receptor-dependent manner and cell death pathways are inhibited only when these diseases progress into high grade and acute leukemia. Therapeutic strategies targeting the apoptotic machinery specifically block cell death inhibitors that are over-expressed in transformed cells, mainly Bcl-2-related proteins and Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs). Another strategy is the activation of the extrinsic pathway to apoptosis, mainly through the death receptor agonist Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) or agonistic antibodies targeting TRAIL receptors. The use of inhibitors of death receptors could make sense when these receptors are involved in excessive cell death or activation of survival pathways. Most of the drugs targeting apoptotic pathways introduced in clinics have demonstrated their tolerability. Their efficacy, either alone or in combination with other drugs such as demethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors, is currently tested in both myeloid and lymphoid hematological diseases.","['Droin, Nathalie', 'Guery, Leslie', 'Benikhlef, Naima', 'Solary, Eric']","['Droin N', 'Guery L', 'Benikhlef N', 'Solary E']","['Inserm UMR 1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris-Sud 11, 114 rue Edouard Vaillant, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism']",,,2011/07/20 06:00,2013/06/26 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3835(11)00361-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2013 May 28;332(2):325-34. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.016.

The relationship of conditioning intensity to GVL effect was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lethally irradiated (either 900 or 1300 cGy) B6D2F1 (H-2(b/d)) recipients were transplanted from B6 (H-2(b)) donors. P815 or L1214 (H-2(d)) tumor cells were injected intravenously or subcutaneously on day 1 post-transplantation to generate a GVL model. RESULTS: Tumors in allogeneic mice treated with 1300 cGy exhibited markedly delayed subcutaneous tumor growth in vivo as compared with mice treated with 900 cGy, while intravenous tumor growths were comparable between the two radiation doses. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interferon-gamma were similar and the percentages of donor T-cell proliferation or apoptosis early after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were comparable. The numbers of CD8(+) T cells from recipients that received 1300 cGy were significantly elevated in skin and tumor tissues. CD62L(low) and CD44(high) CD8(+) T-cell fractions were also elevated in 1300 cGy. After the higher radiation dose, P815-specific interferon-gamma responses of splenic CD8(+) T cells were markedly enhanced and the fractions of T cells of interferon-gamma-producing T cells in tumor tissues but not in spleen were increased. The protein concentrations of chemokines in skin and tumor tissues were substantially elevated in 1300 cGy compared to 900 cGy. CONCLUSIONS: The higher radiation dose (1300 vs. 900 cGy) resulted in significantly enhanced GVL effect against an extramedullary tumor and the alterations in effector T-cell trafficking into tumor tissue are the most likely mechanism.","['Lim, Ji-Young', 'Choi, Mi-Sun', 'Youn, Hyewon', 'Choi, Eun Young', 'Min, Chang-Ki']","['Lim JY', 'Choi MS', 'Youn H', 'Choi EY', 'Min CK']","[""Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea.""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*radiation effects', 'Interferon-gamma/blood', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating', 'Mastocytoma/surgery', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",,,2011/07/20 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2010/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00331-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.07.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Oct;39(10):1018-29. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.07.003.

We have elucidated the potential for manipulating the cAMP signaling pathway as a target for inhibiting the growth of multiple myeloma cells. METHODS: As a model system, we primarily used the murine multiple myeloma cell line MOPC315 which can be grown both in vivo and in vitro. Human multiple myeloma cell lines U266, INA-6 and the B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Reh were used only for in vitro studies. Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry and western blot analysis after treatment with cAMP elevating agents (forskolin, prostaglandin E2 and rolipram) and cAMP analogs. We followed tumor growth in vivo after forskolin treatment by imaging DsRed-labelled MOPC315 cells transplanted subcutaneously in BALB/c nude mice. RESULTS: In contrast to the effect on Reh cells, 50 muM forskolin more than tripled the death of MOPC315 cells after 24 h in vitro. Forskolin induced cell death to a similar extent in the human myeloma cell lines U266 and INA-6. cAMP-mediated cell death had all the typical hallmarks of apoptosis, including changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and cleavage of caspase 3, caspase 9 and PARP. Forskolin also inhibited the growth of multiple myeloma cells in a mouse model in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP kills multiple myeloma cells in vitro and inhibits development of multiple myeloma in vivo. This strongly suggests that compounds activating the cAMP signaling pathway may be useful in the field of multiple myeloma.","['Follin-Arbelet, Virginie', 'Hofgaard, Peter O', 'Hauglin, Harald', 'Naderi, Soheil', 'Sundan, Anders', 'Blomhoff, Rune', 'Bogen, Bjarne', 'Blomhoff, Heidi K']","['Follin-Arbelet V', 'Hofgaard PO', 'Hauglin H', 'Naderi S', 'Sundan A', 'Blomhoff R', 'Bogen B', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. virginie.follin-arbelet@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Thionucleotides)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",PMC3161033,,2011/07/20 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-301 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-301 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jul 18;11:301. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-301.,20110718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CE was observed in 15/105 patients after 24-170 months (median 64). Recurring aberrations at CE were 14q32/IGH translocation in seven patients; other aberrations were 17p -, 11q -, biallelic 13q - and 14q32 deletion. CE was detected in 15/58 pre-treated patients; in contrast, none of 47 untreated patients developed CE (p < 0.0001). In two cases the appearance of 14q32/IGH translocation was first detected in the bone marrow (BM) or in the lymph node (LN) and 13-58 months later in the peripheral blood (PB). ZAP70 + and high-risk cytogenetics predicted for the occurrence of CE with borderline statistical significance (p = 0.055 and 0.07, respectively). Shorter time to first treatment (TTT) and time to chemorefractoriness (TTCR) were noted in 15 patients with CE when compared to patients without CE (TTT: 35 vs. 71 months, p = 0.0033 and TTCR: 34 vs. 86 months, p = 0.0046, respectively). Survival after the development of CE was 32 months (standard error 8.5). We arrived at the following conclusions: (i) 14q32/IGH translocation may represent one of the most frequent aberrations acquired during the natural history of CLL and (ii) it may be detected earlier in BM or LN samples; (iii) CE including 14q32/IGH translocation occurs in pre-treated patients with short TTT and TTCR; (iii) survival after CE is relatively short.","['Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Rizzotto, Lara', 'Sofritti, Olga', 'Daghia, Giulia', 'Cibien, Francesca', 'Martinelli, Sara', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Saccenti, Elena', 'Dabusti, Melissa', 'Elkareem, Abbas Awad', 'Bardi, Antonella', 'Tammiso, Elisa', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo']","['Cavazzini F', 'Rizzotto L', 'Sofritti O', 'Daghia G', 'Cibien F', 'Martinelli S', 'Ciccone M', 'Saccenti E', 'Dabusti M', 'Elkareem AA', 'Bardi A', 'Tammiso E', 'Cuneo A', 'Rigolin GM']","['Section of Hematology, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. cvzfnc@unife.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/statistics & numerical data', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']",,,2011/07/20 06:00,2012/06/23 06:00,['2011/07/20 06:00'],"['2011/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.606384 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Jan;53(1):83-8. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.606384.

The discovery of this mutation has fueled the development of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors. Available results have indicated that JAK2 inhibitors are particularly effective at reducing spleen size. However, the activity of these agents is multifaceted and also involves a marked improvement of systemic symptoms and, for those agents with dual JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitory activity, a marked reduction in the levels of circulating cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. Because JAK2 inhibitors are not specific for JAK2(V617F), responses have also been observed in JAK2(V617F) -negative MPNs because of the inhibition of wild-type JAK2, which is also likely responsible for the induction of cytopenias in patients with MF and for the normalization of peripheral blood counts observed in patients with ET or PV. Given the distinct mortality and morbidity associated with ET, PV, and MF, the use of JAK2 inhibitors appears reasonable for patients with MF as well as for those with ET or PV who have become resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea. Ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials will further delineate the role of these agents in the management of patients with MPNs. The pros and cons of JAK2 kinase inhibitor therapy are herein discussed.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Verstovsek S']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. aquintas@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/*adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hemorrhage/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Polycythemia Vera/drug therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'Spleen/drug effects/pathology', 'Splenomegaly/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/drug therapy', 'Thrombosis/prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/19 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26359 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Feb 15;118(4):870-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26359.

In this study, the authors examined associations between neuromuscular impairments and physical function and between neuromuscular impairments and doses of vincristine and intrathecal methotrexate used to treat leukemia among survivors of childhood ALL. METHODS: ALL survivors >10 years from diagnosis participated in neuromuscular performance testing. Treatment data were abstracted from medical records. Regression models were used to evaluate associations between treatment factors, neuromuscular impairments, and physical performance. RESULTS: Among 415 survivors (median age, 35 years; age range, 21-52 years), balance, mobility, and 6-minute walk (6MW) distances were 1.3 standard deviations below age-specific and sex-specific values in 15.4%, 3.6%, and 46.5% of participants, respectively. Impairments included absent Achilles tendon reflexes (39.5%), active dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) <5 degrees (33.5%), and impaired knee extension strength (30.1%). In adjusted models (including cranial radiation), survivors who received cumulative intrathecal methotrexate doses >/=215 mg/m(2) were 3.4 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.8 times more likely) to have impaired ROM than survivors who received no intrathecal methotrexate, and survivors who received cumulative vincristine doses >/=39 mg/m(2) were 1.5 times more likely (95% CI, 1.0-2.5 times more likely) to have impaired ROM than survivors who received lower cumulative doses of vincristine. Higher intrathecal methotrexate doses were associated with reduced knee extension strength and 6MW distances. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromuscular impairments were prevalent in childhood ALL survivors and interfered with physical performance. Higher cumulative doses of vincristine and/or intrathecal methotrexate were associated with long-term neuromuscular impairments, which have implications on future function as these survivors age.","['Ness, Kirsten K', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Green, Daniel M', 'Krull, Kevin R', 'Huang, Tseng T', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Morris, E Brannon']","['Ness KK', 'Hudson MM', 'Pui CH', 'Green DM', 'Krull KR', 'Huang TT', 'Robison LL', 'Morris EB']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38138, USA. kiri.ness@stjude.org""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-34/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuromuscular Junction Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",PMC3197897,['NIHMS302824'],2011/07/19 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26337 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Feb 1;118(3):828-38. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26337.

The Children's Oncology Group AAML03P1 trial sought to determine the safety of adding 2 doses of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a humanized anti-CD33 antibody-targeted agent, to intensive chemotherapy during remission induction and postremission intensification for children with de novo AML. METHODS: AAML03P1 enrolled 350 children with previously untreated AML. Patients with a matched family donor received 3 courses of chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; those without a matched family donor received 5 courses of chemotherapy. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3 mg/m(2)/dose was administered on Day 6 of Course 1 and Day 7 of Course 4. RESULTS: Toxicities observed in all courses of therapy were typical of AML chemotherapy regimens, with infection being most common. Patients achieved a complete remission rate of 83% after 1 course and 87% after 2 courses. The mortality rate was 1.5% after the first gemtuzumab ozogamicin-containing induction course and 2.6% after 2 induction courses. The 3-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were 53 +/- 6% and 66 +/- 5%, respectively.

To date, VIP and its two main receptors expressed in T lymphocytes, vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor (VPAC)1 and VPAC2, mediate critical cellular functions regulating adaptive immunity, including arresting CD4 T cells in G(1) of the cell cycle, protection from apoptosis and a potent chemotactic recruiter of T cells to the mucosa associated lymphoid compartment of the gastrointestinal tissues. Since the discovery of VIP in 1970, followed by the cloning of VPAC1 and VPAC2 in the early 1990s, this signaling axis has been associated with common human cancers, including leukemia. This review highlights the present day knowledge of the VIP ligand and its receptor expression profile in T cell leukemia and cell lines. Also, there will be a discussion describing how the anti-leukemic DNA binding transcription factor, Ikaros, regulates VIP receptor expression in primary human CD4 T lymphocytes and T cell lymphoblastic cell lines (e.g. Hut-78). Lastly, future goals will be mentioned that are expected to uncover the role of how the VIP signaling axis contributes to human leukemogenesis, and to establish whether the VIP receptor signature expressed by leukemic blasts can provide therapeutic and/or diagnostic information.","['Dorsam, Glenn Paul', 'Benton, Keith', 'Failing, Jarrett', 'Batra, Sandeep']","['Dorsam GP', 'Benton K', 'Failing J', 'Batra S']","['Glenn Paul Dorsam, Keith Benton, Jarrett Failing, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Center for Protease Research, North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND 58102, United States.']",['eng'],"['K01 DK064828/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR015566/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],United States,World J Biol Chem,World journal of biological chemistry,101546471,,,,PMC3135862,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/07/19 06:01,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.146 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 26;2(6):146-60. doi: 10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.146.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Epigenetics', 'Hut-78', 'Ikaros', 'Neuropeptides']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ikaros is essential for normal hematopoiesis and possesses tumor suppressor activity. Ikaros isoforms interact to form dimers and potentially multimeric complexes. Diverse Ikaros complexes produced by the presence of different Ikaros isoforms are hypothesized to confer distinct functions. Small dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms have been shown to inhibit the tumor suppressor activity of full-length Ikaros. Here, we describe how Ikaros activity is regulated by the coordinated expression of the largest Ikaros isoforms IK-1 and IK-H. Although IK-1 is described as full-length Ikaros, IK-H is the longest Ikaros isoform. IK-H, which includes residues coded by exon 3B (60 bp that lie between exons 3 and 4), is abundant in human but not murine hematopoietic cells. Specific residues that lie within the 20 amino acids encoded by exon 3B give IK-H DNA-binding characteristics that are distinct from those of IK-1. Moreover, IK-H can potentiate or inhibit the ability of IK-1 to bind DNA. IK-H binds to the regulatory regions of genes that are upregulated by Ikaros, but not genes that are repressed by Ikaros. Although IK-1 localizes to pericentromeric heterochromatin, IK-H can be found in both pericentromeric and non-pericentromeric locations. Anti-silencing activity of gamma satellite DNA has been shown to depend on the binding of IK-H, but not other Ikaros isoforms. The unique features of IK-H, its influence on Ikaros activity, and the lack of IK-H expression in mice suggest that Ikaros function in humans may be more complex and possibly distinct from that in mice.","['Li, Zhanjun', 'Perez-Casellas, Laura A', 'Savic, Aleksandar', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Li Z', 'Perez-Casellas LA', 'Savic A', 'Song C', 'Dovat S']","['Zhanjun Li, Chunhua Song, Sinisa Dovat, Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University,College of Medicine, H085, Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Hershey, PA 17033-0850, United States.']",['eng'],['R01 HL095120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,World J Biol Chem,World journal of biological chemistry,101546471,,,,PMC3135861,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/07/19 06:01,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.140 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 26;2(6):140-5. doi: 10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.140.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromatin, Pericentromeric', 'IK-H', 'Ikaros', 'Leukemia', 'Transcription', 'gamma satellite']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ikaros is a master regulator of hematopoiesis and an established tumor suppressor. Moderate alteration of Ikaros activity (e.g. haploinsufficiency) appears to be sufficient to promote malignant transformation in human hematopoietic cells. This raises questions about the mechanisms that normally regulate Ikaros function and the potential of these mechanisms to contribute to the development of leukemia. The focus of this review is the regulation of Ikaros function by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Site-specific phosphorylation of Ikaros by casein kinase 2 (CK2) controls Ikaros DNA-binding ability and subcellular localization. As a consequence, the ability of Ikaros to regulate cell cycle progression, chromatin remodeling, target gene expression, and thymocyte differentiation are controlled by CK2. In addition, hyperphosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2 leads to decreased Ikaros levels due to ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Dephosphorylation of Ikaros by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) acts in opposition to CK2 to increase Ikaros stability and restore Ikaros DNA binding ability and pericentromeric localization. Thus, the CK2 and PP1 pathways act in concert to regulate Ikaros activity in hematopoiesis and as a tumor suppressor. This highlights the importance of these signal transduction pathways as potential mediators of leukemogenesis via their role in regulating the activities of Ikaros.","['Song, Chunhua', 'Li, Zhanjun', 'Erbe, Amy K', 'Savic, Aleksandar', 'Dovat, Sinisa']","['Song C', 'Li Z', 'Erbe AK', 'Savic A', 'Dovat S']","['Chunhua Song, Zhanjun Li, Sinisa Dovat, Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033-0850, United States.']",['eng'],['R01 HL095120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,World J Biol Chem,World journal of biological chemistry,101546471,,,,PMC3135859,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/07/19 06:01,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.126 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 26;2(6):126-31. doi: 10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.126.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Casein kinase 2', 'Ikaros', 'Leukemia', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein phosphatase 1', 'Transcription factor', 'Zinc finger']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Ikaros deficiency appears to be very frequent in murine T-cell leukemias, loss of Ikaros appears to be rare in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We review here the evidence linking Ikaros to T-ALL in mouse and human systems.","['Kastner, Philippe', 'Chan, Susan']","['Kastner P', 'Chan S']","['Philippe Kastner, Susan Chan, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch 67400, France;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,World J Biol Chem,World journal of biological chemistry,101546471,,,,PMC3135856,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/07/19 06:01,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.108 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Biol Chem. 2011 Jun 26;2(6):108-14. doi: 10.4331/wjbc.v2.i6.108.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ikaros', 'Notch', 'T-cell leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the association between paternal smoking and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Method. We identified 18 published epidemiologic studies that reported data on both paternal smoking and childhood ALL risk. We performed a meta-analysis and analyzed dose-response relationships on ALL risk for smoking during preconception, during pregnancy, after birth, and ever smoking. Results. The summary odds ratio (OR) of childhood ALL associated with paternal smoking was 1.11 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.05-1.18, I(2) = 18%) during any time period, 1.25 (95% CI: 1.08-1.46, I(2) = 53%) preconception; 1.24 (95% CI: 1.07-1.43, I(2) = 54%) during pregnancy, and 1.24 (95% CI: 0.96-1.60, I(2) = 64%) after birth, with a dose-response relationship between childhood ALL and paternal smoking preconception or after birth.

It fuses to other genes associated with acute lymphoblastoid leukemia (ALL). These fusion products are potent dominant-negative (DN) inhibitors of wild-type PAX5, resulting in a blockade of B-cell differentiation. Here, we show that multimerization of PAX5 DNA-binding domain (DBD) is necessary and sufficient to cause extremely stable chromatin binding and DN activity. ALL-associated PAX5-C20S results from fusion of the N-terminal region of PAX5, including its paired DBD, to the C-terminus of C20orf112, a protein of unknown function. We report that PAX5-C20S is a tetramer, which interacts extraordinarily stably with chromatin as determined by Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching in living cells. Tetramerization, stable chromatin binding and DN activity all require a putative five-turn amphipathic alpha-helix at the C-terminus of C20orf112, and does not require potential corepressor binding peptides elsewhere in the sequence. In vitro, the monomeric PAX5 DBD and PAX5-C20S binds a PAX5-binding site with equal affinity when it is at the center of an oligonucleotide too short to bind to more than one PAX5 DBD. But, PAX5-C20S binds the same sequence with 10-fold higher affinity than the monomeric PAX5 DBD when it is in a long DNA molecule. We suggest that the increased affinity results from interactions of one or more of the additional DBDs with neighboring non-specific sites in a long DNA molecule, and that this can account for the increased stability of PAX5-C20S chromatin binding compared with wild-type PAX5, resulting in DN activity by competition for binding to PAX5-target sites. Consistent with this model, the ALL-associated PAX5 fused to ETV6 or the multimerization domain of ETV6 SAM results in stable chromatin binding and DN activity. In addition, PAX5 DBD fused to artificial dimerization, trimerization and tetramerization domains results in parallel increases in the stability of chromatin binding and DN activity. Our studies suggest that oncogenic fusion proteins that retain the DBD of the transcription factor (TF) and the multimerization sequence of the partner protein can act in a DN manner by multimerizing and binding avidly to gene targets, preventing the normal TF from binding and inducing expression of its target genes. Inhibition of this multimeriztion may provide a novel therapeutic approach for cancers with this or similar fusion proteins.","['Kawamata, N', 'Pennella, M A', 'Woo, J L', 'Berk, A J', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kawamata N', 'Pennella MA', 'Woo JL', 'Berk AJ', 'Koeffler HP']","['Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center/UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Due to the complex and multi-factorial nature of both aging and cancer, accurate deciphering of causative links between aging and cancer remains a major challenge. It is generally accepted that initiation and progression of cancers are driven by a process of clonal evolution. In principle, this somatic evolution should follow the same Darwinian logic as evolutionary processes in populations in nature: diverse heritable types arising as a result of mutations are subjected to selection, resulting in expansion of the fittest clones. However, prevalent paradigms focus primarily on mutational aspects in linking aging and cancer. In this review, we will argue that age-related changes in selective pressures are likely to be equally important. We will focus on aging-related changes in the hematopoietic system, where age-associated alterations are relatively well studied, and discuss the impact of these changes on the development of leukemias and other malignancies.","['Henry, Curtis J', 'Marusyk, Andriy', 'DeGregori, James']","['Henry CJ', 'Marusyk A', 'DeGregori J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Integrated Department of Immunology, Program in Molecular Biology, University of Colorado Denver School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 AG000279-09/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AG000279/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA137262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109657/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA137262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,,IM,"['Aging/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Fitness', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mutation']",PMC3164372,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/11/15 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['100351 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.100351 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2011 Jun;3(6):643-56. doi: 10.18632/aging.100351.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately one quarter of the patients with AML also carry an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation in the gene encoding FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which has a significantly deleterious impact on prognosis. The ITD mutation renders FLT3 constitutively active and leads to uncontrolled proliferation of the leukemic blast. Over the course of the last decade, a variety of compounds have been developed in preclinical and clinical studies as potent inhibitors of FLT3. Many of the earlier agents under investigation, such as lestaurtinib, midostaurin, and sunitinib, were initially developed as inhibitors of other tyrosine kinases and as targeted therapies in a variety of malignancies. These compounds have been demonstrated to have some efficacy in clinical trials of AML, mainly manifesting as transient decreases in circulating blasts correlating with effective in vivo suppression of the FLT3 target. Nevertheless, the cumbersome pharmacokinetics of some compounds and the suboptimal specificity and potency of others have limited their therapeutic efficacy. In the last few years, newer, more potent and specific agents have been under investigation, with the leading example being AC220. This agent has shown significant promise in early phases of clinical investigation, and is currently in more advanced clinical trials. Hope remains that FLT3 inhibition will be become an effective therapeutic adjunct to our current treatment approach to AML.","['Fathi, Amir T', 'Chabner, Bruce A']","['Fathi AT', 'Chabner BA']","['Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. afathi@partners.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Furans', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sunitinib', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3228152,,2011/07/19 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2011-0084 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0084 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2011;16(8):1162-74. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0084.

A number of genes harbored novel variants in person, but only one gene, GATA2, was mutated in all 4 persons. Each person harbored a different mutation, but all were predicted to be highly deleterious and to cause loss or mutation of the C-terminal zinc finger domain. Because GATA2 is the only common mutated gene in 4 unrelated persons, it is highly probable to be the cause of dendritic cell, monocyte, B, and natural killer lymphoid deficiency.

Three types of FLC abnormalities were identified: monoclonal elevated FLC (elevated kappa and/or lambda with abnormal FLC ratio), polyclonal elevated FLC (elevated kappa and/or lambda with normal FLC ratio), and ratio-only FLC abnormality (normal range kappa and lambda with abnormal FLC ratio). One hundred sixty-five patients (49%) had a FLC abnormality with approximately equal distribution among monoclonal elevation, polyclonal elevation, and ratio-only abnormality.

CD38 is accepted as a dependable marker of unfavorable prognosis and as an indicator of activation and proliferation of cells when tested. Leukemic clones with higher numbers of CD38(+) cells are more responsive to BCR signaling and are characterized by enhanced migration. In vitro activation through CD38 drives CLL proliferation and chemotaxis via a signaling pathway that includes ZAP-70 and ERK1/2. Finally, CD38 is under a polymorphic transcriptional control after external signals. Consequently, CD38 appears to be a global molecular bridge to the environment, promoting survival/proliferation over apoptosis. Together, this evidence contributes to the current view of CLL as a chronic disease in which the host's microenvironment promotes leukemic cell growth and also controls the sequential acquisition and accumulation of genetic alterations. This view relies on the existence of a set of surface molecules, including CD38, which support proliferation and survival of B cells on their way to and after neoplastic transformation. The second decade of studies on CD38 in CLL will tell if the molecule is an effective target for antibody-mediated therapy in this currently incurable leukemia.","['Malavasi, Fabio', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Damle, Rajendra', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S', 'Damle R', 'Cutrona G', 'Ferrarini M', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Torino School of Medicine, Torino, Italy. fabio.malavasi@unito.it']",['eng'],['R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)'],IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/immunology/therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods/trends', 'Research/trends', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Microenvironment/physiology']",PMC3574275,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40440-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-06-275610 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 29;118(13):3470-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-06-275610.

Using a syngeneic retroviral model of MLL-AF9 induced acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we have identified 2 different stages of leukemia progression, propagated by ""pre-LSCs"" and established leukemia (LSCs) and compared the homing properties of these distinctive entities to that of normal HSCs. The homing and microlocalization of pre-LSCs was most similar to long-term HSCs and was dependent on cell-intrinsic Wnt signaling. In contrast, the homing of established LSCs was most similar to that of committed myeloid progenitors and distinct from HSCs. Although osteoblast-derived Dickkopf-1, a potent Wnt inhibitor known to impair HSC function, dramatically impaired normal HSC localization within the bone marrow, it did not affect pre-LSCs, LSC homing, or AML development. Mechanistically, cell-intrinsic Wnt activation was observed in human and murine AML samples, explaining the independence of MLL-AF9 LSCs from niche-derived Wnt signals. These data identify differential engagement of HM associated with leukemic progression and identify an LSC niche that is physically distinct and independent of the constraints of Wnt signaling that apply to normal HSCs.","['Lane, Steven W', 'Wang, Yingzi J', 'Lo Celso, Cristina', 'Ragu, Christine', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Sykes, Stephen M', 'Ferraro, Francesca', 'Shterental, Sebastian', 'Lin, Charles P', 'Gilliland, D Gary', 'Scadden, David T', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Williams, David A']","['Lane SW', 'Wang YJ', 'Lo Celso C', 'Ragu C', 'Bullinger L', 'Sykes SM', 'Ferraro F', 'Shterental S', 'Lin CP', 'Gilliland DG', 'Scadden DT', 'Armstrong SA', 'Williams DA']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL044851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK062757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK62757/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL44851/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Stem Cell Niche', 'Survival Rate', 'Wnt Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3172801,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40710-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-03-345165 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 8;118(10):2849-56. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-03-345165.

Imatinib is known to inhibit the dysregulated proliferation of chronic myeloid leukemia, which is associated with the Bcr-Abl kinase; in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, imatinib is known to act via c-Kit kinase inhibition. The objective of this study was to synthesize an (18)F-labeled analog of imatinib not as a primary imaging agent but rather as a tracer for in vivo drug distribution and tracer concentration that can be used as a PET imaging surrogate for imatinib. METHODS: Molecular modeling studies based on the crystal structure of imatinib bound to the active site of Abl were performed for designing the fluorinated analog. A 2-fluoroethyl analog of imatinib (SKI696) was synthesized using well-established procedures. The selectivity and binding affinity of SKI696 were compared with those of imatinib in vitro. Mice bearing K562 tumor xenografts, which are known to overexpress Bcr-Abl, were imaged with (18)F-SKI696 PET. A biodistribution study was also performed on K562 tumor-bearing mice to which our radiolabeled tracer was administered. RESULTS: The kinase assay verified that imatinib and SKI696 bind to the same targets with similar affinities. The feasibility of using (18)F-SKI696 as a PET agent was examined in vivo, and (18)F-SKI696 PET was shown to visualize K562 tumor xenografts in nude mice. The tumor was visible on PET 1 h after injection, with uptake of 1% of the injected dose. Biodistribution studies in K562-bearing mice were also performed, and the uptake of (18)F-SKI696 (percentage injected dose per gram) for each organ was calculated. CONCLUSION: The results of the binding assay showed that SKI696 has selectivity and binding affinity comparable to imatinib. Small-animal PET of K562 tumor-bearing mice using (18)F-SKI696 as a PET agent displayed promising tumor uptake and tumor-to-nontarget contrast. Because (18)F-SKI696 has been taken up in vivo by tumors that overexpress Bcr-Abl, we are exploring a possible role for identifying tumors that will respond to imatinib before therapy.","['Glekas, Athanasios P', 'Pillarsetty, Nagavara Kishore', 'Punzalan, Blesida', 'Khan, Nahida', 'Smith-Jones, Peter', 'Larson, Steven M']","['Glekas AP', 'Pillarsetty NK', 'Punzalan B', 'Khan N', 'Smith-Jones P', 'Larson SM']","['Radiochemistry Service, Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA. glekasa@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['P50 CA086438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA86438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA83084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA083084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray/methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Piperazines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",PMC4429778,['NIHMS681817'],2011/07/19 06:00,2011/10/08 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['jnumed.110.085050 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.110.085050 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2011 Aug;52(8):1301-7. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.110.085050.

Although therapeutic targeting of most leukemia fusion proteins remains elusive, the posttranslational modifications that control their function could be targetable. We found that AML1-ETO, the fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation, is acetylated by the transcriptional coactivator p300 in leukemia cells isolated from t(8;21) AML patients, and that this acetylation is essential for its self-renewal-promoting effects in human cord blood CD34(+) cells and its leukemogenicity in mouse models. Inhibition of p300 abrogates the acetylation of AML1-ETO and impairs its ability to promote leukemic transformation. Thus, lysine acetyltransferases represent a potential therapeutic target in AML.","['Wang, Lan', 'Gural, Alexander', 'Sun, Xiao-Jian', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Perna, Fabiana', 'Huang, Gang', 'Hatlen, Megan A', 'Vu, Ly', 'Liu, Fan', 'Xu, Haiming', 'Asai, Takashi', 'Xu, Hao', 'Deblasio, Tony', 'Menendez, Silvia', 'Voza, Francesca', 'Jiang, Yanwen', 'Cole, Philip A', 'Zhang, Jinsong', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Roeder, Robert G', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Wang L', 'Gural A', 'Sun XJ', 'Zhao X', 'Perna F', 'Huang G', 'Hatlen MA', 'Vu L', 'Liu F', 'Xu H', 'Asai T', 'Xu H', 'Deblasio T', 'Menendez S', 'Voza F', 'Jiang Y', 'Cole PA', 'Zhang J', 'Melnick A', 'Roeder RG', 'Nimer SD']","['Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM062437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM062437-12/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM062437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM62437/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/chemistry/*metabolism', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Preleukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC3251012,['NIHMS343716'],2011/07/19 06:00,2011/08/19 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['science.1201662 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1201662 [doi]']",ppublish,Science. 2011 Aug 5;333(6043):765-9. doi: 10.1126/science.1201662.

Studies of FeLV infection in a cohort of naturally infected cats were undertaken to examine FeLV variation, the selective pressures operative in FeLV infection that lead to predominance of natural variants, and the consequences for infection and disease progression. A unique variant, designated FeLV-945, was identified as the predominant isolate in the cohort and was associated with non-T-cell diseases including multicentric lymphoma. FeLV-945 was assigned to the FeLV-A subgroup based on sequence analysis and receptor utilization, but was shown to differ in sequence from a prototype member of FeLV-A, designated FeLV-A/61E, in the long terminal repeat (LTR) and the surface glycoprotein gene (SU). A unique sequence motif in the FeLV-945 LTR was shown to function as a transcriptional enhancer and to confer a replicative advantage. The FeLV-945 SU protein was observed to differ in sequence as compared to FeLV-A/61E within functional domains known to determine receptor selection and binding. Experimental infection of newborn cats was performed using wild type FeLV-A/61E or recombinant FeLV-A/61E in which the LTR (61E/945L) or LTR and SU (61E/945SL) were exchanged for that of FeLV-945. Infection with either FeLV-A/61E or 61E/945L resulted in T-cell lymphoma of the thymus, although 61E/945L caused disease significantly more rapidly. In contrast, infection with 61E/945SL resulted in the rapid induction of a multicentric lymphoma of B-cell origin, thus recapitulating the outcome of natural infection and implicating FeLV-945 SU as a determinant of disease outcome. Recombinant FeLV-B was detected infrequently and at low levels in multicentric lymphomas, and was thereby not implicated in disease induction. Preliminary studies of receptor interaction indicated that virus particles bearing FeLV-945 SU bind to the FeLV-A receptor more efficiently than do particles bearing FeLV-A/61E SU, and that soluble SU proteins expressed from the viruses demonstrate the same differential binding phenotype. Preliminary mutational analysis of FeLV-945 was performed by exchanging regions containing either the primary receptor binding determinant, VRA, the secondary determinant, VRB, or a proline-rich region, PRR, with that of FeLV-A/61E. Results implicated a region containing VRA as a minor contributor, while a region containing VRB largely conferred increased binding efficiency.","['Bolin, Lisa L', 'Ahmad, Shamim', 'Levy, Laura S']","['Bolin LL', 'Ahmad S', 'Levy LS']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, 1430 Tulane Avenue SL-38, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA083823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083823-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA083823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Feline/immunology/*virology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Virus/immunology']",PMC3167950,['NIHMS303361'],2011/07/19 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(11)00212-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2011 Oct 15;143(3-4):221-6. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.015.

We tested the hypothesis that IPC may improve the survival of transplanted cells and enhance their therapeutic effects. In this study, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) from Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with lentivirus carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. The left main coronary arteries of rats were occluded for a 30-min ischemia, followed by a 72 h or 28 d reperfusion. IPC was induced by 3 cycles of 10s reperfusion and 10s ischemia before sustained reperfusion. GFP-BMSCs were intramyocardially injected at 2h reperfusion. At 70 h after transplantation, IPC treatment increased the level of interleukin-10, B-cell leukemia-lymphoma-2 (BCL-2), and vascular endothelial and basic fibroblast growth factor (VEGF and bFGF), and decreased the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta and BCL-2-associated X protein by ELISA or PCR or western blotting. The BMSCs therapy with IPC produced more surviving GFP-positive cells than the BMSCs therapy alone by fluorescent staining [at 70 h, (90 +/- 14)/mm(2) vs. (61 +/- 12)/mm(2), and at 28 days, (55 +/- 14)/mm(2) vs. (26 +/- 8)/mm(2), P<0.01, respectively]. At 28 days, it, when compared with the Control, IPC treatment, and BMSCs therapy, demonstrated higher left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiography (62%+/- 8%, 69%+/- 6%, and 75%+/- 4% vs. 82%+/- 4%, P<0.05, respectively), higher expression of VEGF and bFGF by western blotting and PCR, less myocardial fibrosis by Masson's trichrome staining, and higher capillary density by immunohistochemistry.

The inv(16)(p13q22) results in a fusion gene comprising the 5'CBFB gene and the 3'MYH11 gene on the short arm of chromosome 16. The fusion gene interferes with the normal transcription of the CBFA/CBFB heterodimer and disrupts myeloid differentiation. The inv(16) is associated with a good prognosis. The inv(16) with deletion of the 3'CBFB region of the gene is a very rare occurrence. Although the number of cases is small, inv(16) with a deleted 3'CBFB seems to be associated with a poorer prognosis than that generally associated with inv(16). Our patient was a 30-year-old man with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia who was found to have a CBFB-MYH11 fusion by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The high blast count and lack of differentiation were not typical for this entity and suggested clonal progression. The initial karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis, in all metaphases examined, was 46,XY,del(7)(q32),del(16)(q22). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with a dual-color, break-apart probe corresponding to the CBFB gene locus (Abbott, Des Plaines, IL) showed a derivative chromosome 16 resulting from an inversion of the CBFB gene with a deletion of the 3'CBFB probe region. Oligonucleotide array comparative genetic hybridization analysis was performed on this patient's diagnostic bone marrow DNA referenced to a normal male control DNA by using the DNAarray Heme Profile (CombiMatrix Diagnostics, Irvine, CA) microarray. This analysis showed a 1.2 Mb loss of 16q22.1, which did not include loss of the 3'CBFB gene locus, but rather sequences distal to this locus.

This raises a series of questions regarding the clinical characterization of mixed leukemia, whether this diagnosis possesses unique cytogenetic abnormalities, and the possible association between AML and CLL cell clones. The current study attempts to answer these questions by evaluating an 80-year-old man with concurrent diagnoses of AML-M0 and CLL. Routine G-banded chromosome, array based comparative genomic hybridization, and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses were used to characterize complex chromosomal rearrangements in the patient's bone marrow. Novel complex translocations involving chromosomes 2, 5, and 11, as well as submicroscopic deletions and duplications, were revealed. This case study reports a t(2;5;11) in either AML-M0 or in CLL by using array based comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses to facilitate the diagnosis.

Focal adhesion complexes act as sites of integration for both cytoskeletal organization and integrin signaling at the cell surface. Here, we show that talin-1 and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during retroviral infection. Transient overexpression of either talin-1 or vinculin reduced the susceptibility of human cells to infection with pseudotyped human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus. In contrast, transient short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of talin-1 or vinculin increased infection by pseudotyped HIV-1 and simian immunodeficiency virus, demonstrating that the endogenous forms of these proteins also impaired retroviral infection. Talin-1 or vinculin overexpression inhibited infection by retroviruses that entered the cell by either fusion or endocytosis, while analysis of HIV-1 DNA synthesis demonstrated that the block occurred early in infection and prior to the initiation of reverse transcription. Both factors retained antiviral activity in the presence of actin or microtubule depolymerizing agents. Finally, talin-1 and vinculin expression was found to negatively influence tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a major focal adhesion scaffolding protein whose transient knockdown decreased pseudotyped HIV-1 infection. Together, these findings demonstrate that talin-1 and vinculin negatively affect tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin, a novel positive regulator of HIV-1 infection, and impose an early block to infection by distinct retroviruses.","['Brown, Craig', 'Morham, Scott G', 'Walsh, Derek', 'Naghavi, Mojgan H']","['Brown C', 'Morham SG', 'Walsh D', 'Naghavi MH']","['Centre for Research in Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine and Medical Science, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Talin)', '125361-02-6 (Vinculin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Focal Adhesions/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HIV Infections/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Paxillin/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Talin/*metabolism', 'Vinculin/*metabolism', 'Virus Internalization']",,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(11)00379-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2011.03.076 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2011 Jul 29;410(5):761-77. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2011.03.076.,,,,,,,,,['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,

Malignancy conveys an increased risk for thrombosis and chemotherapy further elevates this risk. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly defined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was treated with commonly used anthracycline chemotherapeutics at concentrations similar to those found in the plasma of cancer patients. Cells were analyzed for tissue factor (TF) mRNA, protein, and activity. Microparticle (MP) TF activity was also measured. Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on cells and MPs was analyzed by flow cytometry. PS levels on MPs was also evaluated in an annexin V capture assay. RESULTS: Anthracycline treatment of THP-1 cells resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in cellular TF activity without a change in TF protein, which was associated with increased PS exposure on the cell surface and apoptosis. The increase in TF activity was abolished by annexin V or lactadherin indicating that PS exposure was required. Anthracycline treatment of THP-1 cells also increased the number of TF-positive MPs. CONCLUSION: Treatment of THP-1 cells with anthracyclines induces apoptosis and increases cellular TF activity. The increased activity required an increase in exposure of PS. Additionally, anthracyclines increase the release of TF-positive MPs from THP-1 cells. We propose that the increase in cellular TF activity in circulating leukemic cells, combined with increased numbers of TF-positive MPs, may contribute to thrombosis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.","['Boles, Jeremiah C', 'Williams, Julie C', 'Hollingsworth, Rachel M', 'Wang, Jian-Guo', 'Glover, Sam L', 'Owens, A Phillip 3rd', 'Barcel, David A', 'Kasthuri, Raj S', 'Key, Nigel S', 'Mackman, Nigel']","['Boles JC', 'Williams JC', 'Hollingsworth RM', 'Wang JG', 'Glover SL', 'Owens AP 3rd', 'Barcel DA', 'Kasthuri RS', 'Key NS', 'Mackman N']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.']",['eng'],['R01-HL095096/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylserines/*metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/19 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2010/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']","['S0049-3848(11)00336-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.thromres.2011.06.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2012 Feb;129(2):197-203. doi: 10.1016/j.thromres.2011.06.022.

Among these are the structural proteins that are translated as the gag polyprotein. In order to become infectious, HIV must undergo a maturation process mediated by the proteolytic cleavage of gag to give rise to the isolated structural protein matrix, capsid (CA), nucleocapsid as well as p6 and spacer peptides 1 and 2. Upon maturation, the 13 N-terminal residues from CA fold into a beta-hairpin, which is stabilized mainly by a salt bridge between Pro1 and Asp51. Previous reports have shown that non-formation of the salt bridge, which potentially disrupts proper beta-hairpin arrangement, generates noninfectious virus or aberrant cores. To date, however, there is no consensus on the role of the beta-hairpin. In order to shed light in this subject, we have generated mutations in the hairpin region to examine what features would be crucial for the beta-hairpin's role in retroviral mature core formation. These features include the importance of the proline at the N-terminus, the amino acid sequence, and the physical structure of the beta-hairpin itself. The presented experiments provide biochemical evidence that beta-hairpin formation plays an important role in regard to CA protein conformation required to support proper mature core arrangement. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange and in vitro assembly reactions illustrated the importance of the beta-hairpin structure, its dynamics, and its influence on the orientation of helix 1 for the assembly of the mature CA lattice.","['Cortines, Juliana R', 'Monroe, Eric B', 'Kang, Sebyung', 'Prevelige, Peter E Jr']","['Cortines JR', 'Monroe EB', 'Kang S', 'Prevelige PE Jr']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['eng'],"['F32GM087994/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI044626/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044626-09/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI044626/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM087994/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Capsid Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Deuterium Exchange Measurement', 'HIV-1/*chemistry/pathogenicity/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Proteins/*chemistry', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Virion/chemistry/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Virus Assembly/drug effects/*physiology']",PMC3139139,['NIHMS290528'],2011/07/19 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0022-2836(11)00341-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2011.03.052 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2011 Jul 22;410(4):641-52. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2011.03.052.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, information about TWEAK in dermatological diseases is limited. Herein, we investigated the role of TWEAK in patients with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) and the ability of TWEAK on chemokine production in the human dermal microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1). Serum TWEAK levels in patients with HSP, together with patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PV) and atopic dermatitis (AD), were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). HMEC-1 cells were treated with TWEAK at concentrations ranging from 1 ng/ml to 100 ng/ml. Serum levels of TWEAK were elevated in patients with HSP in the acute stage but not in patients with PV or AD. Moreover, TWEAK levels were correlated with the severity of HSP. TWEAK markedly induced CCL5 and CXCL8 production at both mRNA and protein levels in HMEC-1 cells. In addition, TWEAK-stimulated HMEC-1 supernatant enhanced HL-60 or human acute monocytic leukaemia cell line (THP-1) cell migration. Finally, Western blot data revealed that TWEAK can induce rapid phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappaB-alpha (IkappaBalpha) in HMEC-1 cells. In conclusion, we show that serum levels of TWEAK were elevated in patients with acute stage HSP. TWEAK may act as a regulator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation and chemokine production in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, thus promoting leucocyte migration in cutaneous vasculitis.","['Chen, T', 'Guo, Z-P', 'Li, M-M', 'Li, J-Y', 'Jiao, X-Y', 'Zhang, Y-H', 'Liu, H-J']","['Chen T', 'Guo ZP', 'Li MM', 'Li JY', 'Jiao XY', 'Zhang YH', 'Liu HJ']","['Department of Dermatovenereology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (CCL5 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Cytokine TWEAK)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNFSF12 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL5/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytokine TWEAK', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'IgA Vasculitis/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Inflammation/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Male', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Psoriasis/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/immunology', '*Skin/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/biosynthesis/*immunology/pharmacology']",PMC3193920,,2011/07/19 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.2011.04442.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2011 Oct;166(1):64-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2011.04442.x.

It is based on the simultaneous evaluation of the statistical significance of the maximum likelihood ratio test statistic over a large collection of potential clusters.

For example, using a fixed maximum geographic radius for clusters, urban areas typically have many overlapping potential clusters, whereas rural areas have relatively few. The spatial scan statistic does not account for local multiplicity variation. We describe a previously proposed local multiplicity adjustment based on a nested Bonferroni correction and propose a novel adjustment based on a Gumbel distribution approximation to the distribution of a local scan statistic. We compare the performance of all three statistics in terms of power and a novel unbiased cluster detection criterion.

The inhibition of proteasomal activity by specific proteasome inhibitors or cross-reactivity of certain protease inhibitors with proteasomal enzymes recently became of interest because of the anti-tumoral properties of these agents. We tested the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir on human cervical cancer cells. Both drugs induced cell cycle arrest in cervical cancer cells, as reflected by marked changes in the expression of cell cycle-regulatory cyclins and ensuing mitochondrial-independent apoptosis. Upregulation of the molecular chaperone BiP and the cell stress marker ATF3 indicated induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) as the main cause of apoptosis induced by these drugs in cervical cancer cells. Unlike in leukemia cells, bortezomib mainly inhibited the caspase-like activity of the proteasome in cervical cancer cells. Nelfinavir exhibited no effects on proteasomal activity in cervical cancer cells and leukemia cells. Although both bortezomib and nelfinavir acted on cisplatin-resistant cervical cancer cells (SiHa), neither of the drugs induced a sensitization to cisplatin treatment. Instead, both drugs could effectively be combined with each other, and enhanced the efficacy of an apoptosis-inducing TRAIL receptor antibody. These results suggest that both bortezomib and nelfinavir are effective agents against chemoresistant cervical cancer cells and might be of interest for clinical studies on cervical cancer patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer.","['Bruning, A', 'Vogel, M', 'Mylonas, I', 'Friese, K', 'Burges, A']","['Bruning A', 'Vogel M', 'Mylonas I', 'Friese K', 'Burges A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Campus Innenstadt, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany. ansgar.bruening@med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (HIV Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'HO3OGH5D7I (Nelfinavir)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'HIV Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Nelfinavir/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology']",,,2011/07/19 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2010/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['EPub-Abstract-CCDT-148 [pii]', '10.2174/156800911796798913 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2011 Sep;11(7):799-809. doi: 10.2174/156800911796798913.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypermethylation of DNA generally results in decreased expression of tumor suppressor genes and defective cell cycle control. This is a hallmark of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia. Fortunately, epigenetic changes are potentially reversible and thus remain an attractive target for anticancer therapy. Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase cause demethylation of DNA and exert their activity in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia with good safety profile.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy in children and is characterized by numerous epigenetic abnormalities. These epigenetic changes correspond to repressed activity of some genes and inappropriate activation of others. In contrast to genetic alterations stemming from mutations, deletions or translocation, epigenetic changes are relatively reversible when treated with certain small molecule-based anticancer agents. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI) are a class of drugs capable of modifying the epigenetic status of ALL cells. Several recent preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the potential of HDI as therapeutic agents in ALL. This review summarizes recent studies on (1) the principles of epigenetics and their importance in ALL tumorigenesis; (2) the structure, mechanism of action and anti-tumor activity of HDI; (3) the first comprehensive summary of data from preclinical and clinical studies for HDI as the therapeutic agents for ALL; and (4) novel directions for future research on HDI and ALL.","['Mummery, A', 'Narendran, A', 'Lee, K-Y']","['Mummery A', 'Narendran A', 'Lee KY']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta T2N 4N1, Canada.']",['eng'],['82788-1/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Histone Deacetylases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics']",PMC3855493,['CAMS3770'],2011/07/19 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/07/19 06:00'],"['2011/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['EPub-Abstract-CCDT-152 [pii]', '10.2174/156800911796798922 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2011 Sep;11(7):882-93. doi: 10.2174/156800911796798922.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: CAMS3770'],,

The intracellular levels of ceramide are highly regulated via complex metabolic pathways. Sphingomyelin synthases (SMS) 1 and 2 convert ceramide to sphingomyelin (SM), a ubiquitous phospholipid in mammals. A growing body of evidence in the literature indicates that SMSs likely modulate hematological cell growth and sensitivity to stress-induced apoptosis. On one hand, complete and sustained inhibition of SMS activity is likely to alter membrane composition and properties through membrane SM depletion, perturbing intracellular signaling pathways and leukemia cell growth and conferring partial resistance to death receptor ligands. On the other hand, different patents & reports point to anti-apoptotic functions for SMSs. In patients with chemoresistant leukemia, a decreased intracellular ceramide level was associated with a higher SMS activity.

DIAGNOSIS: Hypereosinophilia has generally been defined as a peripheral blood eosinophil count greater than 1,500/mm(3) and may be associated with tissue damage. After exclusion of secondary causes of eosinophilia, diagnostic evaluation of primary eosinophilias relies on a combination of morphologic review of the blood and marrow, standard cytogenetics, fluorescent in situ-hybridization, flow immunocytometry, and T-cell clonality assessment to detect histopathologic or clonal evidence for an acute or chronic myeloid or lymphoproliferative disorder. RISK STRATIFICATION: Disease prognosis relies on identifying the subtype of eosinophilia. After evaluation of secondary causes of eosinophilia, the 2008 World Health Organization establishes a semi-molecular classification scheme of disease subtypes including myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, not otherwise specified (CEL, NOS), lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia, and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which is a diagnosis of exclusion. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: The goal of therapy is to mitigate eosinophil-mediated organ damage. For patients with milder forms of eosinophilia (e.g. < 1,500/mm(3) ) without symptoms or signs of organ involvement, a watch and wait approach with close-follow-up may be undertaken. Identification of rearranged PDGFRA or PDGFRB is critical because of the exquisite responsiveness of these diseases to imatinib. Corticosteroids are first-line therapy for patients with lymphocyte-variant hypereosinophilia and HES. Hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha have demonstrated efficacy as initial treatment and steroid-refractory cases of HES. In addition to hydroxyurea, second line cytotoxic chemotherapy agents and hematopoietic cell transplant have been used for aggressive forms of HES and CEL with outcomes reported for limited numbers of patients. Although clinical trials have been performed with anti IL-5 (mepolizumab) and anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) antibodies, their therapeutic niche in primary eosinophilic diseases and HES have yet to be established.","['Gotlib, Jason']",['Gotlib J'],"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine/Stanford Cancer Center, Stanford, California 94305-5821, USA. jason.gotlib@stanford.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Eosinophilia/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'World Health Organization']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2011/09/21 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22062 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2011 Aug;86(8):677-88. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22062.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

Relapsed patients often acquire deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del[17p]), which are closely associated with tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations. Wild-type p53 up-regulates and activates B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2)-associated X protein (BAX), and it down-regulates and inactivates BCL-2. The small-molecule BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-737 induces apoptosis in a BAX-dependent and BCL-2 homologous antagonist-killer (BAK)-dependent manner. The role of p53 in sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL-2 inhibition has not been extensively investigated. METHODS: The authors investigated the association of del(17p) with ABT-737 sensitivity in CLL cells from 50 patients. Stable p53 and BAX knockdown cells were used for mechanistic studies. RESULTS: CLL cells with del(17p) were less sensitive to ABT-737-induced BAX activation and apoptosis than CLL cells without del(17p) (39% +/- 7.3% vs 63.7% +/- 2.9% [specific annexin V induction]; P < .01). A positive correlation between the degrees of apoptosis induced by ABT-737 and by the p53-activating binding protein homolog murine double minute (MDM2) antagonist nutlin-3a (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.75; P < .0001) was observed.

METHODS: The authors analyzed 82 patients with AML who were diagnosed according to World Health Organization criteria. The median patient age was 72 years (range, 29-87 years), and 27 patients (33%) had secondary AML. Of 62 patients with evaluable cytogenetics, 18 patients (29%) had a poor-risk karyotype, and 44 patients (71%) had an intermediate karyotype. Thirty-five patients (43%) received azacitidine as front-line treatment, and 47 patients (57%) had previously received 1 or more line of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 32% (26 of 82 patients) and included 12 (15%) complete remissions (CRs), 4 (5%) CRs with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), and 10 (12%) partial responses (PRs). Responses were observed more frequently among untreated patients compared with pretreated patients; in fact, 17 of 35 untreated patients (48%) responded, including 11 responses (31%) classified as CR/CRi. Conversely, only 9 of 47 pretreated patients (19%) responded, including 5 responses (11%) that were classified as CR/Cri. The response rate was significantly higher for untreated patients (P = .006) and those who had white blood cell counts <10 x 10(9) /L (P = .006). For untreated patients who achieved a response, the median overall response duration was 13 months, and the 1-year and 2-years overall survival rates were 58% and 24%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that azacitidine promises to be an effective therapy for elderly patients with untreated AML and with white blood cell counts <10 x 10(9) /L.","['Maurillo, Luca', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Spagnoli, Alessandra', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Oliva, Esther', 'Lunghi, Monia', ""D'Arco, Alfonso M"", 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Pastore, Domenico', 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Santagostino, Alberto', 'Pavone, Vincenzo', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","['Maurillo L', 'Venditti A', 'Spagnoli A', 'Gaidano G', 'Ferrero D', 'Oliva E', 'Lunghi M', ""D'Arco AM"", 'Levis A', 'Pastore D', 'Di Renzo N', 'Santagostino A', 'Pavone V', 'Buccisano F', 'Musto P']","['Institute of Hematology, Tor Vergata Foundation Polyclinic, Rome, Italy. luca.maurillo@uniroma2.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2012/04/17 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26354 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Feb 15;118(4):1014-22. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26354.

Immune-reconstituted mice that receive a tumor vaccine mount more efficient anti-tumor immune responses compared with control mice. In the present study, we evaluated the anti-tumor immune responses in immune-reconstituted mice vaccinated with inactivated leukemia cells and explored the mechanisms underlying these immune responses. Test C57BL/6 mice were lymphodepleted by irradiation and immune-reconstituted with naive mouse spleen lymphocytes. Mice were then injected with an inactivated FBL-3 tumor cell vaccine and challenged with FBL-3 tumor cells. Anti-tumor responses were evaluated by determining the rate of tumor formation, latency, tumor size, interferon gamma levels, and macrophage and CTL cytotoxicities. When challenged with tumor cells, immune-reconstituted, vaccinated mice exhibited a significantly lower mortality, smaller average tumor volume, and a significantly longer mean survival time. They had more robust cellular immunity, reflected by higher levels of INF-gamma production and higher macrophage- and CTL-mediated cytotoxicities. Our results suggest that immune reconstitution enhanced the anti-tumor immune responses in mice injected with a tumor vaccine via generation of CTLs. These results have important implications for immunotherapy used for leukemia.","['He, Aili', 'Zhang, Wanggang', 'Xu, Kangling', 'Wang, Jianli', 'Yang, Yun', 'Chao, Xingmei']","['He A', 'Zhang W', 'Xu K', 'Wang J', 'Yang Y', 'Chao X']","[""Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710004 Shaanxi Province, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0024-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2261-9. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0024-8.

We report a case of rhinoorbital mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus oryzae in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient and review the 79 Mucormycosis cases reported in the last decade from Turkey. In our case, the diagnosis was made with endoscopic appearance, computerized tomography of the paranasal sinuses, and culture of the surgical materials. Following aggressive surgical debridement and parenteral amphotericin B therapy, the patient recovered completely. In Turkish literature, rhinocerebral manifestations were the most common form of the mucormycosis (64 cases), followed by pulmonary form (6 cases). The most common risk factor was hematologic malignancies (32 cases) and diabetes mellitus (32 cases), similar to those reported from the rest of the world. The etiologic agents responsible for the review cases were Rhizopus sp., Mucor spp., Rhizomucor spp., Rhizopus oryzae, Mucor circinelloides, and Lichtheimia corymbifera. Although various treatment modalities were used, amphotericin B was the mainstay of therapy. Mortality rate was found to be 49.4% in review cases. It seems that strong clinical suspicion and early diagnosis, along with aggressive antifungal therapy and endoscopic sinus surgery, have great importance for better prognosis in mucormycosis.","['Gumral, Ramazan', 'Yildizoglu, Uzeyir', 'Saracli, Mehmet Ali', 'Kaptan, Kursat', 'Tosun, Fuat', 'Yildiran, Sinasi Taner']","['Gumral R', 'Yildizoglu U', 'Saracli MA', 'Kaptan K', 'Tosun F', 'Yildiran ST']","['Department of Microbiology, Gulhane Military Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey, rgumral@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Mycopathologia,Mycopathologia,7505689,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 5.8S)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mucormycosis/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', '*Paranasal Sinus Diseases/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Paranasal Sinuses/microbiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 5.8S', '*Rhizopus/drug effects/genetics/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Turkey']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2010/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11046-011-9449-z [doi]'],ppublish,Mycopathologia. 2011 Nov;172(5):397-405. doi: 10.1007/s11046-011-9449-z.

To elucidate its role we analyzed 120 patients with CML for methylation of promoter-associated CpG islands of 10 genes. Five genes were identified by DNA methylation screening in the K562 cell line and 3 genes in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. The CDKN2B gene was selected for its frequent methylation in myeloid malignancies and ABL1 as the target of BCR-ABL translocation. Thirty patients were imatinib-naive (mostly treated by interferon-alpha before the imatinib era), 30 were imatinib-responsive, 50 were imatinib-resistant, and 10 were imatinib-intolerant. We quantified DNA methylation by bisulfite pyrosequencing. The average number of methylated genes was 4.5 per patient in the chronic phase, increasing significantly to 6.2 in the accelerated and 6.4 in the blastic phase. Higher numbers of methylated genes were also observed in patients resistant or intolerant to imatinib. These patients also showed almost exclusive methylation of a putative transporter OSCP1. Abnormal methylation of a Src suppressor gene PDLIM4 was associated with shortened survival independently of CML stage and imatinib responsiveness. We conclude that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with CML progression and that DNA methylation could be a marker associated with imatinib resistance. Finally, DNA methylation of PDLIM4 may help identify a subset of CML patients that would benefit from treatment with Src/Abl inhibitors.","['Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Gharibyan, Vazganush', 'Estecio, Marcos R H', 'Kondo, Kimie', 'He, Rong', 'Chung, Woonbok', 'Lu, Yue', 'Zhang, Nianxiang', 'Liang, Shoudan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Jelinek J', 'Gharibyan V', 'Estecio MR', 'Kondo K', 'He R', 'Chung W', 'Lu Y', 'Zhang N', 'Liang S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes JE', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America. jjelinek@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA046939/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2P01CA049639-20A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K25 CA123344/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects/*genetics', '*Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3132778,,2011/07/16 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0022110 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-00812 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e22110. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0022110.

The antileukemia potential of BJO was investigated in human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (AML) U937 and HL-60 in vitro and in a mouse U937 xenograft tumor model. BJO induced AML cell apoptosis through activation of caspase-8 and modulation of apoptosis-related proteins. Meanwhile, the inhibition of survivin and XIAP increased the cytotoxicity of BJO. Consistent with these findings, BJO also increased subG(1) phase cells and cause PARP cleavage in AML patients' leukemia cells. In contrast, only weak cytotoxicity of BJO was found in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of healthy volunteers. Moreover, oleic acid and linoleic acid were found to be the active components of BJO. Our study provided strong evidence for the first time that BJO induced apoptosis of both cultured and primary AML cells. Furthermore, intravenous injection of BJO significantly inhibited U937 tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model.

Interestingly, for three of these genes, that is, ankyrin repeat domain 28 (ANKRD28), guanine nucleotide binding protein, alpha 15 (GNA15) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase 2 (UGP2), a high transcript level was associated with a significant poorer overall survival (OS) in two independent cohorts (n=163 and n=218) of normal karyotype AML. Importantly, the prognostic value of the continuous transcript levels of ANKRD28 (OS hazard ratio (HR): 1.32, P=0.008), GNA15 (OS HR: 1.22, P=0.033) and UGP2 (OS HR: 1.86, P=0.009) was shown to be independent from the well-known risk factors FLT3-ITD, NPM1c(+) and CEBPA mutation status.","['de Jonge, H J M', 'Woolthuis, C M', 'Vos, A Z', 'Mulder, A', 'van den Berg, E', 'Kluin, P M', 'van der Weide, K', 'de Bont, E S J M', 'Huls, G', 'Vellenga, E', 'Schuringa, J J']","['de Jonge HJ', 'Woolthuis CM', 'Vos AZ', 'Mulder A', 'van den Berg E', 'Kluin PM', 'van der Weide K', 'de Bont ES', 'Huls G', 'Vellenga E', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011172 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Dec;25(12):1825-33. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.172.

Recent advances in ontogeny and classification.,441-8,10.1097/CCO.0b013e328349ab8d [doi],"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Indolent B-cell lymphomas that are supposed to derive from marginal zone encompass three distinct entities: extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) or mucosa-associated lymphatic tissue (MALT), nodal MZL (NMZL) and splenic MZL (SMZL). Although MALT lymphoma is well characterized and extensively studied at the clinical and molecular levels, SMZL and NMZL remain incompletely characterized. However, during the last years, the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of SMZL has been clarified. The recent 2008 WHO classification has maintained the distinction between the three diseases according to the organ where it arises and introduced a new provisional category of unclassified splenic lymphoma for overlapping entities, splenic diffuse red pulp lymphoma (SDRPL) and hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-V). RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings in SMZL contributed to a better characterization, including the few cases associated with hepatitis C, the recurrence of 7q deletion and the possibility of CD5 expression. Furthermore, the peculiar pattern of immunoglobulin heavy chain genes mutations and the biased usage of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHV)1-2 segment are suggestive of a T-independent antigen driven proliferation, at least at initial steps. This review will focus on recent findings and differential diagnosis with SDRPL and HCL-V.

A symptom checklist helps facilitate this process. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to calibrate a child-friendly, clinically usable checklist capturing symptom occurrence and severity; a secondary objective was to examine age group differences: 5 to 11 years (n = 222) and 12 to 17 years (n = 163) and sex differences: males (54%) and females (46%), and correlate symptom severity, functional status, and quality of life. METHODS: Three hundred eighty-five children/adolescents at 5 university-affiliated outpatient oncology clinics: central, western, eastern, southeastern United States. Diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (45%), solid tumors (14%), nervous system tumors (18%), and others (23%). Principal component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, correlational statistics, t test, Wilcoxon test were performed. RESULTS: (a) Robust 30-item checklist, 7 factors; (b) 14 of 30 symptoms reported by at least 40% of patients. Top 5 are feeling sluggish (77%), nausea (72%), appetite loss (66%), irritable (61%), and vomiting (54%). (c) Sixteen of 30 symptoms reported at severity 2 or greater: ""quite a bit."" (d) Therapy-Related Symptom Checklist-Children (TRSC-C) scores are as follows: range, 0 to 89; mean, 25.14 (SD, 18.68). (e) Cronbach alpha = .9106. (f) Older children reported greater symptom severities: TRSC-C (t = 2.73, P = .003). (g) There were no sex differences on the TRSC-C total score. (h) Lansky correlations with TRSC-C (r = -0.32; P = .02); factors: nutrition related (r = -0.36; P = .05); oropharyngeal (r = -0.51; P = .0002); and respiratory (r = - 0.25; P = .06). (i) Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory correlation with TRSC-C (r = -0.68; P = .0001). CONCLUSION: The new TRSC-C has good measurement properties and is ready for use in clinics and research. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Use of the TRSC-C is consistent with guidelines emphasizing self-report of patient symptoms, shared patient decision making, and improved communications among patients, clinicians, and significant others.","['Williams, Phoebe D', 'Williams, Arthur R', 'Kelly, Katherine P', 'Dobos, Carol', 'Gieseking, Annie', 'Connor, Renee', 'Ridder, Lavonne', 'Potter, Nancy', 'Del Favero, Deborah']","['Williams PD', 'Williams AR', 'Kelly KP', 'Dobos C', 'Gieseking A', 'Connor R', 'Ridder L', 'Potter N', 'Del Favero D']","['School of Nursing, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA. pwilliam@kumc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescent', 'Appetite', 'Checklist/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Irritable Mood', 'Male', 'Nausea/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*therapy', 'Quality of Life', '*Self Report', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Vomiting/etiology']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2012/04/25 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0b013e31821a51f6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2012 Mar-Apr;35(2):89-98. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e31821a51f6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These programs often involve RNA-binding proteins that associate with their mRNA targets to elicit changes in mRNA stability and/or translation. The RNA-binding protein IMP-3 is an oncofetal protein overexpressed in many human malignancies. IMP-3 abundance correlates with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. As such, IMP-3 is proving to be a highly significant biomarker in surgical pathology. Among its many mRNA targets, IMP-3 binds to and promotes translation of insulin-like growth factor II (IGFII) mRNA. Our earlier studies showed that reducing IMP-3 abundance with siRNAs reduced proliferation of human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells because of reduced IGF-II biosynthesis. However, the role of IMP-3 in apoptosis is unknown. Here, we have used IR-induced apoptosis of K562 cells as a model to explore a role for IMP-3 in cell survival. Knockdown of IMP-3 with siRNA increased susceptibility of cells to IR-induced apoptosis and led to reduced IGF-II production. Gene reporter assays revealed that IMP-3 acts through the 5' UTR of IGFII mRNA during apoptosis to promote translation. Finally, culture of IR-treated cells with recombinant IGF-II partially reversed the effects of IMP-3 knockdown on IR-induced apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that IMP-3 acts in part through the IGF-II pathway to promote cell survival in response to IR. Thus, IMP-3 might serve as a new drug target to increase sensitivity of CML cells or other cancers to IR therapy.","['Liao, Baisong', 'Hu, Yan', 'Brewer, Gary']","['Liao B', 'Hu Y', 'Brewer G']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA052443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA052443-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ACIN1 protein, human)', '0 (IGF2BP3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protective Agents', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction/*radiation effects']",PMC3173139,,2011/07/16 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)72224-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.263913 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Sep 9;286(36):31145-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.263913.

Importantly, menin also serves as a critical oncogenic cofactor of MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) fusion proteins in acute leukemias. Direct association of menin with MLL fusion proteins is required for MLL fusion protein-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo, and this interaction has been validated as a new potential therapeutic target for development of novel anti-leukemia agents. Here, we report the first crystal structure of menin homolog from Nematostella vectensis. Due to a very high sequence similarity, the Nematostella menin is a close homolog of human menin, and these two proteins likely have very similar structures. Menin is predominantly an alpha-helical protein with the protein core comprising three tetratricopeptide motifs that are flanked by two alpha-helical bundles and covered by a beta-sheet motif. A very interesting feature of menin structure is the presence of a large central cavity that is highly conserved between Nematostella and human menin. By employing site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that this cavity constitutes the binding site for MLL. Our data provide a structural basis for understanding the role of menin as a tumor suppressor protein and as an oncogenic co-factor of MLL fusion proteins. It also provides essential structural information for development of inhibitors targeting the menin-MLL interaction as a novel therapeutic strategy in MLL-related leukemias.","['Murai, Marcelo J', 'Chruszcz, Maksymilian', 'Reddy, Gireesh', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz']","['Murai MJ', 'Chruszcz M', 'Reddy G', 'Grembecka J', 'Cierpicki T']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA160467/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sea Anemones', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",PMC3173070,,2011/07/16 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)72282-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.258186 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Sep 9;286(36):31742-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.258186.

Additional events are often required for AML1 dysfunction to induce full-blown leukemia; however, a mechanistic basis of their cooperation is still elusive. Here, we investigated the effect of AML1 deficiency on the development of MLL-ENL leukemia in mice. Aml1 excised bone marrow cells lead to MLL-ENL leukemia with shorter duration than Aml1 intact cells in vivo. Although the number of MLL-ENL leukemia-initiating cells is not affected by loss of AML1, the proliferation of leukemic cells is enhanced in Aml1-excised MLL-ENL leukemic mice. We found that the enhanced proliferation is the result of repression of p19(ARF) that is directly regulated by AML1 in MLL-ENL leukemic cells. We also found that down-regulation of p19(ARF) induces the accelerated onset of MLL-ENL leukemia, suggesting that p19(ARF) is a major target of AML1 in MLL-ENL leukemia.

METHODS: Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) encoding retroviral vectors based on HIV-1 or murine leukemia virus (MLV), pseudotyped with either vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) or a modified foamy virus envelope protein (FV Env), and prototype foamy virus (PFV) were produced. Transduction was performed in four HCEC culture media that were previously described for specific cultivation of HCECs or organ culture of donor corneas, namely enriched HCEC growth medium F99(HCEC), its unsupplemented basal medium F99, MEM + 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) (MEM), and Human Endothelial-SFM (SFM). Transduction efficiency was evaluated by marker gene transfer assay, and cytotoxic effects of virus infection were evaluated by means of resazurin conversion assay. RESULTS: PFV- and HIV-1-based vectors showed superior transduction efficiency compared with MLV-based vectors. Pseudotyping with a modified FV Env increased transduction efficiency compared with pseudotyping with VSV-G. In medium SFM, transduction efficiency of PFV, HIV-1-/FV Env, and MLV-based vectors was markedly reduced compared with the other culture media. When cells were cultured in F99-based media, cell viability was reduced by retroviral transduction compared with uninfected or mock infected controls, but remained unaffected when cells were cultured in SFM and was even increased when cells were cultured in MEM. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1-based vectors pseudotyped with FV Env can efficiently be used to transduce primary HCECs in vitro. However, transduction efficiency is dependent on culture conditions and impairs metabolic activity and viability of HCECs in vitro.","['Valtink, Monika', 'Stanke, Nicole', 'Knels, Lilla', 'Engelmann, Katrin', 'Funk, Richard H W', 'Lindemann, Dirk']","['Valtink M', 'Stanke N', 'Knels L', 'Engelmann K', 'Funk RH', 'Lindemann D']","['Institute of Anatomy, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany. monika.valtink@tu-dresden.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,7703701,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/*pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Corneal/cytology/*drug effects', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2011/11/02 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['iovs.11-7710 [pii]', '10.1167/iovs.11-7710 [doi]']",epublish,Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2011 Aug 29;52(9):6807-13. doi: 10.1167/iovs.11-7710.,20110829,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to ascertain the long term outcome of patients with SCN. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment and outcome of 11 patients with SCN were analysed. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 4 months (range: 3 days-12 years). The primary clinical manifestation was severe infection. Median ANC at diagnosis: 0.2 x 10(9)/L (range: 0-0.37). Bone marrow aspirate showed maturation arrest at promyelocyte stage in all cases. Genetic studies revealed 3 mutations, two in ELA-2 gene and 1 in G6PC3 gene, showing a correlation between genotype and phenotype. Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) was the first-line treatment in 9 patients; six of whom showed a good response at doses between 5 and 15 mug/kg/day for 3-7 days/week. The remaining 3 patients failed to respond to G-CSF and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was indicated. Furthermore, SCT was the treatment of choice in two cases. Median follow-up of the cohort was 5 years (range: 1-10 years) with 100% survival and no cases of leukaemic transformation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that genetic study is useful for establishing a correlation between genotype and phenotype. The treatment of choice for SCN is G-CSF to which 2/3 of patients should respond; while SCT is reserved for cases of poor response or those evolving to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukaemia; thus close follow-up of this condition is essential.","['Mila, M', 'Rufach, A', 'Dapena, J L', 'Arostegui, J I', 'Elorza, I', 'Llort, A', 'Sanchez de Toledo, J', 'Diaz de Heredia, C']","['Mila M', 'Rufach A', 'Dapena JL', 'Arostegui JI', 'Elorza I', 'Llort A', 'Sanchez de Toledo J', 'Diaz de Heredia C']","[""Servicio de Oncologia y Hematologia Pediatricas, Hospital Materno-Infantil Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Espana. mmilafar@gmail.com""]",['spa'],,['Journal Article'],Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,"['Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, Autosomal Recessive 3']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*congenital/diagnosis/therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2012/04/04 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1695-4033(11)00330-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.05.017 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2011 Dec;75(6):396-400. doi: 10.1016/j.anpedi.2011.05.017.

Almost 20 years ago, an essay by Sitia and Meldolesi first listed what was known at the time about domain formation within the ER. In the time that has passed since, additional ER domains have been discovered and characterized. These include the mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), the ER quality control compartment (ERQC), where ER-associated degradation (ERAD) occurs, and the plasma membrane-associated membrane (PAM). Insight has been gained into the separation of nuclear envelope proteins from the remainder of the ER. Research has also shown that the biogenesis of peroxisomes and lipid droplets occurs on specialized membranes of the ER. Several studies have shown the existence of specific marker proteins found on all these domains and how they are targeted there. Moreover, a first set of cytosolic ER-associated sorting proteins, including phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 2 (PACS-2) and Rab32 have been identified. Intra-ER targeting mechanisms appear to be superimposed onto ER retention mechanisms and rely on transmembrane and cytosolic sequences. The crucial roles of ER domain formation for cell physiology are highlighted with the specific targeting of the tumor metastasis regulator gp78 to ERAD-mediating membranes or of the promyelocytic leukemia protein to the MAM.","['Lynes, Emily M', 'Simmen, Thomas']","['Lynes EM', 'Simmen T']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,['0 (Membrane Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism/physiology', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",PMC7172674,,2011/07/16 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-4889(11)00176-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.06.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2011 Oct;1813(10):1893-905. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2011.06.011.

METHODS: The mRNA expression levels of WT1 and house-keeping gene ABL were dynamically measured with Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-RT-PCR) on 326 bone marrow samples from 63 post-HSCT patients in our hospital from December 2001 to September 2009. After comparing the WT1 levels of patients with different post-transplantation outcomes, the investigators used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to determine the WT1 threshold so as to predict their clinical relapses. Then different prognoses of WT1 positive and negative patients were analyzed. RESULTS: The levels of WT1 expression showed significant difference between the 19 relapsing and 44 non-relapsing patients with the median expression levels of 1270 (55 - 47 596) and 132 (0 - 2959) respectively (P < 0.01). In 19 relapsing patients, except for 1 patient discontinuing the detection of WT1, 10 mortality cases due to recurrence had higher levels of WT1 expression than other 8 patients (P > 0.05). According to the ROC curve, the cut-off value of WT1 at 585 could separate 63 patients into the WT1-positive group (> 585) and the WT1-negative group (</= 585). The WT1-negative group was found to have a longer relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) than the positive group (all P < 0.01). Twenty-one WT1-positive patients were followed up for 3, 4 - 6, 7 - 9 and 9 months respectively. The cumulative post-HSCT recurrence rates in those WT1-positive cases were 8/8, 2/4, 2/4 and 3/5 (P = 0.063) respectively. And the intervention was ineffective. CONCLUSION: WTl gene may be an independent factor of monitoring MRD.

After nucleofection, BCL11B expression in the mRNA and the protein levels were measured by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. The biological consequences based on the highly efficient and specific BCL11B-siRNA were demonstrated by CCK-8 kit, morphological changes (Hoechst 33258 staining), high-resolution imaging, and flow cytometry. Reduction in the BCL11B mRNA level was observed at 24 or 48 hours in molt-4 T cells with BCL11B-935-siRNA, BCL11B-434-siRNA, or BCL11B-748-siRNA, respectively.

Here, we used small-molecule reactivation of p53 and induction of tumor cell apoptosis (RITA) to sensitize leukemic NALM-6 cells to doxorubicin by upregulating p53 protein. RITA alone effectively inhibited NALM-6 cells viability in dose-dependent manner as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and induced apoptosis as evaluated by flow cytometry, whereas RITA in combination with doxorubicin enhanced NALM-6 cells to doxorubicin-sensitivity and promoted doxorubicin induced apoptosis. Levels of p53 protein and its proapoptotic target genes, quantified by western blot and real-time PCR respectively, showed that expression of p53 was significantly increased after RITA treatment. Using p53 inhibitors PFT-alpha and PFT-mu it was shown that p53-mediated apoptosis induced by RITA can be regulated by both p53-transcription-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover, RITA-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the activation of caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Therefore, exploiting synergistic effects between RITA and chemotherapeutics might be an effective clinical strategy for leukemia chemotherapy.","['Kazemi, Ahmad', 'Safa, Majid', 'Shahbazi, Atefeh']","['Kazemi A', 'Safa M', 'Shahbazi A']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (ZNF331 protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2011/07/16 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/102453311X12953015767536 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2011 Jul;16(4):225-31. doi: 10.1179/102453311X12953015767536.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Hematology. 2011 Sep;16(5):324'],,,,

The quantitative determination of cytarabine in plasma is challenging due to the required sensitivity, its in vitro instability and the presence of an isobaric endogenous compound, cytidine. Owing to the polarity of cytarabine, conventional chromatography cannot provide adequate separation of the analyte and the interfering compounds. A few analytical methods have been reported for the determination of cytarabine in plasma, but their sensitivity was not sufficient since most of these methods apply spectrophotometric detection. RESULTS: In this article, an LC-MS/MS method is described for the determination of cytarabine in human plasma down to the sub ng/ml level. To prevent conversion of cytarabine by cytidine deaminase, whole blood samples were stabilized with tetrahydrouridine directly after the collection of whole blood at the clinical site. Cation-exchange SPE was employed to extract cytarabine from 50 microl human plasma. UHPLC on high strength silica T3 column (100 x 2.1 mm x 1.8 microm) was applied to achieve adequate separation of cytarabine from cytidine within a reasonable run time of 5 min. A triple quad mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source was used for detection. CONCLUSION: The method was linear over the concentration ranges of 0.500-500 ng/ml.

Because siglecs exhibit restricted expression on one or a few leukocyte cell types, they have gained attention as attractive targets for cell-directed therapies. Several antibody-based therapies targeting CD22 (Siglec-2) are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and other B cell lymphomas. As an alternative to antibodies we have developed liposomal nanoparticles decorated with glycan ligands of CD22 that selectively target B cells. Because CD22 is an endocytic receptor, ligand-decorated liposomes are bound by CD22 and rapidly internalized by the cell. When loaded with a toxic cargo such as doxorubicin, they are efficacious in prolonging life in a Daudi B cell lymphoma model. These B cell targeted nanoparticles have been demonstrated to bind and kill malignant B cells from patients with hairy cell leukemia, marginal zone lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The results demonstrate the potential of using CD22 ligand-targeted liposomal nanoparticles as an alternative approach for the treatment of B cell malignancies.","['Chen, Weihsu C', 'Sigal, Darren S', 'Saven, Alan', 'Paulson, James C']","['Chen WC', 'Sigal DS', 'Saven A', 'Paulson JC']","['Department of Chemical Physiology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA138891/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI050143/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI050143-10/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI050143/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060938-10/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138891-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM060938/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', '*Nanoparticles', 'Polysaccharides/immunology/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC3197974,['NIHMS308687'],2011/07/16 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/07/16 06:00'],"['2011/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.604755 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2012 Feb;53(2):208-10. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.604755.

The overall prevalence of MBL is at least 100 times higher than that of CLL, which indirectly suggests that MBL is not necessarily a pre-leukemic condition, although in some circumstances, CLL cases can really be preceded by MBL. In view of this high prevalence rate, general clinicians and even non-hematological specialists have a high chance of being faced with individuals with MBL in their routine clinical practice. MBL is classified as ""clinical MBL"", ""population-screening MBL"" and ""atypical MBL"" and the clinical management of affected individuals depends greatly on this differentiation.

This anticancer agent should be considered a pro-drug, whose pharmacological efficiency and/or genotoxic side effects are dependent on its cytochrome P450 (CYP)- and/or peroxidase-mediated activation to species forming covalent DNA adducts. Ellipticine can also act as an inhibitor or inducer of biotransformation enzymes, thereby modulating its own metabolism leading to its genotoxic and pharmacological effects. Here, a comparison of the toxicity of ellipticine to human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, leukemia HL-60 and CCRF-CEM cells, neuroblastoma IMR-32, UKF-NB-3 and UKF-NB-4 cells and U87MG glioblastoma cells and mechanisms of its action to these cells were evaluated. Treatment of all cells tested with ellipticine resulted in inhibition of cell growth and proliferation. This effect was associated with formation of two covalent ellipticine-derived DNA adducts, identical to those formed by 13-hydroxy- and 12-hydroxyellipticine, the ellipticine metabolites generated by CYP and peroxidase enzymes, in MCF-7, HL-60, CCRF-CEM, UKF-NB-3, UKF-NB-4 and U87MG cells, but not in neuroblastoma UKF-NB-3 cells. Therefore, DNA adduct formation in most cancer cell lines tested in this comparative study might be the predominant cause of their sensitivity to ellipticine treatment, whereas other mechanisms of ellipticine action also contribute to its cytotoxicity to neuroblastoma UKF-NB-3 cells.","['Stiborova, Marie', 'Poljakova, Jitka', 'Martinkova, Eva', 'Borek-Dohalska, Lucie', 'Eckschlager, Tomas', 'Kizek, Rene', 'Frei, Eva']","['Stiborova M', 'Poljakova J', 'Martinkova E', 'Borek-Dohalska L', 'Eckschlager T', 'Kizek R', 'Frei E']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Interdiscip Toxicol,Interdisciplinary toxicology,101528175,,,,PMC3131681,,2011/07/15 06:00,2011/07/15 06:01,['2011/07/15 06:00'],"['2010/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2478/v10102-011-0017-7 [doi]', 'ITX-4-098 [pii]']",ppublish,Interdiscip Toxicol. 2011 Jun;4(2):98-105. doi: 10.2478/v10102-011-0017-7.,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA adducts', 'Ellipticine', 'cancer cell lines', 'mechanims of acticancer effects of ellipticine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this, we measured MSI2 protein level by immunohistochemistry in 120 AML patients. Most cases (70%) showed some nuclear or cytoplasmic positivity, but the percentage of positive cells was low in most cases. Despite this, MSI2 protein expression was negatively associated with outcome, particularly for patients with good cytogenetic subgroup. For practical diagnostic purposes, the strongest significance of association was seen in cases with > 1% of cells showing strong MSI2 staining, these having a very poor outcome (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis with cytogenetic category, age, white cell count, and French-American-British subtype demonstrated that nuclear MSI2 levels were independently predictive of outcome (P = .0497). These results confirm the association of MSI2 expression with outcome in AML at the protein level and demonstrate the utility of MSI2 protein as a clinical prognostic biomarker.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: B-CLL patient samples (n = 35) and B leukemic cell lines (EHEB, JVM2, JVM3, MEC1, MEC2, and BJAB) with different p53 status were exposed to Nutlin-3, a small-molecule inhibitor of the p53-MDM2 interaction. Modulations of the steady-state mRNA levels of TCL1 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting in both primary B-CLL samples and leukemic cell lines. In addition, transfection experiments with either p53 siRNA or with a TCL1 expression plasmid were carried out in the EHEB B-CLL cell line. RESULTS: Upon ex vivo treatment with Nutlin-3, TCL1 was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in 23 of 28 B-CLL p53(wild-type). The functionality of the p53 pathway in the same leukemic cell samples was underscored by the concomitant ability of Nutlin-3 to significantly (P < 0.05) upregulate the p53 target gene MDM2 in the p53(wild-type) leukemic cells. The dependence of TCL1 downregulation by a functional p53 pathway was confirmed in a panel of B lymphoblastoid cell lines and by p53 knockdown experiments with p53 siRNA. The importance of TCL1 in promoting leukemic cell survival was underscored in transfection experiments, in which TCL1 overexpression significantly counteracted the Nutlin-3-mediated induction of apoptosis in EHEB. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the Nutlin-3 downregulates TCL1 mRNA and protein, which likely represents an important molecular determinant in the proapoptotic activity of Nutlin-3.","['Voltan, Rebecca', 'di Iasio, Maria Grazia', 'Bosco, Raffaella', 'Valeri, Nicola', 'Pekarski, Yuri', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Secchiero, Paola', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Voltan R', 'di Iasio MG', 'Bosco R', 'Valeri N', 'Pekarski Y', 'Tiribelli M', 'Secchiero P', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. rebecca.voltan@unife.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2011/07/15 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/15 06:00'],"['2011/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-1064 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1064 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Sep 1;17(17):5649-55. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-1064.

We demonstrated in the current study that human allogeneic or autologous anti-third-party CTLs can also efficiently eradicate primary non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma by inducing slow apoptosis of the pathological cells. Using MHC-I mutant cell line as target cells, which are unrecognizable by the CTL TCR, we demonstrated directly that this killing is TCR independent. Strikingly, this unique TCR-independent killing is induced through lymphoma MHC-I engagement. We further showed that this killing mechanism begins with durable conjugate formation between the CTLs and the tumor cells, through rapid binding of tumor ICAM-1 to the CTL LFA-1 molecule. This conjugation is followed by a slower second step of MHC-I-dependent apoptosis, requiring the binding of the MHC-I alpha2/3 C region on tumor cells to the CTL CD8 molecule for killing to ensue. By comparing CTL-mediated killing of Daudi lymphoma cells (lacking surface MHC-I expression) to Daudi cells with reconstituted surface MHC-I, we demonstrated directly for the first time to our knowledge, in vitro and in vivo, a novel role for MHC-I in the induction of lymphoma cell apoptosis by CTLs. Additionally, by using different knockout and transgenic strains, we further showed that mouse anti-third-party CTLs also kill lymphoma cells using similar unique TCR-independence mechanism as human CTLs, while sparing normal naive B cells.","['Lask, Assaf', 'Goichberg, Polina', 'Cohen, Adva', 'Goren-Arbel, Rinat', 'Milstein, Oren', 'Aviner, Shraga', 'Feine, Ilan', 'Ophir, Eran', 'Reich-Zeliger, Shlomit', 'Hagin, David', 'Klein, Tirza', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Berrebi, Alain', 'Reisner, Yair']","['Lask A', 'Goichberg P', 'Cohen A', 'Goren-Arbel R', 'Milstein O', 'Aviner S', 'Feine I', 'Ophir E', 'Reich-Zeliger S', 'Hagin D', 'Klein T', 'Nagler A', 'Berrebi A', 'Reisner Y']","['Department of Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'CD8 Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/pathology']",,,2011/07/15 06:00,2011/10/01 06:00,['2011/07/15 06:00'],"['2011/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1100095 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1100095 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Aug 15;187(4):2006-14. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1100095.

However, information concerning immunoregulation of implantation in cattle remains quite limited. Therefore, our current research is concerned with characterizing the expression and regulatory effect of a number of immune factors in the developing bovine embryo. We have analysed the effect of embryo culture in vitro (IVC) in medium supplemented with progesterone (P4): leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interferon gamma (IFNG), interleukin (IL)-1B, IL3, IL4, IL10 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on in vitro embryo development and expression of the bovine non-classical MHC class I genes NC2, NC3 and N4 in blastocysts. Cytokine supplementation during IVC did not affect cleavage rate or blastocyst development. However, embryo mRNA expression of NC2, NC3 and NC4 was significantly (p</=0.05) modified in a gene- and cytokine-specific manner. Sequence analysis of the promoter regions of these genes confirmed the presence of appropriate binding sites through which the cytokine signalling could be mediated. In contrast to the lack of effect on in vitro blastocyst development, the non-classical MHC-I expression data suggests a preferential immunomodulatory role of these cytokines during preimplantation embryo development.","['Al Naib, A', 'Mamo, S', ""O'Gorman, G M"", 'Lonergan, P', 'Swales, A', 'Fair, T']","['Al Naib A', 'Mamo S', ""O'Gorman GM"", 'Lonergan P', 'Swales A', 'Fair T']","['School of Agriculture, Food Science and Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cytokines/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Embryo Culture Techniques', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects/*physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Response Elements/physiology']",,,2011/07/15 06:00,2011/12/31 06:00,['2011/07/15 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-0378(11)00217-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jri.2011.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 2011 Sep;91(1-2):31-40. doi: 10.1016/j.jri.2011.05.005.

Although numerous antifungal agents are available, IFI remains a serious problem because of obstacles to timely diagnosis and high morbidity and mortality rates associated with such infection. Improvements in treatment of underlying diseases have rapidly expanded the patient populations at risk for IFI with increased use of immunosuppressants, aggressive chemotherapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and narrow-spectrum antifungal prophylaxis. There are various treatment strategies that can be used to manage IFI: prophylaxis, empiric, preemptive, and directed. As the infection progresses, the prospect of successfully treating an infection diminishes; conversely, the earlier the intervention, the greater the possibility of unnecessary treatment. This article discusses the epidemiology of the most important fungal pathogens, identifies high-risk patient groups and risk factors associated with IFI, and critically evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of available diagnostic tests and treatment strategies and the rationale for antifungal prophylaxis. For patients at high risk for IFI, antifungal prophylaxis is an attractive strategy, and numerous randomized, controlled clinical studies have documented the benefit of such prophylaxis as well as the most efficacious of currently available agents.","['Cornely, Oliver A', 'Aversa, Franco', 'Cook, Perry', 'Jones, Brian', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Shea, Thomas', 'Vallejo, Carlos']","['Cornely OA', 'Aversa F', 'Cook P', 'Jones B', 'Michallet M', 'Shea T', 'Vallejo C']","['Department I for Internal Medicine, ZKS Koln (BMBF 01KN1106), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. oliver.cornely@ctuc.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*prevention & control']",,,2011/07/15 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/07/15 06:00'],"['2011/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01682.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Oct;87(4):289-301. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01682.x.

Long-term results and prognostic factors.,564-8,10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08593.x [doi],"To reduce toxicity in elderly patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia, in 1997 the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Dell'Adulto (GIMEMA) started an amended protocol for patients aged >60years, with the same induction [all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)+idarubicin] as in younger patients, followed by a single consolidation course (idarubicin+ cytarabine) and maintenance with intermittent ATRA. Among 60 enrolled patients, 54 (90%) achieved haematological remission and six died during induction. Four additional patients died in complete remission (CR) from haemorrhage (2) and infection (2) prior or during consolidation therapy. Eleven patients relapsed at a median time of 17.5months from CR. The 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) rates were 76.1%, 64.6% and 27.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified a performance score (PS)=2 as the only significant adverse prognostic factor for both OS (P=0.017) and DFS (P=0.0003). Male sex had an unfavourable impact on DFS (P=0.021) and on CIR (P=0.019), but not on OS (P=0.234). In multivariate analysis for DFS, only PS=2 retained prognostic significance (HR=4.5, P=0.0083). In conclusion, the amended GIMEMA protocol is effective, with similar relapse rate and inferior toxicity compared to the original AIDA 0493.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Spectra were obtained for two serum protein profiling studies: (i) 2-200 kDa for 132 patients, 67 healthy and 65 diagnosed as having adult T-cell leukemia and (ii) 2-100 kDa for 140 patients, 70 pairs, each with matched prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of one benign and one prostate cancer. Signal processing was performed on raw spectra and peak data were normalized using four methods. Feature selection was performed using Bayesian Network Analysis and a classifier was tested on withheld data. Identification of candidate biomarkers was pursued. RESULTS: Integrated peak intensities were resolved over full spectra. Normalization using local noise values was superior to global methods in reducing peak correlations, reducing replicate variability and improving feature selection stability. For the leukemia data set, potential disease biomarkers were detected and were found to be predictive for withheld data. Preliminary assignments of protein IDs were consistent with published results and LC-MS/MS identification. No prostate-specific-antigen-independent biomarkers were detected in the prostate cancer data set.

In this study, we examined the ability of a novel cyano derivative of 11-keto-beta-boswellic acid, that is, butyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxours-1,12-dien-24-oate (BCDD) to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. BCDD inhibited cell proliferation with 48 h IC(50) of 0.67 microM in HL-60, 1 microM in Molt4, and 1.5 microM in THP1 cells. The mechanism of cell death was investigated in HL-60 cells where it caused apoptosis by acting against several potential apoptosis suppressive targets. It inhibited phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT activity, NF-kappaB, Hsp-90, and survivin which may enhance the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis. Also, BCDD decreased the activity of Bid and Bax in cytosol, caused DeltaPsi(mt) loss, releasing pro-apoptotic cytochrome c, SMAC/DIABLO leading to caspase-9-mediated down stream activation of caspase-3, ICAD, and PARP1 cleavage. Translocation of apoptotis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria to the nucleus indicated some caspases-independent apoptosis. Though it upregulated DR-5 and caspase-8, the caspase inhibitor yet had no effect on apoptosis as against 75% inhibition by caspase-9 inhibitor. Attempts were made to examine any acclaimed role of AIF in the activation of caspase-8 using siRNA where it had no effect on caspase-8 activity while the Bax-siRNA inhibited caspase-3 activation suggesting predominance of intrinsic signaling. Our studies thus demonstrated that BCDD exerts multi-focal action in cancer cells while it required 10-fold higher the concentration to produce cytotoxicity in normal human PBMC and gingival cell line, and therefore, may find usefulness in the management of human leukemia.","['Khan, Sheema', 'Kaur, Rajbir', 'Shah, Bhahwal A', 'Malik, Fayaz', 'Kumar, Ajay', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Jain, S K', 'Taneja, Subhash C', 'Singh, Jaswant']","['Khan S', 'Kaur R', 'Shah BA', 'Malik F', 'Kumar A', 'Bhushan S', 'Jain SK', 'Taneja SC', 'Singh J']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology and Bio-Organic Chemistry and Natural Products, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research), Jammu-Tawi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (11-keto-boswellic acid)', '0 (AIFM1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gingiva/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/09/28 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.20821 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2012 Sep;51(9):679-95. doi: 10.1002/mc.20821.

Antioxidant activity was determined by the ability of the compound to inhibit lipid peroxidation induced by H(2)O(2) in the K562 cell line. The pure molecule displayed an important malondialdehyde formation inhibition percentage (82.2%). Moreover, this compound exhibited an inhibitory effect against H(2)O(2)-induced genotoxicity, using the comet assay. A protective effect of the same molecule was also revealed when assessing the gene expression of the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562), stressed with H(2)O(2). For this purpose, we used a cDNA-microarray containing 82 genes related to cell defense, essentially represented by antioxidant and DNA repair proteins. We found that DGQA increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes family and the activity of DNA repair enzymes. Taken together, these observations provide evidence that the DGQA is able to protect cells against oxidative stress.","['Ines, Skandrani', 'Ines, Bouhlel', 'Wissem, Bhouri', 'Mohamed, Ben Sghaier', 'Nawel, Hayder', 'Dijoux-Franca, Marie-Genvieve', 'Kamel, Ghedira', 'Leila, Chekir-Ghedira']","['Ines S', 'Ines B', 'Wissem B', 'Mohamed BS', 'Nawel H', 'Dijoux-Franca MG', 'Kamel G', 'Leila CG']","['Unite de Pharmacognosie, Faculte de Pharmacie de Monastir, Rue Avicenne, 5000, Monastir, Tunisia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '058C04BGYI (Quinic Acid)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Antimutagenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Myrtus/*chemistry', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Quinic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/isolation & purification/pharmacology']",,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/07/24 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2010/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2010/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jat.1655 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2012 May;32(5):333-41. doi: 10.1002/jat.1655.

This study was designed to determine whether epoetin alpha would decrease the number of transfusion events and units of packed erythrocytes (PRBCs) transfused, and the secondary objective was to study the effects of epoetin alpha on quality of life (QOL) and complete remission (CR) rates. METHODS: Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), or Burkitt lymphoma (BL) who were receiving frontline myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive epoetin alpha or no epoetin during the first 6 cycles of their planned chemotherapy. QOL was assessed by using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Anemia questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were randomized to receive epoetin alpha, and 54 patients received no epoetin. Transfusion data were available for 79 of 81 evaluable patients (98%) who completed the treatment/observation period. The trial was stopped early because of poor accrual before the target of 123 evaluable patients was met. A mean of 10.6 units of PRBCs over 5 months were administered to those who received epoetin alpha compared with 13 units for those who did not receive epoetin (P = .04). There was no significant difference in QOL as assessed by the FACT-Anemia or ESAS instruments. The CR rate and the 3-year CR duration were not affected adversely by use of epoetin alpha. CONCLUSIONS: Epoetin alpha decreased the number of PRBC transfusions and did not appear to have a negative impact on remission duration. No difference in QOL was observed.","['Cabanillas, Maria E', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Mattiuzzi, Gloria N', 'Rytting, Michael E', 'Bruera, Eduardo', 'Xiao, Lianchun', 'Bekele, B Nebiyou', 'Foudray, Maria C', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Cabanillas ME', 'Kantarjian H', 'Thomas DA', 'Mattiuzzi GN', 'Rytting ME', 'Bruera E', 'Xiao L', 'Bekele BN', 'Foudray MC', 'Cortes JE']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. mcabani@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Hematinics)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '64FS3BFH5W (Epoetin Alfa)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Epoetin Alfa', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'Erythropoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematinics/*therapeutic use', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Quality of Life', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3919032,['NIHMS539585'],2011/07/14 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26341 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Feb 1;118(3):848-55. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26341.

Experience in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is limited. METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate the activity and safety of 2 different doses (15 mg/m(2) vs 30 mg/m(2) daily x 5 days) of intravenous clofarabine in patients with higher-risk MDS. Fifty-eight patients with a median age of 68 years (range, 25-89) including 15 patients (28%) with secondary MDS and 35 patients (60%) who received prior DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors were adaptively randomized between the 2 dose cohorts. RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR; based on a modification of International Working Group criteria) was 36% including 26% with complete remission (CR) (ORR, 41% at 15 mg/m(2) and 29% at 30 mg/m(2)). Responses were lower in patients who failed DNMT inhibitors (ORR, 17%; CR rate, 14%). The 8-week mortality rate was 19%. Median survival was 7.4 months for all patients, 13.4 months for responders, and 21.7 months for complete responders. Some adverse events, particularly hepatic and renal, were more severe (grade >2) in patients randomized to 30 mg/m(2) of clofarabine. Myelosuppression and infectious complications were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: Both the lower and higher doses of clofarabine have comparable clinical activity, but the lower dose appeared less toxic. If these results are confirmed, lower doses of clofarabine, possibly in alternative schedules, should be pursued.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Byrd, Anna L', 'Kwari, Monica', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Borthakur G', 'Estrov Z', 'Gandhi V', 'Byrd AL', 'Kwari M', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77230-1402, USA. sfaderl@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Arabinonucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'Clofarabine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4180241,['NIHMS593648'],2011/07/14 06:00,2012/03/28 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26327 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Feb 1;118(3):722-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26327.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all children presenting with an anterior mediastinal mass from 1994-2009. Parameters studied included demographics, historical and physical findings at diagnosis, radiographic evidence of airway compression, diagnostic studies, diagnosis, and complications. RESULTS: There were 26 patients with anterior mediastinal masses over a 15-year period. The mean age was 11.3 years, and there were no gender differences. The diagnoses were lymphoma (62%, 16/26), leukemia (15%, 4/26), and other (23%, 6/26). Diagnosis was made by CBC/peripheral smear in 2/4 patients with leukemia, by bone marrow biopsy in 2/4 patients with leukemia, by thoracentesis in 3/16 patients with lymphoma, by lymph node biopsies in 6/16 patients with lymphoma, and by biopsy of a mediastinal mass in 7/16 patients with lymphoma and in 6/6 patients with other diagnoses. Radiographic evidence of airway compression was seen in 62% (16/26) of children. Only 12% (3/26) had a tracheal cross-sectional area (TCA) <50%. Correlation of symptoms with anatomical airway obstruction or complications was poor. Pulmonary function studies were obtained in 38%, 10/26 children. Only 2 children had a PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) <50% predicted. This data also correlated poorly with anatomical airway obstruction or complications. 3 patients had anesthesia-related complications: one desaturation during induction prior to median sternotomy, one with significant desaturation and bradycardia during biopsy under local anesthesia with minimal sedation, and one with prolonged (5 days) mechanical ventilation after general anesthesia. 2 of these patients had a TCA <50%, and 2 had SVC obstructions. There were no anesthesia-related deaths, and the overall survival was 85% (22/26). CONCLUSION: Anterior mediastinal masses in children should be approached in a step-wise fashion with multi-disciplinary involvement, starting with the least invasive techniques and progressing cautiously. The surgeon should have a well-defined and preoperatively established contingency plan if these children require general anesthesia for diagnosis.","['Garey, C L', 'Laituri, C A', 'Valusek, P A', 'St Peter, S D', 'Snyder, C L']","['Garey CL', 'Laituri CA', 'Valusek PA', 'St Peter SD', 'Snyder CL']","[""Department of Surgery, Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City 64108, United States.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Eur J Pediatr Surg,European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

The protein serine/threonine kinase CK2 is frequently upregulated in cancer, and it is overexpressed and hyperactivated in primary CLL cells from untreated patients. We have shown that inhibition of CK2 induces apoptosis of CLL cells, whereas it does not significantly impact normal lymphocytes, demonstrating the selectivity of the CK2 inhibitors toward leukemia cells. Notably, although co-culture with OP9 stromal cells and BCR stimulation both promote leukemia cell survival in vitro, they do not prevent apoptosis of CLL cells treated with CK2 inhibitors. PI3K signaling pathway was previously shown to be essential for CLL cell viability, an observation we confirmed in all patient samples analyzed. Further, we observed that CK2 blockade decreases PTEN phosphorylation, leading to PTEN activation, and that apoptosis of CLL cells upon CK2 inhibition is mediated by PKC inactivation. This suggests that activation of PI3K/PKC signaling pathway is involved in the pro-survival effects of CK2 in CLL cells. Sensitivity to CK2 inhibition does not correlate with expression of ZAP-70 or CD38, or with IGVH mutation status. However, it positively correlates with the percentage of CLL cells in the peripheral blood, beta2 microglobulin levels, and Binet clinical stage. CK2 appears to play an important role in the biology of CLL and constitutes a promising target for the development of leukemia-specific therapies.","['Martins, Leila R', 'Lucio, Paulo', 'Silva, Milene C', 'Gameiro, Paula', 'Silva, Maria G', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Martins LR', 'Lucio P', 'Silva MC', 'Gameiro P', 'Silva MG', 'Barata JT']","['Cancer Biology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

Ikaros function depends on its ability to localize to pericentromeric-heterochromatin (PC-HC). Ikaros protein binds to the upstream regulatory elements of target genes, aids in their recruitment to PC-HC, and regulates their transcription via chromatin remodeling. We identified four novel Ikaros phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated by CK2 kinase. Using Ikaros phosphomimetic and phosphoresistant mutants of the CK2 phosphorylation sites, we demonstrate that (1) CK2-mediated phosphorylation inhibits Ikaros' localization to PC-HC; (2) dephosphorylation of Ikaros at CK2 sites increases its binding to the promoter of the terminal deoxynucleotidetransferase (TdT) gene, leading to TdT repression during thymocyte differentiation; and (3) hyperphosphorylation of Ikaros promotes its degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. We show that Ikaros is dephosphorylated by Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) via interaction at a consensus PP1-binding motif, RVXF. Point mutations that abolish Ikaros-PP1 interaction result in functional changes in DNA-binding affinity and subcellular localization, similar to those observed in hyperphosphorylated Ikaros and/or Ikaros phosphomimetic mutants. Phosphoresistant Ikaros mutations at CK2 sites restored Ikaros' DNA-binding activity and localization to PC-HC and prevented accelerated Ikaros degradation. These results demonstrate the role of CK2 kinase in lymphocyte differentiation and in regulation of Ikaros' function, and suggest that CK2 promotes leukemogenesis by inhibiting the tumor suppressor activity of Ikaros. We propose a model whereby a balance between CK2 kinase and PP1 phosphatase is essential for normal lymphocyte differentiation and for the prevention of malignant transformation.","['Dovat, Sinisa', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Payne, Kimberly J', 'Li, Zhanjun']","['Dovat S', 'Song C', 'Payne KJ', 'Li Z']","['Department of Pediatrics, H085, Division of Pediatric, Hematology/Oncology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033-0850, USA. sdovat@hmc.psu.edu']",['eng'],['R01 HL095120/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Casein Kinase II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3665334,['NIHMS470683'],2011/07/14 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-011-0964-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2011 Oct;356(1-2):201-7. doi: 10.1007/s11010-011-0964-5.

M2Yn is a natural extract from plants of central Asia, identified for its antiangiogenic properties and its ability to block the migration of malignant cells. Here, we report that in vitro treatment of cells derived from CLL patients with M2Yn results in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, caspase-3 activation and cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP-1. The extents of these effects depend on the patients and are mostly comparable to those of flavopiridol or hyperforin, two known plant-derived apoptosis inducers of CLL cells. M2Yn does not modulate Mcl-1 expression, while downregulation of this antiapoptotic protein is involved in the action of flavopiridol. By contrast, M2Yn, like hyperforin, upregulates the Noxa protein, possibly by inhibiting proteasomal activity. This BH3-only protein is known to trigger the activation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bak through displacement of the Mcl-1/Bak complex at the mitochondrial membrane, as actually observed here in M2Yn-treated cells. Our data, therefore, show that M2Yn can induce the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis in CLL cells via a mechanism resembling that of hyperforin. Our data also confirm that the BH3-only protein Noxa is a relevant target for CLL therapy.","['Zaher, Murhaf', 'Mirshahi, Massoud', 'Nuraliev, Yusuf', 'Sharifova, Mijgana', 'Bombarda, Isabelle', 'Marie, Jean-Pierre', 'Billard, Christian']","['Zaher M', 'Mirshahi M', 'Nuraliev Y', 'Sharifova M', 'Bombarda I', 'Marie JP', 'Billard C']","['Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM U872, Equipe 18, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'DHD7FFG6YS (Phloroglucinol)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RM741E34FP (hyperforin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phloroglucinol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/01/14 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijo.2011.1121 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2011 Oct;39(4):965-72. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2011.1121.

In a yeast-two-hybrid approach with human bone marrow derived cDNA, we identified ING5 as well as several other proteins as interaction partners of Inhibitor of cyclin A1 (INCA1) that we previously characterized as a novel interaction partner of cyclin A1/CDK2. ING5 expression in leukemic AML blasts was severely reduced compared to normal bone marrow. In line, ING5 inhibited bone marrow colony formation upon retroviral transduction. However, Inca1(-/-) bone marrow colony formation was not suppressed by ING5. In murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from Inca1(+/+) and Inca1(-/-) mice, overexpression of ING5 suppressed cell proliferation only in the presence of INCA1, while ING5 had no effect in Inca1(-/-) MEFs. ING5 overexpression induced a delay in S-phase progression, which required INCA1. Finally, ING5 overexpression enhanced Fas-induced apoptosis in Inca1(+/+) MEFs, while Inca1(-/-) MEFs were protected from Fas antibody-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results indicate that ING5 is a growth suppressor with suppressed expression in AML whose functions depend on its interaction with INCA1.","['Zhang, Feng', 'Baumer, Nicole', 'Rode, Miriam', 'Ji, Ping', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten']","['Zhang F', 'Baumer N', 'Rode M', 'Ji P', 'Zhang T', 'Berdel WE', 'Muller-Tidow C']","['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (INCA1 protein, human)', '0 (ING5 protein, human)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC3130024,,2011/07/14 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0021505 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07242 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(7):e21505. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021505.

The genetic modification of T lymphocytes with chimeric receptors specific for tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) allows for the redirection towards tumor cells. Clinical experience with CAR-redirected T cells suggests that antitumor efficacy associates with some degree of toxicity, especially when TAA expression is shared with healthy tissues. This situation closely resembles the case of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), wherein allorecognition causes both the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Suicide gene therapy, i.e. the genetic induction of a conditional suicide phenotype into donor T cells, enables dissociating the GVL effect from GVHD. Applying suicide gene modification to CAR-redirected T cells may therefore greatly increase their safety profile and facilitate their clinical development.","['Casucci, Monica', 'Bondanza, Attilio']","['Casucci M', 'Bondanza A']","['Experimental Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, ITALY.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,PMC3133962,,2011/07/14 06:00,2011/07/14 06:01,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7150/jca.2.378 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer. 2011;2:378-82. doi: 10.7150/jca.2.378.

As a consequence, p53 function must be inactivated for a tumor to develop. This is achieved by mutation in approximately 50% of cases and probably by functional inactivation in the remaining cases. We have previously shown that the second messenger cAMP can inhibit DNA damage-induced wild-type p53 accumulation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, leading to a profound reduction of their apoptotic response. In the present article, we provide a mechanistic insight into the regulation of p53 levels by cAMP. We show that increased levels of cAMP augment the binding of p53 to its negative regulator HDM2, overriding the DNA damage-induced dissociation of p53 from HDM2. This results in maintained levels of p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which in turn counteracts the DNA damage-induced stabilization of the p53 protein. The apoptosis inhibitory effect of cAMP is further shown to depend on this effect on p53 levels. These findings potentially implicate deregulation of cAMP signaling as a candidate mechanism used by transformed cells to quench the p53 response while retaining wild-type p53.","['Naderi, Elin Hallan', 'Jochemsen, Aart G', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil', 'Naderi, Soheil']","['Naderi EH', 'Jochemsen AG', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Naderi S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/physiology', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Stress, Physiological/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects/genetics']",PMC3132851,,2011/07/14 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1593/neo.11542 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2011 Jul;13(7):653-63. doi: 10.1593/neo.11542.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the development of more active, less toxic antifungal agents and the standard use of antifungal prophylaxis, invasive fungal infections (especially invasive mold infections) continue to be a significant factor in hematopoietic cell and solid organ transplantation outcomes, resulting in high mortality rates. Since the use of fluconazole as standard prophylaxis in the hematopoietic cell transplantation setting, invasive candidiasis has come under control, but no mold-active antifungal agent (except for posaconazole in the setting of acute myelogenous leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) has been shown to improve the survival rate over fluconazole. With the advent of new azole and echinocandin agents, we have seen the emergence of more azole-resistant and echinocandin-resistant fungi. The recent increase in zygomycosis seen in the hematopoietic cell transplantation setting may be due to the increased use of voriconazole. This has implications for the empiric approach to pulmonary invasive mold infections when zygomycosis cannot be ruled out. It is imperative that an amphotericin B product, an antifungal that has never developed resistance in over 50 years, be initiated. The clinical presentations of invasive mold infections and invasive candidiasis can be nonspecific and the diagnostic tests insensitive, so a high index of suspicion and immediate initiation of empiric therapy is required. Unfortunately, our currently available serologic tests do not predict infection ahead of disease, and, therefore cannot be used to initiate ""preemptive"" therapy. Also, the Aspergillus galactomannan test gives a false negative result in patients receiving antimold prophylaxis, ie, virtually all of our patients with hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. We may eventually be able to select patients at highest risk for invasive fungal infections for prophylaxis by genetic testing. However, with our current armamentarium of antifungal agents and widespread use of prophylaxis in high-risk groups (hematologic malignancy, hematopoietic cell transplantation), we continue to see high incidence and mortality rates, and our future hope lies in reversing the immunosuppression or augmenting the immune system of these severely immunocompromised hosts by developing and utilizing immunotherapy, immunoprophylaxis, and vaccines.","['Kriengkauykiat, Jane', 'Ito, James I', 'Dadwal, Sanjeet S']","['Kriengkauykiat J', 'Ito JI', 'Dadwal SS']",['Department of Pharmacy.'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Clin Epidemiol,Clinical epidemiology,101531700,,,,PMC3130903,,2011/07/14 06:00,2011/07/14 06:01,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CLEP.S12502 [doi]', 'clep-3-175 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Epidemiol. 2011;3:175-91. doi: 10.2147/CLEP.S12502.

We also showed that quercetin potentiated the effect of fludarabine on resistant B cells from CLL patients. Resistance to therapy in CLL depends on the expression and activity of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family. Among these, myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) has been associated with apoptotic resistance in CLL. Therefore, we investigate here whether the sensitising activity of this flavonoid, which leads to increased apoptosis in both cell lines and CLL, could be related to Mcl-1 expression and stability. RESULTS: B cells isolated from CLL patients showed different levels of Mcl-1 protein expression, resulting, in several cases, in increased sensitivity to fludarabine. Quercetin significantly enhanced the downregulation of Mcl-1 in B cells isolated from selected patients expressing detectable levels of Mcl-1. In U-937 cells, quercetin increased Mcl-1 mRNA instability in the presence of actinomycin D. When cells were treated with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, Mcl-1 protein level increased. However, quercetin, in the presence of Z-Vad-FMK, continued to lower Mcl-1 protein expression, indicating its independence from caspase-mediated degradation. In contrast, co-treatment of quercetin and MG-132 did not revert the effect of MG-132 mono-treatment, thus suggesting a possible interference of quercetin in regulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of Mcl-1. Gossypol, a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 family members, mimics the activity of quercetin by lowering Mcl-1 expression and sensitising U-937 cells to apoptosis induced by recombinant TRAIL and the Fas-ligand. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that in U-937 cells, quercetin downregulates Mcl-1 acting directly or indirectly on its mRNA stability and protein degradation, suggesting that the same mechanism may bypass resistance to apoptosis in leukaemic cells isolated from CLL patients and sensitise B cells to apoptosis induced by drugs and death receptor inducers.","['Spagnuolo, C', 'Cerella, C', 'Russo, M', 'Chateauvieux, S', 'Diederich, M', 'Russo, G L']","['Spagnuolo C', 'Cerella C', 'Russo M', 'Chateauvieux S', 'Diederich M', 'Russo GL']","['Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, 83100 Avellino 83100 Avellino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gossypol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'RNA Stability/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",PMC3142809,,2011/07/14 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011229 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.229 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Jul 12;105(2):221-30. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.229.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study describes the use of engineered vesicles to deliver exogenous proteins into human cells. We show that overexpression of the spike glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G) in human cells induces the release of fusogenic vesicles named gesicles. Biochemical and functional studies revealed that gesicles incorporated proteins from producer cells and could deliver them to recipient cells. This protein-transduction method allows the direct transport of cytoplasmic, nuclear or surface proteins in target cells. This was demonstrated by showing that the TetR transactivator and the receptor for the murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope [murine cationic amino acid transporter-1 (mCAT-1)] were efficiently delivered by gesicles in various cell types. We further shows that gesicle-mediated transfer of mCAT-1 confers to human fibroblasts a robust permissiveness to ecotropic vectors, allowing the generation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells in level 2 biosafety facilities. This highlights the great potential of mCAT-1 gesicles to increase the safety of experiments using retro/lentivectors. Besides this, gesicles is a versatile tool highly valuable for the nongenetic delivery of functions such as transcription factors or genome engineering agents.","['Mangeot, Philippe-Emmanuel', 'Dollet, Sandra', 'Girard, Mathilde', 'Ciancia, Claire', 'Joly, Stephane', 'Peschanski, Marc', 'Lotteau, Vincent']","['Mangeot PE', 'Dollet S', 'Girard M', 'Ciancia C', 'Joly S', 'Peschanski M', 'Lotteau V']","['Universite de Lyon, INSERM, U851, Lyon, France. philippe.mangeot@inserm.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Trpv6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Channels/genetics/metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Transmission', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'TRPV Cation Channels/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vesiculovirus/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC3182355,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)32751-4 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2011.138 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2011 Sep;19(9):1656-66. doi: 10.1038/mt.2011.138.

RESULTS: Six of 23 (26%) mouse DNA free xenograft cultures were strongly positive for MLV and their sequences had greater than 99% homology to known MLV strains. Four of five available supernatant fluids from these viral positive cultures were strongly positive for RT activity. Three of these supernatant fluids were studied to confirm the infectivity of the released virions for other human culture cells. Of the 78 non-xenograft derived cell lines maintained in the xenograft culture-containing facilities, 13 (17%) were positive for MLV, including XMRV, a virus strain first identified in human tissues. By contrast, all 50 cultures maintained in a xenograft culture-free facility were negative for viral sequences. METHODOLOGY: We examined xenograft tumor cell lines from seven independent laboratories and 128 non-xenografted tumor cell lines. Cell line DNA was examined for mouse DNA contamination, and by 3 Taqman qPCR assays targeting the gag, env or pol regions of MLV. Sequencing was used for viral strain identification. Supernatant fluids were tested for reverse transcriptase (RT) activity. CONCLUSIONS: Human cultures derived after mouse xenografting frequently contain and release highly infectious xenotropic MLV viruses. Laboratories working with xenograft-derived human cultures should be aware of the risk of contamination with potentially biohazardous human-tropic mouse viruses and their horizontal spread to other cultures.","['Zhang, Yu-An', 'Maitra, Anirban', 'Hsieh, Jer-Tsong', 'Rudin, Charles M', 'Peacock, Craig D', 'Karikari, Collins', 'Brekken, Rolf A', 'Stastny, Victor', 'Gao, Boning', 'Girard, Luc', 'Wistuba, Ignacio', 'Frenkel, Eugene', 'Minna, John D', 'Gazdar, Adi F']","['Zhang YA', 'Maitra A', 'Hsieh JT', 'Rudin CM', 'Peacock CD', 'Karikari C', 'Brekken RA', 'Stastny V', 'Gao B', 'Girard L', 'Wistuba I', 'Frenkel E', 'Minna JD', 'Gazdar AF']","['Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['P50CA70907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01CA084971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA070907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor/*virology', 'DNA/analysis', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, gag', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Mice/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/transmission', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Virion']",PMC3218386,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/03/29 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['15955 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.12.7.15955 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 Oct 1;12(7):617-28. doi: 10.4161/cbt.12.7.15955.

Sixty patients were enrolled; median age was 59 years (range, 42-69); 75% were male; median beta2M was 5.1 mg/L (range, 4-11.6); and 51% were Rai III-IV.

In total, 448 CML patients were enrolled, and the SF-36 Health Survey was used to compare generic HRQOL profiles. Symptoms were also assessed. HRQOL comparisons were adjusted for key possible confounders. The median age of patients was 57 years and the median time of imatinib treatment was 5 years (range 3-9 years). The largest HRQOL differences were found in younger patients. In particular, patients aged between 18 and 39 years had marked impairments in role limitations because of physical and emotional problems, respectively: -22.6 (P < .001), -22.3 (P < .001). Patients with CML age 60 or older had a HRQOL profile very similar to that reported by the general population. Women had a worse profile than men when each were compared with their peers in the general population. Fatigue was the most frequently reported symptom. The HRQOL of CML patients is comparable with that of population norms in many areas, however, younger and female patients seem to report the major limitations.","['Efficace, Fabio', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Cottone, Francesco', 'Deliliers, Giorgio Lambertenghi', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Rossi, Antonella Russo', 'Fioritoni, Giuseppe', 'Luciano, Luigia', 'Turri, Diamante', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Dabusti, Melissa', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Leoni, Pietro', 'Simula, Maria Pina', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Ulisciani, Stefano', 'Veneri, Dino', 'Sica, Simona', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Mandelli, Franco']","['Efficace F', 'Baccarani M', 'Breccia M', 'Alimena G', 'Rosti G', 'Cottone F', 'Deliliers GL', 'Barate C', 'Rossi AR', 'Fioritoni G', 'Luciano L', 'Turri D', 'Martino B', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Dabusti M', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Leoni P', 'Simula MP', 'Levato L', 'Ulisciani S', 'Veneri D', 'Sica S', 'Rambaldi A', 'Vignetti M', 'Mandelli F']","['Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases, Data Center and Health Outcomes Research Unit, Rome, Italy. f.efficace@gimema.it']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Population', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40966-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-347575 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Oct 27;118(17):4554-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-347575.

We recently found that filamins are targeted for proteasomal degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase specificity subunit ASBalpha and that acute degradation of filamins through this ubiquitin-proteasome pathway correlates with cell differentiation. Specifically, in myeloid leukemia cells retinoic-acid-induced expression of ASB2alpha triggers filamin degradation and recapitulates early events crucial for cell differentiation. ASB2alpha is thought to link substrates to the ubiquitin transferase machinery; however, the mechanism by which ASB2alpha interacts with filamin to induce degradation remained unknown. Here, we use cell-based and biochemical assays to show that the subcellular localization of ASB2alpha to actin-rich structures is dependent on filamin and that the actin-binding domain (ABD) of filamin mediates the interaction with ASB2alpha. Furthermore, we show that the ABD is necessary and sufficient for ASB2alpha-mediated filamin degradation. We propose that ASB2alpha exerts its effect by binding the ABD and mediating its polyubiquitylation, so targeting filamins for degradation. These studies provide the molecular basis for ASB2alpha-mediated filamin degradation and unravel an important mechanism by which filamin levels can be acutely regulated.","['Razinia, Ziba', 'Baldassarre, Massimiliano', 'Bouaouina, Mohamed', 'Lamsoul, Isabelle', 'Lutz, Pierre G', 'Calderwood, David A']","['Razinia Z', 'Baldassarre M', 'Bouaouina M', 'Lamsoul I', 'Lutz PG', 'Calderwood DA']","['Department of Cell Biology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8066, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM068600/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM-068600/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (Filamins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Contractile Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Filamins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3138704,,2011/07/14 06:00,2011/12/15 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['jcs.084343 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.084343 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2011 Aug 1;124(Pt 15):2631-41. doi: 10.1242/jcs.084343.

Over-expression of EVI1 through either 3q26 rearrangements, MLL fusions, or other unknown mechanisms confers a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the prevalence and prognostic impact of EVI1 over-expression in a series of 476 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and investigated the epigenetic modifications of the EVI1 locus which could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. RESULTS: Our data provide further evidence that EVI1 over-expression is a poor prognostic marker in acute myeloid leukemia patients less than 65 years old. Moreover, we found that patients with no basal expression of EVI1 had a better prognosis than patients with expression/over-expression (P=0.036). We also showed that cell lines with over-expression of EVI1 had no DNA methylation in the promoter region of the EVI1 locus, and had marks of active histone modifications: H3 and H4 acetylation, and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4. Conversely, cell lines with no expression of EVI1 have DNA hypermethylation and are marked by repressive trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 at the EVI1 promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify EVI1 over-expression as a poor prognostic marker in a large, independent cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients less than 65 years old, and show that the total absence of EVI1 expression has a prognostic impact on the outcome of such patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that an aberrant epigenetic pattern involving DNA methylation, H3 and H4 acetylation, and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 and histone H3 lysine 27 might play a role in the transcriptional regulation of EVI1 in acute myeloid leukemia. This study opens new avenues for a better understanding of the regulation of EVI1 expression at a transcriptional level.","['Vazquez, Iria', 'Maicas, Miren', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Agirre, Xabier', 'Marin-Bejar, Oskar', 'Marcotegui, Nerea', 'Vicente, Carmen', 'Lahortiga, Idoya', 'Gomez-Benito, Maria', 'Carranza, Claudia', 'Valencia, Ana', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Lumbreras, Eva', 'Prosper, Felipe', 'Gomez-Casares, Maria T', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus M', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Odero, Maria D']","['Vazquez I', 'Maicas M', 'Cervera J', 'Agirre X', 'Marin-Bejar O', 'Marcotegui N', 'Vicente C', 'Lahortiga I', 'Gomez-Benito M', 'Carranza C', 'Valencia A', 'Brunet S', 'Lumbreras E', 'Prosper F', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Sanz MA', 'Sierra J', 'Odero MD']","['Division of Oncology, CIMA, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC3186305,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.040535 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.040535 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Oct;96(10):1448-56. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.040535.

These results support targeted efforts to bank family cord blood units that can be used for a sibling diagnosed with a disease which can be cured by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or for research that investigates the use of allogeneic or autologous cord blood cells. Over 500 patients transplanted with related cord blood units have been reported to the Eurocord registry with a 4-year overall survival of 91% for patients with non-malignant diseases and 56% for patients with malignant diseases. Main hematologic indications in children are leukemia, hemoglobinopathies or inherited hematologic, immunological or metabolic disorders. However, family-directed cord blood banking is not widely promoted; many cord blood units used in sibling transplantation have been obtained from private banks that do not meet the necessary criteria required to store these units. Marketing by private banks who predominantly store autologous cord blood units has created public confusion.

Toll-like receptors bridge the innate and adaptive immune responses by acting as co-stimulatory signals for B cells. The available data on the expression of Toll-like receptors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia are limited and derive from small series of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We profiled the expression of genes associated with Toll-like receptor signaling pathways in 192 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and explored potential associations with molecular features of the clonotypic B-cell receptors. RESULTS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells express all Toll-like receptors expressed by normal activated B cells, with high expression of TLR7 and CD180, intermediate expression of TLR1, TLR6, TLR10 and low expression of TLR2 and TLR9. The vast majority of adaptors, effectors and members of the NFKB, JNK/p38, NF/IL6 and IRF pathways are intermediately-to-highly expressed, while inhibitors of Toll-like receptor activity are generally low-to-undetectable, indicating that the Toll-like receptor-signaling framework is competent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Significant differences were identified for selected genes between cases carrying mutated or unmutated IGHV genes or assigned to different subsets with stereotyped B-cell receptors. The differentially expressed molecules include receptors, NFkappaB/MAPK signaling molecules and final targets of the cascade. CONCLUSIONS: The observed variations are suggestive of distinctive activation patterns of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway in subgroups of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia defined by the molecular features of B-cell receptors. Additionally, they indicate that different or concomitant signals acting through receptors other than the B-cell receptor can affect the behavior of the malignant clone.","['Arvaniti, Eleni', 'Ntoufa, Stavroula', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Touloumenidou, Tasoula', 'Laoutaris, Nikolaos', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Lamnissou, Klea', 'Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Muzio, Marta', 'Belessi, Chrysoula']","['Arvaniti E', 'Ntoufa S', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Touloumenidou T', 'Laoutaris N', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Lamnissou K', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Ghia P', 'Muzio M', 'Belessi C']","['School of Biology, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3208682,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.044792 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.044792 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Nov;96(11):1644-52. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.044792.

We used a cohort approach to examine whether residence near NPPs was associated with leukaemia or any childhood cancer in Switzerland. METHODS: We computed person-years at risk for children aged 0-15 years born in Switzerland from 1985 to 2009, based on the Swiss censuses 1990 and 2000 and identified cancer cases from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We geo-coded place of residence at birth and calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing the risk of cancer in children born <5 km, 5-10 km and 10-15 km from the nearest NPP with children born >15 km away, using Poisson regression models. RESULTS: We included 2925 children diagnosed with cancer during 21 117 524 person-years of follow-up; 953 (32.6%) had leukaemia. Eight and 12 children diagnosed with leukaemia at ages 0-4 and 0-15 years, and 18 and 31 children diagnosed with any cancer were born <5 km from a NPP. Compared with children born >15 km away, the IRRs (95% CI) for leukaemia in 0-4 and 0-15 year olds were 1.20 (0.60-2.41) and 1.05 (0.60-1.86), respectively. For any cancer, corresponding IRRs were 0.97 (0.61-1.54) and 0.89 (0.63-1.27). There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship with distance (P > 0.30). Results were similar for residence at diagnosis and at birth, and when adjusted for potential confounders. Results from sensitivity analyses were consistent with main results. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide cohort study found little evidence of an association between residence near NPPs and the risk of leukaemia or any childhood cancer.","['Spycher, Ben D', 'Feller, Martin', 'Zwahlen, Marcel', 'Roosli, Martin', 'von der Weid, Nicolas X', 'Hengartner, Heinz', 'Egger, Matthias', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Spycher BD', 'Feller M', 'Zwahlen M', 'Roosli M', 'von der Weid NX', 'Hengartner H', 'Egger M', 'Kuehni CE']","['Division of International and Environmental Health, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",PMC3204210,,2011/07/14 06:00,2012/03/20 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/20 06:00 [medline]']","['dyr115 [pii]', '10.1093/ije/dyr115 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2011 Oct;40(5):1247-60. doi: 10.1093/ije/dyr115.

For this study, we investigated the effects of the DIP-DHA conjugate on 2 representative T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines: CEM and Jurkat. Treatment of both cell lines with DIP-DHA resulted in significantly greater inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis than that of parent compounds, 2,6-diisopropylphenol (DIP) or docosahexaenoate (DHA). Treatment of the cells with DIP-DHA resulted in increased activation of caspase-3, and caspase-7. Furthermore, induction of apoptosis in both cell lines was reversed in the presence of a caspase family inhibitor. Treatment with DIP-DHA reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. These observations suggest that the effects are driven by intrinsic apoptotic pathways. DIP-DHA treatment also downregulated surface CXCR4 expression, an important chemokine receptor involved in cancer metastasis that is highly expressed in both CEM and Jurkat cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that the DIP-DHA conjugate exhibits significantly more potent effects on CEM and Jurkat cells than that of DIP or DHA alone.

This study aimed to identify genomic lesions associated with a poor outcome and a higher risk of histological transformation. A mono-institutional cohort of 147 cases was used as the test series, and a multi-institutional cohort of 176 cases as a validation series. Genomic profiles were obtained using Affymetrix SNP 6.0. The impact of the recurrent minimal common regions (MCRs) on overall survival was evaluated by univariate analysis followed by multiple-test correction. The independent prognostic significance was assessed by multivariate analysis. Eight MCRs showed a prognostic impact: gains at 2p25.3-p22.3 (MYCN), 2p22.3, 2p16.2-p14 (REL), 8q23.3-q24.3 (MYC), losses at 8p23.1-p21.2, 8p21.2, and of the TP53 locus. Gains at 2p and 8q and TP53 inactivation maintained prognostic significance in multivariate analysis and a hierarchical model confirmed their relevance.

It has been reported that genistein has apoptotic effects on certain hematological malignancies. However, so far there have been no completely comparative studies of the effect of genistein on malignant hematological diseases, especially multiple myeloma. We investigated genistein's inhibitory effect on the growth of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RS4;11 and CEM), lymphoma (Toledo and GA10) and multiple myeloma (OPM-2 and U266) cell lines in vitro. We observed that genistein dose- and time-dependently inhibited proliferation of these cells. The cell line sensitivity to genistein treatment based on the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values in decreasing order of toxicity was found to be as follows: RS4;11 (4.89 +/- 4.28 muM) > GA10 (13.08 +/- 3.49 muM) > Toledo (16.94 +/- 3.89 muM) > CEM (17.31 +/- 0.72 muM) > OPM-2 (46.76 +/- 2.26 muM) > U266 (128.82 +/- 1.90 muM). The mechanism of growth inhibition was through induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The concomitant altered expression of apoptosis pathway proteins and cell cycle modulators (caspases 9, 3, 7, PARP [poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase], cIAP1 [inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1], Bcl-2 and cyclin B1) were observed by Western blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses.

LGL cells play an integral role in the immune system and are divided into two major lineages of CD3(-)natural killer (NK) cells and CD3(+) T cells that circulate throughout the blood in search of infected cells, in which they will make contact through a receptor ligand and induce cell death. LGL cells are also programmed to undergo apoptosis after contact with an infected target cell; however, they continue to survive in individuals with LGL leukemia. This unchecked proliferation and cytotoxicity of LGLs in patients results in autoimmunity or malignancy. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune condition seen in individuals with LGL leukemia; however, LGL leukemia is associated with a wide spectrum of other autoimmune diseases. Patients may also suffer from other hematological conditions including hemolytic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, and neutropenia, which lead to recurrent bacterial infections. Currently, the only established treatment involves a low dose of an immunosuppressive regimen with methotrexate, in which 40-50% of patients are either resistant or do not respond. In order to establish new therapeutics it is important to understand the current state of LGL leukemia both in the clinic and in basic research.","['Watters, Rebecca J', 'Liu, Xin', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Watters RJ', 'Liu X', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033-0850, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA098472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/classification/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Research', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/pathology']",PMC3721966,['NIHMS488537'],2011/07/14 06:00,2012/07/14 06:00,['2011/07/14 06:00'],"['2011/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.593276 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Dec;52(12):2217-25. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.593276.

Here, we report that magnetofection of N,N''-dioleylglutamide (DG)-based magnetic lipoplexes can substantially enhance the cellular delivery rates of siRNA. The siRNA was triply complexed with DG-based cationic liposomes and cationic iron-oxide nanoparticles. The formation of siRNA-containing magnetic lipoplexes was confirmed by gel retardation, sizes, and zeta potential values. Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry of fluorescent marker-labeled siRNA revealed that the DG-based magnetic lipoplexes conferred a higher cellular delivery rate of siRNA than DG-based lipoplexes or Lipofectamine 2000. In addition to the enhanced delivery of siRNA, the DG-based magnetic lipoplexes showed lack of cytotoxicity. We then tested the application of these magnetic lipoplexes for the cellular delivery of anticancer siRNA. Cancer cell lines magnetofected with DG-based magnetic lipoplexes containing Mcl1-specific siRNA (siMcl1) showed much lower viability than the groups treated with DG-based lipoplexes or Lipofectamine 2000, indicating that our magnetofection strategy conferred greater siMcl1-induced anticancer activity.

We examined whether child's germline genetic variation in the folate pathway is associated with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and whether periconception maternal folate and alcohol intake modify the risk. METHODS: Seventy-six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including 66 haplotype-tagging SNPs in 10 genes (CBS, DHFR, FOLH1, MTHFD1, MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, SHMT1, SLC19A1, and TYMS), were genotyped in 377 ALL cases and 448 controls. Log-additive associations between genotypes and ALL risk were adjusted for age, sex, Hispanic ethnicity (when appropriate), and maternal race. RESULTS: Single and haplotype SNPs analyses showed statistically significant associations between SNPs located in (or adjacent to) CBS, MTRR, TYMS/ENOFS, and childhood ALL. Many regions of CBS were associated with childhood ALL in Hispanics and non-Hispanics (p < 0.01). Levels of maternal folate intake modified associations with SNPs in CBS, MTRR, and TYMS. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the importance of genetic variability in the folate pathway and childhood ALL risk.","['Metayer, Catherine', 'Scelo, Ghislaine', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Barcellos, Lisa F', 'Aldrich, Melinda C', 'Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Guha, Neela', 'Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Block, Gladys', 'Kiley, Vincent', 'Wiencke, John K', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Metayer C', 'Scelo G', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Barcellos LF', 'Aldrich MC', 'Chang JS', 'Guha N', 'Urayama KY', 'Hansen HM', 'Block G', 'Kiley V', 'Wiencke JK', 'Wiemels JL', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Suite 460, Berkeley, CA 94704-7392, USA. cmetayer@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42-ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,['935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)'],IM,"['Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Folic Acid/administration & dosage/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Risk Factors']",PMC3744066,['NIHMS500104'],2011/07/13 06:00,2012/01/26 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-011-9795-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2011 Sep;22(9):1243-58. doi: 10.1007/s10552-011-9795-7.

The trephine biopsy has the characteristic features of a honey comb appearance and flow cytometry is typically CD103, CD25, FMC7, CD11c, gamma or kappa light chain positive with the classic B lymphocyte markers CD19, CD20, CD79a. Purine analogues followed by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to manage the febrile neutropenia is currently the treatment of choice. A 10 year disease free survival is recorded with these management strategies. Experimental use of anti CD20 and CD22 has also shown promising results in the treatment of this disease. We report four cases of HCL diagnosed in a span of two years at the Royal Hospital, Muscat, Oman.","['Kurukulasuriya, Arundathi', 'Al-Rashdi, Asia', 'Al-Muslahi, Muhanna']","['Kurukulasuriya A', 'Al-Rashdi A', 'Al-Muslahi M']","['Department of Haematology & Blood Transfusion, Royal Hospital, Muscat, Sultanate of Oman.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Oman,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,101519915,,,,PMC3074845,,2008/11/01 00:00,2008/11/01 00:01,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2008/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J. 2008 Nov;8(3):333-8.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Case report', 'Hairy cell leukaemia', 'Lymphoproliferative disorder', 'Oman']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since it is not possible for the non-oncologist to keep abreast with the latest developments in the field of oncology, this review summarises the most significant advances in the area of treatment of various cancers over the past four years. In some areas, a paradigm shift has occurred setting new standards of care, for example, the use of targeted therapy (trastuzumab) in adjuvant treatment of breast cancer; the use of monoclonal antibodies (rituximab), with or without chemotherapy, in the treatment and maintenance of indolent lymphoma; the use of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, in the adjuvant setting in resected gastrointestinal stromal tumours. In other areas, new treatments have emerged, such as, the use of targeted therapies in hepatocellular carcinoma (sorafenib) and renal cell carcinoma (sunitinib, sorafenib, temsirolimus, bevacizumab). In some other cancers, the addition of targeted therapies has improved survival rates, for example, in colon cancer (bevacizumab, cetuximb, panitumumab), head and neck cancers (cetuximab), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (erlotinib). In yet another group, new targeted therapies have emerged where resistance was previously observed with the existing targeted therapies, for example, breast cancer (lapatinib), chronic myeloid leukemia (dasatinib). Finally, the addition of chemotherapeutic agents has improved survival in some forms of cancer, for example, oxaliplatin in adjuvant treatment of colon cancer, temozolamide in glioblastoma multiforme, and adjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. The information summarized here may provide useful for the busy physician needing an update in the field of oncology.","['Burney, Ikram A', 'Al-Moundhri, Mansour S']","['Burney IA', 'Al-Moundhri MS']","['Department of Medicine, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Oman,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J,Sultan Qaboos University medical journal,101519915,,,,PMC3074830,,2008/07/01 00:00,2008/07/01 00:01,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2008/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2008/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/01 00:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Sultan Qaboos Univ Med J. 2008 Jul;8(2):137-48.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bevacizumab', 'Imatinib', 'Medical Oncology', 'Rituximab', 'Sorafenib', 'Sunitinib', 'Trastuzumab']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-eight patients diagnosed between July 1996 and December 2007 were treated using LMB 96, and 22 patients diagnosed between January 1991 and May 1998 (defined as the early period) were treated using the D-COMP or CCG-106B protocols. We retrospectively reviewed their medical records and analyzed cumulative survival according to the treatment period by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: There were no intergroup differences in the distribution of age, disease stage, or risk group. The median follow-up period of the 33 live patients in the LMB group was 72 months (range, 36-170 months). Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of patients treated using LMB 96 were 86.8%+/-5.5% and 81.6%+/-6.3%, respectively, whereas OS and EFS of patients treated in the early period were 72.7%+/-9.6% and 68.2%+/-9.9%, respectively. In the LMB 96 group, OS of cases showing non-complete response (N=8) was 62.5%+/-17.1%, and OS of relapsed or primary refractory cases (N=6) was 33.3%+/-19.3%. Central nervous system (CNS) disease, high lactate dehydrogenase levels at diagnosis, and treatment response were significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Survival outcome has drastically improved over the last 2 decades with short-term, dose-intensive chemotherapy. However, CNS involvement or poor response to chemotherapy was worse prognostic factors; therefore, future studies addressing this therapeutic challenge are warranted.","['Park, Eun Sil', 'Kim, Hyery', 'Lee, Ji Won', 'Lim, Jae-Young', 'Kang, Hyoung Jin', 'Park, Kyung Duk', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Ahn, Hyo Seop']","['Park ES', 'Kim H', 'Lee JW', 'Lim JY', 'Kang HJ', 'Park KD', 'Shin HY', 'Ahn HS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Health Science, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,,PMC3128907,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/07/13 06:01,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2011.46.2.96 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2011 Jun;46(2):96-102. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2011.46.2.96.

However, the prognostic significance of the mutation at relapse has not been adequately investigated. We investigated the prognostic significance of the FLT3 ITD mutation at relapse in normal-karyotype AML patients. METHODS: We analyzed 69 normal-karyotype AML patients, in whom paired bone marrow samples taken at initial diagnosis and subsequent relapse were analyzed for the FLT3 ITD mutation at the Asan Medical Center between 1995 and 2009. RESULTS: Forty patients showed a persistent wild-type genotype, 11 showed the FLT3 ITD mutation at diagnosis and relapse, and 9 lost and another 9 acquired the mutation at relapse. The mutation status at relapse affected the overall survival (OS), with the mutation group showing shorter OS and survival after relapse than the wild-type group did (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively), despite having received more frequent stem cell transplantation after relapse than the wild-type group did. However, no difference was detected in the OS and survival after relapse with regard to the mutation status at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The patients with FLT3 ITD mutation at relapse showed poorer prognoses than those without the mutation. However, mutation status at diagnosis did not affect the outcome. These results suggest that, in normal-karyotype AML patients with relapse, the prognostic significance of FLT3 ITD mutation at relapse is greater than that of the mutation status at diagnosis.","['Park, Sang Hyuk', 'Chi, Hyun-Sook', 'Min, Sook-Kyung', 'Cho, Young-Uk', 'Jang, Seongsoo', 'Park, Chan-Jeoung', 'Lee, Jung-Hee', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung', 'Im, Ho-Joon', 'Seo, Jong-Jin']","['Park SH', 'Chi HS', 'Min SK', 'Cho YU', 'Jang S', 'Park CJ', 'Lee JH', 'Lee JH', 'Lee KH', 'Im HJ', 'Seo JJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Hematol,The Korean journal of hematology,101486388,,,,PMC3128906,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/07/13 06:01,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/kjh.2011.46.2.88 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Hematol. 2011 Jun;46(2):88-95. doi: 10.5045/kjh.2011.46.2.88.

However, its biological activity on human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 is not fully understood. In the present study, we investigated the proliferation-attenuating and apoptosis-inducing effects of tryptanthrin on leukemia K562 cells in vitro and explored the underlying mechanisms. The results showed that tryptanthrin could significantly inhibit K562 cells proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner as evidenced by MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed pyknosis, chromatin margination and the formation of apoptotic bodies in the presence of tryptanthrin under the electron microscope. Nuclei fragmentation and condensation by Hoechst 33258 staining were detected as well. The amount of apoptotic cells significantly increased whereas the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased dramatically after tryptanthrin exposure. K562 cells in the tryptanthrin treated group exhibited an increase in cytosol cyt-c, Bax and activated caspase-3 expression while a decrease in Bcl-2, mito cyt-c and pro-caspase-3 contents. However, the changes of pro-caspase-3 and activated caspase-3 could be abolished by a pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK. These results suggest that tryptanthrin has proliferation-attenuating and apoptosis-inducing effects on K562 cells. The underlying mechanism is probably attributed to the reduction in mitochondria membrane potential, the release of mito cyt-c and pro-caspase-3 activation.","['Miao, Shan', 'Shi, Xiaopeng', 'Zhang, Hai', 'Wang, Siwang', 'Sun, Jiyuan', 'Hua, Wei', 'Miao, Qing', 'Zhao, Yong', 'Zhang, Caiqin']","['Miao S', 'Shi X', 'Zhang H', 'Wang S', 'Sun J', 'Hua W', 'Miao Q', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhang C']","[""Institute of Materia Medica, School of Pharmacy, Fourth Military Medical University, #17 West Changle Road, Xi'an 710032, China; E-Mails: miaoshan@fmmu.edu.cn (S.M.); sunjiy@fmmu.edu.cn (J.S.); miaoqing@fmmu.edu.cn (Q.M.).""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '13220-57-0 (tryptanthrine)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC3131594,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/07/13 06:01,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3390/ijms12063831 [doi]', 'ijms-12-03831 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2011;12(6):3831-45. doi: 10.3390/ijms12063831.

Alterations of the TP53 gene are frequently associated with resistance to chemotherapy, but their significance in relapsed childhood ALL has remained controversial because of small studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Therefore, we systematically studied 265 first-relapse patients enrolled in the German Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Relapse Berlin-Frankfurt-Mu nster 2002 (ALL-REZ BFM 2002) trial for sequence and copy number alterations of the TP53 gene by using direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. RESULTS: We observed copy number and sequence alterations of TP53 in 12.4% (27 of 218) of patients with B-cell precursor ALL and 6.4% (three of 47) of patients with T-cell ALL relapse. Backtracking to initial ALL in 23 matched samples revealed that 54% of all TP53 alterations were gained at relapse. Within B-cell precursor ALL, TP53 alterations were consistently associated with nonresponse to chemotherapy (P < .001) and poor event-free survival (P < .001) and overall survival rates (P = .002). TP53 alterations also had a significant impact on survival within intermediate-risk (S2) and high-risk (S3/S4) relapse patients (P = .007 and P = .019, respectively). This prognostic significance of TP53 alterations was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Besides their clinical impact, TP53 alterations were associated with a higher fraction of leukemic cells in S/G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle at relapse diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Alterations of the TP53 gene are of particular importance in the relapse stage of childhood ALL, in which they independently predict high risk of treatment failure in a significant number of patients. Therefore, they will aid in future risk assessment of children with ALL relapse.","['Hof, Jana', 'Krentz, Stefanie', 'van Schewick, Claudia', 'Korner, Gabriele', 'Shalapour, Shabnam', 'Rhein, Peter', 'Karawajew, Leonid', 'Ludwig, Wolf-Dieter', 'Seeger, Karl', 'Henze, Gunter', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Hagemeier, Christian', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Kirschner-Schwabe, Renate']","['Hof J', 'Krentz S', 'van Schewick C', 'Korner G', 'Shalapour S', 'Rhein P', 'Karawajew L', 'Ludwig WD', 'Seeger K', 'Henze G', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Hagemeier C', 'Eckert C', 'Kirschner-Schwabe R']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburgerplatz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.8144 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.8144 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug 10;29(23):3185-93. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.8144.

This study also prospectively studied patient- and tumor-specific markers of treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After surgical resection, patients with stage II colon cancer were randomly assigned to either five infusions of edrecolomab at 28-day intervals or observation without adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: Final accrual included 1,738 patients; 865 patients received edrecolomab, and 873 patients were observed without adjuvant treatment. Median follow-up time was 7.9 years. There were no significant outcome differences between study arms (overall survival [OS], P = .71; disease-free survival, P = .64). The combined 5-year all-cause OS was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.88), and the combined 5-year disease-specific OS was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.91 to 0.94). The relationships between demographic and histopathologic factors and survival differed for all-cause and disease-specific survival outcomes, but no combined prognostic factor model was found to adequately classify patients at higher risk of recurrence or death as a result of colon cancer. CONCLUSION: Edrecolomab did not prolong survival. Consequently, this large study with a long duration of follow-up provided unique data concerning the natural history of resected stage II colon cancer. Prognostic factors identified in previous retrospective and pooled analyses were associated with survival outcomes in this stage II patient cohort. Results from ongoing molecular marker studies may enhance our ability to determine the risk profile of these patients.","['Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M', 'Warren, Robert S', 'Compton, Carolyn C', 'Kemeny, Nancy E', 'Benson, Al Bowen 3rd', 'Eckhardt, S Gail', 'Alberts, Steven', 'Porjosh, Gity N', 'Kerr, David J', 'Fields, Anthony', 'Rougier, Philippe', 'Pipas, J Marc', 'Schwartz, Joel H', 'Atkins, James', ""O'Rourke, Mark"", 'Perry, Michael C', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Colacchio, Thomas A']","['Niedzwiecki D', 'Bertagnolli MM', 'Warren RS', 'Compton CC', 'Kemeny NE', 'Benson AB 3rd', 'Eckhardt SG', 'Alberts S', 'Porjosh GN', 'Kerr DJ', 'Fields A', 'Rougier P', 'Pipas JM', 'Schwartz JH', 'Atkins J', ""O'Rourke M"", 'Perry MC', 'Goldberg RM', 'Mayer RJ', 'Colacchio TA']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Center, Duke University Medical Center, Hock Plaza, 2424 Erwin Rd, Room 8040, Durham, NC 27705, USA. niedz001@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025741/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0KYI9U9FSJ (Edrecolomab)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Digestive System Surgical Procedures', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3157980,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.32.5357 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.32.5357 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug 10;29(23):3146-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.32.5357.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned to carboplatin (area under the curve, 5) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2)) every 21 days for four cycles and TRT (70 Gy; arm A) or the same treatment with cetuximab administered concurrent only with TRT (arm B). Patients in both arms received up to four cycles of pemetrexed as consolidation therapy. The primary end point was the 18-month overall survival (OS) rate; if the 18-month OS rate was >/= 55%, the regimen(s) would be considered for further study. RESULTS: Of the 101 eligible patients enrolled (48 in arm A and 53 in arm B), 60% were male; the median age was 66 years (range, 32 to 81 years); 44% and 35% had adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma, respectively; and more patients enrolled onto arm A compared with arm B had a performance status of 0 (58% v 34%, respectively; P = .04). The 18-month OS rate was 58% (95% CI, 46% to 74%) in arm A and 54% (95% CI, 42% to 70%) in arm B. No significant difference in OS between patients with squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC was observed (P = .667). The toxicities observed were consistent with toxicities associated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSION: The combination of pemetrexed, carboplatin, and TRT met the prespecified criteria for further evaluation. This regimen should be studied further in patients with locally advanced unresectable nonsquamous NSCLC.","['Govindan, Ramaswamy', 'Bogart, Jeffrey', 'Stinchcombe, Thomas', 'Wang, Xiaofei', 'Hodgson, Lydia', 'Kratzke, Robert', 'Garst, Jennifer', 'Brotherton, Timothy', 'Vokes, Everett E']","['Govindan R', 'Bogart J', 'Stinchcombe T', 'Wang X', 'Hodgson L', 'Kratzke R', 'Garst J', 'Brotherton T', 'Vokes EE']","[""Washington University School of Medicine, 4960 Children's Place, St Louis, MO 63110, USA. rgovinda@dom.wustl.edu""]",['eng'],"['U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Glutamates)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'PQX0D8J21J (Cetuximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Cetuximab', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Glutamates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Guanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pemetrexed']",PMC3157978,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.33.4979 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.33.4979 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug 10;29(23):3120-5. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.33.4979.

This study examined the clinical relevance of such a distinction. METHODS: Representatives from seven international centers of excellence for myeloproliferative neoplasms convened to create a clinicopathologic database of patients previously diagnosed as having ET (N = 1,104). Study eligibility criteria included availability of treatment-naive BM specimens obtained within 1 year of diagnosis. All bone marrows subsequently underwent a central re-review. RESULTS: Diagnosis was confirmed as ET in 891 patients (81%) and was revised to early/prefibrotic PMF in 180 (16%); 33 patients were not evaluable. In early/prefibrotic PMF compared with ET, the 10-year survival rates (76% and 89%, respectively) and 15-year survival rates (59% and 80%, respectively), leukemic transformation rates at 10 years (5.8% and 0.7%, respectively) and 15 years (11.7% and 2.1%, respectively), and rates of progression to overt myelofibrosis at 10 years (12.3% and 0.8%, respectively) and 15 years (16.9% and 9.3%) were significantly worse. The respective death, leukemia, and overt myelofibrosis incidence rates per 100 patient-years for early/prefibrotic PMF compared with ET were 2.7% and 1.3% (relative risk [RR], 2.1; P < .001), 0.6% and 0.1% (RR, 5.2; P = .001), and 1% and 0.5% (RR, 2.0; P = .04). Multivariable analysis confirmed these findings and also identified age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 6.7), leukocyte count greater than 11 x 10(9)/L (HR, 2.01), anemia (HR, 2.95), and thrombosis history (HR, 2.81) as additional risk factors for survival. Thrombosis and JAK2V617F incidence rates were similar between the two groups. Survival in ET was similar to the sex- and age-standardized European population. CONCLUSION: This study validates the clinical relevance of strict adherence to WHO criteria in the diagnosis of ET and provides important information on survival, disease complication rates, and prognostic factors in strictly WHO-defined ET and early/prefibrotic PMF.","['Barbui, Tiziano', 'Thiele, Juergen', 'Passamonti, Francesco', 'Rumi, Elisa', 'Boveri, Emanuela', 'Ruggeri, Marco', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco', ""d'Amore, Emanuele S G"", 'Randi, Maria Luigia', 'Bertozzi, Irene', 'Marino, Filippo', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Antonioli, Elisabetta', 'Carrai, Valentina', 'Gisslinger, Heinz', 'Buxhofer-Ausch, Veronika', 'Mullauer, Leonhard', 'Carobbio, Alessandra', 'Gianatti, Andrea', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Barbui T', 'Thiele J', 'Passamonti F', 'Rumi E', 'Boveri E', 'Ruggeri M', 'Rodeghiero F', ""d'Amore ES"", 'Randi ML', 'Bertozzi I', 'Marino F', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Antonioli E', 'Carrai V', 'Gisslinger H', 'Buxhofer-Ausch V', 'Mullauer L', 'Carobbio A', 'Gianatti A', 'Gangat N', 'Hanson CA', 'Tefferi A']","['Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*diagnosis/mortality', 'World Health Organization', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/10/06 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2010.34.5298 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2010.34.5298 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Aug 10;29(23):3179-84. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2010.34.5298.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 435 patients with early chronic-phase, Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML treated with imatinib (n = 281), nilotinib (n = 78), and dasatinib (n = 76) using definitions of PFS and EFS used in the International Randomized Study of Interferon Versus STI571 (IRIS), Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials-Newly Diagnosed Patients (ENEST-nd), Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive CML Patients (DASISION), and MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) trials. Definitions for EFS-IRIS, time without progression in ENEST-nd, PFS-DASISION, and EFS-MDACC were as previously reported. The EFS-MDACC considered an event any instance of toxicity or death from any cause on or off therapy (if not counted before death as progression/event). RESULTS: Of the 435 patients, 123 (28%) were taken off TKI therapy (resistance/loss of response, n = 33; blastic phase on TKI therapy, n = 6; intolerance/toxicity, n = 29; other causes, n = 55). Thirty-three patients (7.6%) have died; eight patients died on TKI therapy, two patients died within 60 days of being off TKIs, and 23 patients died after being off TKIs for more than 60 days. Of the 33 deaths, 19 deaths (eight deaths on TKI, two deaths within 60 days, and nine deaths off for resistance/relapse/transformation) would be counted as progression/events on the IRIS/ENEST-nd/DASISION studies, whereas 14 deaths would be censored at time off TKI. On the basis of the four definitions used by IRIS, ENEST-nd, DASISION, and MDACC trials, the corresponding 5-year PFS/EFS rates were 96%, 90%, 89%, and 81%.

In the next round of infection, the mature Gag capsids disassemble during viral entry. Thus, Gag plays a central role in the HIV life cycle. Using a yeast membrane-associated two-hybrid assay based on the SOS-RAS signaling system, we developed a system to measure the Gag-Gag interaction and isolated 6 candidates for Gag assembly inhibitors from a chemical library composed of 20,000 small molecules. When tested in the human MT-4 cell line and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, one of the candidates, 2-(benzothiazol-2-ylmethylthio)-4-methylpyrimidine (BMMP), displayed an inhibitory effect on HIV replication, although a considerably high dose was required. Unexpectedly, neither particle production nor maturation was inhibited by BMMP. Confocal microscopy confirmed that BMMP did not block Gag plasma membrane targeting. Single-round infection assays with envelope-pseudotyped and luciferase-expressing viruses revealed that BMMP inhibited HIV replication postentry but not simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or murine leukemia virus infection. Studies with HIV/SIV Gag chimeras indicated that the Gag capsid (CA) domain was responsible for the BMMP-mediated HIV postentry block. In vitro studies indicated that BMMP accelerated disassembly of HIV cores and, conversely, inhibited assembly of purified CA protein in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, our data suggest that BMMP primarily targets the HIV CA domain and disrupts viral infection postentry, possibly through inducing premature disassembly of HIV cores. We suggest that BMMP is a potential lead compound to develop antiretroviral drugs bearing novel mechanisms of action.","['Urano, Emiko', 'Kuramochi, Noriko', 'Ichikawa, Reiko', 'Murayama, Somay Yamagata', 'Miyauchi, Kosuke', 'Tomoda, Hiroshi', 'Takebe, Yutaka', 'Nermut, Milan', 'Komano, Jun', 'Morikawa, Yuko']","['Urano E', 'Kuramochi N', 'Ichikawa R', 'Murayama SY', 'Miyauchi K', 'Tomoda H', 'Takebe Y', 'Nermut M', 'Komano J', 'Morikawa Y']","['Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences and Graduate School of Infection Control, Kitasato University, Shirokane 5-9-1, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (2-(benzothiazol-6-ylamino)-4-(indan-5-ylamino)pyrimidine)', '0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Pyrimidines)']",IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', '*Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",PMC3165301,,2011/07/13 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['AAC.00299-11 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.00299-11 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2011 Sep;55(9):4251-60. doi: 10.1128/AAC.00299-11.

We show that the Pbx1 and Meis2 homeodomain proteins interact with Klf4 and can be recruited to DNA elements comprising a Klf4 site or GC box, with adjacent Meis and Pbx sites. Meis2d and Pbx1a activate expression of p15(Ink4a) and E-cadherin, dependent on the Meis2d transcriptional activation domain. In HepG2 cells, reducing expression of endogenous Meis2 or Pbx1 decreases p15 gene expression and increases the number of cells entering S phase. Although DNA binding by all three proteins contributes to full cooperative activation, the sequence requirements for binding by Meis2 and Pbx1 are variable. In the E-cadherin promoter, a Pbx-like site is required for full activation, whereas in the p15 promoter, the Klf4 site appears to play the major role. Through a bioinformatics search we identified additional genes with conserved binding sites for Klf4, Meis2, and Pbx1 and show that at least some of these genes can be activated cooperatively by Klf4 and Meis2/Pbx1. We suggest a model in which genes with Klf4 sites can be cooperatively activated by Meis2/Pbx1 and Klf4, dependent primarily on recruitment by Klf4. This provides a mechanism to modulate transcriptional regulation by the multifunctional Klf4 transcription factor.","['Bjerke, Glen A', 'Hyman-Walsh, Cathy', 'Wotton, David']","['Bjerke GA', 'Hyman-Walsh C', 'Wotton D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics and Center for Cell Signaling, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HD039926/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD39926/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MEIS2 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'COS Cells', 'Cadherins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC3165729,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['MCB.01456-10 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01456-10 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2011 Sep;31(18):3723-33. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01456-10.

The authors propose an approach to explore the contribution of saturable metabolism to previously reported exposure-response relations by integrating predictive models of relevant biomarkers of exposure into the epidemiologic analysis. The approach is demonstrated with 2 studies of leukemia in benzene-exposed workers, one conducted in the Australian petroleum industry (1981-1999) and one conducted in a US rubber hydrochloride production factory in Ohio (1940-1996). The studies differed greatly in their magnitudes and durations of exposure. Substitution of biomarker levels for external estimates of benzene exposure reduced the fold difference of the log relative risk of leukemia per unit of cumulative exposure between the 2 studies by 11%-44%. Nevertheless, a considerable difference in the log relative risk per unit of cumulative exposure remained between the 2 studies, suggesting that exposure misclassification, differences in study design, and potential confounding factors also contributed to the heterogeneity in risk estimates.","['Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Portengen, Lutzen', 'Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Glass, Deborah C', 'Kromhout, Hans', 'Vermeulen, Roel']","['Vlaanderen J', 'Portengen L', 'Rappaport SM', 'Glass DC', 'Kromhout H', 'Vermeulen R']","['Environmental Epidemiology Division, Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, P.O.

The B-cell immunophenotype of LBL (B-LBL) accounts for less than 20% of all cases and may involve extramediastinal areas, such as the skin. Although highly aggressive, LBL is potentially curable if diagnosed early. OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the clinical and histopathologic features of B-LBL in children presenting with cutaneous lesions, and to highlight the specific features of this rare and serious disease. METHODS: Seven children with a confirmed diagnosis of cutaneous B-LBL were identified by retrospective chart review. The clinical and histopathologic features were documented, analyzed, and compared with cases previously published in the literature. RESULTS: Six children developed nodules on the head, and one child presented with lesions on the back and abdomen. Histopathology showed a diffuse dermal and subcutaneous monomorphous infiltrate made up of atypical cells with an immature B-cell phenotype. The average duration of the lesions before diagnosis was 3.2 months. A staging workup revealed extracutaneous disease in 5 patients, including bone-marrow involvement in 4 children. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study with a small number of patients. CONCLUSION: The cutaneous lesions of B-LBL typically manifest as rapidly growing erythematous firm nodules located on the head. Awareness of these clinical features is important for the diagnosis to be reached rapidly and treatment started without delay.","['Boccara, Olivia', 'Laloum-Grynberg, Etty', 'Jeudy, Geraldine', 'Aubriot-Lorton, Marie-Helene', 'Vabres, Pierre', 'de Prost, Yves', 'Pacquement, Helene', 'Brousse, Nicole', 'Fraitag, Sylvie', 'Bodemer, Christine']","['Boccara O', 'Laloum-Grynberg E', 'Jeudy G', 'Aubriot-Lorton MH', 'Vabres P', 'de Prost Y', 'Pacquement H', 'Brousse N', 'Fraitag S', 'Bodemer C']","['Necker-Enfants-Malades Hospital, Dermatology Department and Pathology Department, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris, University Rene Descartes Paris V, Paris, France. oliveboc@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology/therapy']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2010/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0190-9622(10)02120-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2010.10.040 [doi]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 2012 Jan;66(1):51-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jaad.2010.10.040.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the anti-inflammatory activity of capsaicin can be used to improve free fatty acid (FFA)-induced inflammation by reducing gene expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell) macrophages. To investigate whether capsaicin ameliorates palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 gene expressions, we treated THP-1 cells with palmitate in the presence or absence of capsaicin and measured MIP-1 and IL-8 by real-time polymerase chain reaction. To elucidate the mechanism by which capsaicin effects on palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 gene expressions, we performed immunoblotting with stress kinase-related antibodies and measured palmitate oxidation and palmitate oxidation-related gene expression. Palmitate and stearate but not the unsaturated FFA oleate significantly increased MIP-1 and IL-8 expressions in THP-1 macrophages. Treatment with capsaicin or FFA oxidation stimulators inhibited palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 expressions in THP-1 macrophages. Capsaicin increased the gene expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and the beta-oxidation of palmitate. Furthermore, capsaicin significantly reduced palmitate-stimulated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Jun, and p38. Our data suggest that the attenuation of palmitate-induced MIP-1 and IL-8 gene expressions by capsaicin is associated with reduced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, c-Jun, and p38 and preserved beta-oxidation activity.","['Choi, Sung-E', 'Kim, Tae Ho', 'Yi, Sang-A', 'Hwang, Yun Cheong', 'Hwang, Won Sun', 'Choe, Sun Jung', 'Han, Seung Jin', 'Kim, Hae Jin', 'Kim, Dae Jung', 'Kang, Yup', 'Lee, Kwan-Woo']","['Choi SE', 'Kim TH', 'Yi SA', 'Hwang YC', 'Hwang WS', 'Choe SJ', 'Han SJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim DJ', 'Kang Y', 'Lee KW']","['Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon 443-749, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Res,"Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)",8303331,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S07O44R1ZM (Capsaicin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Capsaicin/*pharmacology', 'Capsicum/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Palmitates/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0271-5317(11)00095-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nutres.2011.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Nutr Res. 2011 Jun;31(6):468-78. doi: 10.1016/j.nutres.2011.05.007.

To date, specific targeting of GvL antigens with effector T cells and of GvHD antigens with specific regulatory T cells remains the subject of experimental research. In clinical reality, negative modulation of GvHD, e.g. by immunosuppression, reduces GvL and positive modulation of GvL, e.g. by donor lymphocyte infusions, often amplifies GvHD. Clinically feasible strategies to induce GvL while simultaneously reducing GvHD are urgently needed. Here, we report the case of an early relapsed primary cutaneous T cell lymphoma in tumor stage after allogeneic stem cell transplantation which was successfully treated with a parallel administration of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and systemic PUVA and bexarotene which led to sustained complete remission without onset of acute GvHD. After termination of the treatment with PUVA/bexarotene subacute chronic GvHD occurred but was subsequently brought under control by extracorporeal photopheresis. We suggest that the combination of DLI and PUVA/bexarotene might be an interesting immunologic bimodal treatment option which warrants further investigation.","['Schlaak, M', 'Kurschat, P', 'Shimabukuro-Vornhagen, A', 'Scheid, C', 'Chemnitz, J', 'Stadler, R', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon, M', 'Theurich, S']","['Schlaak M', 'Kurschat P', 'Shimabukuro-Vornhagen A', 'Scheid C', 'Chemnitz J', 'Stadler R', 'von Bergwelt-Baildon M', 'Theurich S']","['University Hospital of Cologne, Department of Dermatology, Skin Cancer Center, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Transpl Immunol,Transplant immunology,9309923,"['0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', 'A61RXM4375 (Bexarotene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bexarotene', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', '*PUVA Therapy', 'Photopheresis/methods', 'Recurrence', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/*pharmacology']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2012/02/09 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S0966-3274(11)00071-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trim.2011.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Transpl Immunol. 2011 Sep;25(2-3):163-6. doi: 10.1016/j.trim.2011.06.008.

Since the heat shock protein HSP90 and its co-chaperone CDC37 have been shown to stabilize many oncogenic proteins, we investigated the requirement for HSP90 or HSP90-CDC37 assistance to maintain the stability or activity of FOP2-FGFR1 expressed in KG-1a cells. We found that HSP90-CDC37 forms a permanent complex with FOP2-FGFR1. This results in protection against degradation of FOP2-FGFR1 and holds the oncoprotein in a permanently active conformation. Inhibition of HSP90 or depletion of CDC37 or heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) reduced the expression level of FOP2-FGFR1 and was sufficient to block the oncoprotein induced proliferation of KG-1a cells. We conclude that the driver of malignancy in KG-1a leukemic cells, FOP2-FGFR1, is an HSP90 addicted oncoprotein. This provides a rationale for the therapeutic use of HSP90 inhibitors in myeloid leukemias that contain FGFR fusion proteins.","['Jin, Yixin', 'Zhen, Yan', 'Haugsten, Ellen Margrethe', 'Wiedlocha, Antoni']","['Jin Y', 'Zhen Y', 'Haugsten EM', 'Wiedlocha A']","['Department of Biochemistry, Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo University Hospital, Montebello, N-0310 Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (CDC37 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (FOP-FGFR1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Chaperonins)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chaperonins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/12/31 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(11)00182-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.06.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2011 Nov;23(11):1758-66. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.06.010.

Therefore, in the present study, we determined the involvement of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the proliferation of mouse iPS cells. The selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist l-phenylephrine dose-dependently increased the proliferation of mouse iPS cells cultured in a medium with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Pretreatment with either selective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors significantly inhibited l-phenylephrine-induced DNA synthesis. The treatment with an IP(3) receptor agonist significantly enhanced LIF-induced DNA synthesis. On the other hand, we confirmed that the intracellular calcium level was increased by the treatment with l-phenylephrine. Thus, intracellular calcium release or PKC activation induced by alpha(1)-adrenoceptor activation may lead to the enhancement of DNA synthesis. In addition, pretreatment with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 or phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 significantly inhibited l-phenylephrine-induced DNA synthesis. Treatment with l-phenylephrine significantly increased Akt or p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation. alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor expression in mouse iPS cells was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and western blotting analysis. In mouse iPS cells cultured with LIF, stimulation with l-phenylephrine significantly increased the proportion of cells in the S and G(2)/M phases and decreased that in the G(1) phase. These results suggest that stimulation with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor may enhance DNA synthesis and proliferation of mouse iPS cells cultured with LIF via augmentation of both the MEK/MAPK and the PI3K/Akt pathways.","['Ishizuka, Toshiaki', 'Watanabe, Yasuhiro']","['Ishizuka T', 'Watanabe Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, National Defense Medical College, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan. tishizu@ndmc.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'XM03YJ541D (Prazosin)']",IM,"['Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Agonists/pharmacology', 'Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Prazosin/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1/*metabolism', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(11)00733-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.06.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2011 Oct 1;668(1-2):42-56. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.06.026.

Forty-five patients who received double RIC-AHSCT between 1997 and 2006 were retrospectively studied. The predominant diagnosis was acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 17). Other diagnoses were aplasic anemia (AA) (n = 5), myelodysplasic disorder (n = 5), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 4), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CML) (n = 3), myeloma (n = 3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (n = 3), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n = 2), Hodgkin's disease (HD) (n = 2), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1). Main indications for RIC-AHSCT 2 were relapse (n = 25, 56%) and early (n = 8, 18%) or late (n = 12, 26%) graft failure. Median delays to reach a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet counts of 50 x 10(9)/L were significantly smaller after the second AHSCT. Among 25 patients who relapsed after RIC-AHSCT 1, 14 patients (56%) presented a response improvement after RIC-AHSCT 2. In this group, 9 patients sustained a complete response and 5 patients a partial response. Moreover, among the 20 patients who had early or late graft failure following RIC-AHSCT 1, 9 (45%) finally reached an engraftment. Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly improved after RIC-AHSCT 2. Thirteen patients (28%) died of transplant-related mortality (TRM) at a median delay of 69 days (range: 0-451) after RIC-AHSCT 2. Double RIC-AHSCT is a feasible procedure that allows a response or engraftment not observed after RIC-AHSCT 1. The main indication is relapse. However, TRM remains high.","['Bay, J O', 'Cabrespine, A', 'Faucher, C', 'Tabrizi, R', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Berceanu, A', 'Coiteux, V', 'Renaud, M', 'Mialou, V', 'Robin, M', 'Kuentz, M', 'Chevallier, P', 'Dhedin, N', 'Huynh, A', 'Garban, F', 'Witz, F', 'Buzyn, A', 'De Revel, T', 'Galambrun, C', 'Deconinck, E', 'Contentin, N', 'Francois, S', 'Gratecos, N', 'Blaise, D', 'Michallet, M']","['Bay JO', 'Cabrespine A', 'Faucher C', 'Tabrizi R', 'Bordigoni P', 'Berceanu A', 'Coiteux V', 'Renaud M', 'Mialou V', 'Robin M', 'Kuentz M', 'Chevallier P', 'Dhedin N', 'Huynh A', 'Garban F', 'Witz F', 'Buzyn A', 'De Revel T', 'Galambrun C', 'Deconinck E', 'Contentin N', 'Francois S', 'Gratecos N', 'Blaise D', 'Michallet M']","[""Service de therapie cellulaire et d'hematologie clinique adulte, Universite d'Auvergne EA3846, INSERM CIC-501, CHU Clermont-Ferrand Hopital Estaing, 1 place Lucie Aubrac, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex 01, France. jobay@chu-clermontferrand.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/blood/mortality', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2012/05/09 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/09 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00285-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.06.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Feb;18(2):250-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.06.015.

Co-treatment with adaphostin (a Bcr/Abl inhibitor) was found to potentiate caffeine-induced Fas/FasL up-regulation. Although adaphostin did not elicit ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1)-mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), co-treatment with adaphostin notably increased p38 MAPK/JNK activation in caffeine-treated cells. Suppression of p38 MAPK and JNK abrogated Fas/FasL up-regulation in caffeine- and caffeine/adaphostin-treated cells. Compared with caffeine, adaphostin markedly suppressed Akt/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase)-mediated MKP-1 (MAPK phosphatase 1) protein expression in K562 cells. MKP-1 down-regulation eventually elucidated the enhanced effect of adaphostin on p38 MAPK/JNK activation and subsequent Fas/FasL up-regulation in caffeine-treated cells. Knockdown of p38alpha MAPK and JNK1, ATF-2 (activating transcription factor 2) and c-Jun by siRNA (small interfering RNA) proved that p38alpha MAPK/ATF-2 and JNK1/c-Jun pathways were responsible for caffeine-evoked Fas/FasL up-regulation. Moreover, Ca2+ and ROS (reactive oxygen species) were demonstrated to be responsible for ASK1 activation and Akt/ERK inactivation respectively in caffeine- and caffeine/adaphostin-treated cells. Likewise, adaphostin functionally enhanced caffeine-induced Fas/FasL up-regulation in leukaemia cells that expressed Bcr/Abl. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest a therapeutic strategy in improving the efficacy of adaphostin via Fas-mediated death pathway activation in Bcr/Abl-positive leukaemia.","['Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Chang, Long-Sen']","['Liu WH', 'Chang LS']","['Institute of Biomedical Sciences, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (NSC 680410)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'PJY633525U (Adamantane)']",IM,"['Adamantane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells']",,,2011/07/13 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['BJ20110725 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20110725 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2011 Nov 1;439(3):453-67. doi: 10.1042/BJ20110725.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

UCN-01 alone was administered in cycle 1 and with FAMP in cycles 2-6. FAMP was escalated in cohorts from 1 to 5 days. UCN-01 and FAMP pharmacokinetics and apoptosis of malignant lymphocytes was evaluated. Eighteen patients were enrolled. Standard FAMP with UCN-01 was tolerated without dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and those seen were common to either agent alone. One patient died due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

The variables that were independent prognostic factors for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in the training set were: age >/= 50 years, secondary AML and white blood cell count (WBC) >/= 20 x 10(9)/L. The patients of the training set were stratified into three groups: low-, intermediate- and high-risk. The median EFS was 25, 12 and 7 months in the low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups (p < 0.0001), respectively. The median OS was not reached in the low-risk group and was 19 and 10 months in the intermediate- and high-risk groups (p < 0.0001). This PIS was validated in a series of 193 patients with CN-AML.

Although immunologic, and perhaps clinical, benefits have been obtained with an autologous CLL tumor vaccine obtained by transgenic expression of CD40L and interleukin (IL)-2, there is little information about the optimal gene transfer strategies. METHODS: We compared two different CLL vaccines prepared by adenoviral gene transfer and plasmid electroporation, analyzing their phenotype and immunostimulatory activity. RESULTS: We found that higher expression of transgenic CD40L was mediated by adenoviral gene transfer than by plasmid transduction, and that adenoviral transfer of CD40L was associated with up-regulation of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 and adhesion molecule CD54. In contrast, transgenic IL-2 secretion was greater following plasmid transduction. These phenotypic differences in the vaccines were associated with different functionality, both ex vivo and following administration to patients. Thus adenoviral vaccines induced greater activation of leukemia-reactive T cells ex vivo than plasmid vaccines. In treated patients, specific T-cell (T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2)) and humoral anti-leukemia responses were detected following administration of the adenoviral vaccine (n = 15), while recipients of the plasmid vaccine (n = 9) manifested only a low-level Th2 response. Progression-free survival at 2 years was 46.7% in the adenoviral vaccine recipients, versus 11.1 % in those receiving plasmid vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: CLL vaccines expressing the same transgenes but produced by distinct methods of gene transfer may differ in the polarity of the immune response they induce in patients.","['Okur, Fatma Visal', 'Yvon, Eric', 'Biagi, Ettore', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Carrum, George', 'Heslop, Helen', 'Mims, Martha P', 'Fratantoni, Joseph C', 'Peshwa, Madhusudan V', 'Li, Linhong', 'Brenner, Malcolm K']","['Okur FV', 'Yvon E', 'Biagi E', 'Dotti G', 'Carrum G', 'Heslop H', 'Mims MP', 'Fratantoni JC', 'Peshwa MV', 'Li L', 'Brenner MK']","[""Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, The Methodist Hospital and Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX 77030, USA. fatvis03@yahoo.com""]",['eng'],"['P50 CA126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA126752-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA 126752/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",PMC3687103,['NIHMS322531'],2011/07/13 06:00,2012/01/11 06:00,['2011/07/13 06:00'],"['2011/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.3109/14653249.2011.592523 [doi]', 'S1465-3249(11)70593-X [pii]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2011 Oct;13(9):1128-39. doi: 10.3109/14653249.2011.592523.

Improvements in the assessment of leukemic cells have the potential to influence not only the diagnosis of leukemia, but also the risk assessment of patients during the course of the treatment, both of which are important for improving the cure rate for this disease. In this study, we report on the design and performance of a confocal laser based system built to collect backscattered light over a range of 26 degrees at 405, 488, and 633 nm to discriminate leukemic cells from normal red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cells (WBC). The design of the system is based on the spectral differences observed from spectroscopy measurements with a similar system designed with a white light source. Significant differences are observed in the intensity and wavelength dependence of leukemic cells from normal RBC and WBC. Specifically, the distinct light scattering of RBC is due to hemoglobin absorption, allowing for its discrimination from leukemic cells, mononuclear, and polymorphonuclear WBC particularly at certain wavelengths. Meanwhile, the high scattering intensities of polymorphonuclear WBC reflect the intracellular complexity of these cells in comparison to the leukemic or normal lymphocytes. Additionally, the detected light scattering spectra for leukemic cells are consistently steeper in comparison to normal WBC, which we attributed to differences in the fractal organization of intracellular scatterers.

PR-104 activation can occur via hypoxia-dependent reductases and also independently of hypoxia by aldo-keto reductase (AKR) 1C3. PROCEDURES: PR-104A was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel (10 nM to 100 microM), and PR-104 in vivo using a weekly x 6 schedule at its maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 550 mg/kg. Subsequently PR-104 was tested at 270 and 110 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetics for PR-104 and its metabolites were determined, as were levels of AKR1C3 RNA and protein in xenografts. RESULTS: In vitro, the leukemia models were most sensitive to PR-104A. In vivo, PR-104 induced objective responses at its MTD in 21/34 solid tumor models and maintained complete responses against 7/7 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) models. At 270 mg/kg and lower dose levels, PR-104 did not induce solid tumor regressions, suggesting a steep dose-response relationship. Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests higher systemic exposures to PR-104A and its metabolites in mice compared to those achievable in patients. Levels of AKR1C3 protein did not correlate with tumor responsiveness. CONCLUSIONS: As monotherapy, PR-104 demonstrated a high level of activity against both solid tumor and ALL models at its MTD, but the activity was almost completely lost at half the MTD dose for solid tumors. Pharmacokinetic data at the PR-104 MTD from human trials suggest that PR-104 metabolites may not reach the plasma exposures in children that were associated with high-level preclinical activity.","['Houghton, Peter J', 'Lock, Richard', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Phelps, Doris', 'Gorlick, Richard', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Kang, Min H', 'Maris, John M', 'Wozniak, Amy W', 'Gu, Yongchuan', 'Wilson, William R', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Houghton PJ', 'Lock R', 'Carol H', 'Morton CL', 'Phelps D', 'Gorlick R', 'Kolb EA', 'Keir ST', 'Reynolds CP', 'Kang MH', 'Maris JM', 'Wozniak AW', 'Gu Y', 'Wilson WR', 'Smith MA']","[""Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA. peter.houghton@nationwidechildrens.org""]",['eng'],"['P50 CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA108786/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM42216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CM042216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (PR-104)', '0 (PR-104A)', '0 (Prodrugs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/blood/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Prodrugs/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC4304205,['NIHMS639056'],2011/07/12 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2010/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22921 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Sep;57(3):443-53. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22921.

We have reviewed the prenatal findings in NS and we have correlated them with genotype and postnatal phenotype. METHODS: The cohort consisted of 47 patients with molecular diagnosis of NS. Prenatal and postnatal phenotypes were assessed by analysis of medical records, and clinical follow-up. Postnatal clinical phenotype, congenital heart disease, neuropsychomotor development, and growth pattern were arbitrarily scored in terms of severity. RESULTS: Mean age at diagnosis of NS was 7 years (ranging from birth to 38 years). Abnormal maternal serum triple screen was present in 36% of cases, nuchal translucency > 2.5 mm in 41%, polyhydramnios in 38% and fetal anomalies at prenatal ultrasonography in 21%. No statistical association was observed between prenatal findings and NS genotype or scores of postnatal clinical phenotype, congenital heart disease, neuropsychomotor development, or short stature. Presence of morphologic fetal anomalies at ultrasonography was associated with developmental delay/intellectual disabilities (p < 0.001) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal prenatal findings are frequent in NS pregnancies, though they are not specific and most are not useful for the prediction of the postnatal phenotype.","['Baldassarre, G', 'Mussa, A', 'Dotta, A', 'Banaudi, E', 'Forzano, S', 'Marinosci, A', 'Rossi, C', 'Tartaglia, M', 'Silengo, M', 'Ferrero, G B']","['Baldassarre G', 'Mussa A', 'Dotta A', 'Banaudi E', 'Forzano S', 'Marinosci A', 'Rossi C', 'Tartaglia M', 'Silengo M', 'Ferrero GB']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Prenat Diagn,Prenatal diagnosis,8106540,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Congenital Abnormalities/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Female', 'Fetal Diseases/*diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Noonan Syndrome/*diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Nuchal Translucency Measurement', 'Phenotype', 'Polyhydramnios/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal Diagnosis/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2012/03/09 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pd.2804 [doi]'],ppublish,Prenat Diagn. 2011 Oct;31(10):949-54. doi: 10.1002/pd.2804.

The few studies published on this disease are now relatively old and include small numbers of patients. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the induction-related cost of 500 patients included in the AML 2001 trial, and to determine the explanatory factors of cost. SETTING: ""Induction"" patient's hospital stay from admission for ""induction"" to discharge after induction. METHOD: The study was performed from the French Public Health insurance perspective, restrictive to hospital institution costs. The average management of a hospital stay for ""induction"" was evaluated according to the analytical accounting of Besancon University Teaching Hospital and the French public Diagnosis-Related Group database. Multiple linear regression was used to search for explanatory factors. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Only direct medical costs were included: treatment and hospitalisation. RESULTS: Mean induction-related direct medical cost was estimated at euro41,852 +/- 6,037, with a mean length of hospital stay estimated at 36.2 +/- 10.7 days. After adjustment for age, sex and performance status, only two explanatory factors were found: an additional induction course and salvage course increased induction-related cost by 38% (+/- 4) and 15% (+/- 1) respectively, in comparison to one induction. These explanatory factors were associated with a significant increase in the mean length of hospital stay: 45.8 +/- 11.6 days for 2 inductions and 38.5 +/- 15.5 if the patient had a salvage course, in comparison to 32.9 +/- 7.7 for one induction (P < 10(-)(4)). This result is robust and was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Consideration of economic constraints in health care is now a reality. Only the control of length of hospital stay may lead to a decrease in induction-related cost for patients with AML.","['Nerich, Virginie', 'Lioure, Bruno', 'Rave, Maryline', 'Recher, Christian', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Witz, Brigitte', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Moles, Marie-Pierre', 'Jourdan, Eric', 'Cahn, Jean Yves', 'Woronoff-Lemsi, Marie-Christine']","['Nerich V', 'Lioure B', 'Rave M', 'Recher C', 'Pigneux A', 'Witz B', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Moles MP', 'Jourdan E', 'Cahn JY', 'Woronoff-Lemsi MC']","['Department of Pharmacy, University Hospital of Besancon, 25030, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Clin Pharm,International journal of clinical pharmacy,101554912,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/economics', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/economics', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', 'France', '*Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization/*economics', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/economics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Economic', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/economics', 'National Health Programs/economics', 'Patient Admission/economics', 'Patient Discharge/economics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/economics', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2010/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11096-010-9462-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharm. 2011 Apr;33(2):191-9. doi: 10.1007/s11096-010-9462-1.

One of the major changes has been the widespread adoption of pediatric-based protocols, which appears to have significantly improved survival and probably renders allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) unnecessary in most standard-risk patients. However, high-risk patients, such as those with BCR-ABL or MLL rearrangements or high white count presentations, should still be referred for HSCT in CR-1. Minimal residual disease positivity has also been identified as a high-risk feature. Patients with BCR-ABL-positive ALL should receive combined therapy with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and chemotherapy prior to HSCT. The adoption of pediatric-based regimens has been associated with significant additional toxicities, including venous thromboembolism, osteonecrosis, other steroid-related changes, and neuropathy, which can potentially have a major adverse impact on the quality of life of these young ALL patients.","['Brandwein, Joseph M']",['Brandwein JM'],"['Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. joseph.brandwein@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2012/01/04 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11912-011-0185-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2011 Oct;13(5):371-8. doi: 10.1007/s11912-011-0185-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, disease-associated parameters reveal differences between older and younger patients with AML. Survival in normal karyotype AML (NK-AML) is influenced by different clinical and molecular markers. The aim of this work was to investigate the frequencies of molecular markers in patients with NK-AML with a focus on NPM1 mutations and FLT3-ITD in different age groups. In the present study, we analyzed the frequencies of mutations of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD in a cohort of 1,321 adult patients and 148 children with AML treated within the AMLCG99, the AML98, and AML04 trials and their distribution in different age groups. Additionally, the frequencies of mutations in CEBPA genes, FLT3-TKD, and MLL-PTD were analyzed in the cohort with NK-AML (n = 729). Our data show that the presence of mutations of NPM1 (from 60% to 40%) and FLT3-ITD (from 50% to 20%) significantly decreased with age in adult AML. Consequently, the proportion of NPM1-/FLT3-ITD- patients increased with age. The decreasing frequency of NPM1 mutations in elderly patients was paralleled by a reduced complete remission (CR) rate in the elderly of 55% compared to 80% in the younger patients. By contrast, the frequencies of other gene mutations, like FLT3-TKD and MLL-PTD, and mutations in CEBPA were not age-dependent. The decreasing frequency of the favorable NPM1 mutations with increasing age may partially explain the worse outcome in the elderly patients. Furthermore, the increasing amount of elderly patients without NPM1 mutations or FLT3-ITD suggests that other molecular and clinical risk factors may influence prognosis in this age group.","['Schneider, Friederike', 'Hoster, Eva', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Dufour, Annika', 'Benthaus, Tobias', 'Kakadia, Purvi M', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Braess, Jan', 'Heinecke, Achim', 'Sauerland, Maria C', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Buechner, Thomas', 'Woermann, Bernhard J', 'Feuring-Buske, Michaela', 'Buske, Christian', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Zwaan, Michel C', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Schneider F', 'Hoster E', 'Schneider S', 'Dufour A', 'Benthaus T', 'Kakadia PM', 'Bohlander SK', 'Braess J', 'Heinecke A', 'Sauerland MC', 'Berdel WE', 'Buechner T', 'Woermann BJ', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Buske C', 'Creutzig U', 'Thiede C', 'Zwaan MC', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Reinhardt D', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Munich, Campus Grosshadern Marchioninistr. 15, 81377 Munich, Germany.

In addition to ATL leukemogenesis, studies of the HTLV viruses also provide an exceptional model for understanding basic pathogenic mechanisms of virus-host interactions and human oncogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the viral regulatory protein Tax and host inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB are largely responsible for the different pathogenic potentials of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of HTLV-1 oncogenic pathogenesis with a focus on the interplay between the Tax oncoprotein and NF-kappaB pro-oncogenic signaling.

Answers to those questions will greatly advance our understanding of ATL leukemogenesis and other NF-kappaB-associated tumorigenesis and will help us design personalized cancer therapies.","['Qu, Zhaoxia', 'Xiao, Gutian']","['Qu Z', 'Xiao G']","['Cancer Institute, Medical Center, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA116616-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116616-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116616-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116616-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116616-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116616/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116616-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/*virology', 'Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3131208,['NIHMS303405'],2011/07/12 06:00,2012/03/07 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3390/v3060714 [doi]'],ppublish,Viruses. 2011 Jun;3(6):714-49. doi: 10.3390/v3060714.,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATL', 'HTLV', 'IKK', 'NF-kappaB', 'PDLIM2', 'Tax', 'WWOX', 'immune escape', 'transformation', 'tumorigenesis', 'virus-host interaction']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective study was done to assess the impact of the HCT-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) in addition to other pre-transplant factors on the outcome of RIC transplants. In all 121 such patients were transplanted between 2002 and 2008 at two centers using fludarabine, melphalan and alumtuzumab conditioning. The OS and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 56% and 30% at 2 years, respectively. The NRM of patients with HCT-CI >/= 3 was not significantly different from the NRM of those with HCT-CI 0-2 (P value 0.24). Age and disease status at transplantation were significant factors affecting OS (P value 0.07 and 0.008, respectively), with no impact on NRM (P value 0.14 and 0.24, respectively). Although HCT-CI on its own did not independently predict NRM or survival, taken together with age and disease status at transplantation, it can be utilized to further delineate RIC allograft recipients into groups with different outcomes. Patients with none or one of these three adverse factors (age >/= 60 years, leukemia in second CR or PR/high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) and HCT-CI >/= 3) had a 2-year NRM and survival of 18% and 80%, respectively, which was significantly better than those of patients with two or more of these adverse factors with 2-year NRM and survival of 46% (P value 0.03) and 40% (P value 0.02), respectively. None of the patients with all three adverse factors (age >/= 60 years, leukemia in second CR or PR/high-risk MDS and HCT-CI >/= 3) had survived for 2 years (median survival 12 months). This information can be used to guide patient selection for RIC transplants and to appropriately counsel patients of the risks and benefits of this treatment.","['Bokhari, S W', 'Watson, L', 'Nagra, S', 'Cook, M', 'Byrne, J L', 'Craddock, C', 'Russell, N H']","['Bokhari SW', 'Watson L', 'Nagra S', 'Cook M', 'Byrne JL', 'Craddock C', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals (City Campus), Nottingham, UK. w_bokhari@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2012/07/31 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt2011138 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2011.138 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2012 Apr;47(4):528-34. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2011.138.

Non-randomized studies suggest that long-term remissions are achievable when using myeloablative or reduced intensity conditioning transplantation. Allogeneic SCT for CMML is often reported as part of MDS registry data. The largest series in adult patients reported a disappointing long-term relapse-free survival (RFS) of 18%. The Fred Hutchinson Cancer and Research Center group reported a 40% long-term RFS for a mixed group of adults and children with CMML who were transplanted over two decades. In this study, we performed a literature search and reviewed available data for adult CMML patients undergoing HST. The dearth of data that span two decades with changing transplant practices prohibited us from performing a formal meta-analysis.

Mashhad, in northeast Iran, with high instances of this infection, has a noticeable number of infected renal failure patients. Since immunosuppressive drugs might decrease the latency period of HTLV-1 or increase its complications, the question arises whether HTLV-1 positive renal failure patients are suitable candidates for kidney transplants. To answer this, HTLV-1 positive recipients were evaluated in our study. Patients were divided into two groups. First group consisted of patients at the Imam Reza Hospital dialysis center. Second group had 20 kidney transplantation recipients consisting of ten infected and ten uninfected recipients as control from Imam Reza. Medical history of these patients was recorded and evaluated. The follow-up periods were between one and six years. Among them, 3.8% of patients undergoing dialysis were infected. The most important fact resulting from this study is that none of the infected recipients suffered from HAM or ATL during the follow-up period. In addition, it did not show any significant difference in the incidence of post-transplant complications between the infected and non-infected groups. Our study indicates that HTLV-1 positive patients may undergo kidney transplant without fear of increased incidence of side effects than those found in uninfected recipients. Because of short-term follow-up, probable long latency period of the virus, and the limited number of infected recipients, further work on this issue would be prudent.","['Naghibi, Orode', 'Nazemian, Fatemeh', 'Naghibi, Massih', 'Ali Javidi, D B']","['Naghibi O', 'Nazemian F', 'Naghibi M', 'Ali Javidi DB']","['Nephrology Ward, Department of Internal Medicine, Imam Reza Hospital, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS), Mashhad, I.

BACKGROUND: The few data in the literature only relate to isolated cases or small series. The non-infectious pulmonary complications of myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myeloproliferative disorders can be classified into several clinical entities: tumour syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis or diffuse infiltrating pneumonia, autoimmune reactions including vasculitis, Sweet syndrome, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, pleural effusion and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

The present study aimed to investigate the enhanced effects and mechanisms in apoptosis and the cycle distribution of HL-60 cells, a human leukemia cell line lacking a functional p53 protein, after combination treatment with arsenic trioxide (ATO) and irradiation (IR). Our results indicated that combined treatment led to increased cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells, which was correlated with the activation of cdc-2 and increased expression of cyclin B, the induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the loss of mitochondria membrane potential, and the activation of caspase-3. The combined treatment of HL-60 cells pre-treated with Z-VAD or NAC resulted in a significant reduction in apoptotic cells. In addition, activation of JNK and p38 MAPK may be involved in combined treatment-mediated apoptosis. The data suggest that a combination of IR and ATO could be a potential therapeutic strategy against p53-deficient leukemia cells.","['Ho, Sheng-Yow', 'Wu, Wei-Jr', 'Chiu, Hui-Wen', 'Chen, Yi-An', 'Ho, Yuan-Soon', 'Guo, How-Ran', 'Wang, Ying-Jan']","['Ho SY', 'Wu WJ', 'Chiu HW', 'Chen YA', 'Ho YS', 'Guo HR', 'Wang YJ']","['Sinlau Christian Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'F-Box Proteins/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'X-Rays', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00237-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.06.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2011 Sep 5;193(2):162-71. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.06.007.

These artifacts shield important structural features such as lamellopodia, filopodia, microvilli and membrane ridges, which represent characteristic status in signaling processes such as spreading and activation. These cliff-like edges arise from a premature contact of the probe side contact with the cell prior to the probe top apex-cell contact. Carbon nanotube (CNT) modified AFM probes were utilized to address this drawback. Using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, this work revealed that CNT probes diminish cliff-like artifacts and enabled visualization of entire membrane morphology and structural features in three dimensions. The high aspect ratio of CNT probes provides a very effective remedy to the cliff-like artifacts as well as tip convolution of conventional probes, which shall enhance the validity and application of AFM in cellular biology research.","['Koehne, J E', 'Stevens, R M', 'Zink, T', 'Deng, Z', 'Chen, H', 'Weng, I C', 'Liu, F T', 'Liu, G Y']","['Koehne JE', 'Stevens RM', 'Zink T', 'Deng Z', 'Chen H', 'Weng IC', 'Liu FT', 'Liu GY']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.']",['eng'],['1R43GM087978/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Ultramicroscopy,Ultramicroscopy,7513702,"['0 (Nanotubes, Carbon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Artifacts', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Structures/*ultrastructure', 'Imaging, Three-Dimensional/methods', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force/*methods', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', '*Nanotubes, Carbon', 'Rats']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2010/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2011/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-3991(11)00053-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.01.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Ultramicroscopy. 2011 Jul;111(8):1155-62. doi: 10.1016/j.ultramic.2011.01.030.

In this paper, we propose a sub-space greedy search method for efficient Bayesian Network inference. Particularly, this method limits the greedy search space by only selecting gene pairs with higher partial correlation coefficients. Using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieved comparable results with standard greedy search method yet saved approximately 50% of the computational time.

A total of 60 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 20 each): crocetin therapy group (cerebral contusion treated with crocetin), cerebral trauma control group (without treatment), sham operation control group. The effect of crocetin was examined by modified Neurological Severity Scores (mNSS), electron microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) procedure, western blotting analysis of Bcl-2 protein expression, microvessel count (MVC), endothelial cell culture and immunocyto-chemistry. The mNSS results indicated that neurological function of therapy group was significantly recovered seven days and fifteen days after the trauma. The TUNEL staining and electron microscopy revealed that crocetin treatment led to an inhibition of neuronal apoptosis 72 h following treatment; this finding was confirmed by western blot analysis of B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) protein expression. Expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and serum response factor (SRF) were higher in the crocetin therapy group in comparison to the two other experimental groups.

P19 induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells and inhibited cell proliferation with 48h IC50 of 3.5muM. At 10mg/kg dose, it doubled the median survival time of L1210 leukemic mice and at 25mg/kg it inhibited Ehrlich ascites tumor growth by 60%. Investigation of the mechanism of P19 induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells revealed that N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and s-methylisothiourea (sMIT) could reverse several molecular events that lead to cell death by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) formation. It selectively produced massive NO in cells while quenching the basal ROS levels with concurrent elevation of GSH. P19 disrupted mitochondrial integrity leading to cytochrome c release and caspase-9 activation. P19 also caused caspase-8 activation by selectively elevating the expression of DR4 and DR5. All these events lead to the activation of caspase-3 leading to PARP-1 cleavage and DNA fragmentation. However, knocking down of AIF by siRNA also suppressed the apoptosis substantially thus indicating caspase independent apoptosis, too. Further, contrary to enhanced iNOS expression, its transcription factor, NF-kappaB (p65) was cleaved with a simultaneous increase in cytosolic IkappaB-alpha. In addition, P19 potently inhibited pro-survival proteins pSTAT3 and survivin. The multi-modal pro-apoptotic activity of P19 raises its potential usefulness as a promising anti-cancer therapeutic.","['Kumar, Ajay', 'Malik, Fayaz', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Shah, Bhahwal A', 'Taneja, Subhash C', 'Pal, Harish C', 'Wani, Zahoor A', 'Mondhe, Dilip M', 'Kaur, Jagdeep', 'Singh, Jaswant']","['Kumar A', 'Malik F', 'Bhushan S', 'Shah BA', 'Taneja SC', 'Pal HC', 'Wani ZA', 'Mondhe DM', 'Kaur J', 'Singh J']","['Division of Pharmacology, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research), Jammu Tawi.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0', ""(2'-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-chlorophenylidene)-5,10-dimethyl-12-methylene-decahydro"", ""-1,2-(1',3'-dioxocyclopenta(c))azuleno(4,5-b)furan-4,11-dione)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Survivin)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Female', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2011/11/10 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0009-2797(11)00228-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2011.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2011 Sep 30;193(3):204-15. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2011.06.006.

In addition, five known compounds were obtained, which included myrocin A (6), norlichexanthone (7), anomalin A (8), decarboxycitrinone (9) and 2,5-dimethyl-7-hydroxychromone (10). The structures of all isolated compounds were unambiguously elucidated based on extensive 1D and 2D NMR and HR-MS analyzes. The absolute configuration of arthrinins A-D (1-4) was established by the convenient Mosher method performed in NMR tubes and by interpretation of the ROESY spectra. Antiproliferative activity of the isolated compounds was assessed in vitro against four different tumor cell lines, including mouse lymphoma (L5178Y), human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), human ovarian cancer (A2780) and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells (A2780CisR), using the MTT assay. Norlichexanthone (7) and anomalin A (8) exhibited the strongest activities with IC(5)(0) values ranging from 0.40 to 74.0 muM depending on the cell line investigated. This was paralleled by the inhibitory activity of both compounds against 16 cancer related protein kinases including aurora-B, PIM1, and VEGF-R2.

Traditional Chinese herbal remedy, as a kind of traditional treatments, has been widely and increasingly applied in clinic. In this article, the impact of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) on embryonic implantation, pregnant rate and underlying mechanisms will be investigated. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-three female pregnant kunming mice were randomly divided into 6 groups, including A, control group; B, ovulation stimulation (OS) group; C, OS+TCM group; D, embryo implantation dysfunction (EID) group; E, EID+TCM group; F, TCM only group. Uterus samples were collected at gestation Day 4 and were detected with immunohistochemistry and Real Time-PCR analyses. Uterine horns were excised to determine the number of pregnant mice and implantation sites on the Day 8 postcoitum. RESULTS: OS group and EID group showed a significant decrease in pregnant rate and the expression of both the endometrial leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and integrin beta3 subunit during the implantation window. OS+TCM group and EID+TCM group showed a higher pregnant rate and endometrial LIF and integrin beta3 subunit expression compared to OS group and EID group. The number of implanted embryo in EID group was lower than in control group, but higher in EID+TCM group than in EID group. No significant difference was found in the measured indices between the TCM only group and control group. CONCLUSIONS: OS model and EID model may have a negative influence on endometrial receptivity and embryonic implantation in mice. Conversely, TCM appears to reverse the expression of endometrial LIF and integrin beta3 subunit, improves the uterine receptivity in mice and increases pregnant rate and embryonic implantation. It provides a new insight into the clinic infertility's treatment.","['Yu, Nan', 'Yang, Jing', 'Yin, Tailang']","['Yu N', 'Yang J', 'Yin T']","[""Reproductive Medical Center, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Fertility Agents, Female)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertility Agents, Female/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Gestational Age', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Integrin beta3/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ovulation Induction/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0378-8741(11)00402-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2011.05.037 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2011 Sep 1;137(1):389-95. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2011.05.037.

Besides its importance in endocrine organs, menin has been shown to interact with the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) protein, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, and plays a critical role in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Previous studies have shown that menin promotes transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling in endocrine cells. However, little is known regarding the impact of TGF-beta pathway on menin in hematopoietic system. Here, with leukemia cell lines generated from conditional MEN1 or TGF-beta receptor (TbetaRII) knockout mouse models, we investigated the possible cross-talk of these two pathways in leukemia cells. METHODS: MEN1 or TbetaRII conditional knockout mice were bred and the bone marrow cells were transduced with retroviruses expressing oncogeneic MLL-AF9 (a mixed lineage leukemia fusion protein) to generate two leukemia cell lines. Cell proliferation assays were performed to investigate the effect of TGF-beta treatment on MLL-AF9 transformed leukemia cells with/without MEN1 or TbetaRII excision. Menin protein was detected with Western blotting and mRNA levels of cell proliferation-related genes Cyclin A(2) and Cyclin E(2) were examined with real-time RT-PCR for each treated sample. In vivo effect of TGF-beta signal on menin expression was also investigated in mouse liver tissue after TbetaRII excision. RESULTS: TGF-beta not only inhibited the proliferation of wild type MLL-AF9 transformed mouse bone marrow cells, but also up-regulated menin expression in these cells. Moreover, TGF-beta failed to further inhibit the proliferation of Men1-null cells as compared to Men1-expressing control cells. Furthermore, excision of TbetaRII, a vital component in TGF-beta signaling pathway, down-regulated menin expression in MLL-AF9 transformed mouse bone marrow cells. In vivo data also confirmed that menin expression was decreased in liver samples of conditional TbetaRII knockout mice after TbetaRII excision. CONCLUSION: These results provided the first piece of evidence of cross-talk between menin and TGF-beta signaling pathways in regulating proliferation of leukemia cells, suggesting that manipulating the cross-talk of the two pathways may lead to a novel therapy for leukemia.","['Zhang, Hui', 'Liu, Zu-Guo', 'Hua, Xian-Xin']","['Zhang H', 'Liu ZG', 'Hua XX']","['State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Centre, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510060, China.']",['eng'],"['R01-CA-100912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-113962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Transforming Growth Factor-beta Type II', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2011/12/15 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2011 May;124(10):1556-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent genome-wide analyses have identified that an alteration of IKZF1 is associated with very poor outcomes in B-cell progenitor ALL. In this study, we determined the prognostic significance of IKZF1 deletions in patients with childhood ALL. This study analyzed 242 pediatric B-cell progenitor ALL patients in Taiwan. We developed a simple yet sensitive multiplex quantitative PCR coupled with capillary electrophoresis to accurately determine the allele dose of IKZF1, and high resolution melting was used for mutation screening for all coding exons of IKZF1. Twenty-six (10.7%) pediatric B-cell progenitor ALL patients were found to harbor these deletions. Most of the deletions were broader deletions that encompassed exon 3 to exon 6, consistent with previous reports. Genomic sequencing of IKZF1 was carried out in all cases and no point mutations were identified. Patients with IKZF1 deletions had inferior event-free survival (P < 0.001), and overall survival (P = 0.0016). The association between IKZF1 deletions and event-free survival was independent of age, leukocyte count at presentation, and cytogenetic subtype by multivariate Cox analysis (P = 0.003, hazard ratio = 2.45). This study indicates that detection of IKZF1 deletions upon diagnosis of B-cell progenitor ALL may help to identify patients at risk of treatment failure. IKZF1 deletions could be incorporated as a new high-risk prognostic factor in future treatment protocols. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the poor prognosis of IKZF1 deletions in an Asian population.","['Yang, Yung-Li', 'Hung, Chia-Cheng', 'Chen, Jiann-Shiuh', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng', 'Hsiao, Chih-Cheng', 'Sheen, Jiunn-Ming', 'Cheng, Chao-Neng', 'Wu, Kang-Hsi', 'Lin, Shu-Rung', 'Yu, Sung-Liang', 'Chen, Hsuan-Yu', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Wang, Shih-Chung', 'Chang, Hsiu-Hao', 'Lin, Shu-Wha', 'Su, Yi-Ning', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn']","['Yang YL', 'Hung CC', 'Chen JS', 'Lin KH', 'Jou ST', 'Hsiao CC', 'Sheen JM', 'Cheng CN', 'Wu KH', 'Lin SR', 'Yu SL', 'Chen HY', 'Lu MY', 'Wang SC', 'Chang HH', 'Lin SW', 'Su YN', 'Lin DT']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Taiwan', 'Treatment Failure']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02031.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Oct;102(10):1874-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02031.x.

RA induces MAPK-dependent expression of IRF-1. IRF-1 binds c-Cbl, a MAPK related adaptor. Ectopic IRF-1 expression causes CD38 expression and activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis, and enhances RA-induced differentiation by augmenting CD38, CD11b, respiratory burst and G0 arrest. Ectopic IRF-1 expression also decreases the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, a stem cell marker, and enhances RA-induced ALDH1 down-regulation.

Their development and maturation involve a complex variety of interactions with nonlymphoid cell products and receptors. Highly specialized to defend against bacterial and viral infections, T cells also mediate immune surveillance against tumor cells and react to foreign tissues. T cell progenitors originate in the bone marrow and, through a series of defined and coordinated developmental stages, enter the thymus, differentiate, undergo selection, and eventually mature into functional T cells. The steps in this process are regulated through a complex transcriptional network, specific receptor-ligand pair interactions, and sensitization to trophic factors, which mediate the homing, proliferation, survival, and differentiation of developing T cells.

Our objectives were to evaluate the long-term event-free (EFS) and overall (OS) survival rates following ASCT for FL, and to identify predictors of improved outcome. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the first 100 consecutive patients with relapsed or refractory FL treated with HDT/ASCT in Calgary from 1993 to 2008. With a median follow-up of 65 months (range 16-178) post-ASCT, 5-year EFS and OS rates were 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 46-66%) and 70% (95% CI 61-79%), respectively. A plateau on the EFS curve is evident starting 6 years post-ASCT. Also, the EFS post-ASCT was markedly longer than the 12-month median EFS from last therapy prior to ASCT (p < 0.0001). Failure of rituximab pre-ASCT was not associated with EFS or OS. Severe toxicities included two early treatment-related deaths, and four late deaths from secondary leukemia. Independent predictors of EFS and OS in multivariate analysis were rituximab therapy within 6 months of ASCT, chemosensitivity and FLIPI (FL International Prognostic Index) score 0-1. In conclusion, our data suggest that over 50% of patients with relapsed/refractory FL who have failed 1-2 prior chemotherapy regimens achieve long-term EFS following HDT/ASCT.","['Peters, Anthea C', 'Duan, Qiuli', 'Russell, James A', 'Duggan, Peter', 'Owen, Carolyn', 'Stewart, Douglas A']","['Peters AC', 'Duan Q', 'Russell JA', 'Duggan P', 'Owen C', 'Stewart DA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'International Cooperation', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rituximab', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/12 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2011/07/12 06:00'],"['2011/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.594925 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Nov;52(11):2124-9. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.594925.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been proven to possess significant anti-proliferative potential in various cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Hence, treatment with these agents can be utilized to study disease specific anti-proliferative pathways. In this study, a total number of 42 bone marrow derived CD34(+) selected de novo AML patient samples and the AML cell lines THP-1 and HL-60 were treated with the NSAIDs Sulindac sulfide and Diclofenac. We analyzed viability, apoptosis, differentiation and addressed the molecular mechanisms involved. We found a consistent induction of apoptosis and to some extent an increased myeloid differentiation capacity in NSAID treated AML cells. Comprehensive protein and gene expression profiling of Diclofenac treated AML cells revealed transcriptional activation of GADD45alpha and its downstream MAPK/JNK pathway as well as increased protein levels of the caspase-3 precursor. This pointed towards a role of the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) in NSAID mediated apoptosis that we found indeed to be dependent on JNK activity as addition of a specific JNK-inhibitor abrogated apoptosis. Furthermore, the AP-1 transcription factor family members' c-Jun, JunB and Fra-2 were transcriptionally activated in NSAID treated AML cells and re-expression of these transcription factors led to activation of GADD45alpha with induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that NSAIDs induce apoptosis in AML through a novel pathway involving increased expression of AP-1 heterodimers, which by itself is sufficient to induce GADD45alpha expression with consecutive activation of JNK and induction of apoptosis.","['Singh, Raminder', 'Cadeddu, Ron-Patrick', 'Frobel, Julia', 'Wilk, Christian Matthias', 'Bruns, Ingmar', 'Zerbini, Luiz Fernando', 'Prenzel, Tanja', 'Hartwig, Sonja', 'Brunnert, Daniela', 'Schroeder, Thomas', 'Lehr, Stefan', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Czibere, Akos']","['Singh R', 'Cadeddu RP', 'Frobel J', 'Wilk CM', 'Bruns I', 'Zerbini LF', 'Prenzel T', 'Hartwig S', 'Brunnert D', 'Schroeder T', 'Lehr S', 'Haas R', 'Czibere A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (FOSL2 protein, human)', '0 (Fos-Related Antigen-2)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '144O8QL0L1 (Diclofenac)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)', '6UVA8S2DEY (sulindac sulfide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Diclofenac/*therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fos-Related Antigen-2/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/methods', 'Sulindac/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-011-0624-y [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2011 Sep;16(9):889-901. doi: 10.1007/s10495-011-0624-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most cases, it is cytogenetically visualized by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. About 5-10% of CML patients lack cytogenetic evidence of the Ph translocation but show BCR/ABL fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Deletions around the breakpoints on derivative chromosome 9 including 5'ABL and 3'BCR sequences occur in 10-15% of Ph-positive CML patients and are thought to have prognostic significance. METHODS: We explored cryptic rearrangements involving chromosomes 9 and 22 in 3 CML patients with an apparently normal bone marrow karyotypes using multiplex RT-PCR and FISH with commercial and home-brew probes. RESULTS: The BCR/ABL fusion transcripts were detected by RT-PCR. Using commercial FISH probes, the BCR/ABL fusion gene was found on chromosome 22 in two patients and on chromosome 9 in one patient. Consecutive FISH assays clarified the mechanism of the masked Ph chromosome: in the 3 patients, Ph rearrangement resulted from double mechanism consisting in standard translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) followed by a second reversed translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11).

Gag proteins, encoded by retroviruses, orchestrate the assembly of virus particles in close collaboration with host cell machinery. The earliest steps in retrovirus assembly-those immediately following synthesis of Gag on cytosolic ribosomes-are poorly understood. Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) offers a unique model system for dissecting these early steps because the RSV Gag protein undergoes transient nuclear trafficking prior to plasma membrane transport. Other Gag proteins, including those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV), foamy virus and retrotransposons in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila, have also been detected in the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear trafficking of Gag proteins is a common property of retroviruses and retrotransposons. In addition to retroviruses, many structural proteins of unrelated viruses, including influenza M1, NEP and NP proteins,38 Borna disease virus N and P proteins28,56 and coronavirus N protein,23,57 undergo nuclear localization and bind viral RNAs to form viral ribonuclear protein (RNP) complexes that are exported from the nucleus for packaging into virus particles. Similarly, nuclear trafficking of the RSV Gag protein is required for efficient encapsidation of the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) into assembling virus particles.19 Recently, we reported that the viral RNA itself appears to be a key factor in controlling the nucleus/cytosol distribution of RSV Gag.22 Our data demonstrate that binding of RSV RNA to the Gag protein promotes Gag-CRM1-RanGTP binding, resulting in export of the retroviral RNP from the nucleus. We propose that association of the viral RNA induces a conformational change in Gag that reveals its nuclear export signal (NES) and prepares that complex for its journey to the plasma membrane for budding. This work challenges existing dogmas regarding the molecular basis of Gag-mediated selection of gRNA for packaging and may lead to novel paradigms for the mechanism of retroviral genome encapsidation.","['Parent, Leslie J']",['Parent LJ'],"['Department of Medicine, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA. lparent@psu.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA076534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA76534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Nucleus,"Nucleus (Austin, Tex.)",101518322,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Retroelements)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Humans', 'Nucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroelements/genetics', '*Retroviridae']",PMC3127090,,2011/07/09 06:00,2012/01/19 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4161/nucl.2.2.15018 [doi]', '1949-1034-2-2-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Nucleus. 2011 Mar-Apr;2(2):92-7. doi: 10.4161/nucl.2.2.15018.,,['NOTNLM'],"['gag proteins', 'nucleocytoplasmic trafficking', 'retroviral assembly', 'viral RNA packaging']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the enormous biological diversity of cancer, strategic combination of agents targeted against the most critical of those alterations is needed. Due to their complex nature, plant products interact with numerous targets and influence several biochemical and molecular cascades. The interest in further development of botanical drugs has been increasing steadily and the FDA recently approved the first new botanical prescription drug. The present study is designed to explore the potential antileukemic properties of Hemidesmus indicus with a view to contributing to further development of botanical drugs. Hemidesmus was submitted to an extensive in vitro preclinical evaluation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A variety of cellular assays and flow cytometry, as well as a phytochemical screening, were performed on different leukemic cell lines. We have demonstrated that Hemidesmus modulated many components of intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell viability and proliferation and altered the protein expression, eventually leading to tumor cell death, mediated by a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. ADP, adenine nucleotide translocator and mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitors did not reverse Hemidesmus-induced mitochondrial depolarization. Hemidesmus induced a significant [Ca(2+)](i) raise through the mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Moreover, Hemidesmus significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of three commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs (methotrexate, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine). A clinically relevant observation is that its cytotoxic activity was also recorded in primary cells from acute myeloid leukemic patients. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate the molecular basis of the antileukemic effects of Hemidesmus and identify the mitochondrial pathways and [Ca(2+)](i) as crucial actors in its anticancer activity. On these bases, we conclude that Hemidesmus can represent a valuable tool in the anticancer pharmacology, and should be considered for further investigations.","['Fimognari, Carmela', 'Lenzi, Monia', 'Ferruzzi, Lorenzo', 'Turrini, Eleonora', 'Scartezzini, Paolo', 'Poli, Ferruccio', 'Gotti, Roberto', 'Guerrini, Alessandra', 'Carulli, Giovanni', 'Ottaviano, Virginia', 'Cantelli-Forti, Giorgio', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Fimognari C', 'Lenzi M', 'Ferruzzi L', 'Turrini E', 'Scartezzini P', 'Poli F', 'Gotti R', 'Guerrini A', 'Carulli G', 'Ottaviano V', 'Cantelli-Forti G', 'Hrelia P']","['Department of Pharmacology, Alma Mater Studiorum, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy. carmela.fimognari@unibo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hemidesmus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC3125193,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0021544 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-04840 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e21544. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021544.

However, the effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on bone marrow hematopoiesis remain unknown. The objective of this study was to elucidate the direct effects of cigarette smoke on human bone marrow hematopoiesis and characterize the inflammatory process known to result from cigarette smoking. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) from healthy individuals when exposed to CSE had significantly diminished CFU-E, BFU-E and CFU-GM. We found increased nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB p65 subunit and, independently, enhanced activation of AKT and ERK1/2. Exposure of BMCs to CSE induced IL-8 and TGF-beta1 production, which was dependent on NF-kappaB and ERK1/2, but not on AKT. CSE treatment had no effect on the release of TNF-alpha, IL-10, or VEGF. Finally, CSE also had a significant induction of TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4, out of which, the up-regulation of TLR2 and TLR3 was found to be dependent on ERK1/2 and NF-kappaB activation, but not AKT. These results indicate that CSE profoundly inhibits the growth of erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in the bone marrow. Further, CSE modulates NF-kappaB- and ERK1/2-dependent responses, suggesting that cigarette smoking may impair bone marrow hematopoiesis in vivo as well as induce inflammation, two processes that proceed malignant transformation.","['Zhou, Junmin', 'Eksioglu, Erika A', 'Fortenbery, Nicole R', 'Chen, Xianghong', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K', 'Djeu, Julie Y', 'Wei, Sheng']","['Zhou J', 'Eksioglu EA', 'Fortenbery NR', 'Chen X', 'Wang H', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Djeu JY', 'Wei S']","['Department of Immunology, H.

Many therapeutic approaches have been used to control bleeding with various degrees of success. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of selective internal iliac artery embolization for controlling acute intractable bleeding in children with malignancies. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the cases of 6 children with various malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and rhabdomyosarcoma), who had undergone selective arterial embolization (SAE) of the internal iliac artery at the Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital between January 2004 and December 2009. SAE was performed by an interventional radiologist using Gelfoam(R) and/or Tornado(R) coils. RESULTS: The patients were 5 boys and 1 girl with median age of 6.9 years (range, 0.7-14.8 years) at the time of SAE. SAE was performed once in 4 patients and twice in 2, and the procedure was unilateral in 2 and bilateral in 4. The causes of hemorrhage were as follows: hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) in 3 patients, procedure-related internal iliac artery injuries in 2 patients, and tumor rupture in 1 patient. Initial attempt at conservative management was unsuccessful. Of the 6 patients, 5 (83.3%) showed improvement after SAE without complications. CONCLUSION: SAE may be a safe and effective procedure for controlling acute intractable hemorrhage in pediatric malignancy patients. This procedure may obviate the need for surgery, which carries an attendant risk of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients with critical conditions.","['Bae, Sul Hee', 'Han, Dong Kyun', 'Baek, Hee Jo', 'Park, Sun Ju', 'Chang, Nam Kyu', 'Kook, Hoon', 'Hwang, Tai Ju']","['Bae SH', 'Han DK', 'Baek HJ', 'Park SJ', 'Chang NK', 'Kook H', 'Hwang TJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,PMC3127151,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/07/09 06:01,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/08/03 00:00 [received]', '2010/10/14 00:00 [revised]', '2010/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2011.54.4.169 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2011 Apr;54(4):169-75. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2011.54.4.169.

Previously, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was considered the only curative treatment for this disease. Treatment with imatinib, a selective inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase (TKI), has resulted in prolonged molecular response with limited drug toxicity. Imatinib is now implemented in the primary treatment regimen for children, but the paucity of evidence on its ability to result in permanent cure and the potential complications that may arise from long-term treatment with TKIs have prevented imatinib from superseding HSCT as the primary means of curative treatment in children. The results of allogeneic HSCT in children with CML are similar to those observed in adults; HSCT-related complications such as transplant-related mortality and graft-versus-host disease remain significant challenges. An overall consensus has been formed with regards to the need for HSCT in patients with imatinib resistance or those with advanced-phase disease. However, issues such as when to undertake HSCT in chronic-phase CML patients or how best to treat patients who have relapsed after HSCT are still controversial. The imatinib era calls for a reevaluation of the role of HSCT in the treatment of CML. Specific guidelines for the treatment of pediatric CML have not yet been formulated, underscoring the importance of prospective studies on issues such as duration of imatinib treatment, optimal timing of HSCT and the type of conditioning utilized, possible treatment pre- and post-HSCT, and the role of second-generation TKIs.","['Lee, Jae Wook', 'Chung, Nack Gyun']","['Lee JW', 'Chung NG']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Catholic University of Korea Colledge of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Korean J Pediatr,Korean journal of pediatrics,101215374,,,,PMC3120996,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/07/09 06:01,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3345/kjp.2011.54.3.111 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Pediatr. 2011 Mar;54(3):111-6. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2011.54.3.111.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a closely matched donor cures 60% of patients in first complete remission. Recent data suggest that chemotherapy plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may be the initial treatment of choice for Ph+ ALL in children. However, longer observation is required to determine whether long-term outcome with intensive imatinib and chemotherapy is indeed equivalent to that with allogeneic related or alternative donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Reports on the use of second-generation TKIs in children with Ph+ ALL are limited. A few case reports have indicated the feasibility and clinical benefit of using dasatinib as salvage therapy enabling HSCT. However, more extensive data from clinical trials are needed to determine whether the administration of second-generation TKIs in children is comparable to that in adults. Because Ph+ ALL is rare in children, the question of whether HSCT could be a dispensable part of their therapy may not be answered for some time.

With ATRA and anthracycline-based-chemotherapy, the complete remission rate is greater than 90%, and the long-term survival rate is 70-89%. Moreover, arsenic trioxide (ATO), which was introduced for APL treatment in 1994, resulted in excellent remission rates in relapsed patients with APL, and more recently, several clinical studies have been designed to explore its role in initial therapy either alone or in combination with ATRA. APL is a rare disease in children and is frequently associated with hyperleukocytosis, which is a marker for higher risk of relapse and an increased incidence of microgranular morphology. The frequency of occurrence of the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RARalpha) isoforms bcr 2 and bcr 3 is higher in children than in adults. Although recent clinical studies have reported comparable long-term survival rates in patients with APL, therapy for APL in children is challenging because of the risk of early death and the potential long-term cardiac toxicity resulting from the need to use high doses of anthracyclines. Additional prospective, randomized, large clinical trials are needed to address several issues in pediatric APL and to possibly minimize or eliminate the need for chemotherapy by combining ATRA and ATO.

In addition, a number of cellular proteins are found in retrovirus particles; some of these are important for viral replication, but many lack a known functional role. One such protein is clathrin, which is assumed to be passively incorporated into virions due to its abundance at the plasma membrane. We found that clathrin is not only exceptionally abundant in highly purified HIV-1 particles but is recruited with high specificity. In particular, the HIV-1 Pol protein was absolutely required for clathrin incorporation and point mutations in reverse transcriptase or integrase domains of Pol could abolish incorporation. Clathrin was also specifically incorporated into other retrovirus particles, including members of the lentivirus (simian immunodeficiency virus, SIVmac), gammaretrovirus (murine leukemia virus, MLV) and betaretrovirus (Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, M-PMV) genera. However, unlike HIV-1, these other retroviruses recruited clathrin primarily using peptide motifs in their respective Gag proteins that mimicked motifs found in cellular clathrin adaptors. Perturbation of clathrin incorporation into these retroviruses, via mutagenesis of viral proteins, siRNA based clathrin depletion or adaptor protein (AP180) induced clathrin sequestration, had a range of effects on the accuracy of particle morphogenesis. These effects varied according to which retrovirus was examined, and included Gag and/or Pol protein destabilization, inhibition of particle assembly and reduction in virion infectivity. For each retrovirus examined, clathrin incorporation appeared to be important for optimal replication. These data indicate that a number of retroviruses employ clathrin to facilitate the accurate morphogenesis of infectious particles. We propose a model in which clathrin contributes to the spatial organization of Gag and Pol proteins, and thereby regulates proteolytic processing of virion components during particle assembly.","['Zhang, Fengwen', 'Zang, Trinity', 'Wilson, Sam J', 'Johnson, Marc C', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Zhang F', 'Zang T', 'Wilson SJ', 'Johnson MC', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Laboratory of Retrovirology, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, The Rockefeller University, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01AI052774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 AI052774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI073098-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI073098/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (clathrin assembly protein AP180)']",IM,"['Betaretrovirus/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Clathrin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gammaretrovirus/enzymology', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/enzymology', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', '*Virus Assembly/genetics']",PMC3128127,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1002119 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-11-00315 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS Pathog. 2011 Jun;7(6):e1002119. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1002119.

Recent data have shown that family history influences survival of bladder cancer. Gene identification has been successful particularly on low-risk genes influencing susceptibility and prognosis. RECENT FINDINGS: Familial clustering of bladder cancer has been found with cancers of the stomach, larynx, kidney, endometrium and the bone marrow (leukaemia). Shared smoking habits are an explanation to these findings and between spouses these appear to be the only explanation to the clustering of cancers with bladder cancer. Family members also share prognosis of bladder cancer, either good or poor survival. Among the low-penetrant genes, the variants within the genes encoding metabolic enzymes have been consistently associated with susceptibility to bladder cancer and the evidence is compelling for NAT2 slow acetylator and GSTM1 null genotypes. SUMMARY: Smoking is the only identifiable environmental factor explaining familial clustering of bladder cancers and other cancers. Genetic factors are likely to contribute to many of the described associations but the identified genes are probably an introduction to the genetics of bladder cancer.","['Hemminki, Kari', 'Bermejo, Justo L', 'Ji, Jianguang', 'Kumar, Rajiv']","['Hemminki K', 'Bermejo JL', 'Ji J', 'Kumar R']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. k.hemminki@dkfz.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Urol,Current opinion in urology,9200621,"['EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (NAT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Multigene Family', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology/ethnology/*genetics']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOU.0b013e32834958ff [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Urol. 2011 Sep;21(5):386-92. doi: 10.1097/MOU.0b013e32834958ff.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last 18 months, studies challenged the paradigm that neonatal megakaryocytes are immature and revealed a developmentally unique uncoupling of proliferation, polyploidization, and cytoplasmic maturation. Several studies also described substantial molecular differences between fetal/neonatal and adult megakaryocytes involving transcription factors, signaling pathways, cytokine receptors, and microRNAs. RECENT FINDINGS: This review will summarize our current knowledge on the developmental differences between fetal/neonatal and adult megakaryocytes, and recent advances in the underlying molecular mechanisms, including differences in transcription factors, in the response to thrombopoietin (Tpo), and newly described developmentally regulated signaling pathways. We will also discuss the implications of these findings on the way megakaryocytes interact with the environment, the response of neonates to thrombocytopenia, and the pathogenesis of Down syndrome-transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and Down syndrome-acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL). SUMMARY: A better characterization of the molecular differences between fetal/neonatal and adult megakaryocytes is critical to elucidating the pathogenesis of a group of disorders that selectively affect fetal/neonatal megakaryocyte progenitors, including the thrombocytopenia-absent radius (TAR) syndrome, Down syndrome-TMD or Down syndrome-AMKL, and the delayed platelet engraftment following cord blood transplantation.","['Liu, Zhi-Jian', 'Sola-Visner, Martha']","['Liu ZJ', 'Sola-Visner M']","[""Division of Newborn Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],['HL69990/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cellular Microenvironment/physiology', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Thrombocytopenia/metabolism', '*Thrombopoiesis/genetics', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283497ed5 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2011 Sep;18(5):330-7. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3283497ed5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we investigated the role of ITCs in modulating immune dysfunction caused by LP-BM5 retrovirus infection. Among the tested ITCs, oral administration of sulforaphane (SUL), benzyl isothiocyante (BITC), and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) showed the inhibition of premature death caused by LP-BM5 retrovirus infection, while indolo[3,2-b] carbazole (ICZ) and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) did not delay the progress of the LP-BM5 retrovirus to murine AIDS. Inhibition of premature death by BITC, PEITC, and SUL could be explained by restoration of the immune system and down regulation of free radicals. Dysfunction of T and B cell mitogenesis caused by retrovirus infection in primary cultured splenocytes has been partially recovered with administration of BITC, PEITC, and SUL. There was a shift from imbalanced cytokine production (increased Th2 and decreased Th1 cell cytokine production) into balanced Th1/Th2 cell secretion of cytokines under administration of these ITCs during the development of murine AIDS. Hepatic vitamin E level was significantly restored by administration of these ITCs, in accordance with reduced hepatic lipid peroxidation levels. This study suggests that certain types of ITCs have beneficial effects in preventing premature death during progression to murine AIDS by restoration of immune dysfunction and removal of excessive free radicals, implying that selective usage of ITCs would be helpful in retarding the progression from HIV infection to AIDS.","['Ho, Jin-Nyoung', 'Kang, Eun-Ryung', 'Yoon, Ho-Geun', 'Jeon, Hyelin', 'Jun, Woojin', 'Watson, Ronald R', 'Lee, Jeongmin']","['Ho JN', 'Kang ER', 'Yoon HG', 'Jeon H', 'Jun W', 'Watson RR', 'Lee J']","['Department of Medical Nutrition, Graduate School of East-West Science, Kyung Hee University, Gyeonggi, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem,"Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry",9205717,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/*drug effects', 'Longevity/*drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/*immunology/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Sulfoxides', 'Th1 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thiocyanates/pharmacology', 'Vitamin E/metabolism']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/bbb/100840 [pii]', '10.1271/bbb.100840 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Biotechnol Biochem. 2011;75(7):1234-9. doi: 10.1271/bbb.100840.

Using ChIP-Seq, we find that in human and murine T-lymphoblastic leukemia (TLL) genomes Notch1 binds preferentially to promoters, to RBPJ binding sites, and near imputed ZNF143, ETS, and RUNX sites. ChIP-Seq confirmed that ZNF143 binds to approximately 40% of Notch1 sites. Notch1/ZNF143 sites are characterized by high Notch1 and ZNF143 signals, frequent cobinding of RBPJ (generally through sites embedded within ZNF143 motifs), strong promoter bias, and relatively low mean levels of activating chromatin marks. RBPJ and ZNF143 binding to DNA is mutually exclusive in vitro, suggesting RBPJ/Notch1 and ZNF143 complexes exchange on these sites in cells. K-means clustering of Notch1 binding sites and associated motifs identified conserved Notch1-RUNX, Notch1-ETS, Notch1-RBPJ, Notch1-ZNF143, and Notch1-ZNF143-ETS clusters with different genomic distributions and levels of chromatin marks. Although Notch1 binds mainly to gene promoters, approximately 75% of direct target genes lack promoter binding and are presumably regulated by enhancers, which were identified near MYC, DTX1, IGF1R, IL7R, and the GIMAP cluster. Human and murine TLL genomes also have many sites that bind only RBPJ. Murine RBPJ-only sites are highly enriched for imputed REST (a DNA-binding transcriptional repressor) sites, whereas human RPBJ-only sites lack REST motifs and are more highly enriched for imputed CREB sites. Thus, there is a conserved network of cis-regulatory factors that interacts with Notch1 to regulate gene expression in TLL cells, as well as unique classes of divergent RBPJ-only sites that also likely regulate transcription.","['Wang, Hongfang', 'Zou, James', 'Zhao, Bo', 'Johannsen, Eric', 'Ashworth, Todd', 'Wong, Hoifung', 'Pear, Warren S', 'Schug, Jonathan', 'Blacklow, Stephen C', 'Arnett, Kelly L', 'Bernstein, Bradley E', 'Kieff, Elliott', 'Aster, Jon C']","['Wang H', 'Zou J', 'Zhao B', 'Johannsen E', 'Ashworth T', 'Wong H', 'Pear WS', 'Schug J', 'Blacklow SC', 'Arnett KL', 'Bernstein BE', 'Kieff E', 'Aster JC']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01CA131354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA131354/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA047006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HG004570/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK019525/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 CA047006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-DK19525/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 ES017155/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (Rbpj protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', '*Response Elements', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3169118,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1109023108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1109023108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Sep 6;108(36):14908-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1109023108.

Here we report on a patient who received standard chemotherapy, unspecific immunotherapy with interleukin-2, as well as later specific CD8+ T-cell stimulation by RHAMM-R3 peptide vaccination. The patient maintained a complete remission in BM and PB, while he developed recurrent relapses in the CSF. Moreover, the patient developed a chloroma in the vicinity of neuronal sheaths during hematological CR, but high leukemia cell numbers within the CSF spaces over a long time period. This rare observation demonstrates several aspects. There is a previously unknown site of leukemia cell distribution, namely the peripheral cerebrospinal outflow pathway (PCOP). This demonstrates the ineffective therapy of this previously unknown mechanism of leukemia cell spread. The hypothesis that the PCOP is a site of physiological CSF-T-cell trafficking, and the lumen of the PCOP should be considered as an extension of the subarachnoidal spaces without closed anatomical borders is supported by this observation. The CSF spaces, but possibly specifically the PCOP, may represent a previously unknown survival niche of tumor cells within intrathecal spaces.","['Schmitt, Michael', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Greiner, Jochen', 'Xu, Xun', 'Barth, Thomas F E', 'Bechter, Karl']","['Schmitt M', 'Neubauer A', 'Greiner J', 'Xu X', 'Barth TF', 'Bechter K']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Rostock, Ernst-Heydemann-Str. 6, 18057 Rostock, Germany. michael.schmittu@t-online.de']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*cerebrospinal fluid/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*cerebrospinal fluid/pathology']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/10/20 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['31/6/2343 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2011 Jun;31(6):2343-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the proliferation of uninfected cell lines and PBMCs from healthy donors was hardly affected by the compound. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that TMNAA increased the population of the G0/G1 phase and reduced that of the S phase in HTLV-1-infected cells.

Moreover, a 1.5- or 3-h treatment with 4 was sufficient to inhibit the rates of DNA, RNA and protein syntheses measured in L1210 cells over 0.5- or 1-h periods of pulse-labeling with 3H-thymidine, 3H-uridine and 3H-leucine, respectively. As 4 did not reduce the fluorescence of the ethidium bromide-DNA complex, this compound was unlikely to directly bind to or destabilize double-stranded DNA. However, 4 induced DNA cleavage at 24 h in L1210 cells containing 3H-thymidine-prelabeled DNA, suggesting that this antitumor drug might trigger an apoptotic pathway of DNA fragmentation. After 12-48 h, 4 weakly increased the mitotic index of L1210 cells but stimulated the formation of many binucleated cells, multinucleated cells and micronuclei, suggesting that this antitumor compound might enhance mitotic abnormality, induce chromosomal damage or missegregation, and block cytokinesis. CONCLUSION: Although 4 may have interesting bioactivity, more compounds based on the quinazoliniminium scaffold must be synthesized to elucidate structure-activity relationships, identify more potent antitumor lead compounds, and investigate their molecular targets and mechanisms of action.","['Perchellet, Jean-Pierre H', 'Waters, Andrew M', 'Perchellet, Elisabeth M', 'Naganaboina, Vijaya K', 'Chandra, Kusum L', 'Desper, John', 'Rayat, Sundeep']","['Perchellet JP', 'Waters AM', 'Perchellet EM', 'Naganaboina VK', 'Chandra KL', 'Desper J', 'Rayat S']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Kansas State University, Division of Biology, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506-4901, USA. jpperch@ksu.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Quinazolines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/10/20 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [medline]']",['31/6/2083 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2011 Jun;31(6):2083-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to analyze the mRNA expression of the novel apoptosis-related gene BCL2L12 in patients with CLL and to examine its prognostic and predictive value and potential clinical application as a novel molecular biomarker for CLL. For this purpose, total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood of 65 CLL patients and 23 healthy donors. An ultrasensitive quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction methodology for BCL2L12 and BCL2 mRNA quantification was developed using SYBR Green chemistry. After preparing cDNA by reverse transcription, relative quantification analysis was performed using the comparative C(T) (2(-DeltaDeltaCT)) method. Furthermore, analysis of IGHV mutational status, CD38 expression, and detection of early apoptosis by double staining with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide were performed. According to our findings, BCL2L12 mRNA expression is significantly higher in CLL patients than in healthy donors. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that BCL2L12 expression had significant discriminatory value, distinguishing very efficiently CLL patients from the non-leukemic population. Moreover, BCL2L12 expression predicts the presence of CLL, as demonstrated by both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Finally, high BCL2L12 mRNA levels are associated with advanced clinical stage and predict shorter overall survival in CLL patients.","['Papageorgiou, Sotirios G', 'Kontos, Christos K', 'Pappa, Vassiliki', 'Thomadaki, Hellinida', 'Kontsioti, Frida', 'Dervenoulas, John', 'Papageorgiou, Efstathios', 'Economopoulos, Theofanis', 'Scorilas, Andreas']","['Papageorgiou SG', 'Kontos CK', 'Pappa V', 'Thomadaki H', 'Kontsioti F', 'Dervenoulas J', 'Papageorgiou E', 'Economopoulos T', 'Scorilas A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Panepistimiopolis, 15701 Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (BCL2L12 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*blood/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis']",PMC3228171,,2011/07/09 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['theoncologist.2010-0349 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0349 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2011;16(9):1280-91. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0349.

The ASB2 gene, initially identified as a retinoic acid responsive gene and a target of the promyelocytic leukemia retinoic acid receptor alpha oncoprotein in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, encodes two isoforms, a hematopoietic-type (ASB2alpha) and a muscle-type (ASB2beta) that are involved in hematopoietic and myogenic differentiation, respectively. ASB2alpha is the specificity subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that targets filamins to proteasomal degradation. To examine the relationship of the ASB2alpha structure to E3 ubiquitin ligase function, functional assays and molecular modeling were performed. We show that ASB2alpha, through filamin A degradation, enhances adhesion of hematopoietic cells to fibronectin, the main ligand of beta1 integrins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a short N-terminal region specific to ASB2alpha, together with ankyrin repeats 1 to 10, is necessary for association of ASB2alpha with filamin A. Importantly, the ASB2alpha N-terminal region comprises a 9-residue segment with predicted structural homology to the filamin-binding motifs of migfilin and beta integrins. Together, these data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ASB2alpha binding to filamin.","['Lamsoul, Isabelle', 'Burande, Clara F', 'Razinia, Ziba', 'Houles, Thibault C', 'Menoret, Delphine', 'Baldassarre, Massimiliano', 'Erard, Monique', 'Moog-Lutz, Christel', 'Calderwood, David A', 'Lutz, Pierre G']","['Lamsoul I', 'Burande CF', 'Razinia Z', 'Houles TC', 'Menoret D', 'Baldassarre M', 'Erard M', 'Moog-Lutz C', 'Calderwood DA', 'Lutz PG']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 31077 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 31077 Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Interdepartmental Program in Vascular Biology and Transplantation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 31077 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 31077 Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Interdepartmental Program in Vascular Biology and Transplantation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 31077 Toulouse, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 31077 Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Interdepartmental Program in Vascular Biology and Transplantation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse, France; Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, 31077 Toulouse, France.

Because it allows collecting only a small amount of materiel, an optimal processing of the samples is needed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on 150 consecutive procedures, we evaluate the overall diagnostic performances and of each technical methods used for the exploitation of the samples. RESULTS: The global diagnostic yield is 64.0% for the 50 first exams (learning phase), 88.0% for the next 100 exams. The maximal sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) are 79.3%, 96.3% and 92.7%, respectively. The yield, sensitivity and NPV of smears are 68.0%, 75.0% and 66.0%, of monolayer preparation 77.8%, 62.1% and 50.0%, of sections from tissue cores of 65.8%, 94.4% and 86.7%. The combination of the different methods increases the yield comparing to tissue cores and smears when taken alone (P < 0.05), and the sensibility and the NPV comparing to smears (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.01, respectively) and monolayer preparation (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0005, respectively). The sensitivity of tissue cores is greater than smears (P < 0.005) and monolayer preparations (P < 0.0001). This increase in sensitivity is significant for granuloma (sarcoidosis), but not for carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration is an accurate and sensitive technique. Liquid based conditioning of samples and paraffin embedded tissue cores increases the diagnostic performances comparing to smears, notably for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.","['Gauchotte, Guillaume', 'Wissler, Marie-Pierre', 'Bressenot, Aude', 'Clement-Duchene, Christelle', 'Marie, Beatrice', 'Menard, Olivier', 'Vignaud, Jean-Michel']","['Gauchotte G', 'Wissler MP', 'Bressenot A', 'Clement-Duchene C', 'Marie B', 'Menard O', 'Vignaud JM']","['Laboratoire de pathologie, hopital Central, CHU de Nancy, 29, avenue du Marechal-de-Lattre-de-Tassigny, 54000 Nancy, France. g.gauchotte@chu-nancy.fr']",['fre'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Pathol,Annales de pathologie,8106337,,IM,"['Biopsy, Fine-Needle/*methods', 'Bronchi', '*Bronchoscopy', 'Carcinoma/diagnosis/pathology/*secondary', 'Fiber Optic Technology', 'Granuloma/diagnosis/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Mediastinum/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sarcoidosis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specimen Handling', 'Staining and Labeling', '*Ultrasonography, Interventional', 'Video Recording']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2010/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0242-6498(11)00032-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annpat.2011.02.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pathol. 2011 Jun;31(3):142-51. doi: 10.1016/j.annpat.2011.02.007.

Syrbactins are a group of microbial metabolites consisting of two related families, the glidobactins and the syringolins. Some members of this group have revealed cytotoxic efficacy in tumor cells, and more recently it was discovered that they exert proteasome-inhibitory function. Based on this therapeutic promise and to gain further understanding of their molecular modes of action, we chemically synthesized de-novo three novel syrbactin analogs and characterized their proteasome-inhibitory and in vitro anti-neoplastic activity in human cell lines representing multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and lymphocytic leukemia. Our results show that two of these novel compounds are able to inhibit proteasome activity in the nanomolar range, reduce the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins survivin and Mcl-1, and cause severe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, resulting in pronounced tumor cell death. These anticancer effects can be synergistically enhanced when the agents are combined with thapsigargin, which further aggravates ER stress by a different mechanism. Taken together, our findings support the notion that syrbactin analogs may provide a structural platform for the development of novel cancer therapeutics, and that their efficacy may be further increased when complemented with other agents that trigger ER stress.","['Anshu, Ashish', 'Thomas, Simmy', 'Agarwal, Puneet', 'Ibarra-Rivera, Tannya R', 'Pirrung, Michael C', 'Schonthal, Axel H']","['Anshu A', 'Thomas S', 'Agarwal P', 'Ibarra-Rivera TR', 'Pirrung MC', 'Schonthal AH']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology & Immunology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089-9094, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (syringolin A)', '0 (syringolin B)', '108351-50-4 (glidobactin A)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Peptides, Cyclic/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Urea/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology']",,,2011/07/09 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/07/09 06:00'],"['2011/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00415-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.06.031 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Sep 15;82(6):600-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.06.031.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To see whether the PHF6 mutation occurs in other malignancies, we analyzed entire coding sequences of PHF6 in 231 hematologic malignancies [105 acute myelogenous leukemias (AML), 66 pre-B-ALL, 23 T-ALL, one undifferentiated acute leukemia and 36 multiple myelomas] by single-strand conformation polymorphism assay. Also, we analyzed the mutation in 236 solid cancers, including 41 lung, 39 hepatocellular (HCC), 36 breast, 40 colorectal, 40 gastric and 40 prostate carcinomas. RESULTS: In the hematologic malignancies, there were 11 PHF6 mutations that were detected not only in T-ALL (34.7%) (five adult and three childhood T-ALL), but also in two AML (1.9%) (one acute monocytic leukemia and one AML minimally differentiated). In addition, there was a PHF6 mutation in the HCC (2.6%). The PHF6 mutations were detected in both male and female patients, and consisted of six frameshift, three nonsense and two intron mutations.

Although Ro RNPs, whose main protein components Ro60 and La are targeted by the immune system in several autoimmune diseases, were discovered many years ago, their function is still poorly understood. Indeed, recent data show that miRNA-sized small RNAs can be generated from Y RNAs. This hypothesis leads also to a model in which Ro60 acts as a modulator in the Y RNA-derived miRNA biogenesis pathway. The implications of these Y RNA-derived miRNAs, which may be specifically produced under pathological circumstances such as in autoimmunity or during viral infections, for the enigmatic function of Ro RNPs are discussed.","['Verhagen, Anja P M', 'Pruijn, Ger J M']","['Verhagen AP', 'Pruijn GJ']","['Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

METHODS: Cultured HepG-2 cells treated with SSE were analysed by 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium bromide and clone formation assay. The cell cycle and apoptosis analysis were conducted by flow cytometric, TdT-Mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling and acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining methods, and protein expression was examined by both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. The pathological changes of the tumor cells were observed by haematoxylin and eosin staining. Tumor growth inhibition and side effects were determined in a xenograft mouse model. RESULTS: SSE treatment could not only inhibit HepG-2 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner but also induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the S phase. The number of colonies formed by SSE-treated tumor cells was fewer than that of the controls (P < 0.05). SSE induced caspase-dependent apoptosis accompanied by a significant decrease in Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 and elevation of Bak expression (P < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor alpha in the xenograft tumor tissue and the liver functions of SSE-treated mice showed no significant changes at week 8 compared with the control group (P > 0.05). Systemic administration of SSE could inhibit the HepG-2 xenograft tumor growth with no obvious toxic side effects on normal tissues. CONCLUSION: SSE can induce apoptosis of HepG-2 cells in vitro and in vivo through decreasing expression of Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 and increasing expression of Bax.","['Wang, Ming-Hua', 'Long, Min', 'Zhu, Bao-Yi', 'Yang, Shu-Hui', 'Ren, Ji-Hong', 'Zhang, Hui-Zhong']","['Wang MH', 'Long M', 'Zhu BY', 'Yang SH', 'Ren JH', 'Zhang HZ']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine and Research Center, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an 710038, Shaanxi Province, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hep G2 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Stems/*chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3120945,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2011/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3748/wjg.v17.i23.2848 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2011 Jun 21;17(23):2848-54. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v17.i23.2848.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Bcl-2 family', 'HepG-2', 'Human hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Sargentgloryvine stem extract']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are also by-products of several metabolic pathways and, without enzymatic catabolism, may accumulate and cause DNA damage. Ethanol, which is metabolised to acetaldehyde, is both carcinogenic and teratogenic in humans. Here we find that the Fanconi anaemia DNA repair pathway counteracts acetaldehyde-induced genotoxicity in mice. Our results show that the acetaldehyde-catabolising enzyme Aldh2 is essential for the development of Fancd2(-/-) embryos. Nevertheless, acetaldehyde-catabolism-competent mothers (Aldh2(+/-)) can support the development of double-mutant (Aldh2(-/-)Fancd2(-/-)) mice. However, these embryos are unusually sensitive to ethanol exposure in utero, and ethanol consumption by postnatal double-deficient mice rapidly precipitates bone marrow failure. Lastly, Aldh2(-/-)Fancd2(-/-) mice spontaneously develop acute leukaemia. Acetaldehyde-mediated DNA damage may critically contribute to the genesis of fetal alcohol syndrome in fetuses, as well as to abnormal development, haematopoietic failure and cancer predisposition in Fanconi anaemia patients.","['Langevin, Frederic', 'Crossan, Gerry P', 'Rosado, Ivan V', 'Arends, Mark J', 'Patel, Ketan J']","['Langevin F', 'Crossan GP', 'Rosado IV', 'Arends MJ', 'Patel KJ']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0QH, UK.']",['eng'],['MC_U105178811/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Fancd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Teratogens)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (ALDH2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial)', 'GO1N1ZPR3B (Acetaldehyde)']",IM,"['Acetaldehyde/metabolism/toxicity', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase, Mitochondrial', 'Aldehydes/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chickens', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/genetics', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'Embryo Loss/chemically induced/etiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/abnormalities/drug effects/embryology', 'Ethanol/metabolism/toxicity', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics/pathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders/etiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Essential', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Teratogens/metabolism/toxicity', 'Weaning']",,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/08/20 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2010/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/20 06:00 [medline]']","['nature10192 [pii]', '10.1038/nature10192 [doi]']",epublish,Nature. 2011 Jul 6;475(7354):53-8. doi: 10.1038/nature10192.,20110706,,,"['Nature. 2011 Jul 7;475(7354):45-6.

Among these compounds, licochalcone C was isolated but its biology has not been fully examined. In our study we reproduced an inflammatory state by treating THP-1 (human myelomonocytic leukaemia) cells with pro-inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS and IFN-gamma and we investigated the possible antioxidant activity of licochalcone C at a concentration of 50 muM. Our results show that treatment with licochalcone C attenuates the LPS-IFN-gamma-induced inflammatory response by significantly decreasing the expression and activity of iNOS via NFkappaB (nuclear factor kappa-B), by influencing extracellular O(2)(-) production, and by modulating the antioxidant network activity of SOD (superoxide dismutase), CAT (catalase) and GPx (glutathione peroxidase) activity. Based on these results we hypothesize that Licochalcone C has antioxidant properties since it reduces the production of superoxide radicals and consequently reduces the activity of iNOS.","['Franceschelli, Sara', 'Pesce, Mirko', 'Vinciguerra, Isabella', 'Ferrone, Alessio', 'Riccioni, Graziano', 'Patruno, Antonia', 'Grilli, Alfredo', 'Felaco, Mario', 'Speranza, Lorenza']","['Franceschelli S', 'Pesce M', 'Vinciguerra I', 'Ferrone A', 'Riccioni G', 'Patruno A', 'Grilli A', 'Felaco M', 'Speranza L']","[""Department of Human Movement Sciences, University G.

A quantitative fluorescence-in-situ protocol (Q-FISH) was used to compare telomere length in amniocytes cultured from 11 trisomy 21 conceptions and from 14 normal pregnancies. Quantification was conducted using novel computer software. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to assess the percentage of cells with additional copies of hTERC. We found that the immunofluorescence intensity, which represents telomere length, was significantly lower in amniocytes from trisomy 21 conceptions compared to the control group. The trisomy 21 group had a higher number of cells with additional copies of hTERC.

Thirteen out of 50 (26%) patients with plasma cell disorders and abnormal karyotypes (11 with MM and 2 with plasma cell leukemia (PCL)) were selected for inclusion in the present report based on the presence of karyotypes with new and/or infrequent structural aberrations. Thirty-three new rearrangements, including a novel recurrent aberration: psu dic(5;1)(q35;q10), were detected. Chromosome 1 was the most frequently involved. Gains of genetic material (57%) were noted more frequently than losses (43%). Three rearrangements that were observed only once in the literature appear to be recurrent from our data: del(16)(q13), del(5)(p13) and i(3)(q10), the latter being a single structural aberration in the karyotype. Clinical parameters from our series were compared with 2 control groups: 20 MM cases with recurrent aberrations in MM/PCL with a similar distribution of abnormalities associated with poor prognosis (group 1), and 40 with normal karyotypes and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis (group 2). Significantly increased serum calcium levels (p = 0.022) in patients with new and/or infrequent chromosome changes with respect to both control groups, and a higher percentage of bone marrow plasma cell infiltration (p = 0.005), beta(2) microglobulin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels (p < 0.0001) compared to group 2 were observed.

Despite a remarkable effectiveness, treatment failure cases have been reported in 20 percent of CML patients. The identification of biomarkers which can predict the response to imatinib is our point of interest. METHODS: Gene expression profiling microarray was carried out on secondary imatinib resistant patients. Longitudinal studies were performed on imatinib treated responder/resistant patients. Then, Q-RT/PCR studies were realized on patients prior imatinib initiation. RESULTS: For imatinib responder patients, we observed a strong and lasting decrease of alpha-defensin 1-3 and alpha-defensin 4 expression. For relapse patients, we observed a dramatic increase of alpha-defensin 1-3 and alpha-defensin 4 expression before BCR-ABL transcript increase. Moreover, before imatinib initiation, alpha-defensin 1-3 and alpha-defensin 4 expression was significantly lower in the resistant group than in the responder group. CONCLUSION: The variation of expression of alpha-defensin 1-3 and alpha-defensin 4 in peripheral blood is associated with imatinib resistance and may reflect an adequate immune control of the disease. Monitoring of alpha-defensin 1-3 and alpha-defensin 4 could be helpful to predict the patients who are not going to respond to the treatment.","['Etienne, Gabriel', 'Dupouy, Maryse', 'Costaglioli, Patricia', 'Chollet, Claudine', 'Lagarde, Valerie', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Garbay, Bertrand', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Turcq, Beatrice']","['Etienne G', 'Dupouy M', 'Costaglioli P', 'Chollet C', 'Lagarde V', 'Pasquet JM', 'Reiffers J', 'Garbay B', 'Mahon FX', 'Turcq B']","['Laboratoire Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cibles Therapeutiques, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DEFA1A3 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha-Defensins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/*blood', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Peptides, Cyclic/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'alpha-Defensins/blood/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3825081,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['P21422342504010H [pii]', '10.3233/DMA-2011-0777 [doi]']",ppublish,Dis Markers. 2011;30(5):221-7. doi: 10.3233/DMA-2011-0777.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. The present study demonstrates that DZNep induces robust apoptosis in AML cell lines, primary cells, and targets CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia stem cell (LSC)-enriched subpopulations. Using RNA interference (RNAi), gene expression profiling, and ChIP, we identified that TXNIP, a major redox control molecule, plays a crucial role in DZNep-induced apoptosis. We show that disruption of PRC2, either by DZNep treatment or EZH2 knockdown, reactivates TXNIP, inhibits thioredoxin activity, and increases reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that TXNIP is down-regulated in AML and is a direct target of PRC2-mediated gene silencing. Consistent with the ROS accumulation on DZNep treatment, we also see a signature of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-regulated genes, commonly associated with cell survival, down-regulated by DZNep. Taken together, we uncover a novel molecular mechanism of DZNep-mediated apoptosis and propose that EZH2 may be a potential new target for epigenetic treatment in AML.","['Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Bi, Chonglei', 'Cheong, Lip-Lee', 'Mahara, Sylvia', 'Liu, Shaw-Cheng', 'Tay, Kian-Ghee', 'Koh, Tze-Loong', 'Yu, Qiang', 'Chng, Wee-Joo']","['Zhou J', 'Bi C', 'Cheong LL', 'Mahara S', 'Liu SC', 'Tay KG', 'Koh TL', 'Yu Q', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TXNIP protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '544SH4020S (3-deazaneplanocin)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Histone Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Epigenomics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Silencing', 'Histone Methyltransferases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40708-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-07-294827 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 8;118(10):2830-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-07-294827.

Here, we further investigate the mechanism of suppression and define the cell subset that is fully responsible for BM-MDSC-mediated immune suppression. This population, which displays the structure and markers of promyelocytes, is however distinct from physiologic promyelocytes that, instead, are devoid of immuosuppressive function. In addition, we demonstrate that promyelocyte-like cells proliferate in the presence of activated lymphocytes and that, when these cells exert suppressive activity, they do not differentiate but rather maintain their immature phenotype. Finally, we show that promyelocyte-like BM-MDSCs are equivalent to MDSCs present in the blood of patients with breast cancer and patients with colorectal cancer and that increased circulating levels of these immunosuppressive myeloid cells correlate with worse prognosis and radiographic progression.","['Solito, Samantha', 'Falisi, Erika', 'Diaz-Montero, Claudia Marcela', 'Doni, Andrea', 'Pinton, Laura', 'Rosato, Antonio', 'Francescato, Samuela', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Zanovello, Paola', 'Onicescu, Georgiana', 'Garrett-Mayer, Elizabeth', 'Montero, Alberto J', 'Bronte, Vincenzo', 'Mandruzzato, Susanna']","['Solito S', 'Falisi E', 'Diaz-Montero CM', 'Doni A', 'Pinton L', 'Rosato A', 'Francescato S', 'Basso G', 'Zanovello P', 'Onicescu G', 'Garrett-Mayer E', 'Montero AJ', 'Bronte V', 'Mandruzzato S']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences, Oncology Section, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['K01 CA134927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA148893/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD3 antigen, zeta chain)', '0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Myeloid Cells/classification/*immunology/*pathology', 'Myelopoiesis/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism']",PMC3709641,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40418-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-325753 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 25;118(8):2254-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-325753.

However, despite its great paradigmatic and clinical relevance, induction of GVL by conventional allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains a quite rudimentary form of leukemia immunotherapy. It is toxic and its efficacy is far from optimal. It is therefore sobering that since the discovery of the GVL effect 3 decades ago, the way GVL is induced and manipulated has practically not changed. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that injection of T cells primed against a single Ag present on neoplastic cells could enhance the GVL effect without causing any GVHD. We therefore contend that Ag-targeted adoptive T-cell immunotherapy represents the future of leukemia immunotherapy, and we discuss the specific strategies that ought to be evaluated to reach this goal. Differences between these strategies hinge on 2 key elements: the nature of the target Ag and the type of Ag receptor expressed on T cells.","['Vincent, Krystel', 'Roy, Denis-Claude', 'Perreault, Claude']","['Vincent K', 'Roy DC', 'Perreault C']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cross Reactions/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/*trends', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Models, Biological']",,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40649-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-350868 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 15;118(11):2951-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-350868.

Inhibition of TET2 by RNA interference decreases 5-hmC levels in both human leukemia cell lines and cord blood CD34(+) cells. These results confirm the enzymatic function of TET2 in human hematopoietic cells. Knockdown of TET2 in cord blood CD34(+) cells skews progenitor differentiation toward the granulomonocytic lineage at the expense of lymphoid and erythroid lineages. In addition, by monitoring in vitro granulomonocytic development we found a decreased granulocytic differentiation and an increase in monocytic cells.

This adaptive response is possible because of the unique structure of the TCR, which is composed of two chains, either alphabeta or gammadelta, that undergo genetic rearrangement in the thymus. alphabeta and gammadelta T cells are functionally distinct within the host but are derived from a common multipotent precursor. The canonical model for T cell lineage commitment assumes that the gamma, delta, and beta chains rearrange before alphabeta or gammadelta T cell commitment. To test the standard model in humans, we used high-throughput sequencing to catalog millions of TCRgamma and TCRbeta chains from peripheral blood alphabeta and gammadelta T cells from three unrelated individuals. Almost all sampled alphabeta and gammadelta T cells had rearranged TCRgamma sequences. Although sampled alphabeta T cells had a diverse repertoire of rearranged TCRbeta chains, less than 4% of gammadelta T cells in peripheral blood had a rearranged TCRbeta chain. Our data suggest that TCRgamma rearranges in all T lymphocytes, consistent with TCRgamma rearranging before T cell lineage commitment. However, rearrangement of the TCRbeta locus appears to be restricted after T cell precursors commit to the alphabeta T cell lineage. Indeed, in T cell leukemias and lymphomas, TCRgamma is almost always rearranged and TCRbeta is only rearranged in a subset of cancers. Because high-throughput sequencing of TCRs is translated into the clinic for monitoring minimal residual for leukemia/lymphoma, our data suggest the sequencing target should be TCRgamma.","['Sherwood, Anna M', 'Desmarais, Cindy', 'Livingston, Robert J', 'Andriesen, Jessica', 'Haussler, Maximilian', 'Carlson, Christopher S', 'Robins, Harlan']","['Sherwood AM', 'Desmarais C', 'Livingston RJ', 'Andriesen J', 'Haussler M', 'Carlson CS', 'Robins H']","['Adaptive TCR, 307 Westlake Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['R56 AI081860/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI081860/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Sci Transl Med,Science translational medicine,101505086,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology']",PMC4179204,['NIHMS517383'],2011/07/08 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['3/90/90ra61 [pii]', '10.1126/scitranslmed.3002536 [doi]']",ppublish,Sci Transl Med. 2011 Jul 6;3(90):90ra61. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.3002536.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mediators of neovascularization and the biologic significance of increased endothelial cell proliferation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia require further investigation. Because signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 is constitutively activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, we studied the role of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in modulating vascular endothelial growth factor expression and the effect of vascular endothelial cells on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we found that anti-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 antibodies immunoprecipitated DNA of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, vascular endothelial growth factor, and other signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-regulated genes. In addition, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-short interfering RNA significantly reduced messenger RNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, suggesting that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 induces vascular endothelial growth factor expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Remarkably, bone marrow chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells expressed high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, and high vascular endothelial growth factor levels were detected in the plasma of patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia and correlated with white blood cell count. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia bone marrow biopsies revealed increased microvascular density and attachment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to endothelial cells.

Cumulative incidence numbers vary greatly, probably because local circumstances influence the incidence of IMI. Therefore, comparison of different patient groups at risk should be performed at one hospital. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis examining both adult patients treated with chemotherapy for acute leukemia or MDS and patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) between June 2007 and August 2009. IMI were classified according to the EORTC criteria. RESULTS: A total of 211 patients with 237 predefined risk episodes were analyzed. A total of 22 IMI were observed: three of them were classified as proven, 15 as probable, and four as possible. No IMI were observed in the autologous SCT group. The incidence of proven and probable IMI in the allogeneic SCT group was 7.2%, and in the chemotherapy group, 14.3%. Patients with IMI had a higher mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that patients receiving intensive chemotherapy for acute leukemia have the highest risk of developing IMI during their treatment compared to patients with allogeneic SCT.","['Janssen, Anke', 'van der Bruggen, Tjomme', 'Haas, Pieter-Jan A', 'de Jong, Pim A', 'Minnema, Monique C']","['Janssen A', 'van der Bruggen T', 'Haas PJ', 'de Jong PA', 'Minnema MC']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, Utrecht, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01678.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Nov;87(5):419-25. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01678.x.

Combotox is a 1:1 mixture of two immunotoxins (ITs), prepared by coupling deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgRTA) to monoclonal antibodies directed against CD22 (RFB4-dgRTA) and CD19 (HD37-dgRTA). Pre-clinical data demonstrated that Combotox was effective in killing both pre-B-ALL cell lines and cells from patients with pre-B ALL. A clinical study of paediatric patients in which 3 of 17 patients with ALL experienced complete remission, supported the preclinical work and motivated this study. This study was a Phase I, dose-escalation trial using Combotox in adults with refractory or relapsed B-lineage-ALL. A cycle consisted of three doses, with one dose given every other day. Dose levels were 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 mg/m(2) per dose. Seventeen patients, aged 19-72 years, were enrolled in this multi-institution study. The maximum tolerated dose was 7 mg/m(2) /dose (21 mg/m(2) /cycle) and vascular leak syndrome was the dose-limiting toxicity. Two patients developed reversible grade 3 elevations in liver function tests. One patient achieved partial remission and proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. All patients with peripheral blasts experienced decreased blast counts following the administration of Combotox. Thus, Combotox can be safely administered to adults with refractory leukaemia.","['Schindler, John', 'Gajavelli, Srikanth', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Shen, Yumin', 'Parekh, Samir', 'Braunchweig, Ira', 'Barta, Stefan', 'Ghetie, Victor', 'Vitetta, Ellen', 'Verma, Amit']","['Schindler J', 'Gajavelli S', 'Ravandi F', 'Shen Y', 'Parekh S', 'Braunchweig I', 'Barta S', 'Ghetie V', 'Vitetta E', 'Verma A']","['Cancer Immunobiology Center, University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390-8576, USA. john.schindler@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['K12 CA132783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC3877839,['NIHMS520545'],2011/07/08 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08762.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Aug;154(4):471-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08762.x.

We demonstrate in the present study for the first time that p13, an accessory protein encoded by the HTLV-1 (human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1), binds the SH3 domain of SFKs via its C-terminal proline-rich motif, forming a stable heterodimer that translocates to mitochondria by virtue of its N-terminal mitochondrial localization signal. As a result, the activity of SFKs is dramatically enhanced, with a subsequent increase in mitochondrial tyrosine phosphorylation, and the recognized ability of p13 to insert itself into the inner mitochondrial membrane and to perturb the mitochondrial membrane potential is abolished. Overall, the present study, in addition to confirming that the catalytic activity of SFKs is modulated by interactors of their SH3 domain, leads us to hypothesize a general mechanism by which proteins bearing a proline-rich motif and a mitochondrial localization signal at the same time may act as carriers of SFKs into mitochondria, thus contributing to the regulation of mitochondrial functions under various pathophysiological conditions.","['Tibaldi, Elena', 'Venerando, Andrea', 'Zonta, Francesca', 'Bidoia, Carlo', 'Magrin, Elisa', 'Marin, Oriano', 'Toninello, Antonio', 'Bordin, Luciana', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Pagano, Mario Angelo', 'Brunati, Anna Maria']","['Tibaldi E', 'Venerando A', 'Zonta F', 'Bidoia C', 'Magrin E', 'Marin O', 'Toninello A', 'Bordin L', 'Martini V', 'Pagano MA', 'Brunati AM']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (rof protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', '*Proline-Rich Protein Domains', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization/genetics', 'Protein Transport/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', '*src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/*chemistry/genetics']",,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['BJ20101650 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20101650 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2011 Nov 1;439(3):505-16. doi: 10.1042/BJ20101650.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to apoptotic stimuli, several proapoptotic proteins are released into the cytoplasm from the mitochondria, including second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein binding protein with low p I (Smac/DIABLO), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and high temperature requirement protein A2 (HtrA2/Omi). Apoptosis-inducing factor promotes apoptosis through a caspase-independent pathway, while Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2/Omi do so through both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. Smac/DIABLO was reported to be strongly positive in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and virtually absent in small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). Little is known about the expression of AIF and HtrA2/Omi in lymphomas. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the expression of AIF and HtrA2/Omi in SLL and DLBCL. DESIGN: Twenty-three DLBCLs, 20 SLLs/CLLs, and 10 benign lymph nodes were evaluated for AIF and HtrA2/Omi expression by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Apoptosis-inducing factor was strongly and diffusely expressed in 19 of 23 (83%) cases of DLBCL with comparable expression pattern between germinal center-like and non-germinal center-like subgroups. Apoptosis-inducing factor was weakly positive in 15 of 20 (75%) cases of SLL/CLL with increased intensity in pseudofollicles. In contrast, HtrA2/Omi was weakly expressed in SLL/CLL (17 of 20; 85%) and DLBCL (18 of 23; 78%). CONCLUSIONS: The different expression level and pattern of AIF and HtrA2/Omi in SLL/CLL and DLBCL may suggest different apoptotic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and prognosis of these diseases. HtrA2/Omi does not appear to be a major player in the regulation of apoptosis of DLBCL and SLL/CLL.","['Li, Shaoying', 'Wan, Mei', 'Cao, Xu', 'Ren, Yongsheng']","['Li S', 'Wan M', 'Cao X', 'Ren Y']","['Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham Health System, Birmingham, USA. shaoyingli2004@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.108 (HTRA2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.108 (High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/*metabolism', 'Female', 'High-Temperature Requirement A Serine Peptidase 2', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/09/15 06:00,['2011/07/08 06:00'],"['2011/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1043/2010-0003-OAR1.1 [pii]', '10.5858/2010-0003-OAR1.1 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2011 Jul;135(7):903-8. doi: 10.5858/2010-0003-OAR1.1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcriptional repressor growth factor independence 1 (Gfi1) restricts HSC proliferation and is essential to maintain their self-renewal capacity and multipotency after transplantation. In addition, Gfi1(-/-) HSCs are severely compromised in their ability to compete with wild-type (wt) HSCs after transplantation. We now report that Gfi1 protects HSCs against stress-induced apoptosis, probably, by repressing the proapoptotic target gene Bax, since irradiated Gfi1(-/-) HSCs display higher expression of Bax and show a higher rate of apoptosis than wt HSCs. This protective function of Gfi1 appears to be functionally relevant since Gfi1(-/-) HSCs that express Bcl-2, which antagonizes the effects of Bax, regain their ability to self renew and to initiate multilineage differentiation after transplantation. Surprisingly, Gfi1(-/-) xBcl-2 transgenic mice also show a strong, systemic expansion of Mac-1(+) Gr-1(-) myeloid cells in bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid organs. These cells express high levels of the proleukemogenic transcription factor Hoxa9 and, in older mice, appear as atypical monocytoid-blastoid cells in the peripheral blood. As a result of this massive expansion of myeloid cells, all Gfi1(-/-) xBcl-2 mice eventually succumb to a myeloproliferative-like disease resembling a preleukemic state. In summary, our data demonstrate that Gfi1's ability to protect against apoptosis is essential for HSC function. In addition, our finding show that Gfi1 prevents the development of myeloproliferative diseases and provides evidence how Gfi1 deficiency could be linked to myeloid leukemia.","['Khandanpour, Cyrus', 'Kosan, Christian', 'Gaudreau, Marie-Claude', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Zeng, Hui', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Khandanpour C', 'Kosan C', 'Gaudreau MC', 'Duhrsen U', 'Hebert J', 'Zeng H', 'Moroy T']","['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gfi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*prevention & control', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/12/31 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.575 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2011 Feb;29(2):376-85. doi: 10.1002/stem.575.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2010 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,

Although alpha-SMA is often expressed in stromal cells associated to a variety of cancers including hematological malignancies, up to now the role of anti-cancer drugs on alpha-SMA has not been deeply investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that Nutlin-3, the small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2/p53 interactions, significantly up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of alpha-SMA in normal macrophages as well as in p53(wild-type) but not in p53(mutated/null) myeloid leukemic cells. The p53-dependence of alpha-SMA up-regulation induced by Nutlin-3 was demonstrated in experiments performed with siRNA for p53. Of note, Nutlin-3 mediated up-regulation of alpha-SMA in OCI leukemic cells was accompanied by cell adhesion to plastic substrate and by reduced cell migratory response in transwell assays. Notably, the role of alpha-SMA induction in the modulation of myeloid cell migration was clearly documented in alpha-SMA gene knockdown experiments. In addition, Nutlin-3 significantly up-regulated alpha-SMA expression in primary endothelial cells, but not in fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Conversely, transforming growth factor-beta1 up-regulated alpha-SMA in fibroblasts and MSC, but not in macrophages and endothelial cells. Taken together, these data indicate that Nutlin-3 is a potent inducer of alpha-SMA in both normal and leukemic myeloid cells as well as in endothelial cells.","['Secchiero, Paola', 'Rimondi, Erika', 'di Iasio, Maria Grazia', 'Voltan, Rebecca', 'Gonelli, Arianna', 'Zauli, Giorgio']","['Secchiero P', 'Rimondi E', 'di Iasio MG', 'Voltan R', 'Gonelli A', 'Zauli G']","['Department of Morphology and Embryology and LTTA Centre, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. paola.secchiero@unife.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2012/04/03 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.22910 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2012 May;227(5):1829-37. doi: 10.1002/jcp.22910.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

The authors report the final results from a multicenter, prospective study examining FCR in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM). METHODS: Forty-three patients with symptomatic WM that was untreated or pretreated with 1 line of chemotherapy received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenously on day 1 and fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 2 through 4. FCR was repeated every 28 days for up to 6 courses. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 79%, and the major response rate of 74.4%, including 11.6% complete remissions (CRs) and 20.9% very good partial remissions. An amelioration of the quality of responses was observed during follow-up, leading to 18.6% of CRs. No differences in terms of responses were observed among previously treated or untreated patients. Among the clinical and laboratory features that were considered, only the beta2-microglobulin level had a significant impact in terms of achieving a major response. The major toxicity reported was grade 3/4 neutropenia, which occurred in 45% of courses and was the main reason for treatment discontinuation. After the end of treatment, 19 patients (44%) had long-lasting episodes of neutropenia. Three patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The FCR regimen was capable of neutralizing adverse prognostic factors and proved to be active in patients with WM, leading to rapid disease control and good-quality responses.

Previous studies demonstrated the efficacy and safety of nilotinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patients in chronic phase (CML-CP) or accelerated phase who failed prior imatinib. METHODS: This expanded access trial further characterized the safety of nilotinib 400 mg twice daily in patients with CML-CP (N = 1422). RESULTS: In this large, heavily pretreated population, nilotinib demonstrated significant efficacy, with complete hematologic response and complete cytogenetic response achieved in 43% and 34% of patients, respectively. Responses were rapid, mostly occurring within 6 months, and were higher in patients with suboptimal response to imatinib, with 75% and 50% achieving major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response, respectively. At 18 months, the progression-free survival rate was 80%. Most patients achieved planned dosing of 400 mg twice daily and maintained the dose >12 months. Nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were mostly mild to moderate and included rash (28%), headache (25%), and nausea (17%). Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (22%), neutropenia (14%), and anemia (3%) were low and managed by dose reduction or brief interruption. Grade 3 or 4 elevations in serum bilirubin and lipase occurred in 4% and 7% of patients, respectively. The incidence of newly occurring AEs decreased over time. Of patients who experienced a dose reduction because of AEs and attempted a re-escalation, 87% successfully achieved re-escalation to the full dose. CONCLUSIONS: This large study confirms that nilotinib was well tolerated and that grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred infrequently and were manageable through transient dose interruptions.","['Nicolini, Franck E', 'Turkina, Anna', 'Shen, Zhi-Xiang', 'Gallagher, Neil', 'Jootar, Saengsuree', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'De Souza, Carmino', 'Zheng, Ming', 'Szczudlo, Tomasz', 'le Coutre, Philipp']","['Nicolini FE', 'Turkina A', 'Shen ZX', 'Gallagher N', 'Jootar S', 'Powell BL', 'De Souza C', 'Zheng M', 'Szczudlo T', 'le Coutre P']","['Department of Hematology, Edouard Herriot Hospital, Lyon, France. franck-emmanuel.nicolini@chu-lyon.fr']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Compassionate Use Trials', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26249 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jan 1;118(1):118-26. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26249.

An important drawback of TKI therapy is the development of resistance, frequently through the acquisition of mutations. Mutations at the gatekeeper residues of BCR-ABL1 (eg, the threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at codon 315) and other oncogenic kinases have proven highly resistant to currently available TKIs.

Neuronal and oligodendrocyte precursor cells have been identified in several areas in the murine central nervous system. The presence of astrocyte precursor cells (APCs) is not so well understood. The present study provides several lines of evidence that CD44-positive cells are APCs in the early postnatal mouse cerebellum. In developing mouse cerebellum, CD44-positive cells, mostly located in the white matter, were positive for the markers of the astrocyte lineage, but negative for the markers of mature astrocytes. CD44-positive cells were purified from postnatal cerebellum by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and characterized in vitro. In the absence of any signaling molecule, many cells died by apoptosis. The surviving cells gradually expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker for mature astrocytes, indicating that differentiation into mature astrocytes is the default program for these cells. The cells produced no neurospheres nor neurons nor oligodendrocytes under any condition examined, indicating these cells are not neural stem cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor greatly promoted astrocytic differentiation of CD44-positive cells, whereas bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) did not. Fibroblast growth factor-2 was a potent mitogen for these cells, but was insufficient for survival. BMP4 inhibited activation of caspase-3 and greatly promoted survival, suggesting a novel role for BMP4 in the control of development of astrocytes in cerebellum. We isolated and characterized only CD44 strongly positive large cells and discarded small and/or CD44 weakly positive cells in this study. Further studies are necessary to characterize these cells to help determine whether CD44 is a selective and specific marker for APCs in the developing mouse cerebellum. In conclusion, we succeeded in preparing APC candidates from developing mouse cerebellum, characterized them in vitro, and found that BMPs are survival factors for these cells.","['Cai, Na', 'Kurachi, Masashi', 'Shibasaki, Koji', 'Okano-Uchida, Takayuki', 'Ishizaki, Yasuki']","['Cai N', 'Kurachi M', 'Shibasaki K', 'Okano-Uchida T', 'Ishizaki Y']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showa-machi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cerebellum,"Cerebellum (London, England)",101089443,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Cd44 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Astrocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cerebellum/cytology/*growth & development', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture/methods']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2012/12/10 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/12/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12311-011-0294-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cerebellum. 2012 Mar;11(1):181-93. doi: 10.1007/s12311-011-0294-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 2006 to 2010, 47 patients were treated using the MRC UKALLXII/ECOG E2993 protocol. Prior to July 2005, 40 patients had been treated with the JALSG ALL 87 protocol. A complete remission (CR) rate of 91.5% was achieved with the E2993 protocol, which was not significantly higher than the 80% achieved using JALSG (P > 0.05). The median duration of CR in months was 19 for all patients treated with the MRC UKALLXII/ECOG E2993 protocol. Ph+ patients showed a median CR duration of 11.5 months, while Ph- patients had a significantly longer CR duration of 19 months (P = 0.019). Further, Ph- patients at standard risk (stratified on the basis of age and white blood cell count at diagnosis) had a CR duration of 21 months, which was significantly longer than the 12-month CR duration for the ten Ph- patients at high risk (P = 0.001). Significant differences were found in the 2-year event-free survival and overall survival rates between the MRC UKALLXII/ECOG E2993 and JALSG ALL 87 groups in the following three cohorts: all patients (P = 0.009 and 0.022, respectively), Ph- patients (P = 0.009 and 0.018, respectively), and standard-risk patients (P = 0.014 and 0.007, respectively). The overall mortality rate for induction therapy in the MRC UKALLXII/ECOG E2993 group was 2.1% (1 of 47 patients). One or more instances of grade IV myelosuppression occurred during induction therapy. Among the non-hematological toxicities, alopecia and elevated ALT and AST levels were the most common. The levels of ALT and AST could be reduced to less than twofold the normal values within 1-2 weeks. The data indicate that the MRC UKALLXII/ECOG E2993 regimen is well tolerated in Chinese adults with ALL and can improve survival compared with the JALSG ALL 87 protocol. Risk stratification at diagnosis based on age and WBC count is suitable for adults with ALL, and it is necessary to adopt different strategies as determined by diagnostic results. Lastly, Ph+ patients have an extremely poor prognosis.","['Wang, Hua', 'Chen, Xiao-Qin', 'Geng, Qi-Rong', 'Liu, Pan-Pan', 'Lin, Gui-Nan', 'Xia, Zhong-Jun', 'Lu, Yue']","['Wang H', 'Chen XQ', 'Geng QR', 'Liu PP', 'Lin GN', 'Xia ZJ', 'Lu Y']","[""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. luyue@medmail.com.cn."", ""Department of Hematologic Oncology, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, Guangzhou, 510060, People's Republic of China. luyue@medmail.com.cn."", ""Institute of Hematology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510060, Guangdong, People's Republic of China. luyue@medmail.com.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0891-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0891-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Aug;94(2):163-168. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0891-y.

Multi-donor transfusions induce alloimmunization, thereby increasing morbidity and mortality. Therefore, an autologous or HLA-matched allogeneic source of platelets and granulocytes is needed. To determine whether nonhematopoietic cells can be reprogrammed into hematopoietic cells, human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and skin fibroblasts were incubated with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (Aza) and the growth factors (GF) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor. This treatment transformed MSCs to round, non-adherent cells expressing T-, B-, myeloid-, or stem/progenitor-cell markers. The transformed cells engrafted as hematopoietic cells in bone marrow of immunodeficient mice.

This therapeutic strategy has the potential of avoiding the significant side effects that occur with the traditional AML therapeutics. We identified a natural compound securinine, as a leukemia differentiation-inducing agent. Securinine is a plant-derived alkaloid that has previously been used clinically as a therapeutic for primarily neurological related diseases. Securinine induces monocytic differentiation of a wide range of myeloid leukemia cell lines as well as primary leukemic patient samples. Securinine's clinical potential for AML can be seen from its ability to induce significant growth arrest in cell lines and patient samples as well as its activity in significantly impairing the growth of AML tumors in nude mice. In addition, securinine can synergize with currently employed agents such as ATRA and decitabine to induce differentiation. This study has revealed securinine induces differentiation through the activation of DNA damage signaling. Securinine is a promising new monocytic differentiation inducing agent for AML that has seen previous clinical use for non-related disorders.","['Gupta, Kalpana', 'Chakrabarti, Amitabha', 'Rana, Sonia', 'Ramdeo, Ritu', 'Roth, Bryan L', 'Agarwal, Munna L', 'Tse, William', 'Agarwal, Mukesh K', 'Wald, David N']","['Gupta K', 'Chakrabarti A', 'Rana S', 'Ramdeo R', 'Roth BL', 'Agarwal ML', 'Tse W', 'Agarwal MK', 'Wald DN']","['Department of Pathology, Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],['R43 CA134089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Azepines)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Receptors, GABA)', 'G4VS580P5E (securinine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azepines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, Bridged-Ring', 'Humans', 'Lactones/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Piperidines/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Receptors, GABA/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3123298,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0021203 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-01176 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e21203. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021203.

Patients enrolled in Medicare and commercial insurance plans often have large copay requirements with each treatment cycle. Often, these patients undergo significant financial hardship, and some patients decline treatment. We have developed a support program that works closely with all copay assistance foundations to secure financial assistance to facilitate appropriate treatment. METHODS: In September, 2008 we initiated a coordinated program with various copay assistance foundations, including Healthwell, Cancer Care, Patient Access, Chronic Disease Fund, Beckstrand Cancer, Lilly Cares and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Patients requesting assistance with chemotherapy copay were enrolled in this program. Information about income level, chemotherapy regimens, and associated copay was given to these foundations, who then determined the amount of monetary assistance. RESULTS: Since the initiation of this program, of 201 patients who began receiving chemotherapy, 25 (12.4%) requested assistance with this program for either intravenous or oral treatments. The current results of time delays for foundation decision, success rates and administrative costs to secure funding will be presented at the time of the poster presentation. CONCLUSION: Copay for chemotherapy drugs is a financial hardship for a significant number of patients. Coordinated resources must be provided and reimbursed to facilitate appropriate and sustainable cancer care. This program is a successful model for other centers to adopt.","['Rajurkar, Swapnil P', 'Presant, Cary A', 'Bosserman, Linda D', 'McNatt, Wendy J']","['Rajurkar SP', 'Presant CA', 'Bosserman LD', 'McNatt WJ']","['Wilshire Oncology Medical Group, LaVerne, CA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,,,PMC3051854,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/07/07 06:01,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/10/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1200/JOP.2010.000112 [doi]', '3676723 [pii]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2011 Mar;7(2):100-2. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2010.000112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethanol and aqueous extracts of roots of Annona reticulata Linn were studied for their in vitro antiproliferative activity on A-549 (human lung carcinoma), K-562 (human chronic myelogenous leukemia bone marrow), HeLa (human cervix) and MDA-MB (human adenocarcinoma mammary gland) cancer cell lines by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] colorimetric assay. RESULTS: The ethanol extract exhibited a prominent inhibitory effect against A-549, K-562, HeLa and MDA-MB human cancer cell lines at a concentration range between 10 and 40 mug/ml, whereas the aqueous extract showed a lower activity at the same concentration. Simultaneously, the effect of the ethanol extract toward the inhibition of Vero cell line proliferation was lower in comparison with the cancer cell lines. CONCLUSION: The significant antiproliferative activity of the ethanol extract of Annona reticulata roots against A-549, K-562, HeLa and MDA-MB human cancer cell lines may be attributed toward the collective presence of acetogenins, alkaloids and lower inhibitory effect on Vero cell line, which suggests Annona reticulata be used as a chemopreventive agent in cancer therapy.","['Suresh, H M', 'Shivakumar, B', 'Hemalatha, K', 'Heroor, S S', 'Hugar, D S', 'Rao, K R S Sambasiva']","['Suresh HM', 'Shivakumar B', 'Hemalatha K', 'Heroor SS', 'Hugar DS', 'Rao KR']","[""Department of Pharmacognosy, H.K.E.

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the metabolism of several anticancer drugs, including alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and cyclophosphamides. AIM: The present study is aimed to examine the association of GST and CYP1A1*2A polymorphisms in the susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the prognostic significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 92 immunophenotyped patients and 150 cord blood controls were genotyped by PCR for GSTM1 and GSTT1, RQ-PCR allelic discrimination assay for GSTP1 and PCR-RFLP for CYP1A1*2A polymorphism. RESULTS: We have previously reported the significant association of GSTM1 (null) and combined GSTP1 {(Ile/Val)/ (Val/Val)} /GSTM1 (null) genotype with the susceptibility to ALL. No significant association was observed with GSTT1 (P=0.75) and CYP1A1*2A (P=0.61 for +/- and P=0.86 for -/- respectively) in the susceptibility to ALL. Survival analysis was performed in 50 of the 92 patients who were followed for three years. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for three years showed significant lower event-free survival in patients harboring GSTP1 (Ile/Val) and GSTP1 (Val/Val) (P=0.038 and 0.0001, respectively) genotype. Cox regression analysis revealed GSTP1 as an independent prognostic marker with 6-fold higher risk with Val/Val genotype (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that GSTP1 (Ile/Val) polymorphism has a role in the susceptibility to ALL and also influence treatment outcome.","['Suneetha, K J', 'Nancy, K Nirmala', 'Rajalekshmy, K R', 'Rama, R', 'Sagar, T G', 'Rajkumar, T']","['Suneetha KJ', 'Nancy KN', 'Rajalekshmy KR', 'Rama R', 'Sagar TG', 'Rajkumar T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute (WIA), Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,PMC3124985,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/07/07 06:01,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.81886 [doi]', 'IJMPO-32-25 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2011 Jan;32(1):25-9. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.81886.,,['NOTNLM'],"['CYP1A1*2A', 'GSTM1', 'GSTP1', 'GSTT1', 'polymorphisms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer cells have deregulated apoptotic pathways, where increased expression and stability of anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 increases resistance to apoptosis. Pathways that increase the stability of proteins in cancer cells remain poorly understood. METHODS: Using human mammary epithelial and established breast cancer cell lines, we assessed the mechanisms that increase the stability of anti-apoptotic proteins in breast cancer cells by caspase assay, western blot, small-inhibitory RNA treatment and immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: While breast cancer cells were resistant to de novo inhibition of protein synthesis, a rapid proteosome-mediated degradation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 induced apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells. Although Mule, an E3 ligase that targets Mcl-1 for degradation was expressed in mammary epithelial and breast cancer cell lines, rapid increase of polyubiquitinated Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 was detected only in mammary epithelial cells. Only transient formation of the Mule-Mcl-1 complex was detected in breast cancer cells. Downregulation of pERK1/2 in breast cancer cells reduced Mcl-1 levels and increased Mcl-1/Mule complex. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that reduced Mule/Mcl-1 complex has a significant role in increasing the stability of Mcl-1 in breast cancer cells and increased resistance to apoptosis.","['Pervin, S', 'Tran, A', 'Tran, L', 'Urman, R', 'Braga, M', 'Chaudhuri, G', 'Singh, R']","['Pervin S', 'Tran A', 'Tran L', 'Urman R', 'Braga M', 'Chaudhuri G', 'Singh R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science, 3084 Hawkins Building, 1731 East 120th Street, Los Angeles, CA 90059, USA. shehlapervin@cdrewu.edu']",['eng'],"['UL1 RR033176/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5S21MD000103/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000124/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 HD053888/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SC1AG033407/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '5U54CA 143931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SC1 AG033407/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '1R03 HD053888/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'S21 MD000103/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (HUWE1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",PMC3172901,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011242 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.242 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Jul 26;105(3):428-37. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.242.

It has long been recognised as an important target for cancer therapy but inhibitors have proved elusive. As NU6027, originally developed as a CDK2 inhibitor, potentiated cisplatin in a CDK2-independent manner we postulated that it may inhibit ATR. METHODS: Cellular ATR kinase activity was determined by CHK1 phosphorylation in human fibroblasts with inducible dominant-negative ATR-kinase dead expression and human breast cancer MCF7 cells. Cell cycle effects and chemo- and radiopotentiation by NU6027 were determined in MCF7 cells and the role of mismatch repair and p53 was determined in isogenically matched ovarian cancer A2780 cells. RESULTS: NU6027 is a potent inhibitor of cellular ATR activity (IC(50)=6.7 muM) and enhanced hydroxyurea and cisplatin cytotoxicity in an ATR-dependent manner. NU6027 attenuated G2/M arrest following DNA damage, inhibited RAD51 focus formation and increased the cytotoxicity of the major classes of DNA-damaging anticancer cytotoxic therapy but not the antimitotic, paclitaxel. In A2780 cells sensitisation to cisplatin was greatest in cells with functional p53 and mismatch repair (MMR) and sensitisation to temozolomide was greatest in p53 mutant cells with functional MMR. Importantly, NU6027 was synthetically lethal when DNA single-strand break repair is impaired either through poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition or defects in XRCC1. CONCLUSION: NU6027 inhibits ATR, impairing G2/M arrest and homologous recombination thus increasing sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and PARP inhibitors. It provides proof of concept data for clinical development of ATR inhibitors.","['Peasland, A', 'Wang, L-Z', 'Rowling, E', 'Kyle, S', 'Chen, T', 'Hopkins, A', 'Cliby, W A', 'Sarkaria, J', 'Beale, G', 'Edmondson, R J', 'Curtin, N J']","['Peasland A', 'Wang LZ', 'Rowling E', 'Kyle S', 'Chen T', 'Hopkins A', 'Cliby WA', 'Sarkaria J', 'Beale G', 'Edmondson RJ', 'Curtin NJ']","['Newcastle University, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA148747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (4-cyclohexylmethoxy-5-nitrosopyrimidine-2,6-diamine)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Nitroso Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",PMC3172902,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bjc2011243 [pii]', '10.1038/bjc.2011.243 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2011 Jul 26;105(3):372-81. doi: 10.1038/bjc.2011.243.

Thus, we systematically evaluated PAX2 immunohistochemical staining in a retrospective study of pediatric WT, as compared with other pediatric tumors. We stained formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections from 39 WT, 6 nephrogenic rests, 8 non-Wilms renal tumors, and 43 nonrenal pediatric small round cell tumors with 2 different PAX2 polyclonal antibodies. PAX2 demonstrated strong, diffuse staining of epithelial and blastema components of WT (97% of cases). PAX2 stained WT stroma in fewer cases (23%), but 80% of anaplastic foci were positive. Nephrogenic rests, 1 case of metanephric adenoma, and 1 pediatric renal cell carcinoma were also PAX2 positive; other pediatric renal tumors were negative. Neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewings, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL) were PAX2 negative. However, PAX2 weakly stained some cases of B-cell ALL rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) was also stained, especially alveolar RMS (83%), with less staining of embryonal RMS (13%). One of the antibodies also stained maturing myoid cytoplasm of WT and RMS. This study shows that PAX2 is a sensitive marker of WT (sensitivity 97%), but PAX2 shows weak-to-moderate-intensity nuclear staining of RMS and B-cell ALL, somewhat limiting its utility. However, PAX2 may be a helpful marker in certain diagnostic situations. We speculate that RMS and B-cell ALL staining could be due to antibody cross-reactivity with PAX family members with known expression in RMS and B-cell ALL.","['Davis, Jessica L', 'Matsumura, Linh', 'Weeks, Douglas A', 'Troxell, Megan L']","['Davis JL', 'Matsumura L', 'Weeks DA', 'Troxell ML']","['Department of Pathology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239-3098, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epithelial Cells/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Neuroblastoma/chemistry', 'Neuroectodermal Tumors, Primitive/chemistry', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor/*analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/chemistry', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/chemistry', 'Stromal Cells/chemistry', 'Wilms Tumor/*chemistry/pathology']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/09/14 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e31821d3131 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2011 Aug;35(8):1186-94. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e31821d3131.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 2 additional tyrosine kinases in nilotinib-resistant cells: the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk and the UFO family receptor tyrosine kinase Axl. This increased tyrosine phosphorylation involved an interaction of these tyrosine kinases with Lyn. Inhibition of Syk by the inhibitors R406 or BAY 61-3606 or by RNA interference restored the capacity of nilotinib to inhibit cell proliferation. Conversely, coexpression of Lyn and Syk were required to fully induce resistance to nilotinib in drug-sensitive cells. Surprisingly, the knockdown of Syk also strongly decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn and Axl, thus uncovering interplay between Syk and Lyn. We have shown the involvement of the adaptor protein CDCP-1 in resistance to nilotinib. Interestingly, the expression of Axl and CDCP1 were found increased both in a nilotinib-resistant cell line and in nilotinib-resistant CML patients. We conclude that an oncogenic signaling mediated by Lyn and Syk can bypass the need of Bcr-Abl in CML cells. Thus, targeting these kinases may be of therapeutic value to override imatinib or nilotinib resistance in CML.","['Gioia, Romain', 'Leroy, Cedric', 'Drullion, Claire', 'Lagarde, Valerie', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Roche, Serge', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max']","['Gioia R', 'Leroy C', 'Drullion C', 'Lagarde V', 'Etienne G', 'Dulucq S', 'Lippert E', 'Roche S', 'Mahon FX', 'Pasquet JM']","['Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cible Therapeutique, Inserm U1035, Universite Victor Segalen, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDCP1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40414-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-10-313692 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 25;118(8):2211-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-10-313692.

Forodesine and ara-G cytotoxicities were higher in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples than in B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. Resistance to forodesine did not preclude ara-G sensitivity and vice versa, indicating that both drugs rely on different resistance mechanisms. Differences in sensitivity could be partly explained by significantly higher accumulation of intracellular dGTP in forodesine-sensitive samples compared with resistant samples, and higher mRNA levels of dGK but not dCK. The mRNA levels of the transporters ENT1 and ENT2 were higher in ara-G-sensitive than -resistant samples.

CASE SUMMARY: A 7-year-old boy with a history of myelodysplasia that progressed to acute myeloid leukemia received busulfan with therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), clofarabine, and thiotepa as a pretransplant conditioning regimen for a cord blood transplant. The patient received metronidazole the day after a busulfan test dose of 0.5 mg/kg was administered. On the day of the first busulfan therapeutic dose, TDM was performed and the clearance of busulfan was significantly decreased by 46%. After 2 doses of busulfan therapy, the course area under the curve was exceeded, requiring discontinuation of busulfan. Metronidazole is not known to affect glutathione or the glutathione S-transferase A1 (GSTA1) enzyme system or cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. DISCUSSION: Busulfan is a bifunctional alkylating agent widely used in pretransplant conditioning regimens in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Busulfan metabolism is best described by hepatic conjugation to glutathione by GSTA1, although some CYP-dependent pathways have been described. Currently there is 1 publication describing the drug interaction between oral busulfan and oral metronidazole, in which concomitant use of metronidazole resulted in higher busulfan trough concentrations and higher risk of veno-occlusive disease. Our case represents a possible drug interaction based on the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale. CONCLUSIONS: Though the mechanistic basis for this interaction is unknown, the risks and benefits of using metronidazole during and in close proximity to busulfan should be carefully considered and therapeutic alternatives to metronidazole should be used when appropriate.","['Gulbis, Alison M', 'Culotta, Kirk S', 'Jones, Roy B', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Gulbis AM', 'Culotta KS', 'Jones RB', 'Andersson BS']","['Division of Pharmacy, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. amassaro@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '140QMO216E (Metronidazole)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Clostridioides difficile/isolation & purification', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/complications/drug therapy', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/drug effects', 'Metronidazole/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['aph.1Q087 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1Q087 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2011 Jul;45(7-8):e39. doi: 10.1345/aph.1Q087.

PURPOSE: The specific objective was to compare the lengths of remission for patients receiving 6-MP or placebo after achieving complete or partial remission from steroid treatment. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled sequential study was conducted in which patients were paired by remission status at each of the eleven institutions participating in the study, and randomized to 6-MP or placebo within each pair of patients. A preference for 6-MP or placebo was recorded depending on which patient in the pair had the longer remission. The preferences were plotted according to a restricted sequential procedure devised by Peter Armitage and, depending on which boundary of the design was crossed, a statistically significant difference could be declared favoring 6-MP, placebo or no preference. CONCLUSIONS: The trial established the efficacy of 6-MP for maintaining longer remissions in acute leukemia and led to the concept of 'adjuvant chemotherapy', namely that patients with minimal disease have a substantially better response to chemotherapy than patients with advanced disease, a concept that has been followed in many other forms of cancer. Statistically, the fact that many patients were still in remission when the study was stopped (i.e. the length of remission data for these patients was 'right censored') led to the development of a generalized Wilcoxon test and was an important influence on Cox's development of the proportional hazards model. The trial had an innovative design in the early 1960's and has been an important influence on subsequent clinical research in cancer and statistical research in survival analysis.","['Gehan, Edmund A', 'Freireich, Emil J']","['Gehan EA', 'Freireich EJ']","['Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA. gehane@georgetown.edu']",['eng'],['2P30 CA051008-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Placebos)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Placebos', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['8/3/288 [pii]', '10.1177/1740774511407358 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Trials. 2011 Jun;8(3):288-97. doi: 10.1177/1740774511407358.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome of relapsed patients remains dismal. The pro-survival role of NOTCH1 and NFkappaB in T-ALL is well documented; also, both factors were reported to be predictive of relapse. The NOTCH1 signaling pathway, commonly activated in T-ALL, was shown to enhance the transcriptional function of NFkappaB via several mechanisms. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH1-NFkappaB signaling was suggested to be incorporated into existing T-ALL treatment protocols. However, conventional chemotherapy is based on activation of various types of stress, such as DNA damage, mitotic perturbations or endoplasmic reticulum overload. NFkappaB is frequently activated in response to stress and, depending on yet unknown mechanisms, it either protects cells from the drug action or mediates apoptosis. Here, we report that T-ALL cells respond to NFkappaB inhibition in opposite ways depending on whether they were treated with a stress-inducing chemotherapeutic agent or not. Moreover, we found that NOTCH1 enhances NFkappaB apoptotic function in the stressed cells.

PROphylaxis of Fungal invasive Infections in Leukaemia-Caspofungin (PROFIL-C) is a multicentre study aiming to assess the comparative yield of using caspofungin versus standard policy (SP) regimens and the overall impact of IFI in routine clinical care conditions. METHODS: All AL patients receiving IFI prophylaxis according to local SP were prospectively included in the study by Northern Italy Leukaemia Group (NILG) centres. To allow the comparison of caspofungin versus SP regimens as prophylaxis strategies, caspofungin treatment was assigned via a centralized randomized procedure. The study was registered at http://www.clinicaltrial.gov (NCT00501098). RESULTS: Over a 2 year period, 175 patients were included. The overall incidence of IFI was 32/175 (18.3%) [10/175 (5.7%) probable/proven and 22/175 (12.6%) possible], with no statistically significant differences between caspofungin-based versus SP-based regimens [overall: 15/93 (16.1%) versus 17/82 (20.7%), relative risk (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-1.46; probable/proven: 7/93 (7.5%) versus 3/82 (3.7%), RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.55-7.7; possible: 8/93 (8.6%) versus 14/82 (17.1%), RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.22-1.14]. Only one IFI-related death was recorded (10%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and mortality of IFI were lower than expected in this strictly sequential cohort representative of the routine care in the NILG network. The efficacy and safety of caspofungin were similar to other prophylactic regimens.","['Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Monte, Simona', 'Algarotti, Alessandra', 'Audisio, Ernesta', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Campiotti, Leonardo', 'Cerqui, Elisa', 'Fanizza, Caterina', 'Giuliani, Rachele', 'Mico, Caterina', 'Rocconi, Roberta', 'Salvi, Anna', 'Salvi, Flavia', 'Verga, Luisa', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, Giorgio', 'Pogliani, Enrico M', 'Tognoni, Gianni', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Cattaneo C', 'Monte S', 'Algarotti A', 'Audisio E', 'Borlenghi E', 'Campiotti L', 'Cerqui E', 'Fanizza C', 'Giuliani R', 'Mico C', 'Rocconi R', 'Salvi A', 'Salvi F', 'Verga L', 'Levis A', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers G', 'Pogliani EM', 'Tognoni G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Rossi G']","['Department of Haematology, Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy. chiara.cattaneo@libero.it']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Caspofungin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Echinocandins/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/drug therapy', 'Lipopeptides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy', 'Pulmonary Aspergillosis/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Sample Size', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['dkr271 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkr271 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2011 Sep;66(9):2140-5. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkr271.

Host-defense peptides often exhibit selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells and show potential as anti-cancer therapeutics. Here, we screen 26 naturally occurring variants of the peptide pleurocidin for cytotoxic and anti-cancer activities, and investigate the underlying mechanism of action. Cytotoxicities were assessed in vitro using cell-based assays and in vivo using zebrafish embryos. Morphological changes were assessed by both transmission and scanning electron microscopy, and functional assays were performed on zebrafish embryos to investigate the mechanism of cell death. A total of 14 peptides were virtually inactive against HL60 human leukemia cells, whereas 12 caused >50% death at </=32 mug/ml. Morphological changes characteristic of oncosis were evident by electron microscopy after only 1 minute of treatment with 32 mug/ml of variant NRC-03. Only two peptides were hemolytic. Four peptides showed no toxicity towards zebrafish embryos at the highest concentration tested (25 muM; approximately 64 mug/ml) and one peptide was highly toxic, killing 4-hour-post-fertilization (hpf) embryos immediately after exposure to 1 muM peptide. Four other peptides killed embryos after 24 hours of exposure at 1 muM. Most peptides caused mortality at one or more developmental stages only after continuous exposure (24 hours) with higher lethal doses (>/=5 muM). Pleurocidin NRC-03 bound to embryos and induced the release of superoxide, caused an increase in the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei, and caused membrane damage and the loss of embryonic epithelial integrity, marked by the exclusion of cells from the outer epithelium and the appearance of F-actin within the circumferential cells of the repair site. Our results indicate that specific pleurocidin variants are attractive cancer-selective agents that selectively induce cell death in target cells but leave non-target cells such as erythrocytes and non-transformed cells unaffected.","['Morash, Michael G', 'Douglas, Susan E', 'Robotham, Anna', 'Ridley, Christina M', 'Gallant, Jeffrey W', 'Soanes, Kelly H']","['Morash MG', 'Douglas SE', 'Robotham A', 'Ridley CM', 'Gallant JW', 'Soanes KH']","['Institute for Marine Biosciences, National Research Council, 1411 Oxford Street, Halifax, NS B3H 3Z1, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (pleurocidin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*analysis/chemistry/toxicity', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Fish Proteins/*analysis/chemistry/toxicity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*analysis/chemistry/toxicity', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Zebrafish/*embryology']",PMC3177944,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/12/31 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['dmm.007310 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.007310 [doi]']",ppublish,Dis Model Mech. 2011 Sep;4(5):622-33. doi: 10.1242/dmm.007310.

In an effort to provide better postoperative pain control, there is a need to understand the factors that contribute to the development of pain after surgery. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine released from tissues after injury. We hypothesized that LIF expression in skin, muscle, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) would increase after plantar incision. The mRNA and protein expression of LIF and LIF receptor (LIF-R) were measured after plantar incision in the rat. Pain behaviors, immunohistochemistry, and C-fiber heat responses to LIF were also studied. LIF expression increased after incision in skin and muscle, and LIF-R was present in large and small DRG neurons. LIF administration to the hindpaw increased pain behaviors, a process that was reversed by anti-LIF. However, LIF and anti-LIF treatment at the time of incision did not augment or ameliorate pain behaviors. LIF treatment activated the second messenger system, JAK-STAT3, in cultured DRG neurons, but failed to alter spontaneous activity or heat responses in C-fiber nociceptors. In conclusion, LIF is not a target for postoperative analgesia; LIF may be important for skin and muscle repair and regeneration after incision. PERSPECTIVE: This article highlights an incision pain model for the study of factors involved in nociception. The study demonstrates that LIF in is an unlikely target for novel early postoperative analgesics.","['Spofford, Christina M', 'Mohan, Shekher', 'Kang, Sinyoung', 'Jang, Jun Ho', 'Brennan, Timothy J']","['Spofford CM', 'Mohan S', 'Kang S', 'Jang JH', 'Brennan TJ']","['Department of Anesthesia, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA. christina-spofford@uiowa.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pain,The journal of pain,100898657,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/therapeutic use', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ganglia, Spinal/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hyperalgesia/physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/administration & dosage/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/metabolism', 'Nerve Fibers, Unmyelinated/physiology', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Pain Threshold/physiology', 'Pain, Postoperative/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Skin/innervation/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1526-5900(11)00420-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpain.2011.02.351 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pain. 2011 Jul;12(7):819-32. doi: 10.1016/j.jpain.2011.02.351.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 American Pain Society.

We report an open-label randomized phase II trial of reinduction chemotherapy with and without the XIAP antisense oligonucleotide AEG35156 in patients with AML who did not achieve remission with initial induction chemotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with AML who were refractory to initial induction chemotherapy were randomized and treated with AEG35156 (650 mg) in combination with high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin. Thirteen patients were randomized and treated with high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin alone. The rates of response and toxicity were determined. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients assigned to AEG35156 in combination with high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin, 3 died during reinduction chemotherapy, 5 achieved complete remission (CR), and 6 achieved CR with incomplete platelet count recovery (CRp), for an overall response rate of 41%.

METHODS: The promoter methylation status of hPer3 gene and mRNA expression levels in bone marrow of 206 AML and 40 iron deficiency anemia (IDA) patients (as control) were detected by methylation specific PCR (MS-PCR) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The HL-60 and U937 cell lines were treated with different concentrations of DCA for 48 and 72 h. The inhibition rates of cell proliferation were detected by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT); the early apoptosis rates by staining with Annexin V and PI; the CD14 and CD11b expressions by flow cytometry (FCM); the promoter methylation status of hPer3 gene by MS-PCR; and the hPer3 mRNA expressions levels by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The promoter methylation rates of hPer3 in newly diagnosed (ND) group, partial remission(PR) group, complete remission (CR) group, relapse (R) group and control group were 93.65% (59/63), 54.39% (31/57), 24.66% (18/73), 61.54% (8/13) and 0% (0/40), and the hPer3 mRNA expression levels were 0.19 +/- 0.08, 6.28 +/- 2.11, 52.76 +/- 14.17, 8.18 +/- 4.36, 75.03 +/- 18.16, respectively. There was a significant statistic difference between any two group (P < 0.01) excepting for between PR and R group (P > 0.05). After DCA treatment, the promoter hypermethylation status of hPer3 was reduced and the mRNA and CD14, CD11b expression levels were up regulated in a dose dependent manner with an induction of cell apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Promotor methylation status and mRNA expression of hPer3 gene may be indicators for evaluating AML.

METHODS: ATRA sensitive strain of APL (NB4) and resistant strain (NB4-R1, NB4-R2) were used in this study. The low toxic dosage of MAT was established by MTT test, and ATRA IC(50) of the cell strains (cultured with or without 0.1 mmol/L MAT) were obtained to confirm the reversal index (RI); the influence of MAT (10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 mmol/L) combine with 1 micromol/L ATRA on the differentiation of the three cell strains were observed by nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (NBT) test and morphologic changes. The apoptosis rate of cells treated with different concentration of MAT combined with 1 micromol/L ATRA was tested by flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining. RESULTS: (1) The toxicity of MAT to NB4, NB4-R1, and NB4-R2 cells was increased with the concentration, IC(50) value was (0.661 +/- 0.035) mmol/L, (0.673 +/- 0.132) mmol/L and (0.329 +/- 0.020) mmol/L, respectively; (2) After treated with 0.1 mmol/L MAT, the ATRA resistance factor of NB4-R1 decreased markedly (RI = 4.96 +/- 1.15), but did not of NB4-R2(RI = 0.66 +/- 0.17); (3) The differentiation capacity of NB4 and NB4-R1 was enhanced with increase of MAT, and peaked at 0.1 mmol/L (P < 0.05), but did not of NB4-R2; (4) After treated with MAT, the ATRA (1 micromol/L) induced apoptosis rate in NB4 and NB4-R1 increased significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively).

METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing were used to sequence exon 3 to 11 of TET2 gene. RESULTS: Among 96 AML patients, TET2 gene mutation was detected in 13 (13.54%) patients (95%CI 6.70% - 20.38%). The median age was 54 years in mutated group and 41 years in unmutated group (P = 0.010).

METHODS: Seventy-nine AMOL patients were treated with (m)HAD regimen as induction therapy (HHT 2 mg/m(2), d 1-7; Ara-C 100 mg/m(2), d 1-7 and increasing to 1.5 gxm(-2)x(12 h)(-1), d 5-7 in some patients; DNR 40 mg/m(2), d 1-3). The treatment outcome and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) The complete remission (CR) rate was 79.7% (63/79), partial remission (PR) rate was 6.3% (5/79), overall rate was 86.0%. (2) The chromosome karyotypes were analyzed in 75 patients, of whom 43 with normal karyotypes (NCR) and 30 abnormal karyotypes (ACR). For the cytogenetic prognostic groups, 49 patients were intermediate, 18 poor and 6 unknown. The CR, 1-year and 3-year overal survival (OS) rates in NCR group were significantly higher than those in ACR group (P < 0.05); but there was no significantly statistical difference in disease free survival (DFS) between the two groups (P > 0.05). The CR, 1-year OS, 3-year OS and 1-year DFS and 3-year DFS rates in intermediate prognostic group were significantly higher than those in poor prognostic group (85.7% vs 61.1%, 75.9% vs 51.3%, 65.4% vs 25.6%, 82.2% vs 66.7%, and 77.9% vs 26.7%, respectively) (P < 0.05). (3) Chromosome karyotype and the number of consolidation therapy courses had more important influence on survival in COX analysis. CONCLUSION: (m)HAD regimen as induction chemotherapy for AMOL patients achieves a high CR rate. It has an important influence on survival for the patients to received adequate consolidation therapy. The frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in AMOL is similar to that in other AMLs. The prognosis of AMOL patients with chromosome karyotype in intermediate prognostic group is significantly better than that in poor prognostic group.","['Zhang, Jing', 'Mi, Ying-chang', 'Wang, Ying', 'Liu, Bing-cheng', 'Lin, Dong', 'Li, Wei', 'Liu, Kai-qi', 'Wang, Hui-jun', 'Liu, Xu-ping', 'Bian, Shou-geng', 'Wang, Jian-xiang']","['Zhang J', 'Mi YC', 'Wang Y', 'Liu BC', 'Lin D', 'Li W', 'Liu KQ', 'Wang HJ', 'Liu XP', 'Bian SG', 'Wang JX']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2012/05/23 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 May;32(5):294-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: After splenectomy, cytoxan intraperitoneal injection, and sublethal irradiation, 10 BALB/c nu/nu mice were transplanted intravenously with 1.2 x 10(7) of SHI-1 human monocytic leukemic cells. Mice were monitored for survival and clinical manifestation of nerve palsy. The leukemic cells engrafted were examined by RT-PCR, histopathology and bone marrow (BM) smears. Immunofluorescence analysis with laser scanning fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to determine the expression of fibrinogen and tight-junction protein ZO-1. An in vitro BBB model composed of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) was developed on a Matrigel-based insert. Different leukemic cell lines were seeded onto the upper compartment of transwell insert. After incubated for 24 h with BMVECs, cells that had migrated into the lower compartment were counted and analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Paralysis with or without sight loss was developed in half the mice 30-35 d after innoculated with SHI-1 cells. Leukemic cells infiltrates were observed in BM and in different part of brain tissues including brain parenchyma. The transcriptions of human MLL/AF6 fusion gene were also detected in BM and brain tissues in paralysis mice. The fibrinogen expression and ZO-1 disruption were detected in the infiltrated tissue. (2) After 24 h incubation with leukemic cells, the BMVECs sheets were disrupted and grew singly and ZO-1 expression was down-regulated markedly. SHI-1 cells showed more injurious to BMVECs and higher invasive rate \[(40.33 +/- 1.53)% vs (11.83 +/- 1.44)%, P < 0.05\] than HL-60 cells did.

The mice were randomly divided into two groups: control group and experimental group. Nude mice in control group were injected with physiological saline, while those of experimental group were given BCG and inactivated BCG respectively. The tumor growth was assayed by using caliper. The survival time of nude mice was determined. Necrotic extent and morphological changes of tumor were observed and examined by HE staining and immunohistochemical method. The results indicated that on 5th-7th days after tumor inoculated, 2 - 3 mm tumor mass could be observed. The tumor volume increased over the time. HE staining of tumor tissues showed that there were different degrees of tumor necrosis in BCG group and inactivated BCG group. Immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that CD20 positive cells were obviously observed in the necrotic area of BCG group, compared with the control group and inactivated BCG group.

A double PCR was firstly designed and optimized to amplify both exon 12 of NPM1 and exon 14-intron 14-exon 15 of FLT3, with the aim of detecting almost all reported mutations. After optimization, a touchdown PCR was chosen for the multiplex PCR procedure, with the primer concentrations of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD being 200 nmol/L and 152 nmol/L respectively. The PCR amplicons were separated by capillary electrophoresis and the presence of mutants was recognized by the size difference between the mutants and wild-type products. The areas of mutant peak and wild-type peak were used to calculate the mutant/wild-type ratio. All the positive mutated samples were confirmed by sequencing. The results showed that 17 patients with NPM1 mutation, 15 patients with FLT3-ITD mutation, 6 patients with both NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations were found among 93 patents. 7 patients with M(2), 4 patients with M(4), 5 patients with M(5) and 1 patients with M(6) were found out of 17 patients with NPM1 mutation, in which 10 patients were male and 7 patients were female, 15 patients were with type A, 1 patients was with type B and 1 patients was with type Nm, strikingly 1 CML patient in blast crisis was found to carry a type A mutation.

The morphological changes in apoptosis process of NB4 cells treated by arsenic trioxide were observed under immunofluorescence microscope and DNA electrophoresis method, and the apoptosis rate of NB4 cells and the variations of mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the variations of expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 protein were analyzed by using Western blot method. The results indicated that after NB4 cells were treated with 2 micromol/L As(2)O(3) for 48 hours, some variations of NB4 cells were observed, such as pyknosis, chromatin segmentation, even fragmentation. Meanwhile, the typical DNA Ladder phenomenon was observed. The apoptosis rate of NB4 cells treated with 3 micromol/L As(2)O(3) for 48 hours was 33.34%, Furthermore the apoptosis rate of NB4 cells was enhanced along with the increase of concentration of As(2)O(3). After NB4 cells were treated with 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 micromol/L As(2)O(3) for 48 hours, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased by 12.8%, 21.6%, 66.9%, 83.7% and 83.8% respectively. The Western blot detection results showed that the expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 protein in NB4 cells was lower than that in control cells and decreased along with the rise of As(2)O(3) concentration, then the negative dose-dependent manner was observed between these 2 groups. It is concluded that As(2)O(3) can effectively induce NB4 cell apoptosis, and the dose-dependent manner existed in certain extent of concentrations. The decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential may be related with NB4 cell apoptosis induced by As(2)O(3).

Kasumi-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of SM1044, the cell viability was evaluated by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression were assessed by using flow cytometry with Annexin-V/PI double staining and flow cytometry with PI staining respectively. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins caspase 3, PARP and the fusion protein AML1-ETO were detected by Western blot. The results indicated that SM1044 inhibited cell growth of Kasumi-1 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. After exposure of Kasumi-1 cells to 1 micromol/L SM1044 for 24 hours, the cell viability was decreased to 50%. IC(50) of SM1044 to Kasumi-1 cells at 48 hours was 0.17 +/- 0.067 micromol/L. SM1044 induced cell apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner, and the apoptotic rate of Kasumi-1 cells increased as SM1044 concentration increased. Flow cytometry with PI staining revealed that SM1044 induced cell cycle arrest, and the proportion of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase increased from 58.33 +/- 4.46% to 71.75 +/- 2.24% after exposure to 5 micromol/L SM1044 for 24 hours. Western blot showed that SM1044 increased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins cPARP and cleaved caspase 3 and also degraded the AML1-ETO fusion protein. It is concluded that SM1044 can inhibit the proliferation of Kasumi-1 cells, induce cell apoptosis which may be related to the increased level of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3. SM1044 can also induce cell arrest in G(0)/G(1) phase. As the fusion protein AML1-ETO degrades obviously, it can be the potential target of SM1044 in Kasumi-1 cells.","['Liu, Jing-Jing', 'Fei, Ai-Mei', 'Nie, Rui-Min', 'Wang, Jin', 'Li, Ying', 'Wang, Zhen-Yi', 'Mi, Jian-Qing']","['Liu JJ', 'Fei AM', 'Nie RM', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Wang ZY', 'Mi JQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (SM1044)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Artemisinins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2012/01/20 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['1009-2137(2011)03-0607-05 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2011 Jun;19(3):607-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of FAK shRNA on leukemogenesis was studied in a murine model with leukemia. The apoptosis of leukemia cells and survival of leukemic mice treated by FAK shRNA combined with drug STI571 were monitored. The results showed that FAK gene expression was knocked down by lentiviral-FAK-shRNA. FAK gene silencing inhibited leukemia cell growth in vitro.

Receptor masking is thought to provide an earlier means of blocking superinfection, whereas receptor down regulation is generally considered to occur in chronically infected cells. RESULTS: We used replication-competent GFP-expressing viruses containing either an amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) or the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope. We also constructed similar viruses containing fluorescence-labeled Gag proteins for the detection of viral particles. Using this repertoire of reagents together with a wide range of antibodies, we were able to determine the presence and availability of viral receptors, and detect viral envelope proteins and particles presence on the cell surface of chronically infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: A-MLV or GALV receptors remain on the surface of chronically infected cells and are detectable by respective antibodies, indicating that these receptors are not downregulated in these infected cells as previously proposed. We were also able to detect viral envelope proteins on the infected cell surface and infected cells are unable to bind soluble A-MLV or GALV envelopes indicating that receptor binding sites are masked by endogenously expressed A-MLV or GALV viral envelope. However, receptor masking does not completely prevent A-MLV or GALV superinfection.","['Liu, Meihong', 'Eiden, Maribeth V']","['Liu M', 'Eiden MV']","['National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/growth & development/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*biosynthesis']",PMC3136417,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-53 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-53 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 Jul 5;8:53. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-53.,20110705,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a rare case of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia(CLL)-associated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with nephrotic-range proteinuria. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old Caucasian man, previously healthy, with no history of hypertension, alcohol use or smoking presented with rapid weight gain, massive peripheral oedema, and hypertension. Laboratory findings included a white blood cell count of 49,800 cells/mm3 with an absolute lymphocyte count of 47,000 cells/mm3, serum albumin of 2.3 g/dL, urea 65 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.5 mg/dL. A 24-hour urine collection contained 7.1 g protein and significant haematuria. A peripheral blood smear showed mature lymphocytosis and smudge cells. Diagnostic imaging showed mild paraaortic lymphadenopathy with no renal abnormalities. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine biopsy showed diffuse and focal infiltration with B-CLL lymphocytes. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed total sclerosis in 3/21(14%) of the glomeruli and focal and segmental solidification and sclerosis in 4/21 (19%) glomeruli. A regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab was successful in inducing remission of the CLL and clinical resolution of the nephritic-range proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary approach to monitor both the malignancy and the glomerular lesions is crucial for the optimal management of paraneoplastic glomerulonephritis. Although chemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab successfully treated CLL-associated nephrotic syndrome in our patient, further studies are required to confirm efficacy in this setting.","['Arampatzis, Spyridon', 'Giannakoulas, Nikolaos', 'Liakopoulos, Vassilios', 'Eleftheriadis, Theodoros', 'Kourti, Panagiota', 'Karasavvidou, Foteini', 'Matsouka, Panagiota', 'Stefanidis, Ioannis']","['Arampatzis S', 'Giannakoulas N', 'Liakopoulos V', 'Eleftheriadis T', 'Kourti P', 'Karasavvidou F', 'Matsouka P', 'Stefanidis I']","['Department of Nephrology, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece. spiros.arampatzis@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Nephrol,BMC nephrology,100967793,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/complications/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/administration & dosage', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",PMC3145560,,2011/07/07 06:00,2012/05/26 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/26 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2369-12-33 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2369-12-33 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Nephrol. 2011 Jul 5;12:33. doi: 10.1186/1471-2369-12-33.,20110705,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 Arampatzis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate frequency and severity of pulmonary complications in survivors of childhood leukemia and lymphoma treated with chemotherapy alone or combined with radiotherapy. Seventy cancer survivors of hematological malignancies were evaluated for pulmonary complications through history taking, chest examination, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest, and pulmonary function testing (PFTs). Although most survivors were not clinically compromised, the spectrum of impaired PFTs included obstructive pattern (14.3%), restrictive pattern (5.7%), and mixed pattern (20%). Significant pulmonary dysfunction was seen in children older than 10 years of age (P = .003), and in patients treated with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy (72.7%) compared with those treated with chemotherapy alone (25%) (P = .001). Cumulative dose of bleomycin was significantly associated with abnormal PFTs (P = .04). Multivariate analysis revealed methotrexate therapy as significant predictor of abnormal PFTs (P = .002). Male patients who received combined therapy showed higher frequency of restrictive, obstructive lung disease, abnormal respiratory reactance, and peripheral airway disease (P = .007, P = .04, P = .002, P = .003, P = .05, respectively). Those with abnormal CT findings (n = 14) had lower forced vital capacity (FVC%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)%), and peak expiratory flow (PEF%) when compared to cases with normal CT (P = .001, P < 0.001, P = .001, respectively). Subclinical pulmonary function abnormalities are found in survivors of childhood hematological malignancies previously treated and off therapy. Pulmonary dysfunction is more evident with combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy, bleomycin, and methotrexate are the most incriminated chemotherapeutic agents, and males are at higher risk than females; therefore a specific and extended follow-up is warranted.","['Tantawy, Azza Abdel Gawad', 'Elbarbary, Nancy', 'Ahmed, Asmaa', 'Mohamed, Nancy Abdraoaf', 'Ezz-Elarab, Sahar']","['Tantawy AA', 'Elbarbary N', 'Ahmed A', 'Mohamed NA', 'Ezz-Elarab S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. azazaghloul@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Forced Expiratory Volume', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Survivors', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Vital Capacity']",,,2011/07/07 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/07 06:00'],"['2011/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2011.576905 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Aug;28(5):403-17. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2011.576905.

Specifically, we investigated the antiproliferative properties of these new compounds on promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells by analyzing their effects on cell differentiation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. SR4 and SR9 were both cytotoxic to HL-60 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner, with IC(50) of 1.2 muM and 2.2 muM, respectively, after 72 h treatment. Both compounds strongly suppressed growth of HL-60 cells by promoting cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 transition, with concomitant decrease in protein levels of cyclins D1 and E2 and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK 2 and CDK 4), and increased protein expression of CDK inhibitors p21(WAF1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1). In addition, either compounds induce cell differentiation as detected by increased NBT staining and expression of CD11b and CD14. Treatment with SR compounds also promoted mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis as confirmed by Annexin V-FITC double staining, DNA fragmentation, increased expression of caspase 3, 7 and 9, cytochrome c release, PARP degradation, and collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(MT)). Collectively, these results provide evidence that SR4 and SR9 have the potential for the treatment of human leukemia and merit further investigation as therapeutic agents against other types of cancer.","['Figarola, James L', 'Weng, Yehua', 'Lincoln, Christopher', 'Horne, David', 'Rahbar, Samuel']","['Figarola JL', 'Weng Y', 'Lincoln C', 'Horne D', 'Rahbar S']","['Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA. jfigarola@coh.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",,,2011/07/06 06:00,2012/10/30 06:00,['2011/07/06 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10637-011-9711-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2012 Aug;30(4):1413-25. doi: 10.1007/s10637-011-9711-8.

Berbamine (a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid) has been widely used in Asian countries for managing leukopenia associated with chemotherapy. To investigate whether berbamine shows clinical benefit in reversing imatinib-associated neutropenia, we analyzed 63 chronic-phase CML patients who had developed grade >/=2 neutropenia and were treated with (n = 34, berbamine group) or without (n = 29, control group) berbamine. Among those patients with grade 2 neutropenia, five of 13 (38.5%) progressed to grade 3 neutropenia without berbamine support, while in the berbamine group, the rate decreased to 3/20 (15%) (p = 0.213). Although the rate of recovery from grade >/=3 neutropenia was similar in the two groups (94.1 vs. 90.5%, p = 0.559), berbamine markedly shortened the recovery time (median, 11 vs. 24 days, p = 0.006), and prevented recurrence of grade >/=3 neutropenia (18.8 vs. 52.6%, p = 0.039). Moreover, with berbamine support, the time to achieve complete cytogenetic response was significantly shorter (median, 6.5 vs. 10 months, p = 0.007). There were no severe adverse events associated with berbamine treatment. In conclusion, the present study reveals the potential clinical value of berbamine in the treatment of CML with imatinib-induced neutropenia. The use of berbamine may improve response to imatinib by stimulating normal hematopoiesis and faster neutropenia recovery.","['Zhao, Yanmin', 'Tan, Yamin', 'Wu, Gongqiang', 'Liu, Lizhen', 'Wang, Yingjia', 'Luo, Yi', 'Shi, Jimin', 'Huang, He']","['Zhao Y', 'Tan Y', 'Wu G', 'Liu L', 'Wang Y', 'Luo Y', 'Shi J', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, 310003, China. hehuang@medmail.com.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'V5KM4XJ0WM (berbamine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Benzamides', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*drug effects', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/06 06:00,2012/02/15 06:00,['2011/07/06 06:00'],"['2011/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-011-0887-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-011-0887-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2011 Aug;94(2):156-162. doi: 10.1007/s12185-011-0887-7.

OBJECTIVES: To study trends in HSCT activities in the World Health Organization-Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region surveyed by EMBMT between 2008 and 2009. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the survey data, mainly of the cumulative number of transplants, types of transplants (autologous vs. allogeneic), types of conditioning as myeloablative (MAC) vs. reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and trends in leukemias, hemoglobinopathies, SAA, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes amongst others. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fourteen teams from ten Eastern Mediterranean Region Organization (EMRO) countries reported their data (100% return rate) to the EMBMT for the years 2008-2009 with a total of 2608 first HSCT (1286 in 2008; 1322 in 2009). Allogeneic HSCT represented the majority (63%) in both years. The main indications for allogeneic HSCT were acute leukemias (732; 44%), bone marrow failure syndromes (331, 20%), hemoglobinopathies (255; 15%) and immune deficiencies (90; 5%). There was a progressive increase in the proportions of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases transplanted beyond the first chronic phase (3; 7% of all CML cases in 2008 vs 13; 29% in 2009). The main indications for autologous transplants were plasma cell disorders (345; 36%) Hodgkin disease (256; 27%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (207; 22%) and solid tumors (83; 9%). RIC continued to show a progressive increase over the years (7% in 2007, 11% in 2008 and 13% in 2009), yet remained relatively low compared to contemporary practices in Europe published by EBMT. The vast majority (95%) of allo-HSCT sources were from sibling donors with a continued dominance of peripheral blood (PB) (1076; 63%), while cord blood transplant (CBT) increased to 83 (5% of allo-HSCT), matched unrelated donor (MUD) remained underutilized (1; 0%) and there were no haploidentical transplants reported. Large centers with >50 HSCT/year showed a plateau of the total number of allo-HSCT over the last 5 years that may be related to capacity issues and needs further study. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: There is an overall increased rate of HSCT in the EMRO region with a significant increase in utilization of CBT and allogeneic PB-HSCT as a valuable source. However, further research on outcome data and development of regional donor banks (CB and MUD) may help facilitate future planning to satisfy the regional needs and increase collaboration within the group and globally.","['Mohamed, Said Yousef Ahmed', 'Fadhil, Ibtihal', 'Hamladji, Rose-Marie', 'Hamidieh, Amir Ali', 'Fahmy, Omar', 'Ladeb, Saloua', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran', 'Elhaddad, Alaa', 'Nacer, Redhouane Ahmed', 'Alsharif, Fahad', 'Rasheed, Walid', 'Jahani, Mohammad', 'Mousavi, Seyed Asadollah', 'Alseraihy, Amal', 'Abdel-Rahman, Fawzi', 'Al Jefri, Abdullah', 'Hussein, Ayad Ahmed', 'Alabdulaaly, Abdulaziz', 'Ibrahim, Ahmad', 'Bekadja, Mohamed-Amine', 'Abboud, Miguel', 'Ahmed, Parvez', 'Dennison, David', 'Bakr, Mohammad', 'Benchekroun, Said', 'Hussain, Fazal', 'Othman, Tarek Ben', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Ghavamzadeh, Ardeshir']","['Mohamed SY', 'Fadhil I', 'Hamladji RM', 'Hamidieh AA', 'Fahmy O', 'Ladeb S', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Elhaddad A', 'Nacer RA', 'Alsharif F', 'Rasheed W', 'Jahani M', 'Mousavi SA', 'Alseraihy A', 'Abdel-Rahman F', 'Al Jefri A', 'Hussein AA', 'Alabdulaaly A', 'Ibrahim A', 'Bekadja MA', 'Abboud M', 'Ahmed P', 'Dennison D', 'Bakr M', 'Benchekroun S', 'Hussain F', 'Othman TB', 'Aljurf M', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. saidyousuf@kfshrc.edu.sa']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther,Hematology/oncology and stem cell therapy,101468532,['Bone Marrow failure syndromes'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Aplastic', 'Bone Marrow Diseases', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hemoglobinopathies/therapy', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/therapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Mediterranean Region', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/statistics & numerical data']",,,2011/07/06 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['10.5144/1658-3876.2011.81 [pii]', '10.5144/1658-3876.2011.81 [doi]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Ther. 2011;4(2):81-93. doi: 10.5144/1658-3876.2011.81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the case of a young man who was treated with combined therapy of peginterferon alpha 2a and ribavirin for HCV while he was on maintenance anti-leukemic treatment. The patient required reduction in the dose of peginterferon alpha 2a and the addition of filgrastim due to neutropenia. Therapy for HCV was continued for 72 weeks and at the end of therapy, the patient had undetectable HCV RNA. The patient maintained a sustained viral response two years after the end of therapy and developed complete remission of leukemia, whereupon his anti-leukemic therapy was also discontinued.

The risk for cardiovascular disease after the procedure has not been well-described. OBJECTIVE: To compare rates and hazards of cardiovascular-related hospitalization and death among persons who were still alive at least 2 years after HSCT with those in a population-based sample. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Comprehensive cancer center. PATIENTS: 1491 patients who had survived 2 years or longer after HSCT received between 1985 and 2006, and frequency-matched persons who were randomly selected from drivers' license files in the state of Washington. MEASUREMENTS: Cardiovascular hospitalizations and death, as determined from statewide hospital discharge records and death registries in Washington. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, transplant recipients experienced increased cardiovascular death (adjusted incidence rate difference, 3.6 per 1000 person-years [95% CI, 1.7 to 5.5]). Recipients also had an increased cumulative incidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy or heart failure, stroke, vascular diseases, and rhythm disorders and an increased incidence of related conditions that predispose toward more serious cardiovascular disease (hypertension, renal disease, dyslipidemia, and diabetes). No consistent differences in hazards were observed after total-body irradiation or receipt of an allogeneic versus an autologous graft, aside from an increased rate of hypertension among recipients of allogeneic grafts. Disease relapse after transplantation was associated with an increased hazard of cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 2.3 [CI, 1.1 to 4.8]). LIMITATION: All patients received HSCT at a single institution, and no information was available on pretransplantation treatment and lifestyle factors that may influence risk for cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: Increased rates of cardiovascular disease should be taken into account when caring for patients who have received HSCT. Future efforts should be directed toward improved screening and controlling of factors that predispose toward cardiovascular disease.

Genetic alterations in the PTEN-PI3K-AKT pathway are also common in T-ALL. We generated a conditional zebrafish model of T-ALL in which 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) treatment induces MYC activation and disease, and withdrawal of 4HT results in T-ALL apoptosis and tumor regression. However, we found that loss-of-function mutations in zebrafish pten genes, or expression of a constitutively active Akt2 transgene, rendered tumors independent of the MYC oncogene and promoted disease progression after 4HT withdrawal. Moreover, MYC suppresses pten mRNA levels, suggesting that Akt pathway activation downstream of MYC promotes tumor progression. Our findings indicate that Akt pathway activation is sufficient for tumor maintenance in this model, even after loss of survival signals driven by the MYC oncogene.","['Gutierrez, Alejandro', 'Grebliunaite, Ruta', 'Feng, Hui', 'Kozakewich, Elena', 'Zhu, Shizhen', 'Guo, Feng', 'Payne, Elspeth', 'Mansour, Marc', 'Dahlberg, Suzanne E', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'den Hertog, Jeroen', 'Prochownik, Edward V', 'Testa, Joseph R', 'Harris, Marian', 'Kanki, John P', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Gutierrez A', 'Grebliunaite R', 'Feng H', 'Kozakewich E', 'Zhu S', 'Guo F', 'Payne E', 'Mansour M', 'Dahlberg SE', 'Neuberg DS', 'den Hertog J', 'Prochownik EV', 'Testa JR', 'Harris M', 'Kanki JP', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. alejandro_gutierrez@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['1K08CA133103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000005/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140624/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA133103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L40 CA124083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99CA134743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R00 CA134743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K99 CA134743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA133103-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA133103-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'L40 CA124083-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA133103-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 CA133103-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '17197F0KYM (afimoxifene)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cryoultramicrotomy', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Tamoxifen/analogs & derivatives', 'Zebrafish']",PMC3149218,,2011/07/06 06:00,2011/10/18 06:00,['2011/07/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20101691 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20101691 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2011 Aug 1;208(8):1595-603. doi: 10.1084/jem.20101691.

The complexes are relatively strong cytotoxic agents towards P-388 cell line. Comparative analysis was performed for all known copper(II) complexes containing methyl derivatives of the 4-nitropyridine N-oxide on the basis of their composition, structure and cytotoxic activities. To obtain the typical structure for these species (i.e., 4-coordinate mononuclear of the type trans-[Cu(inorganic anion)2L2]), two methyl groups must be situated on both sides of nitrogen atom(s) (i.e., NO and NO2) in the ligand. The biological activity was found to be strongly dependent upon the number of the methyl groups and the type of cell line. The best cytotoxic results were found for the complexes without substituents or with one methyl group.

Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are short non-coding RNA sequences, which regulate expression of genes at post-transcriptional level. The influence of LIF on miRNA expression in trophoblastic cells has not yet been analyzed and was focus of this investigation. METHOD OF STUDY: JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells have been stimulated with LIF for 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hr. The expression of miR-9, miR-141, miR-21, miR-93, and let-7 g has been analyzed by real-time PCR. Subsequently, miR-141 has been silenced and over-expressed to test its role in the proliferation of JEG-3 cells after 24 and 48 hr. RESULTS: MiR-141 has been significantly downregulated by more than 50% after LIF stimulation, while miR-21 and miR-93 expression has been significantly upregulated. Silencing of miR-141 completely inhibited the proliferation of JEG-3 cells, while over-expression had no effect. CONCLUSION: LIF regulates expression of miRNA in trophoblastic cells, which may be responsible for several functional effects induced by LIF.","['Morales-Prieto, Diana M', 'Schleussner, Ekkehard', 'Markert, Udo R']","['Morales-Prieto DM', 'Schleussner E', 'Markert UR']","['Klinik fur Frauenheilkunde und Geburtshilfe, Abteilung fur Geburtshilfe, Placenta-Labor, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (MIRN141 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Choriocarcinoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Trophoblasts/metabolism']",,,2011/07/08 06:00,2011/12/16 06:00,['2011/07/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01037.x [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 2011 Jul;66 Suppl 1:57-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.2011.01037.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,

The distribution of individual KIR genes in 197 B-CLL patients and 200 controls was similar, except for a tendency for lower frequencies of the KIR2DS3 and KIR2DL5 genes among B-CLL patients (26.9% vs 35.5%, P = 0.06, 46.2% vs 55.5%, P = 0.06). The associations between KIR2DS3 and B-CLL reached statistical significance in women (P = 0.05). Moreover, we found a trend toward a lower frequency of genotypes with the presence of five or six activating KIR genes in B-CLL patients compared to controls (20.8% vs 29.0%, P = 0.06), and a significantly higher frequency of individuals possessing genotypes with a prevalence of inhibitory over activating KIR genes (ratio < 0.71) among B-CLL patients (P = 0.04). The HLA-Bw4 specificity was significantly reduced among B-CLL patients (48.7% vs 63.0%, P = 0.005), which resulted from a decreased frequency of HLA-Bw4(Thr80) (21.6% vs 32.0%, P = 0.02). Moreover, among HLA-Bw4-positive individuals, progression-free survival (PFS) tended to be higher in the presence of KIR3DS1 (77% +/- 9% vs 39% +/- 13%, P = 0.07). However, in B-CLL patients, the presence of HLA-C2 was associated with decreased PFS (49% +/- 9% vs 75% +/- 7%, P = 0.02), and among HLA-C2-positive patients, the probability of PFS was significantly reduced in the absence of KIR2DS1 (34% +/- 11% vs 77% +/- 7%, P = 0.007). Our results indicate that the pattern of inhibitory/activating KIR genes, together with their HLA ligands, is associated with susceptibility to B-CLL and affects the clinical course of this disease.","['Karabon, L', 'Jedynak, A', 'Giebel, S', 'Wolowiec, D', 'Kielbinski, M', 'Woszczyk, D', 'Kapelko-Slowik, K', 'Kuliczkowski, K', 'Frydecka, I']","['Karabon L', 'Jedynak A', 'Giebel S', 'Wolowiec D', 'Kielbinski M', 'Woszczyk D', 'Kapelko-Slowik K', 'Kuliczkowski K', 'Frydecka I']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland. lkarabon@iitd.pan.wroc.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics']",,,2011/07/06 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/07/06 06:00'],"['2011/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.2011.01721.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 2011 Aug;78(2):129-38. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.2011.01721.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,

Most patients with PTCL have a poor outcome with conventional therapies and are not cured without stem-cell transplantation. Pralatrexate, a novel antifolate chemotherapeutic agent, was rationally designed to impede folate metabolism by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and to be more efficiently internalized into tumor cells. Pralatrexate is the first drug that is FDA approved for patients with relapsed and refractory PTCL. AREAS COVERED: Pralatrexate has been used as a single agent and in combination with other agents in clinical trials for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease as well as in solid tumors. This review will cover the development of pralatrexate, the pharmacokinetics of pralatrexate, preclinical findings with pralatrexate and clinical studies of pralatrexate in hematologic malignancies. EXPERT OPINION: Pralatrexate has significant activity in vitro, and in early Phase I/II trials, responses were noted in patients with aggressive T-cell lymphomas. The Pralatrexate in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma trial demonstrated the activity of pralatrexate across a spectrum of heavily pretreated patients with different aggressive T-cell lymphoma subtypes, and studies in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma have shown efficacy at different doses and schedules. The most frequent adverse events in these trials were mucositis, reversible thrombocytopenia and fatigue.","['Foss, Francine M']",['Foss FM'],"['Yale University School of Medicine, Lymphoma, Leukemia, and Myeloma Program, New Haven, CT 06520-8032, USA.

We analyzed the expression pattern of 5436 proteins in 45 different cell lines using hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis, and two-group comparisons for the identification of differentially expressed proteins. Our results show that immunohistochemically determined protein profiles can categorize cell lines into groups that overall reflect the tumor tissue of origin and that hematological cell lines appear to retain their protein profiles to a higher degree than cell lines established from solid tumors. The two-group comparisons reveal well-characterized proteins as well as previously unstudied proteins that could be of potential interest for further investigations. Moreover, multiple myeloma cells and cells of myeloid origin were found to share a protein profile, relative to the protein profile of lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma cells, possibly reflecting their common dependency of bone marrow microenvironment.

METHODS: The effect of berbamine on the KU812 cell growth was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Flow cytometry was used to profile cell cycle alteration upon berbamine treatment. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out to determine the transcripts of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptors (TbetaRs), Smad3, c-Myc, cyclin D1, p21(Cip1)(p21), and p27(Kip1)(p27). Changes in the protein levels of total Smad3, phosphorylated Smad3, the downstream targets of Smad3, and specific apoptosis-related factors were evaluated by Western blotting. RESULTS: Berbamine inhibited KU812 cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(5)(0)) values for treatments of 24, 48, and 72 h were 5.83, 3.43, and 0.75 mug/ml, respectively. Berbamine induced G(1) arrest as well as apoptosis in KU812 cells. Transcriptions of Smad3 and p21 were up-regulated, while those of TbetaRI, TbetaRII, c-Myc, cyclin D1 and p27 were not changed significantly. The protein levels of both total Smad3 and phosphorylated Smad3 were both up-regulated after berbamine treatment, together with decreased c-Myc and cyclin D1 and increased p21. Meanwhile, the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, were decreased, whereas pro-apoptotic Bax was increased. CONCLUSIONS: Berbamine suppresses KU812 cell proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest in G(1) and apoptosis. It activates Smad3 without additional stimulation of TGF-beta, and alters the levels of the Smad3 downstream targets, including c-Myc, cyclin D1 and p21. Our findings suggest that berbamine is a promising drug in the treatment of advanced stage patients with CML.","['Liang, Yun', 'Qiu, Xi', 'Xu, Rong-zhen', 'Zhao, Xiao-ying']","['Liang Y', 'Qiu X', 'Xu RZ', 'Zhao XY']","['Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,Journal of Zhejiang University.

Not much is known about the gene expression profile in ATRA-treated tongue cancer cells. We performed a genome-wide transcriptional profiling of ATRA-treated tongue cancer cells to understand the pathways that mediate ATRA action in tongue cancer. METHODS: We measured the effects of ATRA on the proliferation of SCC-9 human tongue carcinoma cells. The differential gene expression profile was measured by microarray analysis of untreated and ATRA-treated cells and expression of key genes was validated by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: ATRA treatment (24 and 48 hr) significantly inhibited SCC-9 cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. SCC-9 cells treated for 48 hr with ATRA showed upregulation of 276 genes, including ANGPTL4, GDF15, ICAM1 and TUSC4, and downregulation of 43 genes, including CXCL10. Validation by real-time PCR showed a significant upregulation of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and downregulation of CXCL10 and IL32. CONCLUSIONS: ATRA had an anti-tumor effect in tongue cancer cells. This effect is likely mediated via upregulation of ICAM1 and downregulation of CXCL10 and IL32.","['Dai, Yaohui', 'Wang, Juan', 'Xia, Juan', 'Hong, Yun', 'Chen, Na', 'Cheng, Bin']","['Dai Y', 'Wang J', 'Xia J', 'Hong Y', 'Chen N', 'Cheng B']","[""Department of Oral Medicine, Guanghua School of Stomatology and Institute of Stomatological Research, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CXCL10 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (IL32 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemokine CXCL10/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Linear Models', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Tongue Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jso.21998 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 2011 Dec;104(7):830-5. doi: 10.1002/jso.21998.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induction by P. mume in human cancer cells are poorly understood. In the present study, we conducted an investigation of the pro-apoptotic effects of an ethanol extract of P. mume (EEPM) in U937 human leukemia cells. Exposure to EEPM was found to result in a concentration-dependent growth inhibition by induction of apoptosis. Induction of apoptotic cell death of U937 cells by EEPM showed a correlation with the down-regulation of members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family, including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and survivin, and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, up-regulation of FasL, and cleavage of Bic. EEPM treatment induced proteolytic activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and degradation of caspase-3 substrate proteins, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and beta-catenin. In addition, apoptotic cell death induced by EEPM was significantly inhibited by z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3-specific inhibitor, which demonstrated the important role played by caspase-3 in the process. Taken together, these findings suggest that EEPM may be a potential chemotherapeutic agent for use in the control of human leukemia U937 cells and that further studies are needed for the identification of the active compounds.","['Park, Cheol', 'Jin, Cheng-Yun', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Jeong, Yong Kee', 'Kim, Wun-Jae', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Jin CY', 'Kim GY', 'Jeong YK', 'Kim WJ', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry and Research Institute of Oriental Medicine, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614-052, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Ethanol/chemistry', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Prunus/*chemistry', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/01/24 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2011.1363 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2011 Oct;26(4):987-93. doi: 10.3892/or.2011.1363.

Conventional chemotherapy (Arm A) consisted of six monthly courses of CHOP followed by six CHOP courses in every 3 months in those achieving a complete or PR. Arm A was compared with high-dose therapy with auto-SCT (Arm B), used as consolidation after three CHOP courses in case of CR or very good PR. A total of 86 patients were enrolled, of which 39 and 43 patients were evaluable in arm A and arm B, respectively. The primary endpoint was PFS. On an intent-to-treat basis and with a median follow-up time of 77.1 (range 1-135.5) months, the median PFS was 22 months in Arm A and 53 months in Arm B (P<0.0001).

Here, we report that when adherent onto fibronectin or osteoblast components, CD34(+)38(-)123(+) progenitors survive through an integrin-dependent activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) by serine 9-dephosphorylation. Strikingly, GSK3beta-mediated survival was restricted to leukemic progenitors from female patients. GSK3beta inhibition restored sensitivity to etoposide, and impaired the clonogenic capacities of adherent leukemic progenitors from female patients. In leukemic progenitors from female but not male patients, the scaffolding protein RACK1, activated downstream of alpha(5)beta(1)-integrin engagement, was specifically upregulated and controlled GSK3beta activation through the phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). In a mirrored manner, survival of adherent progenitors (CD34(+)38(-)) from male but not female healthy donors was partially dependent on this pathway. We conclude that the GSK3beta-dependent survival pathway might be sex-specific in normal immature population and flip-flopped upon leukemogenesis.

The x-ray repair cross complementing (XRCC3) protein also functions in HR-DNA-DSB repair pathway and directly interacts with and stabilizes RAD51 and the closely related RAD51C. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of the RAD51 and XRCC3 repair gene polymorphisms among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and to define their role in development of AML and its correlation with the clinical presentation, laboratory data as well as treatment outcome using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay in 50 de novo AML patients as well as 30 healthy subjects as a control group. Our study revealed that RAD51 G135C and XRCC3 Thr241Met alleles were associated with increased risk of AML with odds ratio (OR) of 2.833 and 2.909 and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.527 to 8.983 and 1.761 to 9.788, respectively. Moreover, when combining the 2 genes polymorphisms, a significant elevation of the risk of AML was found with OR of 3.124 and 95% CI of 1.872 to 11.243. As regards treatment outcome, a highly statistical significant difference was found between XRCC3 genotypes with P value of 0.001, whereas no significant difference was present between RAD51 genotypes with P value of 0.29. This clarifies that XRCC3 gene polymorphisms was found to have a significant impact on the risk of treatment failure with OR of 3.560 and 95% CI of 1.167 to 10.875; however, RAD51 gene polymorphism was not found to have an equivalent effect with OR of 2.813 and 95% CI of 0.933 to 10.828. So XRCC3 gene polymorphism might be considered as a prognostic marker in AML. In conclusion, RAD51 and XRCC3 genes polymorphisms may play an important role in the development of AML.","['Hamdy, Mona S', 'El-Haddad, Alaa M', 'Bahaa El-Din, Neveen M', 'Makhlouf, Manal Mohamed', 'Abdel-Hamid, Samah M']","['Hamdy MS', 'El-Haddad AM', 'Bahaa El-Din NM', 'Makhlouf MM', 'Abdel-Hamid SM']","['Department of Clinical and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, El-Kasr El-Aini Hospital, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (X-ray repair cross complementing protein 3)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RAD51 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Rad51 Recombinase/*genetics', 'Risk']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/03/27 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2310/JIM.0b013e3182281da3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Investig Med. 2011 Oct;59(7):1124-30. doi: 10.2310/JIM.0b013e3182281da3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quinacrine, a small molecule anti-malarial agent that has activity in giardiasis, lupus, prion disease, and used as a means of non-surgical sterilization, has shown cytotoxic activity across a broad range of cancers. Here, we evaluate the potential of adding quinacrine to anticancer chemotherapeutics and targeted agents as a potential novel combinatorial therapy for advanced colon cancer. We show that quinacrine synergizes with 5-fluorouracil and significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of sorafenib in a panel of 10 human colorectal cancer cell lines, including those with KRAS mutations protein gel blot analysis confirmed that quinacrine's anticancer activity partially arises from its ability to stabilize p53 and lower anti-apoptotic protein levels. In a series of in vivo studies, quinacrine monotherapy lowered the tumor load of nu/nu mice bearing human colorectal cancer xenografts. In combination, quinacrine and 5-Fluorouracil significantly delayed tumor growth of a variety of different xenografts, as compared to each agent administered alone. Our results suggest that the administration of quinacrine in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and targeted agents should be further explored in patients with recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic colorectal cancer.","['Gallant, Jean-Nicolas', 'Allen, Joshua E', 'Smith, Charles D', 'Dicker, David T', 'Wang, Wenge', 'Dolloff, Nathan G', 'Navaraj, Arunasalam', 'El-Deiry, Wafik S']","['Gallant JN', 'Allen JE', 'Smith CD', 'Dicker DT', 'Wang W', 'Dolloff NG', 'Navaraj A', 'El-Deiry WS']","['Laboratory of Translational Oncology and Experimental Cancer Therapeutics, Hematology/Oncology Division, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Quinacrine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['17034 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.12.3.17034 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 Aug 1;12(3):239-51. doi: 10.4161/cbt.12.3.17034.

We find that quinacrine stabilizes p53 and induces p53-dependent and independent cell death. Treatment by quinacrine alone at concentrations of 10-20 mM for 1-2 d cannot kill hepatocellular carcinoma cells, such as HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, which are also resistant to TRAIL. However, quinacrine renders these cells sensitive to treatment by TRAIL. Co-treatment of these cells with quinacrine and TRAIL induces overwhelming cell death within 3-4 h. Levels of DR5, a pro-apoptotic death receptor of TRAIL, are increased upon treatment with quinacrine, while levels of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, are decreased. While the synergistic effect of quinacrine with TRAIL appears to be in part independent of p53, knockdown of p53 in HepG2 cells by siRNA results in more cell death after treatment by quinacrine and TRAIL. The mechanism by which quinacrine sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to TRAIL and chemotherapies, and the potential for clinical application currently are being further explored. Lastly, quinacrine synergizes with chemotherapeutics, such as adriamycin, 5-FU, etoposide, CPT11, sorafenib, and gemcitabine, in killing hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and the drug enhances the activity of sorafenib to delay tumor growth in vivo.","['Wang, Wenge', 'Gallant, Jean-Nicolas', 'Katz, Sharyn I', 'Dolloff, Nathan G', 'Smith, Charles D', 'Abdulghani, Junaid', 'Allen, Joshua E', 'Dicker, David T', 'Hong, Bo', 'Navaraj, Arunasalam', 'El-Deiry, Wafik S']","['Wang W', 'Gallant JN', 'Katz SI', 'Dolloff NG', 'Smith CD', 'Abdulghani J', 'Allen JE', 'Dicker DT', 'Hong B', 'Navaraj A', 'El-Deiry WS']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzenesulfonates)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFRSF10A protein, human)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzenesulfonates/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Niacinamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Phenylurea Compounds', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Quinacrine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'Sorafenib', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/02/07 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['17033 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.12.3.17033 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2011 Aug 1;12(3):229-38. doi: 10.4161/cbt.12.3.17033.

These cases are usually not associated with hepatitis C virus infection. Of interest, the rearranged VH1-02 genes display similar complementarity determining regions 3, a finding confirmed by our study. The latter suggests that these SMZL may produce antibodies with similar reactivity. We produced recombinant antibodies from 5 SMZL cases with VH1-02 gene rearrangement to study the binding reactivity of these antibodies. Surprisingly, the recombinant antibodies demonstrated poly- and self-reactivity as demonstrated by their reactivity with nuclear, cytoplasmic, as well as membranous antigens expressed by human cells and by reactivity with human serum. This polyreactivity was specific as demonstrated by ELISA. The antibodies did not react with proteins on the cell surface that are induced by apoptosis as shown for antibodies produced by chronic lymphatic leukemia with VH1-02 gene rearrangement.

RUNX1 is a master regulatory gene in hematopoiesis and its disruption is one of the most common aberrations in acute leukemia. Inactivating or dominant-negative mutations in the RUNX1 gene have been also identified in pedigrees of familial platelet disorders with a variable propensity to develop acute myeloid leukemia (FPD/AML). We performed analysis of hematopoiesis from 2 FPD/AML pedigrees with 2 distinct RUNX1 germline mutations, that is, the R139X in a pedigree without AML and the R174Q mutation in a pedigree with AML. Both mutations induced a marked increase in the clonogenic potential of immature CD34(+)CD38(-) progenitors, with some self-renewal capacities observed only for R174Q mutation.

We demonstrated that NR4A3 was a direct target of RUNX1 and that restoration of NR4A3 expression partially reduced the clonogenic potential of patient progenitors.

Mutations in the PPPY motif are more deleterious for viral release than changes in the PTAP motif. Several reports have shown that the interaction of PPPY with the WW domains of a Nedd4 (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated-4) family ubiquitin ligase (UL) is a critical event in virus release. We tested nine members of the Nedd4 family ULs and found that ITCH is the main contributor to HTLV-1 budding. ITCH overexpression strongly inhibited release and infectivity of wild-type (wt) HTLV-1, but rescued the release of infectious virions with certain mutations in the PPPY motif. Electron microscopy showed either fewer or misshapen virus particles when wt HTLV-1 was produced in the presence of overexpressed ITCH, whereas mutants with changes in the PPPY motif yielded normal looking particles at wt level. The other ULs had significantly weaker or no effects on HTLV-1 release and infectivity except for SMURF-1, which caused enhanced release of wt and all PPPY(-) mutant particles. These particles were poorly infectious and showed abnormal morphology by electron microscopy. Budding and infectivity defects due to overexpression of ITCH and SMURF-1 were correlated with higher than normal ubiquitination of Gag. Only silencing of ITCH, but not of WWP1, WWP2, and Nedd4, resulted in a reduction of HTLV-1 budding from 293T cells. The binding efficiencies between the HTLV-1 LD and WW domains of different ULs as measured by mammalian two-hybrid interaction did not correlate with the strength of their effect on HTLV-1 budding.","['Dorjbal, Batsukh', 'Derse, David', 'Lloyd, Patricia', 'Soheilian, Ferri', 'Nagashima, Kunio', 'Heidecker, Gisela']","['Dorjbal B', 'Derse D', 'Lloyd P', 'Soheilian F', 'Nagashima K', 'Heidecker G']","['HIV-Drug Resistance Program, NCI Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (ITCH protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (Nedd4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (SMURF1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (WWP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.26 (WWP2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nedd4 Ubiquitin Protein Ligases', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*physiology', 'Ubiquitination', '*Virus Release']",PMC3173093,,2011/07/05 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)72219-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M111.259945 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Sep 9;286(36):31092-104. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111.259945.

We present a case of a 50-year-old man with low-burden chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had sudden reactivation of his leukemia triggered by influenza A (H1N1) infection with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. His rapid course was complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome with diffuse alveolar damage, a 6-fold rise in lymphocyte count, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and, ultimately, cardiac arrest. Major findings at autopsy included: bilateral H1N1 pneumonitis with diffuse alveolar damage, intra-alveolar pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary microthromboemboli, pulmonary hemorrhagic infarction, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in multiple locations, and diffuse chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a serious and often fatal condition, which may be primary or secondary. It may be associated with high-grade lymphoproliferative malignancies, especially in patients with therapy-related leukocytopenia, but only rarely is it seen in uncomplicated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis may be triggered by a variety of infections (viral, fungal, bacterial and parasitic), but H1N1 influenza A-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is often rapidly fatal, especially in children. This adult patient's clinical presentation with low tumor burden and leukocytosis is thus unique.

Here, we discuss the potential for developing targeted therapies for NPM1-mutated AML with focus on: (i) interfering with the abnormal traffic of the NPM1 leukemic mutant, i.e., its cytoplasmic dislocation; (ii) disrupting the nucleolar structure/function by interfering with residual wild-type nucleophosmin and other nucleolar components acting as hub proteins; and (iii) evaluating the activity of epigenetic drugs (e.g., 5-azacytidine) or agents acting on differentiation and apoptosis.

Current clinical guidelines recommend the use of molecular testing of BCR-ABL transcript levels by quantitative real-time transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) every 3 to 6 months. However, qRT-PCR methods have not yet been standardized, particularly in the United States, where most patients are initially treated outside of academic practices. The lack of standard methods for molecular monitoring has resulted in the failure to follow National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European LeukemiaNet guideline recommendations and in the misinterpretation of test results. Standardization of molecular monitoring methods and adherence to guideline recommendations are important for optimal patient management. In this article, we provide an update on the current clinical trial results by using the molecular technique to monitor patient response. Current problems and efforts in standardizing the qRT-PCR technique and reporting are reviewed. We provide examples of potential problems of various reference laboratory reports and present recommendations for assessing molecular test results. These recommendations seem particularly important because nilotinib and dasatinib appear to have improved the molecular response in the initial treatment of CML.","['Akard, Luke P', 'Wang, Y Lynn']","['Akard LP', 'Wang YL']","['Indiana Blood and Marrow Transplantation and St Francis Hospital and Health Centers, Indianapolis, USA. lakard@ibmtindy.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring/methods/*standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/methods/*standards', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2010/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00025-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.01.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Oct;11(5):385-95. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.01.001.

CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) methylation is a favorable prognostic biomarker for acute myeloid leukemia; however, rather than the complete methylation observed in inherited disorders, CEBPA methylation is heterogeneous. In this study, we established an algorithm called the ""methylation index,"" deduced from high-resolution melting profiles, which includes Tm shifting (DeltaTm) and Tm width ratio (fold of width), to evaluate the heterogeneous methylation status. The methylation index was highly correlated with the exact methylation levels detected by using the MassARRAY method (R(2) = 0.80; P < 0.001). Within-run reproducibility for the methylation index was 0.9% as the coefficient of variation, and between-run reproducibility was 2.6%. It was determined that with a cutoff methylation index of 1.412, the best measures of sensitivity and specificity could be obtained (97.14% and 95.89%, respectively) to discern low or high CEBPA methylation status. This novel algorithm for calculation of the methylation index from high-resolution melting profiles for CEBPA methylation is compatible with measurement of the methylation level as assayed using MassARRAY and could be a simple and efficient screening method for determination of CEBPA methylation status in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Lin, Tsung-Chin', 'Jiang, Sin-Sien', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Lin, Yu-Min', 'Chang, Chia-Ling', 'Hsu, Cherng-An', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Lin, Liang-In']","['Lin TC', 'Jiang SS', 'Chou WC', 'Hou HA', 'Lin YM', 'Chang CL', 'Hsu CA', 'Tien HF', 'Lin LI']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation/*genetics', 'Transition Temperature']",PMC3157619,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2010/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-1578(11)00148-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmoldx.2011.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2011 Sep;13(5):514-9. doi: 10.1016/j.jmoldx.2011.05.002.

To identify other alterations at the RNA and DNA levels associated with 6-MP- and 6-TG resistance, we compared here the patterns of gene expression and DNA copy number profiles of resistant sublines to those of the parental wild-type cells. The mRNA levels for two nucleoside transporters were down-regulated in both of the thiopurine-resistant sublines. Moreover, both of these cell lines expressed genes encoding the enzymes of purine nucleotide composition and synthesis, including adenylate kinase 3-like 1 and guanosine monophosphate synthetase at significantly lower levels than wild-type cells. In addition, expression of the mRNA for a specialized DNA polymerase, human terminal transferase encoded by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (DNTT) gene, was 122- and 93-fold higher in 6-TG- and 6-MP-resistant cells, respectively.

HMBA has been shown in the past to induce terminal differentiation in multiple leukemia types at a concentration of 2-5mM, but its phase I and II clinical trials were largely unsuccessful due to serious side effects (notably, thrombocytopenia) with dose escalation. In this work, a sensitive and simple LC-MS/MS method for direct determination of HMBA in mouse and human plasma is described. Plasma samples were prepared by deproteinization with acetonitrile. Separation was achieved on a Waters Atlantis((R)) T3 (2.1 mm x 50 mm, 3 mum) column with retention times of 2.2 and 3.7 min for HMBA and 7MBA (internal standard), respectively. The quantitation was carried out by tandem mass spectrometry using positive MRM mode. The linear range of the method was 0.500-100 ng/mL in both mouse and human plasma with injection volume of 5 muL.

Although there are extensive genetic data implicating TET2 mutations in myeloid transformation, the consequences of Tet2 loss in hematopoietic development have not been delineated. We report here an animal model of conditional Tet2 loss in the hematopoietic compartment that leads to increased stem cell self-renewal in vivo as assessed by competitive transplant assays. Tet2 loss leads to a progressive enlargement of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment and eventual myeloproliferation in vivo, including splenomegaly, monocytosis, and extramedullary hematopoiesis. In addition, Tet2(+/-) mice also displayed increased stem cell self-renewal and extramedullary hematopoiesis, suggesting that Tet2 haploinsufficiency contributes to hematopoietic transformation in vivo.","['Moran-Crusio, Kelly', 'Reavie, Linsey', 'Shih, Alan', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Ndiaye-Lobry, Delphine', 'Lobry, Camille', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Vasanthakumar, Aparna', 'Patel, Jay', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Perna, Fabiana', 'Pandey, Suveg', 'Madzo, Jozef', 'Song, Chunxiao', 'Dai, Qing', 'He, Chuan', 'Ibrahim, Sherif', 'Beran, Miloslav', 'Zavadil, Jiri', 'Nimer, Stephen D', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Aifantis, Iannis', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Moran-Crusio K', 'Reavie L', 'Shih A', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Ndiaye-Lobry D', 'Lobry C', 'Figueroa ME', 'Vasanthakumar A', 'Patel J', 'Zhao X', 'Perna F', 'Pandey S', 'Madzo J', 'Song C', 'Dai Q', 'He C', 'Ibrahim S', 'Beran M', 'Zavadil J', 'Nimer SD', 'Melnick A', 'Godley LA', 'Aifantis I', 'Levine RL']","['Department of Pathology, NYU Cancer Institute, New York University School of Medicine, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['F31 AG039991/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'F31-AG039991/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA143798/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016087-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5 P30CA16087-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA133379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129831/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30CA16087-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21CA141399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129831-03S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133379-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA138234-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM088847/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138234/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA143798-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM088847/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149655-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Haploinsufficiency/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*deficiency/metabolism']",PMC3194039,['NIHMS312230'],2011/07/05 06:00,2011/09/08 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S1535-6108(11)00222-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2011.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2011 Jul 12;20(1):11-24. doi: 10.1016/j.ccr.2011.06.001.

Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), the feline analogue to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), are reported to be at increased incidence of neoplasia. This review highlights reported risk factors and tumor cell phenotypes associated with neoplasias arising in FIV-infected animals, differences in oncogenic disease in natural versus experimental FIV infections, and similarities between FIV- and HIV-related malignancies. The most common type of FIV-associated neoplasm reported in the literature is lymphoma, specifically of B-cell origin, with experimentally infected cats developing neoplastic lesions at an earlier age than their naturally infected cohorts. The mechanism of FIV-induced lymphoma has not been completely ascertained, though the majority of published studies addressing this issue suggest oncogenesis arises via indirect mechanisms. HIV-infected individuals have increased risk of neoplasia, specifically B cell lymphoma, in comparison with uninfected individuals. Additional similarities between FIV- and HIV-associated neoplasms include the presence of extranodal lymphoma, a synergism with other oncogenic viruses, and an apparent indirect mechanism of induced oncogenesis. This literature supports study of FIV-associated neoplasms to further characterize this lentiviral-neoplasia association for the benefit of both human and animal disease, and to advance our general knowledge of mechanisms for viral-induced oncogenesis.","['Magden, Elizabeth', 'Quackenbush, Sandra L', 'VandeWoude, Sue']","['Magden E', 'Quackenbush SL', 'VandeWoude S']","['Colorado State University, Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Pathology, 1619 Campus Delivery, Fort Collins, CO 80523, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*virology', 'Cats', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Lentivirus Infections/complications/*veterinary/virology', 'Leukemia/*veterinary/virology', 'Lions/virology', 'Lymphoma/*veterinary/virology']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(11)00213-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2011 Oct 15;143(3-4):227-34. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.016.

This process is regulated by soluble cytokines binding to a ligand specific cell surface receptor on a precursor cell. Key to signal transduction are tyrosine kinase proteins which can be divided into two sub families, the receptor protein tyrosine kinases which are transmembrane receptors and retain an intact catalytic kinase domain and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases which bind to cytokine receptors. Abnormalities of tyrosine kinase proteins are well recognised in myeloid malignancies, mutation in the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase JAK2 (V617F) is key in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms, and translocations involving ABL key in the development of chronic myeloid leukaemia. However tyrosine kinase mutations are increasingly recognised to play a role in the pathogenesis of a wider range of haematological cancers. This review focuses on the role of deregulated tyrosine kinase genes either as part of novel fusion proteins involving FGFR1, PDGFRalpha, PDGFRbeta, JAK2 and ABL, or as a consequence of point mutation in JAK1 or JAK2 in the development of precursor T and B lymphoid malignancies or mixed myeloid/lymphoid disorders.

They are negative for CD10, CD14, CD16, CD56, CD64, and HLA-DR. Mature monocytes are positive for CD11b, CD11c, CD13, CD14, CD33, and CD64, and may express CD2 and CD4. Blasts in acute myeloid leukemias (AML) with minimal differentiation have low SSC and moderate CD45 expression and are positive for CD34, CD117, CD13, HLA-DR, and CD33 and may be positive for TdT, CD4, and CD11c.

Association between IL-2 and its receptor (IL-2R), triggers activation of complex signaling cascade governed by tyrosine phosphorylation that culminates in transcription of genes involved in modulation of the immune response. The complete characterization of the IL-2 pathway is essential to understand how aberrant IL-2 signaling results in several diseases such as cancer or autoimmunity and also how IL-2 treatments affect cancer patients. To gain insights into the downstream machinery activated by IL-2, we aimed to define the global tyrosine-phosphoproteome of IL-2 pathway in human T cell line Kit225 using high resolution mass spectrometry combined with phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and SILAC. The molecular snapshot at 5min of IL-2 stimulation resulted in identification of 172 proteins among which 79 were found with increased abundance in the tyrosine-phosphorylated complexes, including several previously not reported IL-2 downstream effectors. Combinatorial site-specific phosphoproteomic analysis resulted in identification of 99 phosphorylated sites mapping to the identified proteins with increased abundance in the tyrosine-phosphorylated complexes, of which 34 were not previously described.

With the development of novel drugs and treatment protocols adapted for specific individual patients, a simple diagnostic tool for following patients' responses on a daily basis is required. In the present clinical study, we have investigated the usefulness of Fourier transform infrared microscopy (FTIR-MSP) for pre-screening and follow-up of leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from leukemia patients before and during treatment as well as from patients with high fever and healthy subjects which served as control groups. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and their spectra obtained using FTIR-MSP. The presence of blasts in bone marrow and other diagnostic and prognostic clinical parameters were determined during follow-up up to 1000 days. RESULTS: Leukemia was efficiently indicated by a reduced lipids and elevated DNA absorption of PBMC together with additional characteristic spectral bands. These diagnostic markers were used for monitoring the biochemical changes in PBMCs during chemotherapy. The trends of several markers were found to be in agreement with blast percentage as determined by flow cytometry. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal the utility of FTIR-MSP for leukemia pre-screening independently of symptoms common to leukemia. Furthermore, FTIR-MSP supplies precursor indication regarding patient response to treatment compared to current methods. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This preliminary study shows a great potential of FTIR-MSP as a complementary tool for childhood leukemia pre-screening and follow-up which may allow faster response to critical problems arise during treatment.","['Zelig, Udi', 'Mordechai, Shaul', 'Shubinsky, George', 'Sahu, Ranjit Kumar', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud', 'Leibovitz, Eugene', 'Nathan, Ilana', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph']","['Zelig U', 'Mordechai S', 'Shubinsky G', 'Sahu RK', 'Huleihel M', 'Leibovitz E', 'Nathan I', 'Kapelushnik J']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/blood/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Microspectrophotometry/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/methods']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2011/09/20 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['S0304-4165(11)00137-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.06.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2011 Sep;1810(9):827-35. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagen.2011.06.010.

The host kinase, CK2, has been shown or is predicted to modify several HSV-1 proteins and has been proposed to affect one or more steps in the viral life cycle. Furthermore, potential cellular and viral substrates of CK2 are involved in antiviral pathways and viral counter-defenses, respectively, suggesting that CK2 regulates these processes. Consequently, we tested whether pharmacological inhibitors of CK2 impaired HSV-1 replication, either alone or in combination with the cellular antiviral factor, interferon-beta (IFN-beta). Our results indicate that the use of CK2 inhibitors results in a minor reduction in HSV-1 replication but enhanced the inhibitory effect of IFN-beta on replication. This effect was dependent on the HSV-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, infected cell protein 0 (ICP0), which impairs several host antiviral responses, including that produced by IFN-beta. Inhibitors of CK2 did not, however, impede the ability of ICP0 to induce the degradation of two cellular targets: the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Notably, this effect was only apparent for HSV-1, as the CK2 inhibitors did not enhance the antiviral effect of IFN-beta on either vesicular stomatitis virus or adenovirus type 5. Thus, our data suggest that the activity of CK2 is required for an early function during viral infection that assists the growth of HSV-1 in IFN-beta-treated cells.","['Smith, Miles C', 'Bayless, Adam M', 'Goddard, Erica T', 'Davido, David J']","['Smith MC', 'Bayless AM', 'Goddard ET', 'Davido DJ']","['Department of Molecular Biosciences, University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI072357-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI72357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI072357/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016475/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016475-10/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/drug effects/physiology', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Casein Kinase II/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Herpes Simplex/drug therapy/*enzymology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*drug effects/physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Lung/cytology/drug effects', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/metabolism', 'Vesiculovirus/drug effects/physiology', 'Virus Replication/*drug effects']",PMC3159797,['NIHMS306257'],2011/07/05 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0166-3542(11)00351-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.06.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 2011 Sep;91(3):259-66. doi: 10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.06.009.

Herein we report a case of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that presented with jaundice in an adult. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old Hispanic man presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and jaundice. His initial blood work revealed pancytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia. Direct bilirubin was more than 50% of the total. His imaging studies were unremarkable except for hepatomegaly. All blood screening tests for various hepatocellular etiologies were normal. A diagnosis of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was made upon liver biopsy. It also showed lymphocytic infiltration of the hepatic parenchyma leading to bile stasis. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed upon bone marrow biopsy. The patient was treated with a hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone regimen. CONCLUSION: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia should be one of the differential diagnoses that should be considered when initial work-up for jaundice is inconclusive. Some cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia have been reported in both adults and children to have presented with the initial manifestation of jaundice, but only a few had no radiographic evidence of biliary obstruction. Such presentation can pose a serious diagnostic dilemma for clinicians. This manuscript attempts to highlight it. Moreover, we believe that if acute lymphoblastic leukemia presentations similar to this case continue to be reported in adults or children, a specific immunophenotypic expression and cytogenetic abnormality may be found to be associated with hepatic infiltration by leukemia. This may substantially contribute to the further understanding of the pathophysiology of this hematologic disease.","['Siddique, Muhammad N', 'Popalzai, Muhammad', 'Aoun, Nelly', 'Maroun, Rabih', 'Awasum, Michael', 'Dai, Qun']","['Siddique MN', 'Popalzai M', 'Aoun N', 'Maroun R', 'Awasum M', 'Dai Q']","['Department of Medicine, Staten Island University Hospital, 475 Seaview Avenue, Staten Island, NY 10305, USA. mnaumansiddique@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC3141714,,2011/07/05 06:00,2011/07/05 06:01,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2010/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/05 06:01 [medline]']","['1752-1947-5-269 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-5-269 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2011 Jul 1;5:269. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-5-269.,20110701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the roles of AKT1 and AKT2 in NSCLC cells using RNAi. The siRNA targeting of AKT1 or AKT2 effectively decreased protein levels of AKT1 and AKT2, respectively, in A549 and H460 cells. Cisplatin treatment of these cells increased apoptotic cell death compared with control. The siRNA-induced knockdown of AKT1 in H460 cells significantly decreased basal MEK ERK1 2 activity, resulting in nuclear factor-kappaB activation, whereas knockdown of AKT2 resulted in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein MCL-1 (MCL-1) cleavage, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and activation of the caspase cascade. Consequently, both siRNA treatments enhanced the chemosensitivity of H460 cells to cisplatin. However, neither AKT1 nor AKT2 siRNA treatment had any effect of p27 expression, and although both treatments tended to induced G(2) M phase arrest, the effect was not statistically significant. Treatment with AKT1 siRNA markedly decreased colony formation growth and migration, but AKT2 siRNA had no significant effects on these parameters. These data suggest that AKT1 and AKT2 both contribute to cell survival, albeit via different mechanisms, and that the effects on cell growth and migration are predominantly regulated by AKT1. These findings may aid in refining targeted strategies for the inhibition of AKT isoforms towards the sensitization of NSCLC cells to therapeutic agents.","['Lee, Myoung W', 'Kim, Dae S', 'Lee, Joo H', 'Lee, Bum S', 'Lee, Soo H', 'Jung, Hye L', 'Sung, Ki W', 'Kim, Heung T', 'Yoo, Keon H', 'Koo, Hong H']","['Lee MW', 'Kim DS', 'Lee JH', 'Lee BS', 'Lee SH', 'Jung HL', 'Sung KW', 'Kim HT', 'Yoo KH', 'Koo HH']","['Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (p27 antigen)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Caspases/biosynthesis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02025.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2011 Oct;102(10):1822-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2011.02025.x.

We revisited the morphological and immunohistochemical features (CD20, CD34, TdT and PAX5 expression) in 69 BMTB from 62 patients - 27 with excess haematogones; seven with residual B-ALL after therapy; 18 with no reported excess of haematogones or residual acute leukaemia on BMTB; and 17 diagnostic samples of B-ALL. The distinctive immunophenotypic pattern of BMTB with excess haematogones was of CD34, TdT, CD20 and PAX5 accounting for increasing proportions of cells in the order mentioned, whereas among B-ALL, the immunohistochemical pattern was of CD20, PAX5 and TdT accounting for an equal proportion of cells. Furthermore, among haematogones, the intensity of CD20 expression was extremely heterogeneous as compared to the neoplastic cells in CD20-positive B-ALL. The TdT-positive haematogones were generally small and uniform, while a certain degree of heterogeneity was noticed among neoplastic B-ALL cells. This study provides a practical strategy to distinguish haematogones from B-ALL cells in BMTB.","['Al-Shieban, Saeed', 'Byrne, Elizabeth', 'Trivedi, Pritesh', 'Morilla, Ricardo', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Naresh, Kikkeri N']","['Al-Shieban S', 'Byrne E', 'Trivedi P', 'Morilla R', 'Matutes E', 'Naresh KN']","['Department of Histopathology, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, & Imperial College London, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08760.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2011 Aug;154(4):466-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2011.08760.x.

However, a third of patients do not achieve the desired effect and must be considered resistant. One of the early strategies to overcome initial resistance was the use of high doses (600 - 800 mg) of imatinib: before the advent of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, some standard-dose-resistant patients gained benefits from the use of dose-escalation imatinib. Intensification with higher doses of the drug was used in newly diagnosed patients with the aim to improve cytogenetic and molecular responses. AREAS COVERED: In this article, the authors review data of several trials testing high-dose imatinib after resistance to standard dose. Literature about high-dose imatinib used front-line as single treatment or with different combinations is also examined. A literature search for relevant studies was undertaken mainly in PubMed or through published conference abstracts. The aim of this review is to summarize the efficacy and safety of this option either as front-line or as a rescue therapy in chronic-phase CML patients and to discuss the future role of this treatment modality. EXPERT OPINION: Literature evidence supports the fact that high-dose imatinib can induce sustained responses in a subset of patients with cytogenetic failure or acquired resistance, but it seems less effective in patients with haematological failure or in molecular suboptimal responders. In newly diagnosed patients, high-dose imatinib produced increased response rates, which in some instances were not significant compared with standard dose.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Alimena G']","['Sapienza University, Department of Human Biotechnologies and Hematology, Via Benevento 6, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2011.597741 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2011 Sep;12(13):2075-87. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2011.597741.

We evaluated whether a scoring system based on the expression of CDS, CD23, FMC7, CD79b and surface immunoglobulin (Slg) could be utilized to distinguish CLL from other types of lymphoid neoplasms in the Thais. MATERIAL AND METHOD: One-hundred and forty-five samples with a clinical suspicion for CLL were analysed by flow cytometry. A score of one was assigned if the following marker was identified: CD5+, CD23+, FMC7-, CD79b- and SIg(-/weak). A cut-off score of > or =3 was required for the definitive diagnosis of B-CLL. RESULTS: Only 50 cases (34.5%) were confirmed as B-CLL (scores > or =3). Cases with scores > or =3 had significantly higher leukocyte counts and marrow/blood lymphocytes than cases with scores < or =2. Dual CD5/CD23 expression was found in 87.5% of CLL cases. In 81 cases with scores < or =2, a variety of non-CLL disorders predominated, such as marginal zone lymphoma, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, mantle cell lymphoma, and prolymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: A score of 3 and dual CD5/CD23 expression are essential for the diagnosis of CLL while a score of 2 mostly indicative of non-CLL. The majority of clinical cases of CLL turned out to be non-CLL by flow cytometry. Increased utilization of this scoring system should increase the accuracy of diagnosis of this rare type of leukemia in the Thai population.","['Promsuwicha, Orathai', 'Songmuang, Wayuree', 'Auewarakul, Chiray U']","['Promsuwicha O', 'Songmuang W', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MS4A1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Asians', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thailand', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/05 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/07/05 06:00'],"['2011/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2011 Feb;94 Suppl 1:S232-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared neuropsychological outcomes in children treated for Standard Risk (SR) or HR ALL on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) Consortium ALL Protocol 95-01. We also evaluated their performance relative to normative expectations. PROCEDURE: Between 1996 and 2000, 498 children with newly diagnosed ALL were treated on Protocol 95-01, 298 of whom were eligible for neuropsychological follow-up. A feature of this protocol was modification of risk group criteria to treat more children as SR rather than HR patients, intended to minimize toxicities. Testing was completed at a median of 5.3 years post-diagnosis for 211 patients (70.8%; ages 6-25 years; 45.5% male; 40% HR), all of whom were in continuous complete remission. RESULTS: Test scores for both groups were generally at or above normative expectation, with the exception of verbal working memory, processing complex visual information, and parent ratings of metacognitive skills. After adjusting for covariates, the SR group performed better on measures of IQ and academic achievement, working memory and visual learning. Effect sizes, however, were only in the small to moderate range. CONCLUSIONS: HR patients exhibited neuropsychological deficits relative to SR patients, though the differences were modest in degree. Modification of the risk group criteria to treat more children on the SR protocol therefore likely afforded some benefit in terms of neurocognitive late effects.","['Waber, Deborah P', 'Queally, Jennifer Turek', 'Catania, Lori', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Romero, Ivonne', 'Adams, Heather', 'Alyman, Cheryl', 'Jandet-Brunet, Christine', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Waber DP', 'Queally JT', 'Catania L', 'Robaey P', 'Romero I', 'Adams H', 'Alyman C', 'Jandet-Brunet C', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']","[""Division of Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. deborah.waber@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA068484-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD018655/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR024160/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '2 P01 CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-HD18655/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cognition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk']",PMC3189432,['NIHMS298267'],2011/07/02 06:00,2012/04/24 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/04/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23234 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 May;58(5):758-65. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23234.

The thermal stability of plasma proteome has been described previously as a method of producing a disease-specific ""signature,"" termed thermogram, in several neoplastic and autoimmune diseases. We describe the preliminary use of DSC performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a diagnostic tool for the identification of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Samples of CSF from nine patients with confirmed GBM were evaluated using DSC, and the thermogram signatures evaluated. These thermograms were compared with thermograms of CSF taken from patients with non-neoplastic conditions such as head trauma, hydrocephalus, or CSF leak. Further analysis was also performed on CSF from patients who had non-GBM neoplastic conditions such as carcinomatosis meningitis or central nervous system lymphoma or leukemia. The DSC thermograms of CSF of the patients with GBM were significantly different when compared with other neoplastic and non-neoplastic cases. The melting temperature of the major transition was shifted by 5 degrees C, which makes it easily distinguishable from control cases. Our results are very preliminary, but it appears that the DSC of CSF has potential utility in diagnostics and monitoring disease progression in GBM patients.","['Chagovetz, Alexis A', 'Jensen, Randy L', 'Recht, Larry', 'Glantz, Michael', 'Chagovetz, Alexander M']","['Chagovetz AA', 'Jensen RL', 'Recht L', 'Glantz M', 'Chagovetz AM']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.']",['eng'],['5R44GM084603-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Calorimetry, Differential Scanning', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/*chemistry', 'Glioblastoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis', 'Humans']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/03/09 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2010/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11060-011-0630-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2011 Dec;105(3):499-506. doi: 10.1007/s11060-011-0630-5.

ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which induce the differentiation of HL-60 and NB4 (two human acute myeloid leukemia cell lines) to myelocytic lineage, up-regulated these two enzymes with various degrees at 2 and 72 h of treatment. In HL-60 cells treated with ATRA, the increase of beta3GnT-8 was more than beta3GnT-2, while in NB4 cells treated with DMSO, the increase of beta3GnT-2 was more than beta3GnT-8. However, when HL-60 and NB4 were differentiated to monocytic lineage induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate the expressions of beta3GnT-2 and beta3GnT-8 showed no alterations or the increase of expressions was far less than those in myelocytic differentiation. By means of FITC-labeled tomato lectin affinity staining and flow-cytometry, it was found that the product of beta3GnT-2 and -8, polyLacNAc was also increased on the cell surface of HL-60 and NB4 treated with ATRA or DMSO, but unchanged when treated with PMA. These results were in accordance with the up-regulation of the mRNAs of beta3GnT-2 and -8. The expression of beta3GnT-5, however, was not changed both in myelocytic and monocytic differentiations. The difference in the up-regulation of beta3GnT-2 and -8, especially their products may become a useful index to discriminate the myelocytic and monocytic differentiation of leukemia cells.","['Qiu, Hao', 'Wu, Shi-Liang', 'Guo, Xiang-Hong', 'Shen, Hong-Jie', 'Zhang, Huan-Ping', 'Chen, Hui Li']","['Qiu H', 'Wu SL', 'Guo XH', 'Shen HJ', 'Zhang HP', 'Chen HL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical School of Soochow University, Suzhou 215123, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Polysaccharides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82441-98-3 (poly-N-acetyllactosamine)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-011-0928-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2011 Dec;358(1-2):131-9. doi: 10.1007/s11010-011-0928-9.

In order to characterize this rare entity, we performed phenotypic and genetic characterization of SET-NUP214 rearrangement through an investigation of a series of 40 consecutive samples of adult T-ALL that was selected among 229 adult ALL cases during 4 years in a single institution. Four cases (10%) of SET-NUP214 translocation were identified in our study. In all cases, diagnosis of T-ALL was established according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, and clonal TCR rearrangements were found. The immunophenotypic markers were indicative of the precursor nature of T lymphoblasts, and they expressed one or both of the myeloid-associated antigens (CD13, CD33). Conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed complex chromosomal aberrations in all four SET-NUP214 rearranged cases and del(12)(p13)/ETV6 was frequently involved. Array-CGH demonstrated additional genomic imbalances in addition to deletion 9q34. The genomic breakpoint sequencing identified breakpoints at SET intron 7 and NUP214 intron 17, and random nucleotide addition was found in two cases at the site of rearrangement. Our independently derived data set from a single institution confirms previous findings of SET-NUP214 rearrangement, indicates the relatively high incidence of SET-NUP214 rearrangement in adult T-ALLs, and also demonstrates comprehensive clinical, phenotypic, and genetic characteristics of this entity. Also, our report on genomic breakpoints demonstrates the homogeneity in the localization of the genomic breakpoints at 9q34. Concurrent chromosomal aberrations identified in this study should provide further areas of interest in investigation of SET-NUP214-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Chae, Hyojin', 'Lim, Jihyang', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Park, Joonhong', 'Kim, Yonggoo', 'Han, Kyungja', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Woo Sung']","['Chae H', 'Lim J', 'Kim M', 'Park J', 'Kim Y', 'Han K', 'Lee S', 'Min WS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (SET protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/immunology', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/methods', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone Chaperones/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/*pathology/*physiopathology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1289-x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Feb;91(2):193-201. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1289-x.

By using Western blotting, qRT-PCR, Annexin V and immunofluorescence assays we have demonstrated a relationship between Pgp and survivin in a prior sensitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line (K562). A high dose of vincristine induced a concomitant overexpression of Pgp and survivin, which was associated with a low apoptotic index in the K562 cell line. In addition, we observed a cytoplasmic co-localization of Pgp and survivin, suggesting a functional association between these two proteins in apoptosis control by a common mechanism.

Here, we examined its effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and found that, at 500 nM, it potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in 2 of 8 MM cell lines. RNA from un-treated and DZNep treated cells was profiled by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and genes with a significant change in gene expression were determined by significance analysis of microarray (SAM) testing. ALOX5 was the most down-regulated gene (5.8-fold) in sensitive cells and was expressed at low level in resistant cells. The results were corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR. Western-blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon DZNep treatment. Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to DZNep in H929 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929. Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells. We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells, and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells. Taken together, this study shows one of mechanisms of the DZNep efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down-regulate the ALOX5 levels. In addition, DZNep insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2, and the combination of ABT-737 and DZNep could synergistically induced apoptosis. These results suggest that DZNep may be exploited therapeutically for a subset of MM.","['Xie, Zhigang', 'Bi, Chonglei', 'Cheong, Lip Lee', 'Liu, Shaw Cheng', 'Huang, Gaofeng', 'Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Yu, Qiang', 'Chen, Chien-Shing', 'Chng, Wee Joo']","['Xie Z', 'Bi C', 'Cheong LL', 'Liu SC', 'Huang G', 'Zhou J', 'Yu Q', 'Chen CS', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '544SH4020S (3-deazaneplanocin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3123372,,2011/07/02 06:00,2011/10/20 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0021583 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-03055 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e21583. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021583.

After being incubated for 48 hours, K562/A02 cells were treated with DNR/Br Tet-MNPs or DNR and Br Tet in solution (DNR/Br Tet-Sol). Morphologic characteristics of K562/A02 cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope; cell apoptosis and intracellular accumulation of DNR were analyzed by FACS Calibur flow cytometry. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting analyses were performed to study the apoptosis associated gene transcription and protein expression, respectively. Typical apoptotic characteristics, including chromatin condensation and fragmentation of nuclei, were observed and a high rate of apoptosis was detected in K562/A02 cells treated with DNR/Br Tet-MNPs and DNR/Br Tet-Sol. Detection of relative fluorescence intensity of intracellular DNR demonstrated that intracellular DNR was higher in K562/A02 cells treated with DNR/Br Tet-MNPs than that of DNR/Br Tet-Sol. Further study demonstrated that both DNR/Br Tet-MNPs and DNR/Br Tet-Sol reduced the gene transcriptions and protein expressions of bcl-2 and survivin and enhanced that of bax and caspase 3. It is concluded that self-assembled DNR/Br Tet-MNPs, as one of the potential antitumor agents for hematologic malignancies, may effectively induce apoptosis of K562/A02 cells through elevating the ratio of bax/bcl-2, activating caspase 3, and inactivating survivin.","['Wang, Jun', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Cheng, Jian', 'Cai, Xiaohui', 'Xia, Guohua', 'Liu, Ran', 'Wang, Xuemei']","['Wang J', 'Chen B', 'Cheng J', 'Cai X', 'Xia G', 'Liu R', 'Wang X']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Medicine College, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['U24 AA022007/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Delayed-Action Preparations)', '0 (Magnetite Nanoparticles)', '0 (bromotetrandrine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Delayed-Action Preparations', 'Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetite Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3124388,,2011/07/02 06:00,2011/11/05 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S18023 [doi]', 'ijn-6-1027 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2011;6:1027-34. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S18023.

Multiple factors (e.g., virus, host cells, epigenetic aberrations, and immune factors) have been implicated in the development of ATL, although the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis have not been fully elucidated. Despite recent progress in both chemotherapy and supportive care for hematological malignancies, the prognosis of ATL is still poor; overall survival at 3 years is only 24%. New strategies for the therapy and prophylaxis of ATL (e.g., vaccines and novel molecular target agents) are still required. This article reviews new strategy of ATL treatment targeted for HTLV-1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and SIRT1, a longevity gene-encoded protein. HTLV-1-specific CTLs play a critical role in the host immune response against HTLV-1. We have described here the decreased frequency and function of HTLV-1-specific CD8+ T cells in ATL patients and the efficient induction of the HTLV-1-specific CTLs response in human leukocyte antigen-A* 0201-transgenic mice by the HTLV-1/hepatitis B core chimeric particle and oligomannose-coated liposomes encapsulating HTLV-1 epitope without adjuvant, suggesting that the efficient antigen delivery system and CTL induction can be exploited to develop a prophylactic vaccine model against tumors and infectious diseases. Furthermore, our studies suggest that SIRT1, a longevity gene-encoded protein, is a crucial anti-apoptotic molecule in ATL cells, and that SIRT1 inhibitors may be useful therapeutic agents for leukemia, especially in patients with ATL. These studies targeted for anti-tumor immunity such as vaccine and SIRT1 may support the new prophylactic and therapeutic approach for ATL.","['Kozako, Tomohiro']",['Kozako T'],"['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan. kozako@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['jpn'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Yakugaku Zasshi,Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan,0413613,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'HLA-A Antigens', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy/virology', 'Longevity/genetics', 'Mice', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Sirtuin 1/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['JST.JSTAGE/yakushi/131.1061 [pii]', '10.1248/yakushi.131.1061 [doi]']",ppublish,Yakugaku Zasshi. 2011;131(7):1061-72. doi: 10.1248/yakushi.131.1061.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that increasing doses of lenalidomide may benefit this group of patients by inhibiting the tumor clone, as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for del(5q31). DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients at diagnosis or with relapsed disease and not eligible for standard therapy (16 with acute myeloid leukemia, 12 with intermediate-risk 2 or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome) were enrolled in this prospective phase II multicenter trial and treated with lenalidomide up to 30 mg daily for 16 weeks. Three patients had isolated del(5q), six had del(5q) plus one additional aberration, 14 had del(5q) and a complex karyotype, four had monosomy 5, and one had del(5q) identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization only. RESULTS: Major and minor cytogenetic responses, assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, were achieved in 5/26 (19%) and 2/26 (8%) patients, respectively, who received one or more dose of lenalidomide, while two patients achieved only a bone marrow response. Nine of all 26 patients (35%) and nine of the ten who completed the 16 weeks of trial responded to treatment. Using the International Working Group criteria for acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome the overall response rate in treated patients with acute myeloid leukemia was 20% (3/15), while that for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome was 36% (4/11). Seven patients stopped therapy due to progressive disease and nine because of complications, most of which were disease-related. Response rates were similar in patients with isolated del(5q) and in those with additional aberrations. Interestingly, patients with TP53 mutations responded less well than those without mutations (2/13 versus 5/9, respectively; P=0.047).

We investigated this using type I-IFN receptor-deficient mice and exogenous IFN-alpha administration in established models of GVHD and GVL. Type I-IFN signaling in host tissue prevented severe colon-targeted GVHD in CD4-dependent models of GVHD directed toward either major histocompatibility antigens or multiple minor histocompatibility antigens. This protection was the result of suppression of donor CD4(+) T-cell proliferation and differentiation. Studies in chimeric recipients demonstrated this was due to type I-IFN signaling in hematopoietic tissue. Consistent with this finding, administration of IFN-alpha during conditioning inhibited donor CD4(+) proliferation and differentiation. In contrast, CD8-dependent GVHD and GVL effects were enhanced when type I-IFN signaling was intact in the host or donor, respectively. This finding reflected the ability of type I-IFN to both sensitize host target tissue/leukemia to cell-mediated cytotoxicity and augment donor CTL function. These data confirm that type I-IFN plays an important role in defining the balance of GVHD and GVL responses and suggests that administration of the cytokine after BM transplantation could be studied prospectively in patients at high risk of relapse.","['Robb, Renee J', 'Kreijveld, Ellen', 'Kuns, Rachel D', 'Wilson, Yana A', 'Olver, Stuart D', 'Don, Alistair L J', 'Raffelt, Neil C', 'De Weerd, Nicole A', 'Lineburg, Katie E', 'Varelias, Antiopi', 'Markey, Kate A', 'Koyama, Motoko', 'Clouston, Andrew D', 'Hertzog, Paul J', 'Macdonald, Kelli P A', 'Hill, Geoffrey R']","['Robb RJ', 'Kreijveld E', 'Kuns RD', 'Wilson YA', 'Olver SD', 'Don AL', 'Raffelt NC', 'De Weerd NA', 'Lineburg KE', 'Varelias A', 'Markey KA', 'Koyama M', 'Clouston AD', 'Hertzog PJ', 'Macdonald KP', 'Hill GR']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Laboratory, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '156986-95-7 (Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Interferon-alpha/immunology/pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'Receptor, Interferon alpha-beta/*deficiency/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40627-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-325746 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 22;118(12):3399-409. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-325746.

T-cell responses to these proteins have been correlated with remission in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Human PR3/HNE-specific CD8(+) T cells predominantly recognize a nonameric HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitope called PR1 which is conserved in both Ags. However, CML patients have CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood recognizing an additional HLA-A2 epitope termed PR2. To assess immunologic properties of these Ags, novel recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) expressing PR3 and HNE were evaluated in HLA-A2 transgenic (Tg) mice (HHDII). Immunization of HHDII mice with rVV-PR3 elicited a robust PR3-specific CD8(+) T-cell response dominated by recognition of PR2, with minimal recognition of the PR1 epitope. This result was unexpected, because the PR2 peptide has been reported to bind poorly to HLA. To account for these findings, we proposed that HHDII mice negatively selected PR1-specific T cells because of the presence of this epitope within murine PR3 and HNE, leading to immunodominance of PR2-specific responses. PR2-specific splenocytes are cytotoxic to targets expressing naturally processed PR3, though PR1-specific splenocytes are not. We conclude that PR2 represents a functional T-cell epitope recognized in mice and human leukemia patients.

Trial AIEOP-BFM-ALL 2000 introduced standardized quantitative assessment of MRD for stratification, based on immunoglobulin and TCR gene rearrangements as polymerase chain reaction targets: Patients were considered MRD standard risk (MRD-SR) if MRD was negative at day 33 (time point 1 [TP1]) and day 78 (TP2), analyzed by at least 2 sensitive markers; MRD intermediate risk (MRD-IR) if positive either at day 33 or 78 and < 10(-3) at day 78; and MRD high risk (MRD-HR) if >/= 10(-3) at day 78. A total of 464 patients with T-ALL were stratified by MRD: 16% of them were MRD-SR, 63% MRD-IR, and 21% MRD-HR. Their 7-year event-free-survival (SE) was 91.1% (3.5%), 80.6% (2.3%), and 49.8% (5.1%) (P < .001), respectively. Negativity of MRD at TP1 was the most favorable prognostic factor. An excellent outcome was also obtained in 32% of patients turning MRD negative only at TP2, indicating that early (TP1) MRD levels were irrelevant if MRD at TP2 was negative (48% of all patients).

NPM1 is mutated in approximately one-third of patients with AML. The mutant NPM1c+ contains a 4-base insert that results in extra C-terminal residues encoding a nuclear export signal, which causes NPM1c+ to be localized in the cytoplasm. Here, we determined the effects of targeting NPM1 in cultured and primary AML cells. Treatment with siRNA to NPM1 induced p53 and p21, decreased the percentage of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, as well as induced differentiation of the AML OCI-AML3 cells that express both NPMc+ and unmutated NPM1. Notably, knockdown of NPM1 by shRNA abolished lethal AML phenotype induced by OCI-AML3 cells in NOD/SCID mice. Knockdown of NPM1 also sensitized OCI-AML3 to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and cytarabine. Inhibition of NPM1 oligomerization by NSC348884 induced apoptosis and sensitized OCI-AML3 and primary AML cells expressing NPM1c+ to ATRA. This effect was significantly less in AML cells coexpressing FLT3-ITD, or in AML or normal CD34+ progenitor cells expressing wild-type NPM1. Thus, attenuating levels or oligomerization of NPM1 selectively induces apoptosis and sensitizes NPM1c+ expressing AML cells to treatment with ATRA and cytarabine.","['Balusu, Ramesh', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Rao, Rekha', 'Chong, Daniel G', 'Nalluri, Srilatha', 'Mudunuru, Uma', 'Ma, Hongwei', 'Chen, Lei', 'Venkannagari, Sreedhar', 'Ha, Kyungsoo', 'Abhyankar, Sunil', 'Williams, Casey', 'McGuirk, Joseph', 'Khoury, Hanna Jean', 'Ustun, Celalettin', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Balusu R', 'Fiskus W', 'Rao R', 'Chong DG', 'Nalluri S', 'Mudunuru U', 'Ma H', 'Chen L', 'Venkannagari S', 'Ha K', 'Abhyankar S', 'Williams C', 'McGuirk J', 'Khoury HJ', 'Ustun C', 'Bhalla KN']","['The University of Kansas Medical Center, KS City, KS, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA171338/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173877/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects/physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6710561,,2011/07/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40666-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-309674 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 15;118(11):3096-106. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-309674.

One such variant, IVS7 + 2T > G, results in premature protein truncation because of skipping of exon 7. Surprisingly, the persons who are either IVS7 + 2T > G homozygous or compound heterozygous are born alive but die of malignancy associated with Fanconi anemia. Using a mouse embryonic stem cell-based functional assay, we found that the IVS7 + 2T > G allele produces an alternatively spliced transcript lacking exons 4-7, encoding an in-frame BRCA2 protein with an internal deletion of 105 amino acids (BRCA2(Delta105)). We demonstrate that BRCA2(Delta105) is proficient in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair as measured by different functional assays.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether these patients can be cured of malignant disease or whether they survive SAEV only to subsequently relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors report the outcome of children with SAEV treated in the multicentre studies ALL-BFM 95 and AML-BFM 98. Data from 1182 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 334 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were analysed. 88 patients (51 ALL and 37 AML) developed SAEV. RESULTS: The prognosis was almost identical in ALL and AML patients (survival of SAEV patients: 48%, 95% CI 38% to 58%; overall survival after 5 years: 31%, 95% CI 21% to 41%). Prognosis was independent of the time between leukaemia diagnosis and SAEV. Approximately 20% of children who required haemodialysis (n=14) or cardiac resuscitation (n=16) achieved long term survival, but no patient who fulfilled more than three of six identified risk factors (age >/=10 years, high risk leukaemia, C reactive protein >/=150 mg/l, administration of inotropic infusion, cardiac resuscitation and haemodialysis) survived (n=16; 0%, 95% CI 0% to 20%). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care improves the short and long term survival of children with leukaemia. 64% (95% CI 50% to 78%) of children with acute leukaemia who survived SAEV achieved long term survival. Prognosis mainly depends on age and leukaemia risk group.","['Steinbach, Daniel', 'Wilhelm, Bernhard', 'Kiermaier, Hans-Rudolf', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Gruhn, Bernd', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Jurgens, Heribert', 'Strahm, Brigitte', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Moricke, Anja']","['Steinbach D', 'Wilhelm B', 'Kiermaier HR', 'Creutzig U', 'Schrappe M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Debatin KM', 'Gruhn B', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Jurgens H', 'Strahm B', 'Reinhardt D', 'Moricke A']","[""Children's Hospital, University Children's Hospital Ulm, Eythstrasse 24, 89075 Ulm, Germany. daniel@Steinba.ch""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Cardiotonic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intubation, Intratracheal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Renal Dialysis', '*Respiration, Artificial', 'Resuscitation', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['adc.2010.205567 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2010.205567 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2011 Nov;96(11):1026-32. doi: 10.1136/adc.2010.205567.

Their administration has been proposed to treat several viral and immunomediated diseases as an immunomodulatory therapy. Due to its availability, recombinant human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-alpha) has been studied in relation to feline retrovirosis, both in vitro and in vivo. However, IFNs are species-specific and antibodies have been shown to develop in response to the high rHuIFN-alpha doses necessary for an effective therapy. A recombinant feline IFN has been developed, which has been characterized as interferon-omega (rFeIFN-omega), designed to overcome these problems. Nonetheless, very few studies have been undertaken to evaluate its efficacy in cats naturally infected with FIV or FeLV. In an initial study, we here demonstrated that rFeIFN-omega can dramatically improve the clinical condition of infected cats, and induce improvement of hematologic parameters. Minor changes or no change was observed for hypergammaglobulinemia, CD4/CD8 ratio, proviral load, viremia and RT activity, suggesting that the overall effect of IFN was on innate immunity.

While many studies portray mechanisms in early antiviral immune responses of humans and mice, much remains to be discovered about these mechanisms in the cat. With the objective of shedding light on early host-virus interactions in felids, we have developed 12 real-time TaqMan((R)) qPCR systems for feline genes relevant to innate responses to viral infection, including those encoding for various IFNalpha and IFNomega subtypes, IFNbeta, intracellular antiviral factor Mx, NK cell stimulator IL-15 and effectors perforin and granzyme B, as well as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 8. Using these newly developed assays and others previously described, we measured the relative expression of selected markers at early time points after viral infection in vitro and in vivo. Feline embryonic fibroblasts (FEA) inoculated with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) indicated peak levels of IFNalpha, IFNbeta and Mx expression already 6h after infection. In contrast, Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CrFK) cells inoculated with feline herpes virus (FHV) responded to infection with high levels of IFNalpha and IFNbeta only after 24h, and no induction of Mx could be detected. In feline PBMCs challenged in vitro with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), maximal expression levels of IFNalpha, beta and omega subtype genes as well as IL-15 and TLRs 3, 7 and 8 were measured between 12 and 24h after infection, whereas expression levels of proinflammatory cytokine gene IL-6 were consistently downregulated until 48h post inoculation. A marginal upregulation of granzyme B was also observed within 3h after infection. In an in vivo experiment, cats challenged with FIV exhibited a 2.4-fold increase in IFNalpha expression in blood 1 week post infection. We furthermore demonstrate the possibility of stimulating feline immune cells in vitro with various immune response modifiers (IRMs) already known for their immunostimulatory properties in mice and humans, namely Poly IC, Resiquimod (R-848) and dSLIM, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing several unmethylated CpG motifs. Stimulation of feline PBMCs with dSLIM and R-848 effectively enhanced expression of IFNalpha within 12h by factors of 6 and 12, respectively, and Poly IC induced an increase in Mx mRNA expression of 28-fold. Altogether, we describe new molecular tools and their successful use for the characterization of innate immune responses against viruses in the cat and provide evidence that feline cells can be stimulated by synthetic molecules to enhance their antiviral defence mechanisms.","['Robert-Tissot, Celine', 'Ruegger, Vera L', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Riond, Barbara', 'Gomes-Keller, Maria Alice', 'Vogtlin, Andrea', 'Wittig, Burghardt', 'Juhls, Christiane', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Robert-Tissot C', 'Ruegger VL', 'Cattori V', 'Meli ML', 'Riond B', 'Gomes-Keller MA', 'Vogtlin A', 'Wittig B', 'Juhls C', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Lutz H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstr. 260, CH-8057 Zurich, Switzerland. crobert@vetclinics.uzh.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/immunology/*virology', 'Cats/*immunology/virology', 'Cell Line/virology', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Interferons/genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/virology', 'Male', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary']",PMC7112645,,2011/07/02 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(11)00202-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2011 Oct 15;143(3-4):269-81. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.005.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 74 adolescents below 13 years of age received allogeneic HSCT and conditioning with either: sTBI, fTBI or Bu. The unstimulated (USSR) and stimulated (SSSR) whole salivary secretion rates were measured at 15 years of age. RESULTS: Irrespective of conditioning type, there were no significant differences in USSR or SSSR between groups. Girls had a significantly lower SSSR, 0.7 +/- 0.3 ml per min compared with 1.1 +/- 0.4 ml per min in boys (P < 0.001). A significant correlation between age at HSCT and SSSR at 15 years of age (P = 0.02) in children conditioned with sTBI was found as well as an inverse correlation between the plasma area under curve (AUC) of Bu and SSSR. In the multivariate model, only female sex was significantly correlated with low SSSR at 15 years of age (OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.21-12.79; P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: No differences in long-term whole salivary function after HSCT in adolescents receiving conditioning with sTBI, fTBI or Bu were found. Total systemic exposure to Bu was negatively correlated with stimulated salivary secretion.","['Garming-Legert, K', 'Remberger, M', 'Ringden, O', 'Hassan, M', 'Dahllof, G']","['Garming-Legert K', 'Remberger M', 'Ringden O', 'Hassan M', 'Dahllof G']","['Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Department of Dental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Sweden. karin.garming.legert@ki.se']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Oral Dis,Oral diseases,9508565,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Area Under Curve', 'Busulfan/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', '*Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Granulomatous Disease, Chronic/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/surgery', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/surgery', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Salivary Glands/drug effects/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Secretory Rate/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1601-0825.2011.01821.x [doi]'],ppublish,Oral Dis. 2011 Oct;17(7):670-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1601-0825.2011.01821.x.

An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2009-2010.,573-7; quiz 577-8,10.1111/j.1365-2230.2011.04078.x [doi],"This review provides a summary of key findings from 18 systematic reviews on atopic eczema, published or indexed between January 2009 and 24 August 2010. There was no good evidence on the possible benefit of organic food consumption and eczema. Maternal intake of fish or fish oil may be associated with a reduced risk of eczema in offspring, although further studies are needed. There is some evidence that partially hydrolysed infant formulas rather than standard formulas may be associated with a reduced risk of eczema in infants, but there are shortcomings in the existing evidence. An inverse relationship has been found between gliomas/acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and allergic disease/eczema, but there appears to be no association between multiple sclerosis and eczema. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder does appear to be associated with eczema, but there is no evidence of a causal link. The risk of eczema seems to be increased in urban compared with rural areas. Some new evidence has suggested superiority of 1% pimecrolimus over potent and mild corticosteroids at 6 months but not 12 months, and there is some evidence for superiority of 0.03% and 0.1% tacrolimus over 1% pimecrolimus. An updated Cochrane Review still found no evidence of a benefit from any form of antistaphylococcal treatment in managing clinically infected or uninfected eczema. The evidence base is poor for bath emollients, occlusive treatments (e.g., wet and dry wraps) and woven silk clothing in treating eczema. In general, the methods used in most systematic reviews of eczema need to be reported more clearly, especially with regard to a more vigorous quality assessment of included studies. Included studies are frequently heterogeneous, proxy reporting is common, and appropriate disease definitions are often lacking. Better adherence to existing guidance on trial reporting and prospective registration of clinical trials may help improve the quality of studies.","['Shams, K', 'Grindlay, D J C', 'Williams, H C']","['Shams K', 'Grindlay DJ', 'Williams HC']","['Alan Lyell Centre for Dermatology, Southern General Hospital, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",England,Clin Exp Dermatol,Clinical and experimental dermatology,7606847,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/etiology/*prevention & control', '*Diet', '*Food, Organic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant Formula/methods', 'Occlusive Dressings', 'Risk Factors']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2011/10/27 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2230.2011.04078.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Dermatol. 2011 Aug;36(6):573-7; quiz 577-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2230.2011.04078.x.

METHODS: The n-butanol fraction of aqueous extract from Carissa spinarum stem was assessed for its cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic activity. KEY FINDINGS: We report for the first time the anti-cancer potential of C. spinarum stem aqueous extract (CSE) and its n-butanol fraction (CSF). Both inhibited cell proliferation of various human cancer cell lines in which leukaemia HL-60 cells treated with CSF showed maximum growth inhibition having an inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ) value of 34.58+/-0.91 microg/ml. In addition, CSF induced concentration-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 cells as measured by various end-points (e.g. Annexin V binding, DNA laddering, apoptotic body formation and an increase in hypodiploid subG0 DNA content). Moreover, persistent levels of reactive oxygen species caused translocation of Bax to mitochondria and Bcl-2 degradation, which led to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. These events were associated with significant activation of caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-9 leading to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. CONCLUSION: All the above parameters revealed that CSF induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial dependent pathway in HL-60 cells.","['Sehar, Irum', 'Pal, Harish Chandra', 'Shukla, Sangeeta', 'Bhushan, Shashi', 'Hamid, Abid', 'Gupta, Bishan Dutt', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar']","['Sehar I', 'Pal HC', 'Shukla S', 'Bhushan S', 'Hamid A', 'Gupta BD', 'Saxena AK']","['Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Apocynaceae', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/*drug effects', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Plant Stems', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.2042-7158.2011.01310.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2011 Aug;63(8):1078-90. doi: 10.1111/j.2042-7158.2011.01310.x.

These are BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations, increased BCR-ABL expression, and overexpression of drug-efflux proteins (ABCB1 and ABCG2). To investigate the interplay between these three modes of resistance, three CML blast crisis cell lines (K562, its ABCB1-overexpressing variant K562 Dox, and KU812) were cultured in gradually increasing concentrations of imatinib to 2 muM, or dasatinib to 200 nM. Eight imatinib- and two dasatinib-resistant cell lines were established. Two imatinib-resistant K562 lines both had increased BCR-ABL expression as the apparent mode of resistance. However, when a dasatinib-resistant K562 culture was generated we observed gradually increasing BCR-ABL expression which peaked prior to identification of the T315I mutation. BCR-ABL overexpression followed by mutation development was observed in a further 4/10 cell lines, each with different KD mutations. In contrast, three imatinib-resistant K562 Dox lines exhibited only a further increase in ABCB1 expression. All TKI-resistant cell lines generated had increased IC(50) (dose of drug required to reduce phosphorylation of the adaptor protein p-Crkl by 50%) to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, regardless of which TKI was used to induce resistance. This suggests that currently available TKIs share the same susceptibilities to drug resistance.","['Tang, Carine', 'Schafranek, Lisa', 'Watkins, Dale B', 'Parker, Wendy T', 'Moore, Sarah', 'Prime, Jodi A', 'White, Deborah L', 'Hughes, Timothy P']","['Tang C', 'Schafranek L', 'Watkins DB', 'Parker WT', 'Moore S', 'Prime JA', 'White DL', 'Hughes TP']","['Department of Haematology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/08/07 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.591013 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Nov;52(11):2139-47. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.591013.

Although alemtuzumab in relapsed/refractory CLL may be beneficial, the optimal dosage and risk of infection related to its use remain thus far deeply controversial issues. In this pilot phase II study we investigated the feasibility of, toxicity of, and response to alemtuzumab at a reduced dose (30 mg s.c. for 2 weeks and then once a week at extended intervals: every 2, 4, 6 weeks up to 1 year). The overall response rate was 95%, with 51% complete response. The complete response range was 55% in fludarabine-relapsed patients and 28% in patients with fludarabine-refractory disease, without significant difference between the two groups. The regimen was well tolerated with mild toxicity and few cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. With a median follow-up of 27 months, the overall survival (46% at 3 years) appears to be similar to that with other regimens although with fewer adverse events. In conclusion, treatment with alemtuzumab at a reduced dose seems to be safe and increases the event-free survival of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, compared with the standard dose. A randomized study comparing both regimens including a larger number of patients is warranted.","['Bezares, Raimundo Fernando', 'Stemelin, German', 'Diaz, Alicia', 'Argentieri, Daniel', 'Zubiaur, Emilio Lanari', 'Garay, Guy', 'Bartomioli, Miguel', 'Ryser, Ricardo', 'Milone, Gustavo']","['Bezares RF', 'Stemelin G', 'Diaz A', 'Argentieri D', 'Zubiaur EL', 'Garay G', 'Bartomioli M', 'Ryser R', 'Milone G']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Britanico, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/chemically induced', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,,2011/07/02 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.584991 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Oct;52(10):1936-41. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.584991.

Characterization of the mechanism of inhibition in both cell-free and cellular systems.,6678-88,10.1021/bi2002967 [doi],"We describe a series of indolequinones as efficient mechanism-based inhibitors of NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) for use either in cellular or cell-free systems. Compounds were designed to be reduced in the active site of the enzyme leading to loss of a substituted phenol leaving group and generation of a reactive iminium electrophile. Inhibition of NQO2 activity was assessed in both cell-free systems and the human leukemia K562 cell line. Inhibition of recombinant human NQO2 by the indolequinones was NRH-dependent, with kinetic parameters characteristic of mechanism-based inhibition and partition ratios as low as 2.0. Indolequinones inhibited NQO2 activity in K562 cells at nanomolar concentrations that did not inhibit NQO1 and were nontoxic to cells. Computation-based molecular modeling simulations demonstrated favorable conformations of indolequinones positioned directly above and in parallel with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, and mass spectrometry extended our previous finding of adduction of the FAD in the active site of NQO2 by an indolequinone-derived iminium electrophile to the wider series of indolequinone inhibitors. Modeling combined with biochemical testing identified key structural parameters for effective inhibition, including a 5-aminoalkylamino side chain. Hydrogen bonding of the terminal amine nitrogen in the aminoalkylamino side chain was found to be critical for the correct orientation of the inhibitors in the active site. These indolequinones were irreversible inhibitors and were found to be at least 1 order of magnitude more potent than any previously documented competitive inhibitors of NQO2 and represent the first mechanism-based inhibitors of NQO2 to be characterized in cellular systems.","['Yan, Chao', 'Dufour, Marine', 'Siegel, David', 'Reigan, Philip', 'Gomez, Joe', 'Shieh, Biehuoy', 'Moody, Christopher J', 'Ross, David']","['Yan C', 'Dufour M', 'Siegel D', 'Reigan P', 'Gomez J', 'Shieh B', 'Moody CJ', 'Ross D']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80045, USA.']",['eng'],"['R21 HL095995/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL095995-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Indolequinones)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (NRH - quinone oxidoreductase2)', 'EC 1.6.99.- (Quinone Reductases)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Amination', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell-Free System/enzymology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Indolequinones/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', '*Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Quinone Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",PMC3291479,['NIHMS312855'],2011/07/02 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/02 06:00'],"['2011/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi2002967 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2011 Aug 9;50(31):6678-88. doi: 10.1021/bi2002967.

METHODS: To determine whether cenersen merits testing in larger efficacy studies, an exploratory study of cenersen in combination with idarubicin either alone or with 1 of 2 doses of cytarabine was performed in first-salvage AML patients. Patients who either had failed to respond to a single induction course or had responded to induction but relapsed within 12 months were enrolled. Stopping rules based on an expected 14% complete response (CR) rate were applied to each treatment arm. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were treated, and none of the arms was terminated for lack of activity. Nearly all patients received a single course unless they responded. Ten of the 53 (19%) patients responded (8 CR and 2 CR with incomplete platelet recovery). There was a positive trend for a better response rate with increasing intensity of chemotherapy in the patients refractory to front-line treatment compared with those who had relapsed previously. One-third (17/53) of the patients received cenersen inhibitors (acetaminophen and/or high dose antioxidants) during treatment, and none of these responded to treatment. No unique toxicity was attributed to cenersen. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that the combination of cenersen with chemotherapy may have clinical efficacy, and additional studies are warranted to explore its full potential.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ball, Edward D', 'Dipersio, John', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Goodman, Mark', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ball ED', 'Dipersio J', 'Kolitz JE', 'Fernandez HF', 'Goodman M', 'Borthakur G', 'Baer MR', 'Wetzler M']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '872847-66-0 (cenersen)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligonucleotides/*therapeutic use', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Failure']",PMC4977021,['NIHMS806262'],2011/07/01 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26292 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jan 15;118(2):418-27. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26292.

METHODS: The authors explored the safety and tolerability of a modified HiDAC induction regimen consisting of 6 daily doses of cytarabine at 2 g/m(2) in combination with 3 daily doses of daunorubicin at 45 mg/m(2) in 59 consecutive patients aged >60 years who had de novo AML diagnosed between July 1996 and February 2005. RESULTS: The median patient age was 68 years (range, 60-86 years). The regimen was well tolerated. Infections were common and occurred in 39% of patients, but cerebellar toxicities occurred in only 7% of patients and were reversible. The day-30 induction-related mortality rate was 10%. Overall, 69% of patients achieved complete remissions (CR), and 80% received up to 3 consolidations with HiDAC. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 53 months (range, 17-114 months). The median overall survival was 15.3 months (range, 1-114 months), and the relapse-free survival was 13.8 months (range, 1-113 months).

The current ""gold standard"" of treatment response is cytogenetic response. Cytogenetic response to imatinib is strongly associated with disease progression and survival. Various strategies aimed at improving cytogenetic response have been explored, such as escalation of imatinib and switching to the newer breakpoint cluster region/v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene (BCR-ABL) inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib. Data from recent randomized trials of dasatinib and nilotinib as first-line therapy of newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML suggest that these agents are more effective than imatinib in achieving 6-month and 12-month complete cytogenetic responses. However, it is still too early to know whether or not this early response will translate into a long-term survival advantage. In addition, more sensitive assays to detect residual disease also may be associated with improved long-term outcomes. The deepest measure of response-a complete molecular response-may help identify patients who can stop taking imatinib for the short term, although the long-term consequences of this strategy remain unknown.","['Radich, Jerald P']",['Radich JP'],"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. jradich@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2010/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26280 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jan 15;118(2):300-11. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26280.

METHODS: The authors analyzed 570 patients (aged 16-70 years) included in 2 multicenter trials of the CETLAM Group to develop a scoring system (study cohort). The scoring system was tested in 209 patients from an external single institution (validation cohort). Induction regimens consisted of anthracycline and cytarabine combination with or without etoposide. Induction death was defined as death in the first 42 days without evidence of leukemic resistance. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of induction death was 11% in the study cohort and 18% in the validation cohort. Median age was 48 years in the study cohort and 56 years in the validation cohort (P < .001). Multivariate analysis in the study cohort showed the following adverse risk factors for induction death: leukocyte count >100 x 10(9) /L, serum creatinine >1.2 mg/dL, and age >/=50 years. According to these factors, the authors developed a predictive score: low risk (no risk factors), intermediate risk (1 factor), and high risk (2 or 3 factors). The cumulative incidence of induction death in the 3 respective groups was 5%, 13%, and 26% (P < .001). The scoring system was applied in the validation cohort, resulting in cumulative incidence rates of induction death of 6%, 19%, and 32%, for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk categories, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: By using this validated and simple scoring system, the risk of induction death in patients with AML can be predicted accurately. The score may be helpful to design risk-adapted induction strategies.","['Valcarcel, David', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Sanchez-Ortega, Isabel', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Ribera, Jose M', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Bueno, Javier', 'Duarte, Rafael', 'Llorente, Andres', 'Torres, Juan Pio', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Sierra, And Jorge']","['Valcarcel D', 'Montesinos P', 'Sanchez-Ortega I', 'Brunet S', 'Esteve J', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Ribera JM', 'Tormo M', 'Bueno J', 'Duarte R', 'Llorente A', 'Torres JP', 'Guardia R', 'Sanz MA', 'Sierra AJ']","['Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2011/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26273 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jan 15;118(2):410-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26273.

Indeed, imatinib has substantially changed the clinical management and improved the prognosis of both diseases. Treatment with imatinib is generally well tolerated, and the risk for severe adverse effects is low, generally occurring during the early phase of treatment and correlating with imatinib dose, phase of disease and patient's characteristics. This article summarises recent data on safety profile of imatinib for the treatment of CML and GIST, including long-term side effects. Prolonged treatment with imatinib in both diseases demonstrates excellent tolerability.

Treatment of patients suffering from high-risk AML as defined by clinical parameters, cytogenetics, and/or molecular analyses is often unsuccessful. OSI-461 is a pro-apoptotic compound that has been proposed as a novel therapeutic option for patients suffering from solid tumors like prostate or colorectal carcinoma. But little is known about its anti-proliferative potential in AML. Hence, we treated bone marrow derived CD34(+) selected blast cells from 20 AML patients and the five AML cell lines KG-1a, THP-1, HL-60, U-937, and MV4-11 with the physiologically achievable concentration of 1 muM OSI-461 or equal amounts of DMSO as a control. Following incubation with OSI-461, we found a consistent induction of apoptosis and an accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In addition, we demonstrate that the OSI-461 mediated anti-proliferative effects observed in AML are associated with the induction of the pro-apoptotic cytokine mda-7/IL-24 and activation of the growth arrest and DNA-damage inducible genes (GADD) 45alpha and 45gamma. Furthermore, OSI-461 treated leukemia cells did not regain their proliferative potential for up to 8 days after cessation of treatment following the initial 48 h treatment period with 1 muM OSI-461. This indicates sufficient targeting of the leukemia-initiating cells in our in vitro experiments through OSI-461. The AML samples tested in this study included samples from patients who were resistant to conventional chemotherapy and/or had FLT3-ITD mutations demonstrating the high potential of OSI-461 in human AML.","['Singh, Raminder', 'Frobel, Julia', 'Cadeddu, Ron-Patrick', 'Bruns, Ingmar', 'Schroeder, Thomas', 'Brunnert, Daniela', 'Wilk, Christian Matthias', 'Zerbini, Luiz Fernando', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Czibere, Akos']","['Singh R', 'Frobel J', 'Cadeddu RP', 'Bruns I', 'Schroeder T', 'Brunnert D', 'Wilk CM', 'Zerbini LF', 'Haas R', 'Czibere A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 ((5-fluoro-2-methyl-1-(4-pyridyl)methylene-3-(N-benzyl)-indene)-acetamide', 'hydrochloride)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '184SNS8VUH (Sulindac)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sulindac/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1282-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Feb;91(2):173-81. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1282-4.

In the periphery, B cells that encounter antigen can further differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. In this review, we focus on two factors, E47 and ELL2, which play important roles in the regulation of B cell development in the bone marrow and differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells in the periphery, respectively. First, E47 activity is required for B cell development in the bone marrow. In addition, we have identified a cell-intrinsic role for E47 in regulating efficient self-renewal and long-term multilineage bone marrow reconstitution potential of HSCs. Second, we explored the role of transcription elongation factors in the super elongation complex (SEC), including ELL2 (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia factor) in driving poly(A) site choice and plasma cell development. We found that elongation factors impel high levels of IgH mRNA production and alternative processing at the promoter proximal, secretory-specific (sec) poly(A) site in plasma cells by enhancing RNA polymerase II modifications and downstream events. The sec poly(A) site, essentially hidden in B cells, is found by SEC factors in plasma cells.","['Santos, Patricia', 'Arumemi, Fortuna', 'Park, Kyung Soo', 'Borghesi, Lisa', 'Milcarek, Christine']","['Santos P', 'Arumemi F', 'Park KS', 'Borghesi L', 'Milcarek C']","['Department of Immunology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, 200 Lothrop Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI079047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ARO54529/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Transcription Factor 3)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', '*Epigenomics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor 3/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/genetics']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12026-011-8225-y [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 2011 Aug;50(2-3):105-12. doi: 10.1007/s12026-011-8225-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While NK cells express perforin and granzymes in the lysosomal granules and transmembrane tumor necrosis factor superfamily ligands (tmTNFSFL) on the plasma membrane, DCs express only tmTNFSFL on the plasma membrane. Perforin and granzymes are cytolytic molecules, which NK cells use to mediate a secretory/necrotic killing mechanism against rare leukemia cell targets. TNFSFL are pleiotropic transmembrane molecules, which can mediate a variety of important functions such as apoptosis, development of peripheral lymphoid tissues, inflammation and regulation of immune functions. Using tmTNFSFL, NK cells and DCs mediate a cell contact-dependent non-secretory apoptotic cytotoxic mechanism against virtually all types of cancer cells, and cross talk that leads to polarization and reciprocal stimulation and amplification of Th1 type cytokines secreted by NK cells and DCs. In this paper, we review and discuss the supporting evidence of the non-secretory, tmTNFSFL-mediated innate mechanisms of NK cells and DCs, their roles in anticancer immune defense and potential of their modulation and use in prevention and treatment of cancer.","['Vujanovic, Nikola L']",['Vujanovic NL'],"['Departments of Pathology and Immunology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA15213-1863, USA. vujanovicnl@upmc.edu']",['eng'],"['I-PODE13059/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 DE14775/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE17150/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Immunologic Factors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Neoplasms/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors/genetics/*immunology']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12026-011-8228-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 2011 Aug;50(2-3):159-74. doi: 10.1007/s12026-011-8228-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular biological analysis of malignant diseases of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in contaminated territories requires the precise diagnosis based on criteria of novel classifications. AIM: To analyze the relative gene expression of six apoptosis-related genes in different types of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues in patients living in areas of Ukraine contaminated with radionuclides in post-Chernobyl period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The samples of the peripheral blood and bone marrow of 189 Ukrainian leukemia patients and 16 patients with reactive lymphocytosis were analyzed morphologically and immunocytochemically for precise delineation of the main forms and cytological variants of hematological malignancies according to new WHO classification. Expression of six apoptosis-related genes was analyzed in the individual samples of 9 different groups of malignant diseases of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues and one group of patients with reactive lymphocytosis by quantitative RT-PCR. Expression of genes was assessed relative to that in control group of healthy donors. RESULTS: Up-regulation of six analyzed apoptosisrelated genes is observed in all groups of leukemia. In most groups of leukemia being analyzed, BCL-2 up-regulation level is superior to that of BAX. Prominent MYC up-regulation is observed in B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma groups. In myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, the striking up-regulation of Fas-1 and P38MAPK is evident. Practically all the groups of leukemia are characterized by stable high ratios of P53 up-regulation. CONCLUSION: In Ukrainian patients, up-regulation of six analyzed apoptosis-related genes is observed practically in all types of malignant diseases of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues under study. Microarray-based analysis of these samples would be of great importance in terms of elucidating genomic interactions in leukemias and their possible association with ionizing radiation.","['Savli, H', 'Gluzman, D F', 'Sunnetci, D', 'Zavelevich, M P', 'Sklyarenko, L M', 'Nadgornaya, V A', 'Koval, S V']","['Savli H', 'Gluzman DF', 'Sunnetci D', 'Zavelevich MP', 'Sklyarenko LM', 'Nadgornaya VA', 'Koval SV']","['Medical Genetics Department, Medicine Faculty of Kocaeli University, Turkey. hakansavli@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ukraine/epidemiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['49/909 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2011 Jun;33(2):104-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the antitumor potential of a nutrient mixture on malignant leukemia P-388 cells. METHODS: The nutrient mixture containing lysine, proline, ascorbic acid, green tea extract and other nutrients is formulated to target key pathways in cancer progression. The cells were treated with the mixture, and tested at doses 0, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 mug/ml in triplicates. The effects were evaluated by cell proliferation, Matrigel invasion, cell morphology and apoptosis. The in vivo effect was measured in male nude mice (n = 12) inoculated with P-388 cells. After randomly dividing in two groups, each group was fed regular and the nutrient mixture supplemented diet and the mice were sacrificed after four weeks. RESULTS: The nutrient mixture decreased P-388 cell proliferation at 500 and 1000 mug/ml. Only 10% cells were viable at 1000 mug/ml. Matrigel invasion was significantly inhibited in a dose dependent manner with virtually total inhibition at 1000 mug/ml. Cell morphological features notably changed with dose increase to 1000 mug/ml. Analysis of apoptotic cells on live green caspase kit exhibited gradual increase with the increasing dose of the nutrient mixture, and at 1000 mug/ ml 92% of P-388 cells were in late apoptosis. Tumors in the group of mice supplemented with the nutrient mixture had 50% lower weight compared to the tumors in control group (p = 0.0105). Histopathologically, both the groups of tumors were similar, yet size of tumors in the group treated with the nutrient mixture was considerably smaller. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the nutrient mixture exhibited significant action against multiple targets in P-388 leukemia and may have potential in human leukemia.","['Roomi, M W', 'Roomi, N W', 'Bhanap, B', 'Rath, M', 'Niedzwiecki, A']","['Roomi MW', 'Roomi NW', 'Bhanap B', 'Rath M', 'Niedzwiecki A']","[""Dr. Rath's Research Institute, Cancer Division, Santa Clara, California 95050, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (green tea extract AR25)', '119978-18-6 (matrigel)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Camellia sinensis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Collagen/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', '*Food', 'Laminin/drug effects', 'Leukemia/diet therapy/*pathology', 'Lysine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proline/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proteoglycans/drug effects']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['49/903 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2011 Jun;33(2):71-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we examined the antiproliferation and proapoptotic effects of panaxynol and panaxydol on HL60 cells and investigated their mechanism of action. Cell growth inhibition of panaxynol and panaxydol were determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assays. Apoptosis of cells was revealed by morphological observation, analysis for nuclear DNA distribution and by annexin V-FITC/ PI staining using flow cytometry. It was found that panaxynol and panaxydol markedly inhibited proliferation of HL60 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner via an apoptotic pathway. In concern with these fi ndings, Western blot analysis showed proteolytic activation of PKCdelta, caspase-3 activation and cleavage of poly (ADP [adenosine diphosphate]-ribose) polymerase in HL60 cells treated by panaxynol and panaxydol. In conclusion, panaxynol and panaxydol have profound effects on growth and apoptosis of HL60 cells, suggesting those substances are worthy of further exploration as potential anti-cancer agents.","['Yan, Zhonghong', 'Yang, Ruolin', 'Jiang, Yi', 'Yang, Zhihui', 'Yang, Junrui', 'Zhao, Qian', 'Lu, Yang']","['Yan Z', 'Yang R', 'Jiang Y', 'Yang Z', 'Yang J', 'Zhao Q', 'Lu Y']","['Department of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Diynes)', '0 (Fatty Alcohols)', '21852-80-2 (falcarinol)', '72800-72-7 (panaxydol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diynes/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Alcohols/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism']",PMC6264185,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules16075561 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules16075561 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2011 Jun 29;16(7):5561-73. doi: 10.3390/molecules16075561.,20110629,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A few small studies have reported a reduced risk associated with regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). METHODS: In a population-based case-control study, we evaluated analgesic use among 670 newly diagnosed myeloid leukemia cases [including 420 acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and 186 chronic myeloid leukemias (CML)] and 701 controls aged 20 to 79 years. Prior use of aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, other NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors was assessed and included frequency, duration, and quantity. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using unconditional logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Regular/extra strength aspirin use was inversely associated with myeloid leukemia in women (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37-0.93) but not in men (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.58-1.24). In contrast, acetaminophen use was associated with an increased risk of myeloid leukemia in women only (OR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.04-2.47). These relationships were stronger with increasing dose and duration. When stratified by leukemia type, aspirin use was inversely associated with AML and CML in women. No significant overall associations were found with ibuprofen or COX-2 inhibitors for either sex; however, a decreased risk was observed with other anti-inflammatory analgesic use for women with AML or CML (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.22-0.99; OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.10-0.92, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide additional support for the chemopreventive benefits of NSAIDs, at least in women. Because leukemia ranks fifth in person-years of life lost due to malignancy, further investigation is warranted. IMPACT: NSAIDs may reduce, whereas acetaminophen may increase, myeloid leukemia risk in women.","['Ross, Julie A', 'Blair, Cindy K', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Soler, John T', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Roesler, Michelle A', 'Higgins, Rodney R', 'Nguyen, Phuong L']","['Ross JA', 'Blair CK', 'Cerhan JR', 'Soler JT', 'Hirsch BA', 'Roesler MA', 'Higgins RR', 'Nguyen PL']","['Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. rossx014@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA107143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107143-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA107143/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/*administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*administration & dosage', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",PMC3153558,['NIHMS307733'],2011/07/01 06:00,2012/02/02 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/02 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-11-0411 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0411 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2011 Aug;20(8):1741-50. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-11-0411.

However, we found that the predominantly nuclear A3B only weakly restricted infection by HIV-1, HIV-1Deltavif, and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), while significantly inhibiting LINE-1 retrotransposition. The chimeric construct A3G/B, in which the first 60 amino acids of A3B were replaced with those of A3G, restricted HIV-1, HIV-1Deltavif, and HTLV-1 infection, as well as LINE-1 retrotransposition. In contrast to the exclusively cytoplasmic A3G, which is inactive against LINE-1 retrotransposition, the A3G/B protein, while localized mainly to the cytoplasm, was also present in the nucleus. Further mutational analysis revealed that residues 18, 19, 22, and 24 in A3B were the major determinants for nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization and antiretroviral activity. HIV-1Deltavif packages A3G, A3B, and A3G/B into particles with close-to-equal efficiencies. Mutation E68Q or E255Q in the active centers of A3G/B resulted in loss of the inhibitory activity against HIV-1Deltavif, while not affecting activity against LINE-1 retrotransposition. The low inhibition of HIV-1Deltavif by A3B correlated with a low rate of G-to-A hypermutation. In contrast, viruses that had been exposed to A3G/B showed a high number of G-to-A transitions. The mutation pattern was similar to that previously reported for A3B, with a preference for the GA context. In summary, these observations suggest that changing 4 residues in the amino terminus of A3B not only retargets the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm but also enhances its ability to restrict HIV while retaining inhibition of retrotransposition.","['Pak, Vladimir', 'Heidecker, Gisela', 'Pathak, Vinay K', 'Derse, David']","['Pak V', 'Heidecker G', 'Pathak VK', 'Derse D']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, P.O.

After 1 or 2 cycles, 45 of 126 evaluable patients (36%) achieved complete remission (CR), 12 partial remission (10%), and 66 (52%) were refractory. One treatment-related death was observed, and 2 patients were withdrawn before evaluation. A total of 80% of the CR patients were transferred to stem cell transplantation (SCT). Overall survival was 24% at 1 year (11% at 6 years). After subsequent SCT in CR, survival was 31% and relapse-free survival 37% at 3 years. Transplantation-related mortality was 11%. Neurologic toxicities of grade I-IV/grade III-IV were observed in 13%/4% of the cycles and 16%/7% of the patients.

Lymph node CLL samples were also CD160(+). Using the disease-specific expression of CD5, CD23, and CD160, a score of 3 characterized CLL (diagnostic odds ratio, 1430); a score of 0 excluded CLL, MCL, and HCL; and the CD23/CD5 ratio differentiated CLL from leukemic CD23(+) MCL.

In transformed cells, BCR-ABL suppresses apoptosis as well as autophagy, a catabolic process in which cellular components are degraded by the lysosomal machinery. The mechanism by which BCR-ABL suppresses autophagy is not known. Here we report that in both mouse and human BCR-ABL-transformed cells, activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5), a prosurvival factor, suppresses autophagy but does not affect apoptosis. We find that BCR-ABL, through PI3K/AKT/FOXO4 signaling, transcriptionally up-regulates ATF5 expression and that ATF5, in turn, stimulates transcription of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; also called mechanistic target of rapamycin), a well-established master negative-regulator of autophagy. Previous studies have shown that the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate induces both apoptosis and autophagy, and that the resultant autophagy modulates the efficiency by which imatinib kills BCR-ABL-transformed cells. We demonstrate that imatinib-induced autophagy is because of inhibition of the BCR-ABL/PI3K/AKT/FOXO4/ATF5/mTOR pathway that we have identified in this study.","['Sheng, Zhi', 'Ma, Leyuan', 'Sun, Jiaoyuan E', 'Zhu, Lihua J', 'Green, Michael R']","['Sheng Z', 'Ma L', 'Sun JE', 'Zhu LJ', 'Green MR']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA115817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01CA115817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATF5 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Atf5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Autophagy', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC3172800,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/11/04 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40709-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-322537 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 8;118(10):2840-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-322537.

Both oncogene and TOI-specific miR30-based shRNA are under the control of the strong viral long terminal repeat promoter, resulting in a single shared RNA transcript. Using this vector in a murine syngeneic BM transplantation model for BCR-ABL-induced chronic myeloid leukemia, we find that oncogene expression and target knockdown in primary hematopoietic cells with this vector is efficient both in vitro and in vivo, and demonstrate that Raf1, but not BRAF, modulates BCR-ABL-dependent ERK activation and transformation of hematopoietic cells.

DNP(24)-BSA, thapsigargin, ionomycin, compound 48/80 and PMA were used as inducers for histamine release from mast cell. In our study, aegeline inhibited the histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells induced by DNP(24)-BSA. Indeed, aegeline showed strong inhibition when RBL-2H3 cells induced by Ca(2+) stimulants such as thapsigargin and ionomycin. Aegeline is suggested to influence the intracellular Ca(2+) pool only since could not inhibit the (45)Ca(2+) influx into RBL-2H3 cells. Aegeline showed weak inhibitory effects on the histamine release from RPMCs, even though still succeed to inhibit when the histamine release induced by thapsigargin. These findings indicate that aegeline altered the signaling pathway related to the intracellular Ca(2+) pool in which thapsigargin acts. Based on the results, the inhibitory effects of aegeline on the histamine release from mast cells depended on the type of mast cell and also involved some mechanisms related to intracellular Ca(2+) signaling events via the same target of the action of thapsigargin or downstream process of intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in mast cells.","['Nugroho, Agung Endro', 'Riyanto, Sugeng', 'Sukari, Mohamad Aspollah', 'Maeyama, Kazutaka']","['Nugroho AE', 'Riyanto S', 'Sukari MA', 'Maeyama K']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Jogjakarta, Indonesia. agungendronugroho@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Pakistan,Pak J Pharm Sci,Pakistan journal of pharmaceutical sciences,9426356,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '4091-50-3 (p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '60T59LN3SG (aegeline)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aegle/*chemistry', 'Amides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dinitrophenols/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Herb-Drug Interactions', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Ionomycin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'p-Methoxy-N-methylphenethylamine/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/09/16 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Pak J Pharm Sci. 2011 Jul;24(3):359-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLF1 and its physiologic partner, cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC) are secreted as a heterodimer and engage the tripartite signaling complex of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIFR) and gp130. Ligation of this receptor complex leads to activation of the STAT3 and MAPK pathways and mediates survival pathways in neurons. Mutations in CLF1, CLC, or CNTFR in mice lead to the birth of mice that die on post-natal day 1 because of an inability to nurse. These animals exhibit significant decreases in the number of motor neurons in the facial nucleus and the spinal cord. CLF1 or CLC deficiency is associated with the development of the human cold-induced sweating syndromes. A growing body of research suggests that CLF1 expression may be associated with several post-natal disease processes. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of CLF1 expression and suggest future studies to understand the potentially important role of CLF1 in postnatal life and disease.","['Kass, Daniel J']",['Kass DJ'],"['Dorothy P. and Richard P.

P-gp acts as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump and reduces the intracellular concentration of structurally unrelated drugs inside the cells. Therefore, there is an urgent need for development of new compound that are less toxic and effective against drug resistance in cancer. Preclinical studies have shown that quinoline derivatives possess anticancer activities. Here, we report the antitumor potential of quinoline derivative, 2-(2-Methyl-quinolin-4ylamino)-N-phenyl acetamide (S4). To evaluate the cytotoxic potential of S4, we used four different cell lines (Hela, HCT-116, CCRF-CEM, and CEM/ADR 5000) in vitro, and showed that S4 kills doxorubicin resistant T lymphoblastic leukemia cell, CEM/ADR 5000 in a concentration dependent manner while others remains unaffected. Moreover, S4 induces apoptosis in CEM/ADR 5000 cells through generation reactive oxygen species (ROS). This is substantiated by the fact that the antioxidant N-acetyle-cysteine (NAC) completely blocks ROS generation and, subsequently, abrogates S4 induced apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo treatment with S4 significantly increases the life span of swiss albino mice bearing sensitive and doxorubicin resistant subline of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. In addition, intraperitoneal application of S4 in mice does not show any systemic toxicity at concentrations that in preliminary trials in a mice Ehrlich ascites carcinoma model. Therefore, present report provides evidence that S4, a quinoline derivative, may be a promising new therapeutic agent against drug resistant cancers.","['Ganguly, Avishek', 'Banerjee, Kaushik', 'Chakraborty, Paramita', 'Das, Satyajit', 'Sarkar, Avijit', 'Hazra, Abhijit', 'Banerjee, Maitrayee', 'Maity, Arindam', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Mondal, Nirup B', 'Choudhuri, Soumitra Kumar']","['Ganguly A', 'Banerjee K', 'Chakraborty P', 'Das S', 'Sarkar A', 'Hazra A', 'Banerjee M', 'Maity A', 'Chatterjee M', 'Mondal NB', 'Choudhuri SK']","['Department of In Vitro Carcinogenesis and Cellular Chemotherapy, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, 37, S.P.

Such viruses would share receptor usage with the recombinant FeLV-B subgroup, a viral subgroup that arises in vivo by recombination between exogenous subgroup A virus (FeLV-A) and endogenous FeLV. Accordingly, all isolates of FeLV-B made to date have contained a ""helper"" FeLV-A, consistent with their recombinatorial origin. In order to assess whether endogenous viruses are transmitted between cats, we examined primary isolates of FeLV for which the viral subgroup had been determined for the presence of a subgroup B virus that lacked an FeLV-A. Here we describe the identification of two primary field isolates of FeLV (2518 and 4314) that appeared to contain subgroup B virus only by classical interference assays, raising the possibility of between-host transmission of endogenous FeLV. Sequencing of the env gene and U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR) confirmed that both viral genomes contained endogenous viral env genes. However the viral 3' LTRs appeared exogenous in origin with a putative 3' recombination breakpoint residing at the 3' end of the env gene. Further, the FeLV-2518 virions also co-packaged a truncated FeLV-A genome containing a defective env gene, termed FeLV-2518(A) whilst no helper subgroup A viral genome was detected in virions of FeLV-4314. The acquisition of an exogenous LTR by the endogenous FeLV in 4314 may have allowed a recombinant FeLV variant to outgrow an exogenous FeLV-A virus that was presumably present during first infection. Given time, a similar evolution may also occur within the 2518 isolate. The data suggest that endogenous FeLVs may be mobilised by acquisition of exogenous LTRs yielding novel viruses that type biologically as FeLV-B.","['Stewart, H', 'Jarrett, O', 'Hosie, M J', 'Willett, B J']","['Stewart H', 'Jarrett O', 'Hosie MJ', 'Willett BJ']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Bearsden Road, Glasgow G61 1QH, United Kingdom. h.stewart.1@research.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['BB/D008425/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0300387/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cats/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Immunoblotting/veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*growth & development/physiology', 'Leukemia, Feline/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2011/12/29 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(11)00208-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2011 Oct 15;143(3-4):325-31. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.06.011.

RESULTS: SeqGene, a new data mining tool, supports mutation detection and annotation, dbSNP and 1000 Genome data integration, RNA-Seq expression quantification, mutation and coverage visualization, allele specific expression (ASE), differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identification, copy number variation (CNV) analysis, and gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) detection. We also developed novel methods for testing the association between SNP and expression and identifying genotype-controlled DEGs. We showed that the results generated from SeqGene compares favourably to other existing methods in our case studies. CONCLUSION: SeqGene is designed as a general-purpose software package. It supports both paired-end reads and single reads generated on most sequencing platforms; it runs on all major types of computers; it supports arbitrary genome assemblies for arbitrary organisms; and it scales well to support both large and small scale sequencing projects.

In an in vitro experiment, antiproliferative effects of these compounds were assessed on the human breast carcinoma MCF-7 and murine leukemia L1210 cell lines. Serum MDA and vitamins A, E, and C levels did not change by the treatments. However, in the kidney and liver tissues, MDA levels were higher, whereas vitamin levels were lower in treatment groups, compared to the control group. All compounds inhibited cell proliferation of MCF-7 and L1210 cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In conclusion, SB derivatives tested in the current study induced oxidative stress in vivo and exhibited anti-proliferative effects in an in vitro culture system.","['Turan, Nevin', 'Topcu, M Fatih', 'Ergin, Zuhal', 'Sandal, Suleyman', 'Tuzcu, Mehmet', 'Akpolat, Nusret', 'Yilmaz, Bayram', 'Sekerci, Memet', 'Karatepe, Mustafa']","['Turan N', 'Topcu MF', 'Ergin Z', 'Sandal S', 'Tuzcu M', 'Akpolat N', 'Yilmaz B', 'Sekerci M', 'Karatepe M']","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Arts, Mus Alparslan University, Mus, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Schiff Bases)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (Vitamins)', '14IAC3GH7G (1,3,4-thiadiazole)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Coordination Complexes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Ligands', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/blood/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Schiff Bases/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Thiadiazoles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Vitamins/blood/metabolism']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2012/01/06 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/01480545.2011.564177 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2011 Oct;34(4):369-78. doi: 10.3109/01480545.2011.564177.

MLL rearrangements include chromosomal translocations, gene internal duplications, chromosome 11q deletions or inversions and MLL gene insertions into other chromosomes, or vice versa. MLL fusion partners can be classified into four distinct categories: nuclear proteins, cytoplasmatic proteins, histone acetyltransferases and septins. Five different septin genes (SEPT2, SEPT5, SEPT6, SEPT9, and SEPT11) have been identified as MLL fusion partners, giving rise to chimeric fusion proteins in which the N terminus of MLL is fused, in frame, to almost the entire open reading frame of the septin partner gene. The rearranged alleles result from heterogeneous breaks in distinct introns of both MLL and its septin fusion partner, originating distinct gene fusion variants. MLL-SEPTIN rearrangements have been repeatedly identified in de novo and therapy related myeloid neoplasia in both children and adults, and some clinicopathogenetic associations are being uncovered. The fundamental roles of septins in cytokinesis, membrane remodeling and compartmentalization can provide some clues on how abnormalities in the septin cytoskeleton and MLL deregulation could be involved in the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies.","['Cerveira, Nuno', 'Bizarro, Susana', 'Teixeira, Manuel R']","['Cerveira N', 'Bizarro S', 'Teixeira MR']","['Department of Genetics, Portuguese Oncology Institute, Porto, Portugal.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Gene Fusion/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Septins/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2011/07/01 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/07/01 06:00'],"['2011/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1515/BC.2011.072 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 2011 Aug;392(8-9):713-24. doi: 10.1515/BC.2011.072.

Somatic mutations may influence the clinical phenotype but are not included in current prognostic scoring systems. METHODS: We used a combination of genomic approaches, including next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based genotyping, to identify mutations in samples of bone marrow aspirate from 439 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. We then examined whether the mutation status for each gene was associated with clinical variables, including specific cytopenias, the proportion of blasts, and overall survival. RESULTS: We identified somatic mutations in 18 genes, including two, ETV6 and GNAS, that have not been reported to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. A total of 51% of all patients had at least one point mutation, including 52% of the patients with normal cytogenetics. Mutations in RUNX1, TP53, and NRAS were most strongly associated with severe thrombocytopenia (P<0.001 for all comparisons) and an increased proportion of bone marrow blasts (P<0.006 for all comparisons). In a multivariable Cox regression model, the presence of mutations in five genes retained independent prognostic significance: TP53 (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 3.84), EZH2 (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.33), ETV6 (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.86), RUNX1 (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.15), and ASXL1 (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.89). CONCLUSIONS: Somatic point mutations are common in myelodysplastic syndromes and are associated with specific clinical features. Mutations in TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, and ASXL1 are predictors of poor overall survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, independently of established risk factors.

The identification of prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers may help stratify patients so that therapy can be individualized. METHODS: Serum samples from patients enrolled in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303 phase 3 trial, ""Randomized Study of Gemcitabine With Versus Without Bevacizumab in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Adenocarcinoma of the Pancreas"" were used to discover novel biomarkers. For the discovery phase, 40 sera were selected based on length of survival and type of therapy, and subjected to liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS-MS). The top features (proteins) were then further selected for validation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Quantification by nano-LC-MS-MS resulted in 1452 peptides mapping to 156 proteins across all 40 samples, 92 of which had 2 or more peptides. After curation of the data, the authors selected 1 putative prognostic protein, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (AACT), and 2 putative predictive proteins, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) and complement factor H (CFH), for validation by ELISA. AACT was found to be negatively correlated with overall survival (tau = -0.30 [-0.38, -0.22]; P < .00001). There was no evidence for interaction with bevacizumab and HRG, but there was some evidence for a weak positive correlation of HRG with overall survival (tau = 0.11 [0.03, 0.19]; P < .01). CFH was found to be neither a predictive nor a prognostic factor for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: AACT may be a useful prognostic marker in patients with advanced stage pancreatic carcinoma, although additional validation studies are needed.","['Roberts, Andrew S', 'Campa, Michael J', 'Gottlin, Elizabeth B', 'Jiang, Chen', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Kindler, Hedy L', 'Venook, Alan P', 'Goldberg, Richard M', ""O'Reilly, Eileen M"", 'Patz, Edward F Jr']","['Roberts AS', 'Campa MJ', 'Gottlin EB', 'Jiang C', 'Owzar K', 'Kindler HL', 'Venook AP', 'Goldberg RM', ""O'Reilly EM"", 'Patz EF Jr']","['Department of Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA7765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*diagnosis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis', 'alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin/blood']",PMC3184330,['NIHMS296206'],2011/06/30 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/30 06:00'],"['2011/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26270 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jan 15;118(2):571-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26270.

Today, the most extensively documented association of the exosome with disease is still its targeting by the immune system of such patients. The highest frequency of autoantibodies to components of the exosome complex is found in polymyositis-scleroderma overlap patients and therefore the exosome is termed PM/Scl autoantigen in the autoimmune field. More recently, one of the core components of the exosome was identified as a protein associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Sixteen of the twenty SMNs were acute myeloid leukemias or myelodysplasias, and 9 of these had either monosomy 7 (n=7) or 7q deletions (n=2). In Cox multivariate analysis longer duration of oral MTX/6MP maintenance therapy (p=0.02; being longest for standard risk patients) and presence of high-hyperdiploidy (p=0.07) were related to an increased risk of SMN. In 524 patients we determined the erythrocyte activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which methylates 6MP and its metabolites, and thus reduces cellular levels of cytotoxic 6-thioguanine nucleotides. The TPMT activity was significantly lower in those that did compared to those that did not develop an SMN (Median: 12.1 vs 18.1 IU/ml; p=0.02). Among 427 TPMT wild type patients, those who developed SMN received higher 6MP doses than the remaining (69.7 vs 60.4 mg/m(2), p=0.03), which may reflect increased levels of methylated metabolites that inhibit purine de novo synthesis and thus enhance incorporation of 6-thioguanine nucleotides into DNA. In conclusion, the duration and intensity of 6MP/MTX maintenance therapy of childhood ALL may influence the risk of SMN.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld']",['Schmiegelow K'],"['Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Gynecology, Obstetrics and Pediatrics, and the Department of Pediatrics, the University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,PMC3113279,,2011/06/30 06:00,2011/06/30 06:01,['2011/06/30 06:00'],"['2011/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2011.020 [doi]', 'mjhid-3-1-e2011020 [pii]']",ppublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2011;3(1):e2011020. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2011.020.

Because ASXL1 lesions have been increasingly identified in myeloid neoplasms, we examined the relationships of ASXL1 mutation or deletion to both clinical phenotype and associated molecular features in 166 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. DESIGN AND METHODS: Exon 12 of ASXL1 was amplified from neutrophil genomic DNA and bidirectionally sequenced in 77 patients with myelofibrosis (including patients with primary and post-essential thrombocytosis or post-polycythemia myelofibrosis), 42 patients with polycythemia vera, 41 with essential thrombocytosis and 6 with post-myelofibrosis acute myeloid leukemia. Pyrosequencing assays were designed to determine the allele percentages of JAK2 V617F (G5073770T), ASXL1 2475dupA, and ASXL1 2846_2847del in neutrophil genomic DNA samples. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with wild-type and ASXL1 mutations were then compared. RESULTS: We identified nonsense mutations or hemizygous deletion of ASXL1 in 36% of the patients with myelofibrosis, but very rarely among those with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocytosis. Among the patients with myelofibrosis, those with ASXL1 lesions were not distinguished from their wild-type counterparts with regard to JAK2 V617F status, exposure to chemotherapy or evolution to leukemia. Myelofibrosis patients with ASXL1 lesions were more likely to have received anemia-directed therapy compared to those without lesions [15/26 (58%) versus 11/39 (23%); P=0.02]. Using serial banked samples and quantitative ASXL1 mutant allele burden assays, we observed the acquisition and accumulation of ASXL1 mutations over time in two patients with post-essential thrombocytosis myelofibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: ASXL1 haploinsufficiency is associated with a myelofibrosis phenotype in the context of other known and unknown lesions, and disruption of ASXL1 function may contribute to the disease pathogenesis of myelofibrosis.","['Stein, Brady L', 'Williams, Donna M', ""O'Keefe, Christine"", 'Rogers, Ophelia', 'Ingersoll, Roxann G', 'Spivak, Jerry L', 'Verma, Amit', 'Maciejewski, Jarek P', 'McDevitt, Michael A', 'Moliterno, Alison R']","['Stein BL', 'Williams DM', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Rogers O', 'Ingersoll RG', 'Spivak JL', 'Verma A', 'Maciejewski JP', 'McDevitt MA', 'Moliterno AR']","['Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['K12HL087169-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082995/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL082995/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA108671/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 HL087169/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polycythemia Vera/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC3186307,,2011/06/30 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/06/30 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.045591 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.045591 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Oct;96(10):1462-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.045591.

In the present study, we find a role for interleukin 7 (IL-7) in protecting T cells from these changes and further define involved signaling pathways. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated the ability of IL-7 treatment to prevent the gain of suppressive function and phenotypic alterations in human T cells after a short coculture with tumor cells in vitro. We then used inhibitors of components of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway and short interfering RNA knockdown of Mcl-1 and Bim to evaluate the role of these signaling pathways in IL-7 protection. RESULTS: We found that IL-7 inhibits CD27/CD28 loss and maintains proliferative capacity, IL-2 production, and reduced suppressive function. The protective ability of IL-7 depended on activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which inhibited activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, which, in turn, prevented the phosphorylation and loss of Mcl-1. We further showed a key role for Mcl-1 in that its knockdown or inhibition abrogated the effects of IL-7. In addition, knockdown of the Mcl-1 binding partner and proapoptotic protein Bim protected T cells from these dysfunctional alterations. CONCLUSION: These observations confirm the role for Bcl-2 family members in cytokine signaling and suggest that IL-7 treatment in combination with other immunotherapies could lead to new clinical strategies to maintain normal T-cell function and reduce tumor-induced generation of dysfunctional and suppressor T cells.","['Zhang, Yue', 'Pfannenstiel, Lukas W', 'Bolesta, Elzbieta', 'Montes, Carolina L', 'Zhang, Xiaoyu', 'Chapoval, Andrei I', 'Gartenhaus, Ronald B', 'Strome, Scott E', 'Gastman, Brian R']","['Zhang Y', 'Pfannenstiel LW', 'Bolesta E', 'Montes CL', 'Zhang X', 'Chapoval AI', 'Gartenhaus RB', 'Strome SE', 'Gastman BR']","['Institutes of Head and Neck, Dermatology and Plastic Surgery, Taussig Cancer Center and Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA132796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132796-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA132796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3R3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/*metabolism']",PMC3149850,['NIHMS302814'],2011/06/30 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/30 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-3328 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3328 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 1;17(15):4975-86. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3328.

NT5C2 inactivates ara-C by dephosphorylating ara-C monophosphate to ara-C. In this study, we sequenced NT5C2 in genomic DNA samples from International HapMap project panels with European [Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEU); n = 90] or African [Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); n = 90] ancestry. We identified 41 genetic variants [one insertion-deletion and 40 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)], including three nonsynonymous SNPs (Y3A, K47R, and Q136R). Twenty-five SNPs were novel and 16 overlapped with the HapMap data. Subjects with African ancestry had NT5C2 mRNA expression levels that was significantly higher than those with European ancestry (p = 0.005). Furthermore, there was a correlation between NT5C2 mRNA expression and ara-C sensitivity in CEU but not in YRI cell lines. None of the nonsynonymous SNPs demonstrated any effect on NT5C2 activity. The genotypes of several SNPs were significantly associated with NT5C2 mRNA expression and/or ara-C sensitivity in CEU cell lines, but very few were significant in YRI cell lines. Of most interest, SNPs (linkage disequilibrium group CEU.12) in the 5'-untranslated region were associated with NT5C2 expression and ara-C sensitivity in HapMap cell lines and with NT5C2 mRNA expression and ara-C sensitivity in diagnostic leukemic blasts from pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Functional genomics analysis demonstrated that the promoter SNP rs11191612 was associated with altered luciferase activation in reporter assays and altered DNA-protein binding in gel shift assays. These results suggest that genetic variations in NT5C2 influence its expression and, potentially, cellular responses to nucleoside analogs.","['Mitra, Amit K', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Feldberg, Tanya', 'Ghodke, Yogita', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William', 'Dolan, M Eileen', 'Hartford, Christine', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Campana, Dario', 'Downing, James', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Lamba, Jatinder K']","['Mitra AK', 'Crews KR', 'Pounds S', 'Cao X', 'Feldberg T', 'Ghodke Y', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Dolan ME', 'Hartford C', 'Raimondi S', 'Campana D', 'Downing J', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Lamba JK']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01-CA132946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132946-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132946-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA132946-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5C2 protein, human)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics"", 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytosol/*enzymology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Exons/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC3186292,,2011/06/30 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/30 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['jpet.111.182873 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.111.182873 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2011 Oct;339(1):9-23. doi: 10.1124/jpet.111.182873.

However, these parameters have some limits. Flow cytometry has been recently included in the diagnostic panel for MDS, and its prognostic significance is under evaluation. METHODS: Marrow aspirates from 424 MDS patients were analyzed by flow cytometry to evaluate the impact of bone marrow cell immunophenotype on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS). The immature compartment of myeloblasts was analyzed by the quantitative expression of CD34 (<3% vs. >/=3%), CD117, and CD11b(-) /CD66b(-) (<5% vs. >/=5%); myeloid maturation was analyzed by the expression of CD11b(+) /CD66b(++) (<15% vs. >/=15%) and CD11b(+) /CD66b(+) (<25% vs. >/=25%). RESULTS: In univariate analysis, the expression of immaturity markers (CD34(+) , CD117(+) , and CD11b(-) /CD66b(-) ) was associated with shorter LFS and OS (P < 0.0001); higher expression of differentiation markers (CD11b(+) /CD66b(++) and CD11b(+) /CD66b(+) ) was associated with longer LFS (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively) and OS (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, expression of CD34(+) (P = 0.007), CD117(+) (P = 0.013), and CD11b(+) /CD66b(++) (P = 0.023) retained independent prognostic value for OS, while only the expression of CD34(+) was a prognostic factor for LFS (P = 0.0003). Two different risk groups were defined according to the presence of 0-1 or >/=2 of these factors with significant different LFS and OS (P < 0.0001). This score showed prognostic value in predicting survival even in subanalysis according to IPSS and WHO subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric analysis in MDS may provide meaningful prognostic information. Blast percentage expressed as CD117(+) or CD34(+) cells and the quantitative assessment of myeloid maturation showed prognostic value for survival.","['Falco, Patrizia', 'Levis, Alessandro', 'Stacchini, Alessandra', 'Ciriello, Maria M', 'Geuna, Massimo', 'Notari, Patrizia', 'Omede, Paola', 'Pautasso, Marisa', 'Prato, Giuseppina', 'Strola, Giuliana', 'Gioia, Daniela', 'Bonferroni, Margherita', 'Cametti, Gianni', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Freilone, Roberto', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Marinone, Carlo', 'Marmont, Filippo', 'Pollio, Berardino', 'Salvi, Flavia', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Girotto, Mauro']","['Falco P', 'Levis A', 'Stacchini A', 'Ciriello MM', 'Geuna M', 'Notari P', 'Omede P', 'Pautasso M', 'Prato G', 'Strola G', 'Gioia D', 'Bonferroni M', 'Cametti G', 'Ferrero D', 'Freilone R', 'Gaidano G', 'Marinone C', 'Marmont F', 'Pollio B', 'Salvi F', 'Saglio G', 'Girotto M']","['Division of Hematology and Transfusional Medicine ASLTO4, Via Marchesi della Rocca 30, Cirie, Turin. pfalco@aslto4.piemonte.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",,,2011/06/30 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/30 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01676.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Nov;87(5):409-18. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01676.x.

Sequence analysis of the complete proviral genomes revealed several unique genetic characteristics of the present two isolates, demonstrating that the two viruses were derived from recombination between earlier Chinese ALV-J and endogenous virus sequences. The two recombinant viruses presented typical genetic organization of replication-competent genus Alpharetrovirus, and the gag and pol genes were well conserved with those of ALVs. The env genes of the two viruses were composed of the internal identical sequences (about 240 bp) of endogenous viruses, and the rest of the sequence belonged to subgroup J ALVs. The long terminal repeats of the two viruses were more closely related to HPRS-103 and earlier Chinese ALV-J than other subgroup ALVs, and multiple transcription regulatory elements of ALV-J were highly conserved. In addition, the two viruses shared an almost identical 3'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence with earlier Chinese ALV-J strains and the US strain 4817, containing a ~127 bp deletion in the E element region. However, further comparison with endogenous ALV indicated that the 3'-UTR sequences with ~127 bp deletion of ALV-J were most probably derived from endogenous viruses by recombination. These results suggested that the two isolates can be characterized as recombinant ALV-J with the internal env gene and 3'-UTR sequence of endogenous ALV.","['Liu, Chaonan', 'Zheng, Shimin', 'Wang, Yongqiang', 'Jing, Long', 'Gao, Honglei', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Qin, Liting', 'Pan, Wei', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Liu C', 'Zheng S', 'Wang Y', 'Jing L', 'Gao H', 'Gao Y', 'Qi X', 'Qin L', 'Pan W', 'Wang X']","['Division of Avian infectious Diseases, National Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150001, P.R.

Cell viability was estimated by MTT assay. We found that the ESB inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A series of well-documented morphological changes, such as cell shrinkage, condensation of nuclear chromatin, and nuclear fragmentation, were observed by fluorescence microscopy. The gold standard scanning electron micrographs showed apoptotic bodies and formation of blebs. Cell cycle analysis showed a significant increase in Sub G(0) population of cells above 50 mug/ml. ESB treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in annexin V positive cells. Increase in intracellular ROS production up to sixfold was detected in ESB-treated HL60 cells by DCFH-DA assay. Dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential of intact cells accompanied by increase in cytosolic cytochrome c was observed, which was followed by activation of caspase-9 and -3 but not caspase-8. DNA fragmentation analysis revealed typical ladders as early as 18 h indicative of caspase-3 role in the apoptotic pathway. The overall results suggest that ESB induces mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway in HL60 cells and might have therapeutic value against human leukemia.","['Agrawal, Satyam Kumar', 'Agrawal, Madhunika', 'Sharma, Parduman Raj', 'Gupta, Bishan Datt', 'Arora, Saroj', 'Saxena, Ajit Kumar']","['Agrawal SK', 'Agrawal M', 'Sharma PR', 'Gupta BD', 'Arora S', 'Saxena AK']","['Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine, Jammu, India. satyamka@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Erythrina/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Bark/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plant Stems/*chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects']",,,2011/06/30 06:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/06/30 06:00'],"['2011/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2011.573900 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2011;63(5):802-13. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2011.573900.

Sick infants have increased levels of cytokines in their cerebrospinal fluid that correlate with poor neurological outcome. In this study, we investigated the role of neuroinflammation and more specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the amplification of subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) neural precursors after neonatal brain injury. METHODS: Neonatal hypoxia/ischemia (H/I) was induced in P6 rat pups, and IL-6 was quantified with or without indomethacin administration. Neural precursor responses were evaluated by neurosphere assays as well as by stereological analyses. Studies were performed to determine how IL-6 and leukemia-inhibiting factor (LIF) affect SVZ cell expansion, proliferation, and self-renewal. RESULTS: Consistent with earlier studies, medially situated SVZ cells expanded after H/I. Contrary to our expectations, indomethacin significantly decreased both the initial reactive increase in these precursors and their ability to self-renew. By contrast, indomethacin increased proliferation in the SGZ and lateral SVZ. Indomethacin diminished the accumulation of microglia/macrophages and IL-6 production after H/I. In vitro IL-6 enhanced neurosphere growth, self-renewal, and tripotentiality and was more effective than LIF in promoting self-renewal. Enhanced precursor self-renewal also was obtained using prostaglandin E2, which is downstream of cyclooxygenase 2 and a target of indomethacin. INTERPRETATION: These data implicate neuroinflammation and in particular IL-6 as a positive effector of primitive neural precursor expansion after neonatal brain injury. These findings have important clinical implications, as indomethacin and other anti-inflammatory agents are administered to premature infants for a variety of reasons.","['Covey, Matthew V', 'Loporchio, Dean', 'Buono, Krista D', 'Levison, Steven W']","['Covey MV', 'Loporchio D', 'Buono KD', 'Levison SW']","['Department of Neurology and Neurosciences, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-New Jersey Medical School, 205 South Orange Avenue, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HD052064-01A2/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', '5R01MH059950/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD052064/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH059950-10/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH059950/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH059950-09/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Neurol,Annals of neurology,7707449,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cerebral Ventricles/*cytology/drug effects', 'Hippocampus/*cytology/drug effects', 'Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain/*immunology/*physiopathology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3522429,['NIHMS294319'],2011/06/29 06:00,2012/01/05 06:00,['2011/06/29 06:00'],"['2009/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ana.22473 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Neurol. 2011 Oct;70(4):616-26. doi: 10.1002/ana.22473.

We reviewed our experiences to re-assess the risk factors of TLS and the efficacy of rasburicase. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 396 children who were diagnosed as positive with acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma between the years 2000 and 2009. The risk factors for TLS were analyzed statistically, and those before and after the availability of rasburicase were compared. Sixty eight patients (17.2%) had TLS. Multivariate analysis showed that pre-chemotherapy hypophosphatemia was a risk factor for TLS, in addition to the known risk factors of hyperuricemia and high lactate dehydrogenase concentration. The availability of rasburicase as a rescue therapy did not negate the importance of uric acid as a risk factor of TLS. Rasburicase as a second line treatment for intractable hyperuricemia was not effective in reducing the incidence of TLS.

After the comprehensive screening of JL1 Ag in the human thymocyte cDNA library, multiple fusion gene constructs encoding human CD43 were generated to identify its specific epitope to JL1 antibody. JL1 antibody interacted with a developmentally regulated and non-glycosylated epitope of the human CD43 extracellular domain (AA 73-81, EGSPLWTSI). In an in vivo leukemia model using NOD/SCID mice injected with CCRF-CEM7 cells, JL1 antibody induced effective cytotoxicity in tumor cells and prolonged survival (p < 0.05). Saporin conjugation to JL1 antibody effectively depleted tumor cells in in vitro cytotoxic assays and also prolonged survival in a leukemic mouse model (p < 0.001).

T/NKCL is presented with various clinicopathologic features, and in general, associated with a poor clinical outcome. This study aims to analyze the clinical prognostic factors in patients with T/NKCL. From January 1999 to December 2009, a total of 170 patients with T/NKCL, except mycosis fungoides, were included in this retrospective study. The diagnosis was established according to World Health Organization classification. The clinical characteristics and prognostic factors were evaluated. Of the 170 patients, mainly peripheral T-cell lymphoma-unspecified (65 cases), precursor T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (31 cases) and nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL, 19 cases), advanced disease (Ann Arbor stages III-IV) was presented in 68.8% and extranodal involvement was in 71.2% of the patients. According to the international prognostic index (IPI), 77 cases were categorized as high/intermediate or high-risk group. Using the prognostic index for peripheral T-cell lymphoma-unspecified (PIT), 87 cases were classified as group 3 or 4. Most of the initial regimens were CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone)-based chemotherapy (87.6%). Cumulative probability of overall survival at 5 years was 43%, and the median survival time was 44.5 months. Univariate analysis revealed that factors associated with a poor outcome were poor performance status (ECOG > 1) (P = 0.001), advanced disease (P = 0.009), the presence of B symptom (P = 0.001), multiple extranodal involvement (P = 0.005), bone marrow involvement (P = 0.003), elevated lactic dehydrogenase level (P = 0.019), IPI (P < 0.001), PIT (P < 0.001), abnormal white blood cell count (P = 0.016), decreased platelet count (P = 0.005) and serum Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgA positivity (P = 0.016). In the multivariate analysis, PIT (P < 0.001; relative risk, 3.221; 95% CI = 2.115-4.907) and EBV serum IgA (P = 0.049; relative risk, 1.901; 95% CI = 1.002-3.606) remained independent factors predictive for overall survival. The PIT may therefore be a useful index for risk stratification in patients with T/NKCL. The serum EBV antibody test could be a simple and quick marker to predict the outcome of the patients.","['Xu, Peng-Peng', 'Wang, Yan', 'Shen, Yang', 'Wang, Li', 'Shen, Zhi-Xiang', 'Zhao, Wei-Li']","['Xu PP', 'Wang Y', 'Shen Y', 'Wang L', 'Shen ZX', 'Zhao WL']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, 197 Rui Jin Er Road, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/06/29 06:00,2013/06/15 06:00,['2011/06/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2013/06/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12032-011-0011-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol. 2012 Sep;29(3):2176-82. doi: 10.1007/s12032-011-0011-0.

MRD was examined with four-color FCM at different time points in 139 patients (including pediatric and adult patients) with ALL after allo-HSCT. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) was applied to evaluate the MRD of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) patients. Patients who were FCM-positive (FCM+) after transplantation had a lower event-free survival (EFS) of 0.54 and a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of 0.54 compared to an EFS of 0.80 and a CIR of 0.08 in FCM-negative (FCM-) patients (EFS, p < 0.001; CIR, p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained in high-risk patients and Ph+ ALL patients. Moreover, a FCM+ status after the second month post-HSCT (defined as MRD positive) proved to be a predictor of leukemia relapse. Multivariate analysis for EFS, OS and CIR showed that MRD status after transplantation was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.001, p = 0.013, and p < 0.001, respectively). A good correlation was found between the MRD results of FCM and RQ-PCR (n = 126 pairs, Spearman r = 0.8139, p < 0.001). MRD monitoring by four-color FCM post-transplantation is an important tool for relapse prediction in ALL patients. Prompt and appropriate pre-emptive anti-leukemia treatment could be considered based on the status of MRD after HSCT.","['Zhao, Xiao-Su', 'Liu, Yan-Rong', 'Zhu, Hong-Hu', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Liu, Dai-Hong', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Zhao XS', 'Liu YR', 'Zhu HH', 'Xu LP', 'Liu DH', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, No 11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/physiopathology/*prevention & control/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', '*Transplantation, Homologous']",,,2011/06/29 06:00,2012/02/24 06:00,['2011/06/29 06:00'],"['2011/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1285-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2012 Feb;91(2):183-92. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1285-1.

Exercise is beneficial in heart failure (HF) patients and in cancer survivors without HF, but has not been tested in cancer survivors with treatment induced HF. METHODS: We present case studies for two survivors: a 56-year old female Hodgkin's lymphoma survivor (Pt 1) and a 44-year old male leukemia survivor (Pt 2). We conducted a 16-week exercise program with the goal of 30 minutes of exercise performed 3 times per week at a minimum intensity of 50% heart rate reserve (HRR) or '12' rating of perceived exertion (RPE). RESULTS: Pt 1 improved from 11.5 minutes of exercise split over two bouts at an RPE of 14 to a 30 minute bout at an RPE of 15. Pt 2 improved from 11 minutes of exercise split over two bouts at an RPE of 12 to an 18 minute bout at an RPE of 12. Both improved in VO(2) peak (Pt 1: 13.9 to 14.3 mlO(2)/kg/min; Pt 2: 12.5 to 18.7 mlO(2)/kg/min). Ejection fraction increased for Pt 2 (25-30% to 35-40%) but not for Pt 1 (35-40%).

In this study, we show that (i) leukemic CLL cells stimulated with the soluble form of CD40L in vitro show differential responses in terms of upregulation of surface markers (CD95 and CD80) and induction of chemokines (CCL22 and CCL17) expression/secretion, and that (ii) these changes are mirrored by a distinct activation of intracellular signalling pathways including increase in IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation and upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins (BCL-2 and MCL-1). CLL patients can then be segregated into two distinct functional subsets. We defined the responsive subset of cases CD40L dependent, considering the capacity to respond as a sign of persistent need of this stimulation for the leukemic expansion. Conversely, we named the unresponsive cases CD40L independent, considering them less dependent on this microenvironmental signal, presumably because of a higher autonomous proliferative and survival potential. Importantly, we report that (iii) the two functional subsets show an opposite clinical outcome, with CD40L-independent cases having a shorter time to progression. This indicates that the functional differences observed in vitro may reflect a different leukemic potential in vivo likely responsible for a distinct clinical course.","['Scielzo, C', 'Apollonio, B', 'Scarfo, L', 'Janus, A', 'Muzio, M', 'Ten Hacken, E', 'Ghia, P', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F']","['Scielzo C', 'Apollonio B', 'Scarfo L', 'Janus A', 'Muzio M', 'Ten Hacken E', 'Ghia P', 'Caligaris-Cappio F']","['Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, Division of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/06/29 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/06/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011149 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.149 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Nov;25(11):1760-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.149.

It is involved in the treatment of the whole body using a large radiation field with extended source-skin distance. Therefore measuring and monitoring the skin dose during the treatment is important. Two kinds of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (OneDose MOSFET and mobile MOSEFT) dosimeter are used during the treatment delivery to measure the skin dose to specific points and compare it with the target prescribed dose. The objective of this study was to compare the variation of skin dose in patients with acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL) treated with total body irradiation (TBI) using OneDose MOSFET detectors and Mobile MOSFET, and then compare both results with the target prescribed dose. MATERIAL/METHODS: The measurements involved 32 patient's (16 males, 16 females), aged between 14-30 years, with an average age of 22.41 years. One-Dose MOSFET and Mobile MOSFET dosimetry were performed at 10 different anatomical sites on every patient. RESULTS: The results showed there was no variation between skin dose measured with OneDose MOSFET and Mobile MOSFET in all patients. Furthermore, the results showed for every anatomical site selected there was no significant difference in the dose delivered using either OneDose MOSFET detector or Mobile MOSFET as compared to the prescribed dose. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that One-Dose MOSFET detectors and Mobile MOSFET both give a direct read-out immediately after the treatment; therefore both detectors are suitable options when measuring skin dose for total body irradiation treatment.","['Mattar, Essam H', 'Hammad, Lina F', 'Al-Mohammed, Huda I']","['Mattar EH', 'Hammad LF', 'Al-Mohammed HI']","['Radiologic Sciences Department, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiometry/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Skin/*radiation effects', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC3539560,,2011/06/29 06:00,2011/11/05 06:00,['2011/06/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['881833 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.881833 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2011 Jul;17(7):MT51-5. doi: 10.12659/msm.881833.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gp130 family cytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, and IL-11 have been identified as oligodendrocyte growth factors, and IL-11 is also strongly immunoregulatory, but their underlying mechanisms of action are incompletely characterized. In this study, we demonstrate that these effects of IL-11 are mediated via differential regulation of apoptosis in oligodendrocytes versus Ag-presenting dendritic cells (DCs), and are dependent on lineage-specific activity of the transcription factors Stat1 versus Stat3. Focal demyelinating lesions induced in cerebral cortices of IL-11Ralpha(-/-) mice using stereotactic microinjection of lysolecithin were larger than in controls, and remyelination was delayed. In IL-11Ralpha(-/-) mice, lesions displayed extensive oligodendrocyte loss and axonal transection, and increased infiltration by inflammatory cells including CD11c(+) DCs, CD3(+) lymphocytes, and CD11b(+) phagocytes. In oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) cultures, IL-11 restricted caspase 9 activation and apoptosis, and it increased myelination in OPC-neuron cocultures. Importantly, siRNA inhibition of Stat1 enhanced the antiapoptotic effects of IL-11 on OPCs, but IL-11 induced apoptosis in the presence of Stat3 silencing. In contrast, IL-11 augmented caspase activation and apoptosis in cultures of CD11c(+) DCs, but not in CD11b(+) or CD3(+) cells. Inhibition of Stat3 exacerbated the proapoptotic effects of IL-11 on DCs, whereas they were ablated in Stat1(-/-) cultures. Collectively, these findings reveal novel mechanisms underlying the actions of a neuroprotective and immunoregulatory member of the gp130 cytokine family, suggesting avenues to enhance oligodendrocyte viability and restrict CNS inflammation in multiple sclerosis.","['Zhang, Jingya', 'Zhang, Yueting', 'Dutta, Dipankar J', 'Argaw, Azeb T', 'Bonnamain, Virginie', 'Seto, Jeremy', 'Braun, David A', 'Zameer, Andleeb', 'Hayot, Fernand', 'Lopez, Carolina B', 'Raine, Cedric S', 'John, Gareth R']","['Zhang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Dutta DJ', 'Argaw AT', 'Bonnamain V', 'Seto J', 'Braun DA', 'Zameer A', 'Hayot F', 'Lopez CB', 'Raine CS', 'John GR']","['Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 NS062703-01A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008553/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS056074-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046620/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI083284/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS08952/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS056074-01A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS062703-02/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R24CA095823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS062703/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046620-06/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI080917/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI083481/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS056074-02S1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS051147/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS056074-04/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM008553-13/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32NS051147-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI083284/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS056074/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS056074-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI083481/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS008952/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS056074-03/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 CA095823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS056074-02S1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01NS062703/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AI080917/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Demyelinating Diseases/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Targeting/methods', 'Interleukin-11/deficiency/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multiple Sclerosis/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Oligodendroglia/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",PMC3164308,['NIHMS299922'],2011/06/29 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/06/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1004066 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1004066 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2011 Aug 1;187(3):1129-41. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1004066.

In this study, we established murine WEHI-3 leukemia in BALB/c mice and hypothesized that an aqueous HDW extract might have antileukemia effects on leukemic animals in vivo. The major characteristic of leukemic mice was an enlarged spleen after intraperitoneal injection with WEHI-3 cells. HDW extract reduced the weights of spleen and liver, but had no significant effect on body weight in WEHI-3 leukemic mice. HDW extract increased the percentage of CD11b cell surface marker (monocytes), but it reduced the percentage of CD3 (T-cell) and CD19 (B-cell) markers. However, HDW extract did not affect the level of Mac-3 and there was no influence on phagocytosis by macrophages from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the peritoneal cavity in leukemic mice. The isolated splenocytes from HDW extract-treated leukemic mice demonstrated an increase of T- and B-cell proliferation in vivo.

This is the first study to produce national survival estimates for childhood cancer in Australia by remoteness of residence and area-based socioeconomic status. METHODS: The study utilized population-based data from the Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry for children diagnosed with cancer from 1996 onward who were at risk of mortality between January 2001 and December 2006 (n = 6,289). Remoteness was specified according to the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Areas, whereas an index of area disadvantage was obtained from census information. Five-year relative survival estimates were produced by the period method for all cancers and the most common diagnostic groups, with corresponding age-sex adjusted mortality hazard ratios calculated using Poisson regression. RESULTS: Overall, children with cancer from remote/very remote areas had a significantly lower survival rate than their counterparts in major cities (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.08-2.23). Survival was also lower for children with leukemia living in inner regional (HR = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.11-2.08) or outer regional areas (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.03-2.28). There was weak evidence (P(grad) = 0.051) of a trend toward poorer survival by greater area disadvantage for all childhood cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Some variation in prognosis by place of residence was present for children with cancer in Australia, particularly among leukemia patients.

Growing evidence indicates that E4F1 is involved in key signaling pathways commonly deregulated during cell transformation. In this study, we investigate the influence of E4F1 on tumorigenesis. Wild-type mice injected with fetal liver cells from mice lacking CDKN2A, the gene encoding Ink4a/Arf, developed histiocytic sarcomas (HSs), a tumor originating from the monocytic/macrophagic lineage. Cre-mediated deletion of E4F1 resulted in the death of HS cells and tumor regression in vivo and extended the lifespan of recipient animals. In murine and human HS cell lines, E4F1 inactivation resulted in mitochondrial defects and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that triggered massive cell death. Notably, these defects of E4F1 depletion were observed in HS cells but not healthy primary macrophages.

Use of the hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HSCT-CI), which was developed and validated in Seattle, Washington, has been proposed to predict the probability of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) following allo-HSCT. We performed a single-center retrospective study to validate the prognostic impact of HSCT-CI on transplant outcomes in a cohort of high-risk acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing allo-HSCT between January 2000 and December 2008. The median patient age at the time of transplantation was 53 years (range: 11-76 years). The median pretransplantation HSCT-CI score was 4 (range: 0-10). Among 340 patients, OS at 3 years was 29% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17%-41%), 40% (33%-47%), and 44% (41%-47%) in the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk HSCT-CI groups (P = .7), respectively. The corresponding NRM at 3 years was 34% (10%-58%), 32% (20%-44%), and 26% (20%-32%; P = .6). In multivariate analysis, we found no predictive value of HSCT-CI for either OS or NRM.

NPM1 mutation is potentially a superior minimal residual disease (MRD) marker compared to WT1 gene overexpression by being specific to the malignant clone, although experimental evidence published so far includes very limited numbers of relapsed cases. Also, the stability of the NPM1 mutation has been questioned by reports of the mutation being lost at relapse. In the present study we compared NPM1 mutation and WT1 overexpression as MRD markers in 20 cases of relapsed AML. The 20 patients experienced a total of 28 morphological relapses. Karyotypic evolution was detected in 56% of relapses. All relapses were accompanied by high levels of NPM1 mutation, along with high WT1 mRNA levels, thus demonstrating complete stability of both markers during relapse. Detectable NPM1 mutation following a period of morphological remission was accompanied by a morphological relapse in all cases. In contrast, WT1 expression was detected in 33% of the NPM1 mutation negative samples. This background WT1 expression produced by non-leukaemia cells was highly variable, both between and within patients, and limited the de facto sensitivity of the WT1 expression analysis. The present study therefore provides important experimental evidence demonstrating that NPM1 mutation is superior to WT1 overexpression as marker of MRD in NPM1-mutated AML, even in the presence of extensive karyotypic evolution.","['Kristensen, Thomas', 'Moller, Michael B', 'Friis, Lone', 'Bergmann, Olav J', 'Preiss, Birgitte']","['Kristensen T', 'Moller MB', 'Friis L', 'Bergmann OJ', 'Preiss B']","['Department of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/*methods', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2011/06/29 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/29 06:00'],"['2011/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01673.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Nov;87(5):400-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01673.x.

In glioma, IDH1R132H is the most common mutation type, which is associated with younger patient age and longer patient survival compared to wild-type status. Sequencing analyses of carcinomas and lymphomas have detected IDH1 mutations in only a small fraction of cases. In those studies, IDH1R132H was also the most frequent mutation. The aim of the present study was to analyse a comprehensive series of human tumours for IDH1R132H mutation. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1844 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumours, including carcinomas, sarcomas and haematopoietic tumours were investigated immunohistochemically using a mutation-specific antibody for IDH1(R132H).

Regulation of ceramide, S1P and the biochemical steps that modulate the balance and interconversion of these two lipids are major determinants of cell fate, a concept referred to as the ""sphingolipid rheostat."" There is abundant evidence that the sphingolipid rheostat plays a role in the origination, progression and drug resistance patterns of hematopoietic malignancies. The pathway has also been exploited to circumvent the problem of chemotherapy resistance in leukemia and lymphoma. Given the broad effects of sphingolipids, targeting multiple steps in the metabolic pathway may provide possible therapeutic avenues. However, new observations have revealed that sphingolipid signaling effects are more complex than previously recognized, requiring a revision of the sphingolipid rheostat model.

We developed a mouse model of CALM-AF10(+) leukemia to examine the hypothesis that disruption of endocytosis contributes to leukemogenesis. Exclusion of the C-terminal portion of CALM from the fusion protein, which is required for optimal binding to clathrin, resulted in the development of a myeloproliferative disease, whereas inclusion of this domain led to the development of acute myeloid leukemia and changes in gene expression of several cancer-related genes, notably Pim1 and Crebbp. Nonetheless, the development of leukemia could not be attributed directly to interference with endocytosis or consequential changes in proliferation and signaling. In leukemia cells, full-length CALM-AF10 localized to the nucleus with no consistent effect on growth factor endocyctosis, and suppressed histone H3 lysine 79 methylation regardless of the presence of clathrin. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, we show that CALM-AF10 has a propensity to homo-oligomerize, raising the possibility that the function of endocytic proteins involved in chimeric fusions may be to provide dimerization properties, a recognized mechanism for unleashing oncogenic properties of chimeric transcription factors, rather than disrupting the internalization of growth factor receptors.","['Stoddart, A', 'Tennant, T R', 'Fernald, A A', 'Anastasi, J', 'Brodsky, F M', 'Le Beau, M M']","['Stoddart A', 'Tennant TR', 'Fernald AA', 'Anastasi J', 'Brodsky FM', 'Le Beau MM']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. astoddar@bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 GM038093-19/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM038093-23/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM038093/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM038093-22/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM038093/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (AF10-CALM fusion protein, human)', '0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clathrin/*physiology', 'Endocytosis', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism']",PMC3204175,['NIHMS298484'],2011/06/28 06:00,2012/03/21 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011251 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.251 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jan 26;31(4):494-506. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.251.

The MLL-AF4 fusion protein is generated by the translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23), and t(4;11)-positive ALL patients (MLL-AF4 ALL), have a notoriously poorer prognosis compared with patients with other MLL-associated leukemias. The detailed role of this fusion protein in leukemogenesis is not well understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the AF4 3' untranslated regions may modulate MLL-AF4 fusion protein levels, raising the question of whether regulation of these miRNAs are involved in the progression of MLL-AF4 ALL. In this study, we show that miR-143 was identified as a regulator of MLL-AF4 expression in MLL-AF4 ALL samples. Restoration of miR-143 in MLL-AF4-positive RS4;11 and MV4-11 cells induced apoptosis, negatively contributing to leukemia cell growth by reducing MLL-AF4 fusion protein levels. Furthermore, miR-143 was epigenetically repressed by promoter hypermethylation in MLL-AF4-positive primary blasts and cell lines, but not in normal bone marrow cells and MLL-AF4-negative primary blasts, which was directly associated with expression of the MLL-AF4 oncogene. This is the first study to show that miR-143 functions as a tumor suppressor in MLL-AF4 B-cell ALL.

The important role of angiogenesis in leukemia has been reported by several studies. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a large group of endopeptidases which degredate the extracellular matrix and play an important role in angiogenesis. OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to evaluate the patterns of MMP-2 activity in three leukemic cell lines. METHODS: Human leukemic monocyte (U937) and T cells (Molt-4 and Jurkat) were cultured in complete RPMI-1640 medium. The cells were then seeded at a density of 106 cells/ml and were incubated with different concentrations of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (1-25 ng/ml) or phytoheamagglutinin (PHA) (2-10 microg/ml) for 24 hours. The MMP-2 activity in cell-conditioned media was then evaluated by gelatin zymography. Statistical comparisons between groups were made by analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: PHA/PMA significantly and dose-dependently increased MMP-2 activity in U937 cells after 24 hours of incubation compared with untreated control cells. Moreover, PHA/PMA significantly induced MMP-2 activity in Molt-4 and Jurkat cells after 24 hours of incubation in a dose-dependent manner compared with untreated control cells. CONCLUSION: We conclude that human leukemic Jurkat, U937 and Molt-4 cells could potentially display MMP-2 activity with different degrees. Thus, these cell lines could provide an appropriate system to study the mechanisms regulating MMPs production in leukemia patients.","['Hajighasemi, Fatemeh']",['Hajighasemi F'],"['Department of Immunology, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran. resoome@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation', 'Jurkat Cells/*immunology', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/*immunology']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['08 [pii]', 'IJIv8i2A8 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2011 Jun;8(2):120-6. doi: IJIv8i2A8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclic strain-induced TNC expression depends on RhoA-actin signaling, the pathway that regulates transcriptional activity of serum response factor (SRF) by its coactivator megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1). Therefore, we tested whether MKL1 controls TNC transcription. We demonstrate that overexpression of MKL1 strongly induces TNC expression in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and normal HC11 and transformed 4T1 mammary epithelial cells. Part of the induction was dependant on SRF and a newly identified atypical CArG box in the TNC promoter. Another part was independent of SRF but required the SAP domain of MKL1. An MKL1 mutant incapable of binding to SRF still strongly induced TNC, while induction of the SRF target c-fos was abolished. Cyclic strain failed to induce TNC in MKL1-deficient but not in SRF-deficient fibroblasts, and strain-induced TNC expression strongly depended on the SAP domain of MKL1. Promoter-reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments unraveled a SAP-dependent, SRF-independent interaction of MKL1 with the proximal promoter region of TNC, attributing for the first time a functional role to the SAP domain of MKL1 in regulating gene expression.","['Asparuhova, Maria B', 'Ferralli, Jacqueline', 'Chiquet, Matthias', 'Chiquet-Ehrismann, Ruth']","['Asparuhova MB', 'Ferralli J', 'Chiquet M', 'Chiquet-Ehrismann R']","['Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Novartis Research Foundation, Maulbeerstrasse 66, 4058 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)', '0 (Tenascin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Serum Response Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Tenascin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['fj.11-187310 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.11-187310 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2011 Oct;25(10):3477-88. doi: 10.1096/fj.11-187310.

Previously, we showed an abundance of inactive GSK-3 in the human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line. CML is a hematopoietic malignancy caused by an oncogenic Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. In Bcr-Abl signaling, the role of GSK-3 is not well defined. Here, we report that enforced expression of constitutively active GSK-3 reduced proliferation and increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced apoptosis by nearly 1-fold. Bcr-Abl inhibition activated GSK-3 and GSK-3-dependent apoptosis. Inactivation of GSK-3 by Bcr-Abl activity is, therefore, confirmed. To reactivate GSK-3, we used glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) inhibitor PDMP to accumulate endogenous ceramide, a tumor-suppressor sphingolipid and a potent GSK-3 activator. We found that either PDMP or silence of GCS increased Bcr-Abl inhibition-induced GSK-3 activation and apoptosis. Furthermore, PDMP sensitized the most clinical problematic drug-resistant CML T315I mutant to Bcr-Abl inhibitor GNF-2-, imatinib-, or nilotinib-induced apoptosis by >5-fold. Combining PDMP and GNF-2 eliminated transplanted-CML-T315I-mutants in vivo and dose dependently sensitized primary cells from CML T315I patients to GNF-2-induced proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. The synergistic efficacy was Bcr-Abl restricted and correlated to increased intracellular ceramide levels and acted through GSK-3-mediated apoptosis. This study suggests a feasible novel anti-CML strategy by accumulating endogenous ceramide to reactivate GSK-3 and abrogate drug resistance.","['Huang, Wei-Ching', 'Tsai, Cheng-Chieh', 'Chen, Chia-Ling', 'Chen, Tsai-Yun', 'Chen, Ya-Ping', 'Lin, Yee-Shin', 'Lu, Pei-Jung', 'Lin, Chun-Mao', 'Wang, Shwu-Huey', 'Tsao, Chiung-Wen', 'Wang, Chi-Yun', 'Cheng, Yi-Lin', 'Hsieh, Chia-Yuan', 'Tseng, Po-Chun', 'Lin, Chiou-Feng']","['Huang WC', 'Tsai CC', 'Chen CL', 'Chen TY', 'Chen YP', 'Lin YS', 'Lu PJ', 'Lin CM', 'Wang SH', 'Tsao CW', 'Wang CY', 'Cheng YL', 'Hsieh CY', 'Tseng PC', 'Lin CF']","['Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (GNF-2 compound)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (antineoplastic agent K 18)', '19130-96-2 (1-Deoxynojirimycin)', '73257-80-4 (RV 538)', 'ADN3S497AZ (miglustat)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['1-Deoxynojirimycin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', '*Genes, abl/drug effects/physiology', 'Glucosyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Melphalan', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Pyrimidines', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['fj.10-180190 [pii]', '10.1096/fj.10-180190 [doi]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2011 Oct;25(10):3661-73. doi: 10.1096/fj.10-180190.

The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is encoded by the minus strand of the provirus, is involved in both regulation of viral gene transcription and T-cell proliferation. We showed in this report that HBZ interacted with Smad2/3, and enhanced transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad transcriptional responses in a p300-dependent manner. The N-terminal LXXLL motif of HBZ was responsible for HBZ-mediated TGF-beta signaling activation. In a serial immunoprecipitation assay, HBZ, Smad3, and p300 formed a ternary complex, and the association between Smad3 and p300 was markedly enhanced in the presence of HBZ. In addition, HBZ could overcome the repression of the TGF-beta response by Tax. Finally, HBZ expression resulted in enhanced transcription of Pdgfb, Sox4, Ctgf, Foxp3, Runx1, and Tsc22d1 genes and suppression of the Id2 gene; such effects were similar to those by TGF-beta. In particular, HBZ induced Foxp3 expression in naive T cells through Smad3-dependent TGF-beta signaling. Our results suggest that HBZ, by enhancing TGF-beta signaling and Foxp3 expression, enables HTLV-1 to convert infected T cells into regulatory T cells, which is thought to be a critical strategy for virus persistence.","['Zhao, Tiejun', 'Satou, Yorifumi', 'Sugata, Kenji', 'Miyazato, Paola', 'Green, Patrick L', 'Imamura, Takeshi', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Zhao T', 'Satou Y', 'Sugata K', 'Miyazato P', 'Green PL', 'Imamura T', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Smad Proteins, Receptor-Regulated)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smad Proteins, Receptor-Regulated/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3158717,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/10/13 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41101-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-12-326199 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 18;118(7):1865-76. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-12-326199.

Recent developments from the analysis of genomic data on TLX1-specific transcriptional targets and analysis of the molecular mechanisms of TLX1 transformation in human- and mouse-induced leukemias have shown novel insight into the activity of this transcription factor oncogene. Aberrant expression of TLX1 in T-cell progenitors disrupts normal T-cell development and triggers the development of aneuploidy during T-cell transformation. Importantly, the disruption of the mitotic checkpoint in TLX1-induced tumors may be linked not only to the acquisition of secondary genetic alterations in T-ALL but also to increased sensitivity of these tumors to chemotherapy with drugs targeting the formation of the mitotic spindle.","['De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['De Keersmaecker K', 'Ferrando AA']","['Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB, Center for Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA-120196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-129382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/02/04 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/04 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-10-3037 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3037 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Oct 15;17(20):6381-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-3037.

The role of the NF-kappaB pathway in the IL6-independent growth of myeloma cells has not been studied. Because human herpesvirus 8-encoded K13 selectively activates the NF-kappaB pathway, we have used it as a molecular tool to examine the ability of the NF-kappaB pathway to confer IL6 independence on murine plasmacytomas. We demonstrated that ectopic expression of K13, but not its NF-kappaB-defective mutant or a structural homolog, protected plasmacytomas against IL6 withdrawal-induced apoptosis and resulted in emergence of IL6-independent clones that could proliferate long-term in vitro in the absence of IL6 and form abdominal plasmacytomas with visceral involvement when injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic mice. These IL6-independent clones were dependent on NF-kappaB activity for their survival and proliferation but were resistant to dexamethasone and INCB018424, a selective Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor. Ectopic expression of human T cell leukemia virus 1-encoded Tax protein, which resembles K13 in inducing constitutive NF-kappaB activation, similarly protected plasmacytoma cells against IL6 withdrawal-induced apoptosis. Although K13 is known to up-regulate IL6 gene expression, its protective effect was not due to induction of endogenous IL6 production but instead was associated with sustained expression of several antiapoptotic members of the Bcl2 family upon IL6 withdrawal. Collectively, these results demonstrate that NF-kappaB activation cannot only promote the emergence of IL6 independence during myeloma progression but can also confer resistance to dexamethasone and INCB018424.","['Yang, Yanqiang', 'Groshong, Jason S', 'Matta, Hittu', 'Gopalakrishnan, Ramakrishnan', 'Yi, Han', 'Chaudhary, Preet M']","['Yang Y', 'Groshong JS', 'Matta H', 'Gopalakrishnan R', 'Yi H', 'Chaudhary PM']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA139119/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA124621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA139119/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE019811/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 7)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k7 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 7/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitriles', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",PMC3151044,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/05/12 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)57516-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M110.213363 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2011 Aug 12;286(32):27988-97. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110.213363.

Here we report the production of leukemia inhibitory factor-dependent, so-called naive type, pluripotent stem cells from the inner cell mass of porcine blastocysts by up-regulating expression of KLF4 and POU5F1. The alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies resulting from reprogramming resemble mouse embryonic stem cells in colony morphology, cell cycle interval, transcriptome profile, and expression of pluripotent markers, such as POU5F1, SOX2, and surface marker SSEA1. They are dependent on leukemia inhibitory factor signaling for maintenance of pluripotency, can be cultured over extended passage, and have the ability to form teratomas. These cells derived from the inner cell mass of pig blastocysts are clearly distinct from the FGF2-dependent ""primed"" induced pluripotent stem cells described recently from porcine mesenchymal cells. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the up-regulation of KLF4, as well as POU5F1, is required to create and stabilize the naive pluripotent state and may explain why the derivation of embryonic stem cells from pigs and other ungulates has proved so difficult.","['Telugu, Bhanu Prakash V L', 'Ezashi, Toshihiko', 'Sinha, Sunilima', 'Alexenko, Andrei P', 'Spate, Lee', 'Prather, Randall S', 'Roberts, R Michael']","['Telugu BPVL', 'Ezashi T', 'Sinha S', 'Alexenko AP', 'Spate L', 'Prather RS', 'Roberts RM']","['Division of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri 65211-7310.

Cat populations exhibit a great variability in social and spatial structure, the existence of different ways of life within a same population may also result in different epidemiological patterns. To test this hypothesis, we used a logistic regression to analyze the risk factors of Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline herpes virus (FHV), feline calicivirus (FCV), and feline parvovirus (FPV) infection in owned (fed and sheltered) and unowned (neither fed nor sheltered, unsocialized) cats living in a rural environment in the North Eastern part of France. A serological survey was carried out in 492 non-vaccinated and non-sterilized individuals from 15 populations living in the same area. The prevalence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was also studied, but too few were infected to analyze the risk factors of this virus. For each virus, the epidemiological pattern was different in owned and unowned cats. Unowned cats were more frequently infected by directly transmitted viruses like FIV, FHV and FCV (21.22%, 67.66%, 86.52% in unowned cats vs 9.55%, 53.88%, 77.18% in owned cats, respectively), a difference that may be explained by a more solitary and more aggressive behavior in unowned adults, and/or possibly by a higher sensitivity related to a more stressful life. On the contrary, owned cats were more frequently infected with FPV (36.41% in owned cats vs 15.61% in unowned cats), possibly as a result of their concentration around human settlements. The present study showed that owned and unowned cats living in a same area have behavioral and physiological characteristics sufficiently different to influence virus circulation. Pooling different types of cats in a single sample without taking it into account could give a wrong picture of the epidemiology of their viruses. The conclusion of this work can be extended to any epidemiological studies led in wildlife species with flexible behavior as any variations in social or spatial structure, between or within populations, could result in different virus circulation.","['Hellard, E', 'Fouchet, D', 'Santin-Janin, H', 'Tarin, B', 'Badol, V', 'Coupier, C', 'Leblanc, G', 'Poulet, H', 'Pontier, D']","['Hellard E', 'Fouchet D', 'Santin-Janin H', 'Tarin B', 'Badol V', 'Coupier C', 'Leblanc G', 'Poulet H', 'Pontier D']","['Universite de Lyon, Universite Lyon1, CNRS, UMR 5558, Laboratoire de Biometrie et Biologie Evolutive, 43 Bd du 11 Novembre 1918, F-69622, Villeurbanne, France. eleonore.hellard@univ-lyon1.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Prev Vet Med,Preventive veterinary medicine,8217463,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Wild', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Calicivirus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Feline Panleukopenia Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Herpesviridae/*isolation & purification', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Pets', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural Population', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary/virology']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2010/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']","['S0167-5877(11)00148-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.04.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Prev Vet Med. 2011 Sep 1;101(3-4):250-64. doi: 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.04.020.

The bacteria cells products impact on Eukariotic cells was evaluated. The cytometric evaluation demonstrates the membrane ability to avoid the release of bacteria enclosed within the membrane wall. In experiments with treatment of the bacteria with antibiotic to release products from damaged bacteria it was possible to distinguish stages of the applied antibiotic impact on encapsulated bacteria cells. In E. coli following stages were distinguished: induction of membrane permeability to PI, activation of proteases targeting GFP (protein) and subsequent nucleic acids degradation. In the another experiment the evidence was presented of the cytotoxic activity of live Bacillus subtilis encapsulated within the membrane system. The Bacilus products mediated by secreted listeriolysin O (LLO) on the chosen eukaryotic cells was evaluated.

ATLL cells frequently express several molecules that are characteristic of regulatory T cells (Tregs), notably CD4, CD25 and the transcription factor FoxP3. It has therefore recently been suggested that HTLV-1 selectively infects and transforms Tregs. We show that HTLV-1 induces and maintains a high frequency of FoxP3+ T cells by inducing expression of the chemokine CCL22; the frequency is especially high in patients with chronic ATLL. In turn, the FoxP3+ T cells exert both potentially beneficial and harmful effects: they suppress the growth of autologous ATLL clones and may also suppress the host's cytotoxic T lymphocyte response, which normally limits HTLV-1 replication and reduces the risk of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Although ATLL cells may exert immune suppressive effects, we conclude that ATLL is not necessarily a tumour of classical FoxP3+ Tregs.","['Bangham, Charles R M', 'Toulza, Frederic']","['Bangham CR', 'Toulza F']","['Department of Immunology, Imperial College, Norfolk Place, London UK.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/virology']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/10/26 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/26 06:00 [medline]']","['B978-0-12-385524-4.00004-0 [pii]', '10.1016/B978-0-12-385524-4.00004-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 2011;111:163-82. doi: 10.1016/B978-0-12-385524-4.00004-0.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mode of nuclear EGFR action. METHODS: Radiation induced nuclear EGFR-shuttling and EGFR-foci formation was analyzed with immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Composition of gammaH(2)AX-protein complexes was analyzed by western-blotting after immuno-precipitation. Functional relevance of nuclear EGFR was analyzed after siRNA mediated depletion of EGFR with respect to activation of ATM, histone H3 acetylation, residual DNA-damage and cell survival after irradiation. RESULTS: Following radiation nuclear EGFR was localized in foci similar to gammaH(2)AX. EGFR co-localized in a sub-fraction of gammaH(2)AX-foci. Analysis of composition of gammaH(2)AX-complexes revealed presence of EGFR, ATM, promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), histone H3 and hetero-chromatin binding protein (HP1) in response to radiation. Depletion of EGFR protein inhibited ATM activation due to inhibition of acetylase TIP60 activity following irradiation. Consequently, histone H3 acetylation and phosphorylation was blocked and chromatin could not be opened for repair. Thus, residual DNA-damage was increased 24 h after irradiation and cells were radio-sensitized. Comparable results were obtained when cells were treated with EGFR-NLS-peptide, which blocks EGFR nuclear shuttling specifically. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear EGFR is part of DNA-damage repair complex and is involved in regulation of TIP60-acetylase activity. TIP60 is essential for ATM activation and chromatin relaxation which is a prerequisite for DNA-repair in heterochromatic DNA. Thus interventional EGFR strategies during tumor treatment may also interact with DNA-repair by blocking access to damaged DNA.","['Dittmann, Klaus', 'Mayer, Claus', 'Fehrenbacher, Birgit', 'Schaller, Martin', 'Kehlbach, Rainer', 'Rodemann, H Peter']","['Dittmann K', 'Mayer C', 'Fehrenbacher B', 'Schaller M', 'Kehlbach R', 'Rodemann HP']","['Division of Radiobiology and Molecular Environmental Research, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Tubingen, Germany. klaus.dittmann@uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Bronchial Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage/radiation effects', 'ErbB Receptors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Up-Regulation/radiation effects']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0167-8140(11)00311-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.radonc.2011.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 2011 Jun;99(3):317-22. doi: 10.1016/j.radonc.2011.06.001.

Clinicians may be hesitant to refer older patients with unexplained cytopenias and/or macrocytosis for a bone marrow biopsy (BM), and consequently undiagnosed patients may be deprived access to effective treatments. Previously, we described factors which were independently predictive of a diagnosis of MDS at time of bone marrow: age >/=65, mean cell volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and suggested a scoring system to calculate the post-test probability of MDS [1]. In this study we validate this scoring system in a cohort of 313 individuals who underwent bone marrow examinations for the investigation of unexplained cytopenias and or macrocytosis over a 3 year period at our institution (2006-2008). Thirty-two percent of all patients were diagnosed with MDS and 9% had suspected MDS. The post-test likelihood of a diagnosis of MDS increased from 12% when none of the four identified factors were present to 48% when 3 or more factors were present.

Here we study the feasibility of expansion and analyzed the characteristics of the end product from starting cells derived from different sources and at different disease states. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-five clinical scale cultures were grown from 28 patients and 20 donors in Good Manufacturing Practices facilities under CIK condition. RESULTS: CIK cells could be successfully expanded from healthy donors, patients with acute myeloid leukemia recovering from chemotherapy, untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome with circulating leukemic blasts, and patients with chronic myeloid leukemia on imatinib. Furthermore, CIK cells of donor origin could be expanded from leukapheresis product collected from patients who relapsed post-allogeneic transplantation, thereby offering a useful method of obtaining activated donor cells in patients for whom further donor cells were unavailable. Interestingly, CIK cells cultured from patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome had a significantly higher proportion of CD3(+)CD56(+) subset and higher fold expansion of CD3(+) cells as compared to other groups of patients or healthy donors. Multivariate analysis showed that fresh starting cells expanded better than frozen-thawed cells, while prior exposure to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or imatinib before harvesting did not adversely affect CIK cell expansion. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical scale expansion of CIK cells is feasible from both healthy donors and leukemia patients at various stages of treatment. This robust system allows clinical translation using CIK cells as immunotherapy in various clinical settings.","['Niam, Madelaine', 'Linn, Yeh-Ching', 'Fook Chong, Stephanie', 'Lim, Tsyr-Jong', 'Chu, Sixian', 'Choong, Alicia', 'Yong, Hao-Xiang', 'Suck, Garnet', 'Chan, Marieta', 'Koh, Mickey']","['Niam M', 'Linn YC', 'Fook Chong S', 'Lim TJ', 'Chu S', 'Choong A', 'Yong HX', 'Suck G', 'Chan M', 'Koh M']","['Cell Therapy Facility, Health Sciences Authority, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/surgery', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['S0301-472X(11)00283-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2011.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2011 Sep;39(9):897-903.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2011.06.005.

This study identifies microRNAs (miRNA) and miRNA targets that might represent diagnostic markers for MDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study utilized a total of 42 MDS samples and 45 controls. A discovery set of 20 frozen bone marrow mononuclear cell samples (10 MDS, 10 controls) was profiled on a custom Agilent miRNA microarray. Classifier miRNAs were validated in a separate set of 49 paraffin-embedded particle preparations by real-time polymerase chain reaction (24 MDS, 25 controls). Target prediction analysis was compared to a de novo transcriptional profile of MDS derived from the Microarray Innovations in Leukemia study. c-Myb and Sufu were further investigated by immunohistochemical stains on a set of 26 paraffin-embedded samples. RESULTS: We identified 13 miRNAs of interest from the discovery set, 8 of which proved statistically significant on real-time polymerase chain reaction verification. These eight miRNAs were then examined in an independent real-time polymerase chain reaction validation set. Notably, hsa-miR-378, hsa-miR-632, and hsa-miR-636 demonstrated particularly high discrimination between MDS and normal controls. Target prediction identified potential targets of miRNA regulation that correspond to many of the genes that characterize MDS.

Extramedullary relapse after HSCT for AML is a rare event and is less well defined than systemic, hematologic relapse. We retrospectively studied all patients with AML (n = 436) who underwent HSCT at the University of Minnesota between 1996 and 2008 who developed either a bone marrow (BM) or extramedullary (EM) relapse, and examined the incidence and risk factors for BM and EM relapse. Of 128 patients who relapsed post-HSCT, 25 had relapse in EM sites, either isolated (n = 13) or with concurrent BM relapse (n = 12). Relapse sites included bone (n = 1), central nervous system (n = 6), gastrointestinal (n = 4), lymphatic (n = 4), skin (n = 5), genitourinary (n = 1), pulmonary (n = 1), and soft tissue (n = 3). The time to relapse was longer in the EM sites (median, 328 days vs 168 days). Patients with EM relapse were more likely to have had preceding acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (77% vs 49%; P = .03) or chronic GVHD (46% vs 15%; P = .02) compared with those with BM relapse. The 6-month survival postrelapse was significantly better in patients with isolated EM relapse (69%) compared with those with combined EM and BM relapse (8%) or those with BM relapse alone (27%) (P < .01). Compared with local therapy alone, systemic therapy yielded better 6-month survival in patients with EM relapse. This study suggests differing pathogenesis of BM relapse versus EM relapse of AML after allogeneic HSCT. GVHD and its accompanying graft-versus-leukemia effect may better protect BM sites, but patients with EM relapse have better responses to combined therapy and improved survival compared with those with BM relapse.","['Solh, Melhem', 'DeFor, Todd E', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Kaufman, Dan S']","['Solh M', 'DeFor TE', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Kaufman DS']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 55455, USA. solhx001@umn.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*surgery', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00243-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jan;18(1):106-12. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.023.

This outcome study was a nonrandomized, prospective, observational noninferiority study, and primarily designed to determine whether RIC was as effective as MAC for myeloid malignancies. Comprehensive longitudinal assessment of HRQOL was done at baseline, day 30, day 100, day 180, and day 365 using validated instruments. A total of 115 patients (MAC, 51; RIC, 64) participated in this study. Of these 115 patients, 105 (91%) participated for HRQOL assessments. The main indication for HCT was acute myeloid leukemia (72%). Except age (median 41 vs 59 years, P < .0001), baseline characteristics were similar in patients undergoing MAC and RIC, respectively. Progression-free survival (PFS) at 1 year was 59% (SE = 7%) and 53% (SE = 6%) for the patients undergoing MAC and RIC, respectively (90% confidence interval [CI] -9% to +21%, P = .53). No significant difference in overall survival (OS), cumulative incidents of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD, cGVHD), nonrelapse mortality (NRM) or relapse was observed in the 2 cohorts. The trajectory of decline and recovery of HRQOL was similar between the 2 cohorts. We conclude that clinical outcomes and HRQOL in patients with myeloid malignancies undergoing RIC are not inferior to MAC at 1 year.","['Gupta, Vikas', 'Panzarella, Tony', 'Li, Le', 'Khan, Jabeen', 'Sharma, Ajay', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Kuruvilla, John', 'Messner, Hans', 'Alibhai, Shabbir M H']","['Gupta V', 'Panzarella T', 'Li L', 'Khan J', 'Sharma A', 'Lipton JH', 'Kuruvilla J', 'Messner H', 'Alibhai SM']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. vikas.gupta@uhn.on.ca']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/psychology/*surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of Life', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00242-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jan;18(1):113-24. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.022.

Polymorphisms on the CTLA-4 gene have been previously associated with autoimmune diseases, predisposition to leukemic relapse, and with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or relapse after allogeneic transplant. As CTLA-4 is expressed on T-lymphocytes, the aim of this study was to determine whether the donor CTLA-4 CT60 genotype also influences clinical outcome even after T cell depletion with CD34-positive selection. We studied 136 patient-donor pairs. Overall survival (OS) was worse for those patients who received grafts from a donor with the CT60 AA genotype rather than from a donor with the AG or GG genotype (35.6% vs 49.4%; P = .043). This association was confirmed through multivariate analysis, which identified the donor CT60 genotype as an independent risk factor for OS (P = .008; hazard ratio [HR]: 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.23-4.08). The donor CT60 AA genotype was also associated with lower disease-free survival, this being related to an increased risk of relapse (P = .001; HR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.67-6.96) and a trend toward higher transplant-related mortality. These associations were stronger when considering only patients in the early stage of disease. Our results suggest that graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity after T cell depletion is conditioned by the donor CTLA-4 genotype.","['Bosch-Vizcaya, Anna', 'Perez-Garcia, Arianne', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Solano, Carlos', 'Buno, Ismael', 'Guillem, Vicent', 'Martinez-Laperche, Carolina', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Barrenetxea, Cristina', 'Martinez, Carmen', 'Tuset, Esperanza', 'Lloveras, Natalia', 'Coll, Rosa', 'Guardia, Ramon', 'Gonzalez, Yolanda', 'Roncero, Josep M', 'Bustins, Anna', 'Gardella, Santiago', 'Fernandez, Cristalina', 'Buch, Joan', 'Gallardo, David']","['Bosch-Vizcaya A', 'Perez-Garcia A', 'Brunet S', 'Solano C', 'Buno I', 'Guillem V', 'Martinez-Laperche C', 'Sanz G', 'Barrenetxea C', 'Martinez C', 'Tuset E', 'Lloveras N', 'Coll R', 'Guardia R', 'Gonzalez Y', 'Roncero JM', 'Bustins A', 'Gardella S', 'Fernandez C', 'Buch J', 'Gallardo D']","[""Servei d'hematologia, Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/*genetics/immunology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/08/04 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00240-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2012 Jan;18(1):100-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.021.

However, in some cases, discrimination of lymphoid neoplasms from reactive lymphoid proliferation is difficult. PCR amplification of complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) gene can be used to assess clonality of B-cell populations as a supportive diagnostic tool for B-cell neoplasms. Because of the sequence variation and possible somatic hypermutation of the IGHV gene, sensitivity of the PCR-based assay to detect clonal IGHV gene rearrangement largely depends on the sequences and numbers of primer sets. Prior to the development of an efficient assay, we cloned and sequenced 97 IGHV complementary DNAs (48 IGHV-1 and 49 IGHV-3 clones) from normal cat spleens. On the basis of these sequences, we designed 6 forward primers at the variable region and 5 reverse primers at the joining region. Using each of 6 forward primers and a mixture of 5 reverse primers, we amplified CDR3 of IGHV genes and analyzed the PCR products by conventional PAGE and Genescan analyses using fluorescence-labeled primers. Twenty-six feline B-cell neoplasms diagnosed by histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations were subjected to the newly developed analysis of IGHV gene rearrangement. Clonal IGHV gene rearrangement was detected in 22 of 26 (84%) samples by both PAGE and Genescan analyses. To reduce the number of PCR reactions, we constructed a multiplex PCR analysis system using a mixture of IGHV-1- and IGHV-3-specific primers as forward primers and a mixture of 5 joining region reverse primers. Results of the multiplex PCR were 100% concordant with those obtained by each of the singleplex PCRs. The multiplex PCR-based assay and Genescan analysis developed in the present study would be useful and practical tools to detect clonal IGHV gene rearrangement in feline B-cell neoplasms.","['Mochizuki, Hiroyuki', 'Nakamura, Kenji', 'Sato, Hirofumi', 'Goto-Koshino, Yuko', 'Sato, Masahiko', 'Takahashi, Masashi', 'Fujino, Yasuhito', 'Ohno, Koichi', 'Uchida, Kazuyuki', 'Nakayama, Hiroyuki', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime']","['Mochizuki H', 'Nakamura K', 'Sato H', 'Goto-Koshino Y', 'Sato M', 'Takahashi M', 'Fujino Y', 'Ohno K', 'Uchida K', 'Nakayama H', 'Tsujimoto H']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cat Diseases/*genetics/*immunology', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/veterinary', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*veterinary', 'Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2011/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['S0165-2427(11)00191-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.05.030 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 2011 Sep 15;143(1-2):38-45. doi: 10.1016/j.vetimm.2011.05.030.

These type I transmembrane proteins belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily and display features of immunoregulatory receptors with inhibitory and/or stimulatory signaling potential. Expanding on our previous work, which demonstrated that putative stimulatory IpLITR-types associated with the catfish adaptor proteins IpFcRgamma and FcRgamma-L, this study focuses on the functional significance of this immune receptor-adaptor signaling complex. Specifically, we generated an epitope-tagged chimeric receptor construct by fusing the extracellular domain of IpLITR 2.6b with the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic tail of IpFcRgamma-L. This chimera was stably expressed in a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line, RBL-2H3, and following cross-linking of the surface receptor with an anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody or opsonized microspheres, the chimeric teleost receptor induced cellular degranulation and phagocytic responses, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif encoded within the cytoplasmic tail of the chimera confirmed that these functional responses were dependent on the phosphorylated tyrosines within this motif. Using a combination of phospho-specific antibodies and pharmacological inhibitors, we also demonstrate that the IpLITR/IpFcRgamma-L-induced degranulation response requires the activity of Src homology 2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinases but appears independent of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAP kinase pathways. In addition to this first look at stimulatory IpLITR-mediated signaling and its influence on cellular effector responses, the advantage of generating RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing a functional IpLITR-adaptor chimera will be discussed.","['Cortes, Herman D', 'Montgomery, Benjamin C', 'Verheijen, Karlijn', 'Garcia-Garcia, Erick', 'Stafford, James L']","['Cortes HD', 'Montgomery BC', 'Verheijen K', 'Garcia-Garcia E', 'Stafford JL']","['Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Comp Immunol,Developmental and comparative immunology,7708205,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fish Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Basophils/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fish Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Ictaluridae', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transgenes/genetics', 'src Homology Domains/genetics']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-305X(11)00170-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.dci.2011.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Dev Comp Immunol. 2012 Jan;36(1):62-73. doi: 10.1016/j.dci.2011.06.004.

To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms we demonstrate that 4'-hydroxychalcone inhibits proteasome activity in a dose-dependent manner but has no effect on IKK activity. Results show that 4'-hydroxychalcone inhibits TNFalpha-dependent degradation of IkappaBalpha and subsequently prevents p50/p65 nuclear translocation leading to 4'-hydroxychalcone-inhibited expression of NF-kappaB target genes. Most importantly, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by 4'-hydroxychalcone is not leukemia cell-type specific and has no significant effect on non-transformed cell viability, thus highlighting the compound's potential in both prevention and treatment.","['Orlikova, Barbora', 'Tasdemir, Deniz', 'Golais, Frantisek', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Orlikova B', 'Tasdemir D', 'Golais F', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Fondation de Recherche Cancer et Sang, Hopital Kirchberg, 9 Rue Edward Steichen, 2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', ""2657-25-2 (4'-hydroxychalcone)"", 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chalcones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/*physiology']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-2952(11)00377-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2011.06.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2011 Sep 15;82(6):620-31. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2011.06.012.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) testing was used to confirm the diagnosis. All patients were treated with oseltamivir from the first day of hospitalization. Upon admission 12/44 had local patchy shadowing in their chest x-ray and additionally antibiotic regimen was added to these patients as pneumonia was suspected based on clinical evidence. In total 44 patients were hospitalized 15/44 had asthma, 6/44 COPD, 5/44 leukemia. Lung function was evaluated with forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and diffused carbon monoxide upon discharge and every 3 months, until 6 months of observation was completed after discharge. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate whether influenza A (H1N1) had an impact on the respiratory capacity of the infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: An improvement of pulmonary function tests was observed between the first two measurements, implicating an inflammatory pathogenesis of influenza A (H1N1) to the respiratory tract. This inflammation was not associated with the severity or clinical outcome of the patients. All patients had a mild clinical course and their respiratory capacity was stable between the second and third measurement, suggesting that the duration of respiratory inflammation was two months.

However, other molecular targets of JSI-124 beyond the JAK/STAT3 pathway are not fully understood. METHODS: BJAB, I-83, NALM-6 and primary CLL cells were treated with JSI-124 as indicated. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry for accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells (indicator of apoptosis) and Annexin V/PI staining. Cell cycle was analyzed by FACS for DNA content of G1 and G2 phases. Changes in phosphorylation and protein expression of p38, Erk1/2, JNK, c-Jun, and XIAP were detected by Western blot analysis. STAT3 and c-Jun genes were knocked out using siRNA transfection. VEGF expression was determined by mRNA and protein levels by RT-PCR and western blotting. Streptavidin Pull-Down Assay was used to determine c-Jun binding to the AP-1 DNA binding site. RESULTS: Herein, we show that JSI-124 activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and increases both the expression and serine phosphorylation of c-Jun protein in the B leukemic cell lines BJAB, I-83 and NALM-6. JSI-124 also activated MAPK p38 and MAPK Erk1/2 albeit at lower levels than JNK activation. Inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway failed to effect cell cycle arrest or apoptosis induced by JSI-124 but repressed JSI-124 induced c-Jun expression in these leukemia cells. The JNK pathway activation c-Jun leads to transcriptional activation of many genes. Treatment of BJAB, I-83, and NALM-6 cells with JSI-124 lead to an increase of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) at both the mRNA and protein level. Knockdown of c-Jun expression and inhibition of JNK activation significantly blocked JSI-124 induced VEGF expression. Pretreatment with recombinant VEGF reduced JSI-124 induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data demonstrates that JSI-124 activates the JNK signaling pathway independent of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, leading to increased VEGF expression.","['Ishdorj, Ganchimeg', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Ishdorj G', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'SHQ47990PH (cucurbitacin I)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Triterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC3146936,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-268 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-268 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jun 24;11:268. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-268.,20110624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also implicated in encapsidation are cis determinants in the R, U5, and PBS (primer binding site) from the 5' untranslated region (UTR). Although conventionally associated with nuclear export of HIV-1 RNA, there is a burgeoning role for the Rev/RRE in the encapsidation process. Pleiotropic effects exhibited by these cis and trans viral components may confound the ability to examine their independent, and combined, impact on encapsidation of RNA into HIV-1 viral particles in their innate viral context. We systematically reconstructed the HIV-1 packaging system in the context of a heterologous murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector RNA to elucidate a mechanism in which the Rev/RRE system is central to achieving efficient and specific encapsidation into HIV-1 viral particles. RESULTS: We show for the first time that the Rev/RRE system can augment RNA encapsidation independent of all cis elements from the 5' UTR (R, U5, PBS, and psi). Incorporation of all the 5' UTR cis elements did not enhance RNA encapsidation in the absence of the Rev/RRE system. In fact, we demonstrate that the Rev/RRE system is required for specific and efficient encapsidation commonly associated with the canonical packaging signal. The mechanism of Rev/RRE-mediated encapsidation is not a general phenomenon, since the combination of the Rev/RRE system and 5' UTR cis elements did not enhance encapsidation into MLV-derived viral particles. Lastly, we show that heterologous MLV RNAs conform to transduction properties commonly associated with HIV-1 viral particles, including in vivo transduction of non-dividing cells (i.e. mouse neurons); however, the cDNA forms are episomes predominantly in the 1-LTR circle form. CONCLUSIONS: Premised on encapsidation of a heterologous RNA into HIV-1 viral particles, our findings define a functional HIV-1 packaging system as comprising the 5' UTR cis elements, Gag, and the Rev/RRE system, in which the Rev/RRE system is required to make the RNA amenable to the ensuing interaction between Gag and the canonical packaging signal for subsequent encapsidation.","['Cockrell, Adam S', 'van Praag, Henriette', 'Santistevan, Nicholas', 'Ma, Hong', 'Kafri, Tal']","['Cockrell AS', 'van Praag H', 'Santistevan N', 'Ma H', 'Kafri T']","['Gene Therapy Center University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['2-R01-DK058702/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5-PO1-HL066973/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"[""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (rev protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1)']",IM,"[""*5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*metabolism']",PMC3131246,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/09/29 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-8-51 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-8-51 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2011 Jun 24;8:51. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-8-51.,20110624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reduced risk was pronounced only among the Caucasian population (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51-0.90), not the Asian (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05). For the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism, no significant association with ALL susceptibility was observed in the pooled analyses. However, significantly increased ALL risk was found in childhood in the comparison of 1298CA versus AA genotype. This study provides evidence that MTHFR polymorphisms may play an important role in the development of ALL.","['Tong, Na', 'Sheng, Xiaojing', 'Wang, Meilin', 'Fang, Yongjun', 'Shi, Danni', 'Zhang, Zhizhong', 'Zhang, Zhengdong']","['Tong N', 'Sheng X', 'Wang M', 'Fang Y', 'Shi D', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang Z']","['Department of Molecular and Genetic Toxicology, Key Laboratory of Modern Toxicology of Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Ethnicity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/etiology/*genetics', 'Risk']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/03/23 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.589545 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Oct;52(10):1949-60. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.589545.

METHODS: Crude extracts of dried leaves of S verticillata, F pumila and F strobilifera were made by exhaustive methanol extraction, fractions were obtained from sequential extraction of the crude extract using solvents of increasing polarity. Dose responses corresponding to cell survival following 72-hour exposure to the extracts were determined using a leukaemia cancer cell line (MT-4). Cell viability was assessed using the MTT[3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay reading absorbances at 570 nm. Comparisons were made with controls and cell survival, in each sample well, was determined based on the ratio of the absorbance of the sample to the control. RESULTS: Crude extracts of S verticillata, F pumila and F strobilifera displayed cytotoxicity and the IC50 values were 89 microg/ml, 131 microg/ml and 81 microg/ml, respectively. The petroleum ether and chloroform fractions of the crude extracts of S verticillata and F strobilifera showed potent cytotoxic activity but the highest cytotoxic activity was found in the chloroform and butanol fractions of F pumila with IC50 values of 23 microg/ml and 26 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSION: The crude extracts of S verticillata, F pumila and F strobilifera were shown to be cytotoxic to the leukaemia cell line, MT-4 and IC50 values were determined. Fractionation of the crude extracts by solvent-solvent extraction enabled determination of the active fractions and their IC50 values. We propose that cytotoxic activity may be due to antioxidant compounds previously isolated from these plants.","['Ramcharan, G', 'Clement, Y N', 'Maxwell, A R']","['Ramcharan G', 'Clement YN', 'Maxwell AR']","['Pharmacology Unit, Faculty of Medical Sciences, The University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad and Tobago, West Indies.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Jamaica,West Indian Med J,The West Indian medical journal,0417410,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fabaceae/chemistry', 'Ficus/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Medicine, Traditional', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves', '*Plants, Medicinal', 'Rubiaceae/chemistry', 'West Indies']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/07/27 06:00,['2011/06/28 06:00'],"['2011/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/27 06:00 [medline]']",['1317 [pii]'],ppublish,West Indian Med J. 2010 Dec;59(6):597-601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypoplastic MDS (h-MDS) accounts for 12-17% of all patients with MDS and has yet to be shown to alter the disease course or prognosis. The concept that T-cell-mediated autoimmunity contributes to bone marrow failure in MDS has been widely accepted due to hematologic improvement after immunosuppressive therapy. T-cell expansion is known to occur in these patients, but development of chronic T-cell disorders, especially T-prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) in a hypocellular MDS is extremely rare, which has an aggressive course. The possible explanation for the association between the two disorders is that T-PLL might arise from a clonally arranged MDS stem cell. We report a unique case of h-MDS with non-progressive pancytopenia and severe hypocellular marrow for 2 years, followed by T-PLL within few months.","['Arathi, C A', 'Puttaraj, K R', 'Shobha, S N']","['Arathi CA', 'Puttaraj KR', 'Shobha SN']","['Department of Pathology, Sree Siddhartha Medical College, Tumkur, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],Germany,J Lab Physicians,Journal of laboratory physicians,101551511,,,,PMC3118059,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/06/28 06:01,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0974-2727.78568 [doi]', 'JLP-3-49 [pii]']",ppublish,J Lab Physicians. 2011 Jan;3(1):49-51. doi: 10.4103/0974-2727.78568.,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic T-cell disorders', 'T-PLL', 'hypoplastic MDS']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using differentiation to induce irreversible cell cycle exit in AML cells could be a p53-independent treatment alternative, however, this possibility requires evaluation. In vitro and in vivo regimens of the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine that deplete the chromatin-modifying enzyme DNA methyl-transferase 1 without phosphorylating p53 or inducing early apoptosis were determined. These decitabine regimens but not equimolar DNA-damaging cytarabine upregulated the key late differentiation factors CCAAT enhancer-binding protein varepsilon and p27/cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B), induced cellular differentiation and terminated AML cell cycle, even in cytarabine-resistant p53- and p16/CDKN2A-null AML cells. Leukemia initiation by xenotransplanted AML cells was abrogated but normal hematopoietic stem cell engraftment was preserved. In vivo, the low toxicity allowed frequent drug administration to increase exposure, an important consideration for S phase specific decitabine therapy. In xenotransplant models of p53-null and relapsed/refractory AML, the non-cytotoxic regimen significantly extended survival compared with conventional cytotoxic cytarabine. Modifying in vivo dose and schedule to emphasize this pathway of decitabine action can bypass a mechanism of resistance to standard therapy.","['Ng, K P', 'Ebrahem, Q', 'Negrotto, S', 'Mahfouz, R Z', 'Link, K A', 'Hu, Z', 'Gu, X', 'Advani, A', 'Kalaycio, M', 'Sobecks, R', 'Sekeres, M', 'Copelan, E', 'Radivoyevitch, T', 'Maciejewski, J', 'Mulloy, J C', 'Saunthararajah, Y']","['Ng KP', 'Ebrahem Q', 'Negrotto S', 'Mahfouz RZ', 'Link KA', 'Hu Z', 'Gu X', 'Advani A', 'Kalaycio M', 'Sobecks R', 'Sekeres M', 'Copelan E', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Maciejewski J', 'Mulloy JC', 'Saunthararajah Y']","['Department of Translational Hematology & Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA117846/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HL090513/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54HL090513/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'DNA Damage', 'Decitabine', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', '*Transplantation, Heterologous']",PMC3668642,['NIHMS469937'],2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011159 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Nov;25(11):1739-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.159.

In this study, we demonstrate that Lyn constitutively phosphorylates the immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motifs of the inhibitory cell surface co-receptor CD5, a marker of B-CLL. As a result, CD5 provides an anchoring site to Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1), a known negative regulator of hematopoietic cell function, thereby triggering the negative B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling. The subsequent segregation of SHP-1 into two pools, one bound to the inhibitory co-receptor CD5 in an active form, the other in the cytosol in an inhibited conformation, proves crucial for withstanding apoptosis, as shown by the use of phosphotyrosine phosphatase-I-I, a direct inhibitor of SHP-1, or SHP-1 knockdown. These results confirm that Lyn exhibits the unique ability to negatively regulate BCR signaling, in addition to positively regulating effectors downstream of the BCR, and identify SHP-1 as a novel player in the deranged signaling network and as a potential attractive target for new therapeutic strategies in B-CLL.","['Tibaldi, E', 'Brunati, A M', 'Zonta, F', 'Frezzato, F', 'Gattazzo, C', 'Zambello, R', 'Gringeri, E', 'Semenzato, G', 'Pagano, M A', 'Trentin, L']","['Tibaldi E', 'Brunati AM', 'Zonta F', 'Frezzato F', 'Gattazzo C', 'Zambello R', 'Gringeri E', 'Semenzato G', 'Pagano MA', 'Trentin L']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/*physiology']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011152 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.152 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Nov;25(11):1768-81. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.152.

Although most of the B-ALL children take advantage from current therapeutic protocols, some patients relapse and need alternative therapies. With this background, we investigated whether interleukin (IL)-27, an immunomodulatory cytokine with antitumor properties, may function as an antitumor agent against pediatric B-ALL cells. Here we show for the first time that pediatric B-ALL cells functional IL-27R and that IL-27 dampens directly tumor growth in vivo and in vitro through mechanisms elucidated in this study. The novelty of these results deals with the first demonstration that (1) B-ALL cells from pediatric patients injected intravenously (i.v.) into NOD/SCID/Il2rg(-/-) (NSG) mice gave rise to leukemic spreading that was severely hampered by IL-27; (2) IL-27-treated mice, compared with controls, showed significant reduction of putative B-ALL-initiating cells and blasts in the peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM) and spleen; and that (3) IL-27 reduced in vitro B-ALL cell proliferation and angiogenesis, induced apoptosis and downregulated miR-155.

However, it remained unclear whether all three BL variants-sBL, endemic BL (eBL) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated BL (HIV-BL)-represent a uniform biological entity despite their differences in geographical occurrence, association with immunodeficiency and/or incidence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. To address this issue, we generated micro RNA (miRNA) profiles from 18 eBL, 31 sBL and 15 HIV-BL cases. In addition, we analyzed the miRNA expression of 86 DLBCL to determine whether miRNA profiles recapitulate the molecular differences between BL and DLBCL evidenced by mRNA profiling. A signature of 38 miRNAs containing MYC regulated and nuclear factor-kB pathway-associated miRNAs was obtained that differentiated BL from DLBCL. The miRNA profiles of sBL and eBL displayed only six differentially expressed miRNAs, whereas HIV and EBV infection had no impact on the miRNA profile of BL. In conclusion, miRNA profiling confirms that BL and DLBCL represent distinct lymphoma categories and demonstrates that the three BL variants are representatives of the same biological entity with only marginal miRNA expression differences between eBL and sBL.","['Lenze, D', 'Leoncini, L', 'Hummel, M', 'Volinia, S', 'Liu, C G', 'Amato, T', 'De Falco, G', 'Githanga, J', 'Horn, H', 'Nyagol, J', 'Ott, G', 'Palatini, J', 'Pfreundschuh, M', 'Rogena, E', 'Rosenwald, A', 'Siebert, R', 'Croce, C M', 'Stein, H']","['Lenze D', 'Leoncini L', 'Hummel M', 'Volinia S', 'Liu CG', 'Amato T', 'De Falco G', 'Githanga J', 'Horn H', 'Nyagol J', 'Ott G', 'Palatini J', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Rogena E', 'Rosenwald A', 'Siebert R', 'Croce CM', 'Stein H']","['Institute of Pathology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Institute of Pathology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Dr Margarete Fischer-Bosch-Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Wurzburg, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Innere Medizin I, Saarland University, Homburg, Germany.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Institute of Pathology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Kenya/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3902789,['NIHMS546272'],2011/06/28 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/leu.2011.156 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Dec;25(12):1869-1876. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.156.

As a consequence, miRNA dysregulation causes disruption of the hematopoietic system and leukemia may arise. We here comprehensively discuss miRNAs found discriminative for cytogenetic and molecular subtypes of acute leukemia. These miRNAs are either known miRNAs involved in leukemogenesis with proven tumor suppressor or oncogenic activities or are newly identified by high-throughput sequencing with yet unknown function. Furthermore, forces are outlined that drive aberrant miRNA function, which include genetic abnormalities (for example, deletions, translocations and mutations) and epigenetic aberrations (for example, aberrant DNA methylation or histone modifications). Interestingly, leukemia-silenced miRNAs can be re-expressed upon treatment with de-methylating agents. Targeting miRNA expression may serve a therapeutical role, albeit at present this way of targeted therapy is in its infancy. However, emerging knowledge about the biology of miRNAs in leukemia may result into a role for these miRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of acute leukemia.","['Schotte, D', 'Pieters, R', 'Den Boer, M L']","['Schotte D', 'Pieters R', 'Den Boer ML']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC/Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogenes']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011151 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.151 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2012 Jan;26(1):1-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.151.

Previously, gene expression profiling (GEP) revealed two distinct CBF leukemia subgroups displaying significant outcome differences and identified apoptotic signaling, MAPKinase signaling and chemotherapy-resistance mechanisms among the most significant differentially regulated pathways. We now tested different inhibitors of the respective pathways in a cell line model (six cell lines reflecting the CBF subgroup-specific gene expression alterations), and found apoptotic signaling to be differentiating between the CBF subgroup models. In accordance, primary samples from newly diagnosed CBF AML patients (n=23) also showed differential sensitivity to in vitro treatment with a Smac mimetic such as BV6, an antagonist of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, and ABT-737, a BCL2 inhibitor. Furthermore, GEP revealed the BV6-resistant cases to resemble the previously identified unfavorable CBF subgroup. Thus, our current findings show deregulated IAP expression and apoptotic signaling to differentiate clinically relevant CBF subgroups, which were independent of known molecular markers, thereby providing a starting point for novel therapeutic approaches.","['Luck, S C', 'Russ, A C', 'Botzenhardt, U', 'Paschka, P', 'Schlenk, R F', 'Dohner, H', 'Fulda, S', 'Dohner, K', 'Bullinger, L']","['Luck SC', 'Russ AC', 'Botzenhardt U', 'Paschka P', 'Schlenk RF', 'Dohner H', 'Fulda S', 'Dohner K', 'Bullinger L']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BV6 peptide)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligopeptides)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factors/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oligopeptides/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Signal Transduction']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011154 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.154 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Nov;25(11):1728-38. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.154.

Current estimates are made with models derived mainly from studies of atomic bomb survivors, a population that differs from today's patients in many respects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the cancer incidence among children who underwent diagnostic x-ray exposures between 1976 and 2003 in a large German university hospital. We reconstructed individual radiation doses for each examination and sorted results by groups of referral criteria for all cancers combined, solid tumors, and leukemia and lymphoma combined. RESULTS: A total of 68 incidence cancer cases between 1980 and 2006 were identified in a 78,527-patient cohort in the German childhood cancer registry: 28 leukemia, nine lymphoma, six tumors of the CNS, and 25 other tumors. The standardized incidence ratio for all cancers was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.75-1.23). Dose-response relations were analyzed by multivariable Poisson regression. Although the cancer incidence risk differed by initial referral criterion for radiographic examination, a positive dose-response relation was observed in five patients with endocrine or metabolic disease. CONCLUSION: Overall, we observed no increase in cancer risk among children and youths with very low radiation doses from diagnostic radiation, which is compatible with model calculations. The growing use of CT warrants further studies to assess associated cancer risk. Our work is an early contribution of epidemiologic data for quantifying these risks among young patients.","['Hammer, Gael P', 'Seidenbusch, Michael C', 'Regulla, Dieter F', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Zeeb, Hajo', 'Schneider, Karl', 'Blettner, Maria']","['Hammer GP', 'Seidenbusch MC', 'Regulla DF', 'Spix C', 'Zeeb H', 'Schneider K', 'Blettner M']","['Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany. gael.hammer@unimedizin-mainz.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

Phosphorylations of intermediates in inflammatory cascades, including NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) at Thr(559), transforming growth factor-beta-activating kinase (TAK) 1 at Thr(184), Thr(187), and Ser(192), and inhibitory factor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) at Ser(32), were examined following mutation of BCL10 at Ser(138) and at Ser(218). Specific phosphoantibodies were used for detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy of differences in phosphorylation following transfection by mutated BCL10. Both mutations demonstrated dominant-negative effects, with inhibition of phospho(Ser(32))-IkappaBalpha to less than control levels. Both of the BCL10 mutations reduced the CGN-induced increases in nuclear RelA and p50, but only the Ser(138) mutation inhibited the CGN-induced increases in nuclear RelB and p52 and in NIK Thr(559) phosphorylation. Hence, the phosphorylation of BCL10 Ser(138), but not Ser(218), emerged as a critical event in activation of the noncanonical pathway of NF-kappaB activation. Either BCL10 Ser(138) or Ser(218) mutation inhibited the phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr(184) and at Thr(187), but not at Ser(192). These findings indicate that BCL10 phosphorylations act upstream of phosphorylations of NIK, TAK1, and IkappaBalpha and differentially affect the canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-kappaB activation.","['Bhattacharyya, Sumit', 'Borthakur, Alip', 'Anbazhagan, Arivarasu N', 'Katyal, Shivani', 'Dudeja, Pradeep K', 'Tobacman, Joanne K']","['Bhattacharyya S', 'Borthakur A', 'Anbazhagan AN', 'Katyal S', 'Dudeja PK', 'Tobacman JK']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01-DK-67887/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK-54016/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK-81858/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,American journal of physiology.

It involves a sequence of genetically determined intracellular events, allowing the inhibition of the main functions of the cell and its elimination by phagocytosis. The apoptosis inactivation is implied in tumours carcinogenesis. Although the tumour physiopathology implies a defect in activation-induced cell death, the treatment is designed to kill the transformed cells. The aim of this review is to describe the apoptotic mechanisms and to explain the interest of new therapeutic tools targeting apoptosis. Apoptosis is an orderly and synchronized process, regulated by two different pathways, the intrinsic way (mitochondrial) and extrinsic one (the death receptor). The targeting of apoptosis, a pathway intrinsically deficient in the tumor cells, is a potentially interesting strategy when the mechanism of its inhibition is well-identified. Small molecules targeting B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAPs) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors are currently under phase I/II studies, which show preliminary efficacy and safety. Their association with standard treatments seems an interesting therapeutic way in order to obtain a synergistic effect on tumor cell death.","['Lheureux, Stephanie', 'Le Moulec, Sylvestre']","['Lheureux S', 'Le Moulec S']","[""CLCC Francois-Baclesse, service d'oncologie medicale, Caen, France.""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/agonists']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/11/05 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0007-4551(15)30583-X [pii]', '10.1684/bdc.2011.1381 [doi]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 2011 Oct;98(9):1029-36. doi: 10.1684/bdc.2011.1381.,,,,,,,,,,"Les molecules de l'apoptose, cibles therapeutiques en oncologie.",,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 20 patients with intermediate- to high-risk follicular lymphoma and 2 patients with marginal zone lymphoma. Treatment consisted of 4-6 cycles of FM (fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) on days 1-3, mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each 28-day cycle). The protocol was amended after enrolling the first 4 patients to include rituximab 375 mg/m(2) on day 1. After 6-8 weeks, responders received (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) followed by maintenance rituximab (375 mg/m(2) weekly x 4 doses, repeated every 6 months for 2 years). RESULTS: After R-FM, the overall response rate was 95% with a complete response rate (CR) of 45% (n = 10), a partial response (PR) rate of 50% (n = 11), and stable disease in 1 patient. Nineteen patients received (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan with a 60% conversion rate of PR to CR, resulting in an improved CR of 79% (n = 15) and a PR of 21% (n = 4). Fifteen patients proceeded to rituximab maintenance resulting in 3 patients with PR converting to CR. At median follow-up of 49.6 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 47.2 months and median overall survival (OS) was not reached in an intent-to-treat analysis. The most common adverse effects were hematologic, with 2 patients experiencing treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), evolving to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: R-FM with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan consolidation and rituximab maintenance is well tolerated, improving CR rates and maintaining durable responses in patients with untreated indolent lymphomas.","['Karmali, Reem', 'Kassar, Mohamad', 'Venugopal, Parameswaran', 'Shammo, Jamile M', 'Fung, Henry C', 'Bayer, Robert', ""O'Brien, Teresa"", 'Gregory, Stephanie A']","['Karmali R', 'Kassar M', 'Venugopal P', 'Shammo JM', 'Fung HC', 'Bayer R', ""O'Brien T"", 'Gregory SA']","['Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA. reem_karmali@rush.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk,"Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",101525386,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2012/06/27 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/05 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S2152-2650(11)00069-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.clml.2011.04.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk. 2011 Dec;11(6):467-74. doi: 10.1016/j.clml.2011.04.009.

Cytotoxic effect of tanshinone A was observed in this study. Additionally its mechanism of promoting apoptosis was also investigated. MTT and SRB assays were applied to measure the effects of tanshinone A on the cell viability, the cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry using PI staining and Annexin V/PI double staining method respectively. The changes of mitochondrial membrane potential were also detected by flow cytometry. Spectrophotometric method was used to detect the changes of caspase-3 activity. Western blotting assay was used to evaluate the expression of bcl-2, bax and c-Myc proteins. Results indicated that tanshinone A displayed a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of K562 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and showed obvious minor damage to LO2 cells. Tanshinone A could arrest K562 cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase and induce apoptosis, decrease the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, decrease the expressions of bcl-2 and c-Myc proteins, increase the expression of bax protein and the activity of caspase-3. Accordingly, it was presumed that the apoptosis induction may be through the endogenous pathway. Subsequently, tanshinone A could be a promising candidate in the development of a novel antitumor agent.","['Zhen, Xia', 'Cen, Juan', 'Li, Yun-Man', 'Yan, Fang', 'Guan, Teng', 'Tang, Xu-Zhen']","['Zhen X', 'Cen J', 'Li YM', 'Yan F', 'Guan T', 'Tang XZ']","['Department of Physiology, China Pharmaceutical University, Mailbox 207, 24 Tong Jia Xiang, Nanjing, Jiangsu, 210009, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '03UUH3J385 (tanshinone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/28 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2010/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0014-2999(11)00687-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2011 Sep 30;667(1-3):129-35. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.06.004.

All patients included had been in CR1 for at least 4 months. The HCT recipients were slightly younger than the chemotherapy patients (median age, 63 years vs 65 years; P < .001), but there were no significant between-group differences in the proportion with therapy-related leukemia or in different cytogenetic risk groups. Time from diagnosis to CR1 was longer for the HCT recipients (median, 44 days vs 38 days; P = .031). Allogeneic HCT was associated with significantly lower risk of relapse (32% vs 81% at 3 years; P < .001), higher nonrelapse mortality (36% vs 4% at 3 years; P < .001), and longer leukemia-free survival (32% vs 15% at 3 years; P = .001). Although overall survival was longer for HCT recipients, the difference was not statistically significant (37% vs 25% at 3 years; P = .08). Our findings suggest that reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT in patients age 60-70 with acute myelogenous leukemia in CR1 reduces relapse and improves leukemia-free survival. Strategies that reduce nonrelapse mortality may yield significant improvements in overall survival.","['Farag, Sherif S', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Perez, Waleska S', 'George, Stephen L', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'DiPersio, John', 'Bunjes, Donald W', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Cairo, Mitchell', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Isola, Luis', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Marks, David I', 'Ringden, Olle', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Soiffer, Robert', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Farag SS', 'Maharry K', 'Zhang MJ', 'Perez WS', 'George SL', 'Mrozek K', 'DiPersio J', 'Bunjes DW', 'Marcucci G', 'Baer MR', 'Cairo M', 'Copelan E', 'Cutler CS', 'Isola L', 'Lazarus HM', 'Litzow MR', 'Marks DI', 'Ringden O', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Soiffer R', 'Larson RA', 'Tallman MS', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA. ssfarag@iupui.edu']",['eng'],"['CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U01HL069294/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3817558,['NIHMS373863'],2011/06/28 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00258-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Dec;17(12):1796-803. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.06.005.

Herein the authors describe the clinical and typical neuroimaging features of a female patient with ALL who presented with subacute MTX neurotoxicity that rapidly progressed to a severe clinical condition in a few hours but eventually resolved completely with dexamethasone and folinic acid. Subacute MTX neurotoxicity is a transient neurological dysfunction that should be considered in patients presenting with stroke-like and various neurological symptoms 10 to 14 days after intrathecal therapy and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging should be undertaken for the correct diagnosis and exclusion of possible ischemic infarct. Discontinuation of subsequent intrathecal MTX therapies should be considered in severe cases and treatment with dexamethasone and folinic acid may help to resolve the symptoms.","['Tufekci, Ozlem', 'Yilmaz, Sebnem', 'Karapinar, Tuba Hilkay', 'Gozmen, Salih', 'Cakmakci, Handan', 'Hiz, Semra', 'Irken, Gulersu', 'Oren, Hale']","['Tufekci O', 'Yilmaz S', 'Karapinar TH', 'Gozmen S', 'Cakmakci H', 'Hiz S', 'Irken G', 'Oren H']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey. ozlemtufekci@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leucovorin/*administration & dosage', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', '*Neurotoxicity Syndromes/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Radiography', 'Time Factors', 'Vitamin B Complex/*administration & dosage']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/12/16 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/08880018.2011.563773 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2011 Sep;28(6):517-22. doi: 10.3109/08880018.2011.563773.

Evaluation of cardiotoxicity was performed via echocardiography and measurement of cardiac troponin I levels. Patients in each phase were homogenous in terms of gender and age. Diastolic dysfunction determined via reduction E/A ratio below the cutoff value was demonstrated to deteriorate earlier than systolic functions and alteration in cardiac enzymes. Being similar between dose groups, cTnI levels were shown to rise in the presence of congestive heart failure.

Chemokinome assays confirmed that NLCs secrete prototypical M2 cytokines and chemokines. Extending previous reports of fludarabine resistance, NLCs are able to promote multidrug resistance. Altogether, we propose that NLCs are not just nursing, but actively participate in the setting of an environment-mediated drug resistance (EM-DR) and immune escape for CLL cells.","['Ysebaert, Loic', 'Fournie, Jean-Jacques']","['Ysebaert L', 'Fournie JJ']","['Inserm U1037, Universite Toulouse 3-ERL CNRS, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France. ysebaert.l@chu-toulouse.fr']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Phenotype', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.568078 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jul;52(7):1404-6. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.568078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In TRAIL resistant CLL cells, only activation of DR4 provided an increase in fludarabine induced apoptosis. This was mediated in part by the localization of DR4 but not DR5 in lipid rafts following TRAIL and fludarabine treatment. This preference for DR4 activation leading to increased fludarabine induced apoptosis was also observed following SAHA, PS-341, and chlorambucil treatment in primary CLL cells. Thus, CLL cells selectively activate DR4 partially mediated through its localization to lipid rafts leading to apoptosis when combined with chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Xiao, Wenyan', 'Ishdorj, Ganchimeg', 'Sun, Jinmei', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer B']","['Xiao W', 'Ishdorj G', 'Sun J', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson SB']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '967Q0SJD77 (lexatumumab)', 'WZ1025JPGR (mapatumumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2011.567317 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jul;52(7):1290-301. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2011.567317.,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2011 Jul;52(7):1176-7.

Tubacin (tubulin acetylation inducer) is a small molecule that inhibits histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and induces acetylation of alpha-tubulin. We observed a higher antiproliferative effect of tubacin in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells than in normal hematopoietic cells. Treatment with tubacin led to the induction of apoptotic pathways in both pre-B and T cell ALL cells at a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of low micromolar concentrations. Acetylation of alpha-tubulin increases within the first 30 min following treatment of ALL cells with tubacin. We also observed an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Furthermore, the signaling pathways activated by tubacin appear to be distinct from those observed in multiple myeloma. In this article, we demonstrate that tubacin enhances the effects of chemotherapy to treat primary ALL cells in vitro and in vivo.

The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of N. salmonis in out-migrating juvenile hatchery and wild Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and steelhead O. mykiss from the Snake River in the U.S. Pacific Northwest. To achieve this goal, we first addressed the following concerns about current molecular diagnostic tests for N. salmonis: (1) nonspecific amplification patterns by the published nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) test, (2) incomplete validation of the published quantitative PCR (qPCR) test, and (3) whether N. salmonis can be detected reliably from nonlethal samples. Here, we present an optimized nPCR protocol that eliminates nonspecific amplification. During validation of the published qPCR test, our laboratory developed a second qPCR test that targeted a different gene sequence and used different probe chemistry for comparison purposes. We simultaneously evaluated the two different qPCR tests for N. salmonis and foundthat both assays were highly specific, sensitive, and repeatable. The nPCR and qPCR tests had good overall concordance when DNA samples derived from both apparently healthy and clinically diseased hatchery rainbow trout were tested. Finally, we demonstrated that gill snips were a suitable tissue for nonlethal detection of N. salmonis DNA in juvenile salmonids. Monitoring of juvenile salmonid fish in the Snake River over a 3-year period revealed low prevalence of N. salmonis in hatchery and wild Chinook salmon and wild steelhead but significantly higher prevalence in hatchery-derived steelhead. Routine monitoring of N. salmonis is not performed for all hatchery steelhead populations. At present, the possible contribution of this pathogen to delayed mortality of steelhead has not been determined.","['Badil, Samantha', 'Elliott, Diane G', 'Kurobe, Tomofumi', 'Hedrick, Ronald P', 'Clemens, Kathy', 'Blair, Marilyn', 'Purcell, Maureen K']","['Badil S', 'Elliott DG', 'Kurobe T', 'Hedrick RP', 'Clemens K', 'Blair M', 'Purcell MK']","['U.S. Geological Survey, Western Fisheries Research Center 6505 Northeast 65th Street, Seattle, Washington 98115, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Aquat Anim Health,Journal of aquatic animal health,9884881,"['0 (DNA, Intergenic)']",IM,"['Animal Migration', 'Animals', 'DNA, Intergenic', 'Fish Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Gills/microbiology', 'Microsporidia/*isolation & purification', 'Mycoses/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rivers', '*Salmonidae', 'Time Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,2011/06/28 06:00,2011/07/20 06:00,['2011/06/25 06:00'],"['2011/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/08997659.2011.559418 [doi]'],ppublish,J Aquat Anim Health. 2011 Mar;23(1):19-29. doi: 10.1080/08997659.2011.559418.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence shows that TrxR is over-expressed or constitutively active in many tumor cells. Moreover, TrxR appears to contribute to increased tumor cell growth and a resistance to chemotherapy. In this study, we evaluated the activity of TrxR in adriamycin-resistant leukemic cells (K562/ADM) and adriamycin-sensitive parental lines (K562), and found that TrxR activity was higher in the drug resistant cell sublines K562/ADM than in K562 drug sensitive parental cells. Auranofin, a gold(I) compound clinically used as an antirheumatic agent, reduced TrxR activity and was more effective than adriamycin in decreasing cell viability in K562/ADM cells. In addition, auranofin induced apoptosis in dose-dependent manners, accompanied by caspase-3 activation in K562/ADM cells.

An audit of breast lymphomas diagnosed on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) over a period of 9 years (2001-2009) was performed. Ten cases were retrieved and the cytomorphology was reviewed along with immunochemistry (IHC), flow cytometry as well as histopathology, wherever available. The age of patients ranged from 17 to 83 years. Eight cases were diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, high-grade on FNAC. Histopathology was available in four of these cases and cell block was available in one case. Lymphoid cells were positive for leukocyte-common antigen (LCA) and CD20 and negative for CD3 in these cases. The same was confirmed by flow cytometry on aspirated material in one case. A diagnosis of DLBCL was offered in these five cases. One case was a low-grade NHL and another case was a young male, a known case of acute leukemia and had leukemic infiltration in the breast lump. We wish to emphasize the potential importance of FNAC in breast lymphoma and the same can be helpful to avoid unnecessary surgery in these cases.

Studies of the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway are widely employed to investigate the effects of a large variety of substances. We assayed the cAMP pathway in human skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells (S-MSC) to evaluate donor to donor variations in response to pharmacological manipulations in vitro. Immunophenotyping of S-MSC revealed that, in general, 95% of S-MSCs were positive for CD90, CD73 and CD105 and negative for the expression of haemopoetic markers CD14, CD45 and human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR). Nevertheless, fluctuations occurred in basal cAMP levels from 5 pmol/mg to 18 pmol/mg. Total cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) concentrations ranged from 0.8 ng/ml to 1 ng/ml, whereas the proportions of phospho-CREB versus total CREB differed between the cell lines. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated cAMP generation, whereas leukaemia inhibiting factor reduced some of their effects. Forskolin (0.05 and 1 mM) acted in synergy with FGF-2 and EGF; however, it caused pronounced donor to donor differences in the increase of cAMP and phospho-CREB levels. Additionally, dibutyryl-cAMP caused significant donor to donor variations in cell proliferation, possibly indicating a change of cell differentiation status. We speculate that similar donor diversity might be observed after cell stimulation with various G(s)-protein-coupled receptor ligands. Heterogeneity of donor cell responses to stimulation of the cAMP pathway indicates the need for wide safety margins for S-MSC use in drug screening; nevertheless, knowledge of this heterogeneity might be useful for the design of donor-specific cell therapy.","['Jekabsons, Kaspars', 'Riekstina, Una', 'Parfejevs, Vadims', 'Laizane, Anete', 'Pavasare, Marta', 'Lencberga, Nelda', 'Jansone, Baiba', 'Muceniece, Ruta']","['Jekabsons K', 'Riekstina U', 'Parfejevs V', 'Laizane A', 'Pavasare M', 'Lencberga N', 'Jansone B', 'Muceniece R']","['University of Latvia, Riga.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,['E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Growth Processes/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*cytology/*metabolism']",,,2011/06/24 06:00,2012/01/25 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00441-011-1203-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 2011 Aug;345(2):253-63. doi: 10.1007/s00441-011-1203-9.

To further assess the suitability of ROR1 for targeted therapy of CLL and MCL, a panel of mAbs was generated and its therapeutic utility was investigated. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A chimeric rabbit/human Fab library was generated from immunized rabbits and selected by phage display. Chimeric rabbit/human Fab and IgG1 were investigated for their capability to bind to human and mouse ROR1, to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and internalization, and to agonize or antagonize apoptosis using primary CLL cells from untreated patients as well as MCL cell lines. A panel of mAbs demonstrated high affinity and specificity for a diverse set of epitopes that involve all three extracellular domains of ROR1, are accessible on the cell surface, and mediate internalization. The mAb with the highest affinity and slowest rate of internalization was found to be the only mAb that mediated significant, albeit weak, ADCC. None of the mAbs mediated CDC. Alone, they did not enhance or inhibit apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Owing to its relatively low cell surface density, ROR1 may be a preferred target for armed rather than naked mAbs. Provided is a panel of fully sequenced and thoroughly characterized anti-ROR1 mAbs suitable for conversion to antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins, chimeric antigen receptors, and other armed mAb entities for preclinical and clinical studies.","['Yang, Jiahui', 'Baskar, Sivasubramanian', 'Kwong, Ka Yin', 'Kennedy, Michael G', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Rader, Christoph']","['Yang J', 'Baskar S', 'Kwong KY', 'Kennedy MG', 'Wiestner A', 'Rader C']","['Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/pathology/*therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rabbits', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/chemistry/*immunology', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",PMC3115963,,2011/06/24 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2011/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0021018 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-06029 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e21018. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0021018.

The role of the P(8)' residue in the potato inhibitor I family was examined by measuring the association and dissociation rates of four rBTI mutants with different substitutions at the P(2) and P(8)' positions when binding to trypsin.

Recently fractal characteristics of the chromatin structure in routinely stained smears have shown to be independent prognostic factors in acute leukemia. In the present study we investigated the influence of the fractal dimension (FD) of chromatin on survival of patients with multiple myeloma. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed 67 newly diagnosed patients from our Institution treated in the Brazilian Multiple Myeloma Study Group. Diagnostic work-up consisted of peripheral blood counts, bone marrow cytology, bone radiograms, serum biochemistry and cytogenetics. The International Staging System (ISS) was used. In every patient, at least 40 digital nuclear images from diagnostic May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained bone marrow smears were acquired and transformed into pseudo-3D images. FD was determined by the Minkowski-Bouligand method extended to three dimensions. Goodness-of-fit of FD was estimated by the R(2) values in the log-log plots. The influence of diagnostic features on overall survival was analyzed in Cox regressions. Patients that underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation were censored at the day of transplantation. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Median age was 56 years. According to ISS, 14% of the patients were stage I, 39% were stage II and 47% were stage III. Additional features of a bad prognosis were observed in 46% of the cases. When stratifying for ISS, both FD and its goodness-of-fit were significant prognostic factors in univariate analyses. Patients with higher FD values or lower goodness-of-fit showed a worse outcome. In the multivariate Cox-regression, FD, R(2), and ISS stage entered the final model, which showed to be stable in a bootstrap resampling study.

The concomitant activation of dendritic cells (DC) and natural killer (NK) cells is an attractive modality for immune-based therapies.

We previously reported that acute myeloid leukemic (AML) cells in response to electroporation with the synthetic dsRNA analogue poly(I:C) exert improved immunogenicity, demonstrated by enhanced DC-activating and NK cell interferon-gamma-inducing capacities. To further invigorate the potential of these immunogenic tumor cells, we explored their effect on the phagocytic and cytotoxic capacity of DC and NK cells, respectively. Using single-cell analysis, we assessed these functionalities in two- and three-party cocultures. Following poly(I:C) electroporation AML cells become highly susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing and phagocytosis by DC. Moreover, the enhanced killing and the improved uptake are strongly correlated. Interestingly, tumor cell killing, but not phagocytosis, is further enhanced in three-party cocultures provided that these tumor cells were upfront electroporated with poly(I:C). Altogether, poly(I:C)-electroporated AML cells potently activate DC and NK cell functions and stimulate NK-DC cross-talk in terms of tumor cell killing. These data strongly support the use of poly(I:C) as a cancer vaccine component, providing a way to overcome immune evasion by leukemic cells.","['Lion, Eva', 'Anguille, Sebastien', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Smits, Evelien L J M', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo F I']","['Lion E', 'Anguille S', 'Berneman ZN', 'Smits EL', 'Van Tendeloo VF']","['Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (Vaxinfectio), Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium. eva.lion@ua.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Dendritic Cells', 'Electroporation', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Poly I-C/*pharmacology']",PMC3117863,,2011/06/24 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2011/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0020952 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-07770 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e20952. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0020952.

Using a combination of both immunohistochemistry with broadly-reactive murine leukemia virus (MLV) anti-sera and PCR, we determined if additional prostate cancer or other cell lines contain XMRV or MLV-related viruses. Our study included a total of 72 cell lines, which included 58 of the 60 human cancer cell lines used in anticancer drug screens and maintained at the NCI-Frederick (NCI-60). We have identified gammaretroviruses in two additional prostate cancer cell lines: LAPC4 and VCaP, and show that these viruses are replication competent. Viral genome sequencing identified the virus in LAPC4 and VCaP as nearly identical to another known xenotropic MLV, Bxv-1. We also identified a gammaretrovirus in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell line EKVX. Prostate cancer cell lines appear to have a propensity for infection with murine gammaretroviruses, and we propose that this may be in part due to cell line establishment by xenograft passage in immunocompromised mice. It is unclear if infection with these viruses is necessary for cell line establishment, or what confounding role they may play in experiments performed with these commonly used lines. Importantly, our results suggest a need for regular screening of cancer cell lines for retroviral ""contamination"", much like routine mycoplasma testing.","['Sfanos, Karen Sandell', 'Aloia, Amanda L', 'Hicks, Jessica L', 'Esopi, David M', 'Steranka, Jared P', 'Shao, Wei', 'Sanchez-Martinez, Silvia', 'Yegnasubramanian, Srinivasan', 'Burns, Kathleen H', 'Rein, Alan', 'De Marzo, Angelo M']","['Sfanos KS', 'Aloia AL', 'Hicks JL', 'Esopi DM', 'Steranka JP', 'Shao W', 'Sanchez-Martinez S', 'Yegnasubramanian S', 'Burns KH', 'Rein A', 'De Marzo AM']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America. ksfanos@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['P50 CA058236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA58236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Gammaretrovirus/genetics/*physiology', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*virology', '*Virus Replication']",PMC3117837,,2011/06/24 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2011/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0020874 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-03983 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e20874. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0020874.

Furthermore, excessive apoptosis can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, anaemia and graft rejection, and diminished apoptosis can lead to autoimmune diseases and cancer. It has become clear that the post-translational modification of apoptotic proteins by ubiquitylation regulates key components in cell death signalling cascades. For example, ubiquitin E3 ligases, such as MDM2 (which ubiquitylates p53) and inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, and deubiquitinases, such as A20 and ubiquitin-specific protease 9X (USP9X) (which regulate the ubiquitylation and degradation of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and myeloid leukaemia cell differentiation 1 (MCL1), respectively), have important roles in apoptosis.

This study investigated whether Erdr1 regulates murine melanoma progression, as well as the mechanism involved in Erdr1-regulated metastasis. The expression of Erdr1 is negatively correlated with IL-18 expression, which has a pro-cancer effect in melanoma. To study the role of Erdr1 as an anti-cancer factor, cell migration, invasion, and proliferation were measured. Erdr1 overexpression markedly inhibited the level of cell migration, invasion, and proliferation in B16F10 cells in vitro. In addition, Erdr1 overexpression significantly suppressed melanoma lung colonization, metastasis, and tumor growth in vivo. To identify the factors involved in Erdr1-reduced metastasis, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a well-known stress protein and contributor to tumor metastasis, was examined. We found that HSP90 was significantly decreased in Erdr1-overexpressing cells. Functional analysis demonstrated that HSP90 small-interfering RNA transfection reduced the migration ability and metastasis of melanoma. In conclusion, Erdr1 shows a powerful anti-metastasis effect that leads to the ability to reduce the metastatic potential of murine malignant melanoma cells. Erdr1 is an anti-metastatic factor that may be a possible therapeutic target for treatment of melanoma.","['Jung, Min Kyung', 'Park, Yoorim', 'Song, Seok Bean', 'Cheon, So Young', 'Park, Sunyoung', 'Houh, Younkyung', 'Ha, Soogyeong', 'Kim, Hee Jung', 'Park, Jung Min', 'Kim, Tae Sung', 'Lee, Wang Jae', 'Cho, Byung Joo', 'Bang, Sa Ik', 'Park, Hyunjeong', 'Cho, Daeho']","['Jung MK', 'Park Y', 'Song SB', 'Cheon SY', 'Park S', 'Houh Y', 'Ha S', 'Kim HJ', 'Park JM', 'Kim TS', 'Lee WJ', 'Cho BJ', 'Bang SI', 'Park H', 'Cho D']","[""Department of Life Science, SIS Immunology Research Center, Sookmyung Women's University, Yongsan-ku, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (erythroid differentiation regulator 1, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-18/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Melanoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/therapy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",,,2011/06/24 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0022-202X(15)35027-2 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2011.170 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2011 Oct;131(10):2096-104. doi: 10.1038/jid.2011.170.

This pathway is antagonized by SH2-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase (SHIP), raising the possibility that v-Abl modulates PI3K signaling through SHIP. Consistent with this, we show that v-Abl expression reduces levels of full-length p145 SHIP in a v-Abl kinase activity-dependent fashion. This event requires signals from the Abl SH2 domain but not the carboxyl terminus. Forced expression of full-length SHIP significantly reduces Ab-MLV pre-B-cell transformation.

To investigate a strategy to exploit abnormal cancer-associated metabolism related to thiamine, we tested the cytotoxicity of native Bacillus thiaminolyticus thiaminase I enzyme, which digests thiamine, in the NCI60 cell line drug cytotoxicity screening program and found that leukemia cell lines were among the most sensitive to thiaminase I. We obtained additional lymphoid leukemia cell lines and confirmed that native thiaminase I and linear chain PEGylated thiaminase I enzyme (LCPTE) have cytotoxic activity in these cell lines. In addition, the IC(50) of 3 of the 5 leukemia cell lines (Reh, RS4, and Jurkat) were at least 1,000-fold more sensitive than Molt-4 cells, which in turn, were among the most sensitive in the NCI60 panel. The 3 LCPTE-sensitive leukemia cell lines were also sensitive to removal of thiamine from the medium, thus suggesting the mechanism of action of LCPTE involves extracellular thiamine starvation. Surprisingly, rapamycin showed a protective effect against LCPTE toxicity in the 3 LCPTE-sensitive cell lines but not in the other 2 cell lines, suggesting involvement of an mTOR-dependent pathway. Immunoblot analysis of the LCPTE-sensitive cell lines after LCPTE exposure revealed changes in mTOR pathway phosphorylation. Nude mice bearing RS4 leukemia xenografts showed both tumor growth delay and prolonged survival after a single dose of LCPTE. Therefore, disruption of thiamine-dependent metabolism may be a novel therapeutic approach to target altered energy metabolism in leukemia and other cancers.","['Daily, Abigail', 'Liu, Shuqian', 'Bae, Younsoo', 'Bhatnagar, Saloni', 'Moscow, Jeffrey A']","['Daily A', 'Liu S', 'Bae Y', 'Bhatnagar S', 'Moscow JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Kentucky, 740 S.

We applied linker-scanning mutagenesis to generate a panel of 34 mutants, each containing an insertion of 5 aa at a random position within the E1E2 sequence. The mutated glycoproteins were analysed by using a range of assays to identify regions critical for maintaining protein conformation, E1E2 complex assembly, CD81 receptor binding, membrane fusion and infectivity. The results, while supporting previously published data, provide several interesting new findings. Firstly, insertion at amino acid 587 or 596 reduced E1E2 heterodimerization without affecting reactivity with some conformation-sensitive mAbs or with CD81, thus implicating these residues in glycoprotein assembly. Secondly, insertions within a conserved region of E2, between amino acid residues 611 and 631, severely disrupted protein conformation and abrogated binding of all conformation-sensitive antibodies, suggesting that the structural integrity of this region is critical for the correct folding of E2. Thirdly, an insertion at Leu-682 specifically affected membrane fusion, providing direct evidence that the membrane-proximal 'stem' of E2 is involved in the fusion mechanism. Overall, our results show that the HCV glycoproteins generally do not tolerate insertions and that there are a very limited number of sites that can be changed without dramatic loss of function. Nevertheless, we identified two E2 insertion mutants, at amino acid residues 408 and 577, that were infectious in the murine leukemia virus-based HCV pseudoparticle system.","['Rychlowska, Malgorzata', 'Owsianka, Ania M', 'Foung, Steven K H', 'Dubuisson, Jean', 'Bienkowska-Szewczyk, Krystyna', 'Patel, Arvind H']","['Rychlowska M', 'Owsianka AM', 'Foung SKH', 'Dubuisson J', 'Bienkowska-Szewczyk K', 'Patel AH']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, 8 Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, University of Gdansk, Kladki 24, 80-822 Gdansk, Poland.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, 8 Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.', 'Inserm U1019, F-59019 Lille, France.', 'Universite Lille Nord de France, F-59000 Lille, France.', 'Institut Pasteur de Lille, Centre for Infection & Immunity of Lille (CIIL), F-59019 Lille, France.', 'CNRS UMR8204, F-59021 Lille, France.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, University of Gdansk, Kladki 24, 80-822 Gdansk, Poland.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, 8 Church Street, Glasgow G11 5JR, UK.']",['eng'],"['AI081903/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL079381/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI081903/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'MC_U130184144/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (E1 protein, Hepatitis C virus)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '157184-61-7 (glycoprotein E2, Hepatitis C virus)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*genetics/methods', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Tetraspanin 28', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3347801,,2011/06/24 06:00,2011/11/08 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1099/vir.0.034314-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2011 Oct;92(Pt 10):2249-2261. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.034314-0.

To predict resistance mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase MET that could emerge during inhibitor treatment in patients, we conducted a resistance screen in BaF3 TPR-MET cells using the novel selective MET inhibitor NVP-BVU972. The observed spectrum of mutations in resistant cells was dominated by substitutions of tyrosine 1230 but also included other missense mutations and partially overlapped with activating MET mutations that were previously described in cancer patients. Cocrystallization of the MET kinase domain in complex with NVP-BVU972 revealed a key role for Y1230 in binding of NVP-BVU972, as previously reported for multiple other selective MET inhibitors. A second resistance screen in the same format with the MET inhibitor AMG 458 yielded a distinct spectrum of mutations rich in F1200 alterations, which is consistent with a different predicted binding mode. Our findings suggest that amino acid substitutions in the MET kinase domain of cancer patients need to be carefully monitored before and during treatment with MET inhibitors, as resistance may preexist or emerge. Compounds binding in the same manner as NVP-BVU972 might be particularly susceptible to the development of resistance through mutations in Y1230, a condition that may be addressed by MET inhibitors with alternative binding modes.","['Tiedt, Ralph', 'Degenkolbe, Elisa', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Appleton, Brent A', 'Wagner, Sabrina', 'Schoepfer, Joseph', 'Buck, Emily', 'Ruddy, David A', 'Monahan, John E', 'Jones, Michael D', 'Blank, Jutta', 'Haasen, Dorothea', 'Drueckes, Peter', 'Wartmann, Markus', 'McCarthy, Clive', 'Sellers, William R', 'Hofmann, Francesco']","['Tiedt R', 'Degenkolbe E', 'Furet P', 'Appleton BA', 'Wagner S', 'Schoepfer J', 'Buck E', 'Ruddy DA', 'Monahan JE', 'Jones MD', 'Blank J', 'Haasen D', 'Drueckes P', 'Wartmann M', 'McCarthy C', 'Sellers WR', 'Hofmann F']","['Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0', '(1-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropyl)-N-(5-(7-methoxyquinolin-4-yloxy)pyridin-2-yl)-5-met', 'hyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide)', '0 (6-(6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)imidazo(1,2-b)pyridazin-3-ylmethyl)quinoline)', '0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Aminopyridines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Pyrazoles/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,,2011/06/24 06:00,2011/10/04 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-10-4433 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4433 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 1;71(15):5255-64. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-10-4433.

For example, genetic mutations or abnormal proteasomal degradation can reduce expression of Bax which limits apoptosis. In cancers where abnormal proteasomal degradation of Bax occurs, we hypothesized that Bax peptides that bind to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules would be generated for presentation to CD8(+) T cells. To test this hypothesis, we generated T cells against pooled Bax peptides, using the blood of healthy human donors. Although T-cell responses were of low frequency (0.15%), a CD8(+) T-cell clone (KSIVB17) was isolated that optimally recognized Bax(136-144) peptide (IMGWTLDFL) presented by HLA-A*0201. KSIVB17 was able to recognize and kill a variety of HLA-matched cancer cells including primary tumor cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). No reactivity was seen against HLA-matched, nontransformed cells such as PHA blasts and skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, KSIVB17 reactivity corresponded with the proteasomal degradation patterns of Bax protein observed in cancer cells. Taken together, our findings suggest a new concept for tumor antigens based on regulatory proteins that are ubiquitously expressed in normal cells, but that have abnormally enhanced degradation in cancer cells. Bax degradation products offer candidate immune antigens in cancers such as CLL in which increased Bax degradation correlates with poor clinical prognosis.","['Nunes, Claudia Trindade', 'Miners, Kelly L', 'Dolton, Garry', 'Pepper, Chris', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Mason, Malcolm D', 'Man, Stephen']","['Nunes CT', 'Miners KL', 'Dolton G', 'Pepper C', 'Fegan C', 'Mason MD', 'Man S']","['Departments of Infection, Immunity and Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*isolation & purification', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,2011/06/24 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-0393 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0393 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 15;71(16):5435-44. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0393.

The objective was to describe the characteristics of TRL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three cases of TRL were registered. Chemotherapeutic agents used for the first tumor, time interval, clinical and biological characteristics, treatment and prognosis of the TRL were analyzed. RESULTS: Median age was 61 years. Cytotoxic agents used in previous neoplasm consisted of alkylating agents (17 patients), inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II (14), antitubulin agents (12), radiotherapy (9, in 6 with radiotherapy) and antimetabolites (6). Median time from diagnosis of the first neoplasm to TRL was 3 years (range 1.2-15.8). Thirteen patients received intensive chemotherapy [with stem cell transplantation (SCT) in 3] and the other 10 received symptomatic treatment (median survival 3 years versus 0.079 years, P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, TRL were associated with exposure to alkylating agents, antitubulin agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors. Response to treatment and prognosis were poor, although chemotherapy and SCT may prolong survival.","['Motllo, Cristina', 'Sancho, Juan Manuel', 'Garcia, Olga', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Milla, Fuensanta', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria']","['Motllo C', 'Sancho JM', 'Garcia O', 'Granada I', 'Milla F', 'Ribera JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, ICO-Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['spa'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/mortality', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Tubulin Modulators/adverse effects']",,,2011/06/24 06:00,2012/01/27 06:00,['2011/06/24 06:00'],"['2010/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2010/09/10 00:00 [revised]', '2010/09/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S0025-7753(11)00514-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.medcli.2010.09.052 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2011 Oct 15;137(10):449-52. doi: 10.1016/j.medcli.2010.09.052.

Cytological examination of bone marrow smears revealed a myeloid to erythroid ratio <0.02:1 (reference range 0.5-2.4:1.0) and an abundance of erythroid precursor cells. The erythroid cell population included rubriblasts, prorubricytes and rubricytes, with only scant numbers of metarubricytes present. There were numerous mitotic erythroid cells, some of which were atypical and megaloblastic. These cytomorphological changes are consistent with pure acute erythroid leukaemia. No treatment was instituted and the filly died three days after presentation. This case illustrates the need to consider both haematology and bone marrow findings to establish a diagnosis of pure erythroid leukaemia.

A total of 121 patients were enrolled and assessed for safety, and 119 were examined for clinical efficacy. The main underlying diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (38.0%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (18.2%), and malignant lymphoma (18.2%). The median initial daily dose and duration of micafungin treatment were 150 mg/day and 13 days, respectively. The overall response rate for suspected IFIs (n = 119), based on four composite endpoints, including baseline IFI, breakthrough IFIs (proven and probable), survival, and premature discontinuation, was 79.0%. In addition, the response rate for FN (n = 81), based on these four endpoints as well as defervescence during neutropenia, was 39.5%. Breakthrough IFIs (proven, probable, and possible) occurred in five patients during micafungin treatment. All of these patients were positive for either BG or GM before the breakthrough IFIs. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) associated with micafungin was 10.7% and most were mild. The majority of AEs were liver dysfunction. These results indicate the effectiveness and safety of micafungin as an empirical therapy for suspected IFIs, including FN, and the usefulness of monitoring both BG and GM to detect breakthrough IFIs.","['Yamaguchi, Masaki', 'Kurokawa, Toshiro', 'Ishiyama, Ken', 'Aoki, Go', 'Ueda, Mikio', 'Matano, Sadaya', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Yamazaki, Hirohito', 'Sawazaki, Aiko', 'Yamauchi, Hiromasa', 'Yoshida, Takashi', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Kurokawa T', 'Ishiyama K', 'Aoki G', 'Ueda M', 'Matano S', 'Takami A', 'Yamazaki H', 'Sawazaki A', 'Yamauchi H', 'Yoshida T', 'Nakao S']","['Department of Hematology, Ishikawa Prefectural Central Hospital, 2-1 Kuratsukihigashi, Kanazawa City, Ishikawa, Japan. myjody@ipch.jp']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Bacterial/blood', 'Aspergillosis/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Candidiasis, Invasive/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/epidemiology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echinocandins/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lipopeptides/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Mannans/blood', 'Micafungin', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Young Adult', 'beta-Glucans/blood']",,,2011/06/23 06:00,2011/10/28 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-011-1277-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2011 Oct;90(10):1209-17. doi: 10.1007/s00277-011-1277-1.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, HDACi have been reported to arrest growth and induce apoptosis. In this study, we elucidate details of the DNA damage induced by the HDACi vorinostat in AML cells. At clinically relevant concentrations, vorinostat induces double-strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage in AML cell lines. Additionally, AML patient blasts treated with vorinostat display increased DNA damage, followed by an increase in caspase-3/7 activity and a reduction in cell viability. Vorinostat-induced DNA damage is followed by a G2-M arrest and eventually apoptosis. We found that pre-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reduces vorinostat-induced DNA double strand breaks, G2-M arrest and apoptosis. These data implicate DNA damage as an important mechanism in vorinostat-induced growth arrest and apoptosis in both AML cell lines and patient-derived blasts. This supports the continued study and development of vorinostat in AMLs that may be sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and as a combination therapy with ionizing radiation and/or other DNA damaging agents.","['Petruccelli, Luca A', 'Dupere-Richer, Daphne', 'Pettersson, Filippa', 'Retrouvey, Helene', 'Skoulikas, Sophia', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Petruccelli LA', 'Dupere-Richer D', 'Pettersson F', 'Retrouvey H', 'Skoulikas S', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Segal Cancer Center, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['MOP-12863/ASPE HHS/United States', 'Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Vorinostat']",PMC3112218,,2011/06/23 06:00,2011/10/22 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0020987 [doi]', 'PONE-D-10-00898 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e20987. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0020987.

This compound with amphoteric properties was designed in the former Germany Democratic Republic in 1960s and re-discovered in 1990s with multiple successive well-designed studies. Bendamustine possesses a unique mechanism of action with potential antimetabolite properties, and only partial cross-resistance with other alkylators. Used in combination with rituximab in vitro, bendamustine shows synergistic effects against various leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. In clinical studies, bendamustine plus rituximab is highly effective in patients with relapsed-refractory indolent lymphoma, inducing remissions in 90% or more and a median progression-free survival of 23-24 months. The optimal dosing and schedule of bendamustine administration is largely undecided and varies among studies.

On admission, his blood pressure (BP) was 210/110 mmHg and he had petechiae and purpura at upper and lower extremities. Renal ultrasonography (USG) showed bilaterally enlarged kidneys without hydronephrosis, unlike his previous USG, which determined bilaterally atrophic kidneys. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia, hypertensive crisis due to bilateral leukemic cell infiltration of kidneys, tumor lysis syndrome, and leukemic involvement of the facial nerve were diagnosed. Despite intense antihypertensive management, his BP was not controlled. After prednisolone, daunorubicine, and vincristine therapy, the size of kidneys diminished and his BP dropped under normal range.

Based on conventional cytogenetic analysis of banded chromosomes, we selected a series of 23 paediatric patients with acute myeloid leukaemia and performed whole genome array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) using DNA samples derived from the same patients. Imbalances involving large chromosomal regions or entire chromosomes were detected by aCGH in seven of the patients studied. Results were validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to both interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes using appropriate bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) probes. The majority of these copy number alterations (CNAs) were confirmed by FISH and found to localize to the interphase rather than metaphase nuclei. Furthermore, the proliferative states of the cells analyzed by FISH were tested by immunofluorescence using an antibody against the proliferation marker pKi67.

Here we evaluated the utility of measuring circulating TK (cTK) activity directly from plasma in leukemia patients positive for the BCR-ABL1. Plasma cTK activity was measured from 46 patients with newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 24 with multidrug-resistant CML, 24 with BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 38 healthy donors. Circulating TK activity was significantly higher in CML (median 801.93 U/mL, range 18.10-3932.30 U/mL) and BCR-ABL1-positive ALL patients (median 659.55 U/mL, range 0-1626.90 U/mL) than in healthy donors (median 82.85 U/mL, range 0.63-852.80 U/mL) (P < 0.001). Plasma cTK activity was closely correlated with cellular BCR-ABL1 kinase activation as indicated by phosphorylation of the downstream signaling proteins CRKL (P < 0.001) and STAT-5 (P= 0.003). However, cTK activity was not associated with BCR-ABL1 transcript level and was independent of BCR-ABL1 mutation type. Ex vivo inhibition of imatinib and dasatinib on plasma cTK activity was severely diminished in patients harboring T315I mutation. Ex vivo testing measuring the effect of TKIs on plasma cTK activity thus hold promise as drug sensitivity tests for predicting and monitoring response to specific TKIs.","['Yeh, Chen-Hsiung', 'Abdool, Adam', 'Bruey, Jean-Marie']","['Yeh CH', 'Abdool A', 'Bruey JM']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA, USA. chenhsiung.x.yeh@questdiagnostics.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Assays', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*blood/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/blood/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",,,2010/01/01 00:00,2011/12/14 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['N8425130X81QV017 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-2010-0193 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2010;7(6):295-303. doi: 10.3233/CBM-2010-0193.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: CALGB 9840 evaluated weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) versus paclitaxel every 3 weeks (175 mg/m(2)); CALGB 9342 evaluated three doses of paclitaxel as follows: 175, 210 and 250 mg/m(2) each over 3 h every 3 weeks. Of the 1048 patients, paclitaxel was used first line in 57%. The groups: (i) <55 years (45%), (ii) 55-64 years (29%), and (iii) >/=65 years (26%). RESULTS: Tumor response was also similar among age groups. First-line therapy (P = 0.0001) and better performance status (PS) (P = 0.018) were significantly related to higher response. Age did not significantly relate to overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). First-line therapy, better PS, estrogen receptor positive status and a fewer number of metastatic sites were significantly related to improved OS and PFS. The grade >/=3 toxic effects that increased linearly with age were leucopenia (P = 0.0099), granulocytopenia (P = 0.022), anorexia (P = 0.028), bilirubin elevation (P = 0.0035) and neurotoxicity (P < 0.0001). Patients over 65 years receiving second-line therapy had the shortest time to neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Older women with breast cancer derive similar efficacy from treatment with paclitaxel as younger women.

To characterize DLBCL with 13q14.3 deletions, we combined genome-wide DNA profiling, gene expression and clinical data in a large DLBCL series treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, vincristine and prednisone repeated every 21 days (R-CHOP21). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 250K NspI and U133 plus 2.0 gene were used. MicroRNA (miRNA) expression was studied were by real-time PCR. Median follow-up of patients was 4.9 years. RESULTS: Deletions at 13q14.3, comprising DLEU2/MIR15A/MIR16, occurred in 22/166 (13%) cases. The deletion was wider, including also RB1, in 19/22 cases. Samples with del(13q14.3) had concomitant specific aberrations. No reduced MIR15A/MIR16 expression was observed, but 172 transcripts were significantly differential expressed. Among the deregulated genes, there were RB1 and FAS, both commonly deleted at genomic level. No differences in outcome were observed in patients treated with R-CHOP21. CONCLUSIONS: Cases with 13q14.3 deletions appear as group of DLBCL characterized by common genetic and biologic features. Deletions at 13q14.3 might contribute to DLBCL pathogenesis by two mechanisms: deregulating the cell cycle control mainly due RB1 loss and contributing to immune escape, due to FAS down-regulation.","['Mian, M', 'Scandurra, M', 'Chigrinova, E', 'Shen, Y', 'Inghirami, G', 'Greiner, T C', 'Chan, W C', 'Vose, J M', 'Testoni, M', 'Chiappella, A', 'Baldini, L', 'Ponzoni, M', 'Ferreri, A J M', 'Franceschetti, S', 'Gaidano, G', 'Montes-Moreno, S', 'Piris, M A', 'Facchetti, F', 'Tucci, A', 'Nomdedeu, J Fr', 'Lazure, T', 'Uccella, S', 'Tibiletti, M G', 'Zucca, E', 'Kwee, I', 'Bertoni, F']","['Mian M', 'Scandurra M', 'Chigrinova E', 'Shen Y', 'Inghirami G', 'Greiner TC', 'Chan WC', 'Vose JM', 'Testoni M', 'Chiappella A', 'Baldini L', 'Ponzoni M', 'Ferreri AJM', 'Franceschetti S', 'Gaidano G', 'Montes-Moreno S', 'Piris MA', 'Facchetti F', 'Tucci A', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Lazure T', 'Uccella S', 'Tibiletti MG', 'Zucca E', 'Kwee I', 'Bertoni F']","['Laboratory of Experimental Oncology and Lymphoma Unit, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland; Division of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera S.

However, leukemic stem cells are insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and contribute to the persistence of disease by representing a reservoir of selfrenewing cells that replenish the disease after drug discontinuation. This finding has refocused the interest of scientists toward drug combinations, ie, treating with TKIs and simultaneously targeting alternative survival mechanisms. One candidate target mechanism is autophagy, a cellular recycling process that acts as a cytoprotective shield in CML cells in response to TKI-induced stress and in other cancer cells surviving in an inhospitable microenvironment. On that basis, inhibition of autophagy has now become an exciting option for combination treatment in cancer, and clinical trials have been initiated in solid and hemopoietic tumors such as CML, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. This review describes the biology of CML and elucidates how the molecular driver BCR-ABL led to the development of TKIs. We then discuss the molecular regulation of autophagy and the potential for autophagy inhibition as the next step in our attempt to tackle the problem of CML persistence to offer a curative option.","['Helgason, G Vignir', 'Karvela, Maria', 'Holyoake, Tessa L']","['Helgason GV', 'Karvela M', 'Holyoake TL']","[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK.""]",['eng'],"['G0600782/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900882/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",,,2011/06/23 06:00,2011/10/25 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40395-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-01-330621 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 25;118(8):2035-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-01-330621.

Here, we report that loss of the remaining normal ABL1 allele in these tumors, which results from cryptic interstitial deletion in 9q34 in patients who did not achieve a complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) during treatment, engenders a novel unexpected mechanism of imatinib resistance. BCR-ABL1-positive Abl1(-/-) leukemia cells were refractory to imatinib as indicated by persistent BCR-ABL1-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, lack of BCR-ABL1 protein degradation, increased cell survival, and clonogenic activity. Expression of ABL1 kinase, but not a kinase-dead mutant, restored the antileukemic effects of imatinib in ABL1-negative chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells and in BCR-ABL1-positive Abl1(-/-) murine leukemia cells. The intracellular concentration of imatinib and expression of its transporters were not affected, although proteins involved in BCR-ABL1 degradation were downregulated in Abl1(-/-) cells. Furthermore, 12 genes associated with imatinib resistance were favorably deregulated in Abl1(-/-) leukemia. Taken together, our results indicate that loss of the normal ABL1 kinase may serve as a key prognostic factor that exerts major impact on CML treatment outcomes.","['Virgili, Anna', 'Koptyra, Mateusz', 'Dasgupta, Yashodhara', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka, Eliza', 'Stoklosa, Tomasz', 'Nacheva, Elisabeth P', 'Skorski, Tomasz']","['Virgili A', 'Koptyra M', 'Dasgupta Y', 'Glodkowska-Mrowka E', 'Stoklosa T', 'Nacheva EP', 'Skorski T']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Laboratory, Academic Hematology, University College London Cancer Institute, Royal Free Campus, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA123014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123014-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA123014-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA123014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",PMC3156347,['NIHMS305963'],2011/06/23 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-11-0068 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0068 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 15;71(16):5381-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0068.

We studied p53 protein expression, by immunohistochemistry, in a randomized clinical trial of stage II patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide with or without paclitaxel [Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9344, INT0148]. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Epithelial p53 expression was evaluated using two immunohistochemical antibodies (DO7 and 1801) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from patients with node-positive breast cancer who were randomized to four cycles of cyclophosphamide and one of three doses of doxorubicin (60, 75, or 90 mg/m(2); AC) and to receive four subsequent cycles of paclitaxel (T) or not. Prognostic and predictive value of p53 protein expression was assessed, independent of treatment assignment, for escalating doses of doxorubicin or addition of T with endpoints of relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of 3,121 patients, 1,887 patient specimens treated on C9344 were obtained, passed quality control, and evaluated for p53 expression. Expression was 23% and 27% for mAbs 1801 and D07, respectively, with 92% concordance. In univariate analysis, p53 positivity was associated with worse OS with either antibody, but only p53 staining with monoclonal antibody 1801 had significantly worse RFS. In multivariate analysis, p53 was not predictive of RFS or OS from either doxorubicin dose escalation or addition of paclitaxel regardless of the antibody. CONCLUSION: Nuclear staining of p53 by immunohistochemistry is associated with worse prognosis in node-positive patients treated with adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy but is not a useful predictor of benefit from doxorubicin dose escalation or the addition of paclitaxel.","['Lara, Jonathan F', 'Thor, Ann D', 'Dressler, Lynn G', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Bleiweiss, Ira J', 'Edgerton, Susan', 'Cowan, David', 'Goldstein, Lori J', 'Martino, Silvana', 'Ingle, James N', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Norton, Larry', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Hudis, Clifford A', 'Ellis, Matthew J', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Hayes, Daniel F']","['Lara JF', 'Thor AD', 'Dressler LG', 'Broadwater G', 'Bleiweiss IJ', 'Edgerton S', 'Cowan D', 'Goldstein LJ', 'Martino S', 'Ingle JN', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L', 'Winer EP', 'Hudis CA', 'Ellis MJ', 'Berry DA', 'Hayes DF']","['Department of Pathology, Saint Barnabas Medical Center, Livingston, NJ 07039, USA. jlara@sbhcs.com']",['eng'],"['CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA059518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA074811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA025224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC3149770,['NIHMS305601'],2011/06/23 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-11-0484 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0484 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2011 Aug 1;17(15):5170-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-0484.

Misregulation of the activity of a specific group of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC) is responsible for reducing the intracellular concentration of drugs in leukemic cells. Moreover, a consistent body of evidence also suggests that ABC transporters play a role in cancer progression beyond the efflux of cytotoxic drugs. Despite a large number of studies that investigated the function of the ABC transporters, little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the ABC genes. Here, we present data showing that the oncoprotein c-MYC is a direct transcriptional regulator of a large set of ABC transporters in CML. Furthermore, molecular analysis carried out in CD34+ hematopoietic cell precursors of 21 CML patients reveals that the overexpression of ABC transporters driven by c-MYC is a peculiar characteristic of the CD34+ population in CML and was not found either in the population of mononuclear cells from which they had been purified nor in CD34+ cells isolated from healthy donors. Finally, we describe how the methylation state of CpG islands may regulate the access of c-MYC to ABCG2 gene promoter, a well-studied gene associated with multidrug resistance in CML, hence, affecting its expression. Taken together, our findings support a model in which c-MYC-driven transcriptional events, combined with epigenetic mechanisms, direct and regulate the expression of ABC genes with possible implications in tumor malignancy and drug efflux in CML.","['Porro, Antonio', 'Iraci, Nunzio', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Diolaiti, Daniel', 'Gherardi, Samuele', 'Terragna, Carolina', 'Durante, Sandra', 'Valli, Emanuele', 'Kalebic, Thea', 'Bernardoni, Roberto', 'Perrod, Chiara', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Perini, Giovanni']","['Porro A', 'Iraci N', 'Soverini S', 'Diolaiti D', 'Gherardi S', 'Terragna C', 'Durante S', 'Valli E', 'Kalebic T', 'Bernardoni R', 'Perrod C', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G', 'Perini G']","['Department of Biology, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytotoxins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*genetics/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Cytotoxins', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2011/06/23 06:00,2011/12/15 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1541-7786.MCR-10-0510 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0510 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2011 Aug;9(8):1054-66. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-10-0510.

METHODS: Our study cohort was composed of BC patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2005 and followed up for blood disorders, mean length of follow up = 7.17 years, range 2-18 years. 5790 TNM stage 0-III patients treated with surgery alone, radiation and/or chemotherapy were included. Patients without surgery (n = 111), with stem cell transplantation (n = 98), unknown or non-standard chemotherapy regimens (n = 94), lost to follow up (n = 66) or 'cancer status unknown' (n = 67) were excluded. Rates observed at our community based cancer care institution were compared to SEER incidence data for rate ratio (RR) calculations. RESULTS: 17 cases of MDS/AML (10 MDS/7 AML) occurred during the follow up period, crude rate .29% (95% CI = .17, .47), SEER comparison RR = 3.94 (95% CI = 2.34, 6.15). The RR of MDS in patients age < 65 comparing our cohort incidence to SEER incidence data was 10.88 (95% CI = 3.84, 24.03) and the RR of AML in patients age < 65 was 5.32 (95% CI = 1.31, 14.04). No significant increased risk of MDS or AML was observed in women >/= 65 or the surgery/chemotherapy-only group. A RR of 3.32 (95% CI = 1.42, 6.45) was observed in the surgery/radiation-only group and a RR of 6.32 (95% CI = 3.03, 11.45) in the surgery/radiation/chemotherapy group. 3 out of 10 MDS cases died of disease at an average 3.8 months post diagnosis and five of seven AML cases died at an average 9 months post diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: An elevated rate of MDS and AML was observed among breast cancer patients < 65, those treated with radiation and those treated with radiation and chemotherapy compared to available population incidence data. Although a small number of patients are affected, leukemia risk associated with treatment and younger age is significant.","['Kaplan, Henry G', 'Malmgren, Judith A', 'Atwood, Mary K']","['Kaplan HG', 'Malmgren JA', 'Atwood MK']","['Swedish Cancer Institute at Swedish Medical Center, Seattle, WA, USA. kaplan.hank@swedish.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Mastectomy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC3141775,,2011/06/23 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2010/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-11-260 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-11-260 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2011 Jun 21;11:260. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-11-260.,20110621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Total 109 patients with DS who had one or more CBCs obtained were enrolled. The molecular analysis of the GATA1 gene performed in 10 patients (three TAM, three AML associated with DS at diagnosis, one remission case of AML associated with DS and three DS without TAM or AML). RESULTS: East Asian DS neonates showed low frequency of thrombocytopenia, uncommon neutrophilia and higher prevalence rate of TAM compared to previous reports from western countries. GATA1 mutations were identified in almost all TAM and AML associated with DS samples, but were not detected in the samples from DS without TAM or AML associated with DS.

All transplantations were performed from 1996 through 2010 in our center. Neutrophil and platelet engraftment were significantly delayed after cord blood transplantation. The median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery were 13 d (7-34) and 11 d (5-70) after haploidentical transplant and 20 d (9-125) and 56 d (12-200) after cord blood (P < 0.001). All supportive care measures included red blood cell, and platelet transfusions were significantly increased in cord blood transplantation group.Transplant-related mortality rates was lower with haplo donors (25 +/- 9%) than with cord blood donors (47 +/- 9%) (P < 0.05). Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) more than grade II was also lower in haploidentical transplants (19 +/- 7%) than in cord blood transplants (44 +/- 10%) (P < 0.03). Relapse and chronic GVHD incidence were not significantly different in the two groups. Leukemia-free survival was higher after haploidentical transplants (44 +/- 10%) than after cord blood transplants (33 +/- 7%) (P < 0.03). Main differences were observed in patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: haplo, 41 +/- 13%; cord blood, 26 +/- 9% (P < 0.03) and in advanced phase of disease: haplo, 37 +/- 14%; cord blood, 21 +/- 8% (P < 0.05).

The Mitelman database of chromosome was searched and abnormal karyotypes were assessed. The main clones were analyzed and chromosomal gains and losses were used to design a model of genetic acquisition based on the calculation of a variable called time to occurrence. Our comprehensive study of genetic abnormalities of a large number of PCL karyotypes suggests that PCL is mainly characterized by the presence of whole chromosome losses as well as IgH rearrangements which is similar to that observed in non-hyperdiploid multiple myeloma (MM). Temporal analysis suggests that most PCL have around 10 abnormalities at diagnosis. It is possible that accumulation of abnormalities such as 17p13 (TP53) and 1p losses may trigger the extramedullary features of PCL. Our study demonstrates that cytogenetics is a valuable tool to evaluate the role of genetic imbalances on karyotypic evolution by using a mathematical model.","['Jimenez-Zepeda, Victor H', 'Neme-Yunes, Yvette', 'Braggio, Esteban']","['Jimenez-Zepeda VH', 'Neme-Yunes Y', 'Braggio E']","['Division of Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Intravenous injection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 73 patients with CLL into 244 mice resulted in robust engraftment of leukemic cells into the murine spleens detected 4 wks after transplantation. Leukemic cell engraftment correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with markers reflecting disease activity, e.g., Binet stage and lymphocyte doubling time, and the expression of molecular risk factors including CD38, CD49d, ZAP-70, and IgVH mutational status. Increased engraftment levels of CD38+ as compared to CD38- CLL cells could be attributed, in part, to leukemic cell proliferation as evidenced by combined immunostaining of murine spleen sections for Ki-67 and CD20. In short-term (24 h) homing assays, CD38+ CLL cells migrated more efficiently to the bone marrow of the recipient animals than their CD38- counterparts. Finally, CD38 expression by the leukemic cells was found to be dynamic in that it was regulated not only by elements of the murine microenvironment but also by co-engrafting non-malignant human T cells. This model could be useful for evaluating the biological basis of CLL growth in the context of the hematopoietic microenvironment as well as preclinical testing of novel compounds.","['Aydin, Semra', 'Grabellus, Florian', 'Eisele, Lewin', 'Mollmann, Michael', 'Hanoun, Maher', 'Ebeling, Peter', 'Moritz, Thomas', 'Carpinteiro, Alexander', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Sak, Ali', 'Gothert, Joachim R', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Durig, Jan']","['Aydin S', 'Grabellus F', 'Eisele L', 'Mollmann M', 'Hanoun M', 'Ebeling P', 'Moritz T', 'Carpinteiro A', 'Nuckel H', 'Sak A', 'Gothert JR', 'Duhrsen U', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology, University of Duisburg-Essen Medical School, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",,,2011/06/23 06:00,2011/08/25 06:00,['2011/06/23 06:00'],"['2011/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01626.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2011 Jul;87(1):10-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2011.01626.x.,,,,,,,,,['(c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.'],,,,,,,,,

It remains unclear whether AML stem cells are present in radiation-induced AML, and information regarding AML-initiating cells is lacking. In this study, we identified and analyzed AML stem cells of mice with radiation-induced AML. The AML stem cells were identified by transplanting 100 bone marrow cells from mice with radiation-induced AML. We injected 100 cells of each of seven cell populations corresponding to different stages of hematopoietic cell differentiation and compared the latencies of AMLs induced in recipient mice. The identified radiation-induced AML stem cells frequently displayed similarities in both CD antigen and gene expression profiles with normal common myeloid progenitors. The number of common myeloid progenitor-like AML stem cells was significantly increased in mice with radiation-induced AML, but the progeny of common myeloid progenitors was decreased. In addition, analysis of radiation effects on the hematopoietic system showed that common myeloid progenitor cells were extremely radiosensitive and that their numbers remained at low levels for more than 2 months after radiation exposure.

If the platelet count is >10 000/muL and the patient is asymptomatic, a 'watch and wait' strategy is appropriate since most children with ITP will recover completely without pharmacotherapy. If therapy is indicated because of bleeding or a platelet count <10 000/muL, then treatment with glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), or anti-D are possible initial choices. Glucocorticoid treatment is the least expensive and is our usual first choice of therapy. Its use assumes that the blood counts and blood film have been evaluated to ensure the absence of evidence of alternative diagnoses, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or incipient acute leukemia. IVIg is expensive and often causes severe headache, nausea and vomiting, and requires hospitalization at our institution. Anti-D therapy is also expensive and can only be used in patients who are Rhesus D positive. These therapies, even if only transiently effective, can be repeated if necessary. Children usually recover from newly diagnosed ITP, with or without multiple courses of medical therapy. If the disease becomes 'persistent' with severe thrombocytopenia and/or bleeding, and is no longer responsive to the three first-line therapies, the next approach includes the use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists or rituximab. When the disease persists for more than 1 year, it is considered chronic, and, if symptomatic, it may become necessary to consider third-line therapies, including splenectomy, alternative immunosuppressive agents, or combination or investigative chemoimmunotherapy.

This study was undertaken in patients with AML to determine whether cytogenetic findings predict CNS involvement. METHODS: The medical records of 1354 patients with AML who were treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2000 and December 2008 were reviewed. Forty patients (3%) had CNS involvement at time of presentation or disease recurrence, of whom 37 had conventional cytogenetics performed on bone marrow aspirate material. Demographics, treatment, and status at last follow-up were collected. RESULTS: Eleven patients (30%) had a diploid karyotype, and 14 patients (38%) had complex cytogenetics. Only 5 of the 40 patients had CNS disease at diagnosis, and the remaining patients had CNS disease at relapse. Patients who developed CNS disease were younger (P = .019), had a higher white blood cell (WBC) count at diagnosis (P = .001), had higher lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH) levels (P < .0001), and had higher percentages peripheral blast cells (P = .024) at diagnosis compared with the rest of the population. In addition, patients with CNS disease had higher rates of chromosome 16 inversion (P < .001), chromosome 11 abnormality (P = .005), and trisomy 8 (P = .02) and had a tendency toward complex cytogenetics (P = .2) compared with the control group (patients who had AML with no CNS involvement). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AML and CNS disease often had higher LDH levels and WBC counts at diagnosis, and they often presented with chromosome 16 inversion and chromosome 11 abnormalities. The current study indicated that the overall survival of patients with AML who had CNS involvement is poor.","['Shihadeh, Ferial', 'Reed, Valerie', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Mazloom, Ali', 'Hadziahmetovic, Mersiha', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Allen, Pamela', 'Ballas, Leslie', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Dabaja, Bouthaina']","['Shihadeh F', 'Reed V', 'Faderl S', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Mazloom A', 'Hadziahmetovic M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Allen P', 'Ballas L', 'Pierce S', 'Dabaja B']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*secondary', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,2011/06/22 06:00,2012/02/14 06:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2011/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26253 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2012 Jan 1;118(1):112-7. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26253.

To support clinical development, we conducted a dose-escalation and food-effect evaluation of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of bosutinib in healthy adults. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-ascending dose, sequential-group study of oral bosutinib. Subjects randomly received bosutinib 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg with food; 200 and 400 mg without food; or placebo. Plasma concentrations were determined by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. Non-compartmental PK analyses were performed, and power models assessed dose linearity. RESULTS: Of 55 enrolled subjects, 33 (81%) subjects had adverse events (AEs) after receiving bosutinib. Common AEs included diarrhea (39%), nausea (29%), and headache (22%). Bosutinib 200-600 mg with food was safe and well tolerated. Bosutinib exposures (C (max) and AUC) were linear and dose proportional from 200 to 800 mg with food. Absorption was relatively slow; median time to C (max) was 6 h. Apparent volume of distribution (V (z)/F) was 131-214 L/kg, mean apparent clearance (CL/F) was 2.25-3.81 L/h/kg, and mean terminal elimination half-life (t (1/2)) was 32-39 h. Preliminary food effect assessment showed that exposure to bosutinib increased by ~2.52-fold (P = 0.002) for C (max) and ~2.28-fold (P = 0.002) for AUC when 200 mg bosutinib was administered with food compared with administration under fasting conditions; administration of 400 mg bosutinib with food increased AUC by ~1.5-fold (P = 0.037). Approximately 1% of administered dose was excreted in urine. CONCLUSIONS: Bosutinib 200-600 mg with food was safe and well tolerated. Under fed conditions, bosutinib exposures were linear and dose proportional, and C (max) increased by ~1.5-fold. The t (1/2) supported a once-daily dosing regimen.","['Abbas, Richat', 'Hug, Bruce A', 'Leister, Cathie', 'Gaaloul, Myriam El', 'Chalon, Stephan', 'Sonnichsen, Daryl']","['Abbas R', 'Hug BA', 'Leister C', 'Gaaloul ME', 'Chalon S', 'Sonnichsen D']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Pfizer Inc, 500 Arcola Road, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA. richat.abbas-borhan@pfizer.com']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Food-Drug Interactions', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinolines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Young Adult', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2011/06/22 06:00,2012/02/18 06:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-011-1688-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2012 Jan;69(1):221-7. doi: 10.1007/s00280-011-1688-7.

METHODS: We present data from a Children's Oncology Group case-control study of 443 infants (<1 year of age) diagnosed with acute leukemia [including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)] between 1996 and 2006 and 324 population controls. Mothers recalled household chemical use 1 month before and throughout pregnancy. We used unconditional logistic regression adjusted for birth year, maternal age, and race/ethnicity to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: We did not find evidence for an association between infant leukemia and eight of nine chemical categories. However, exposure to petroleum products during pregnancy was associated with AML (OR = 2.54; 95% CI:1.40-4.62) and leukemia without mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements (""MLL-"") (OR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.47-4.93). No associations were observed for exposure in the month before pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational exposure to petroleum products was associated with infant leukemia, particularly AML, and MLL- cases. Benzene is implicated as a potential carcinogen within this exposure category, but a clear biological mechanism has yet to be elucidated.","['Slater, Megan E', 'Linabery, Amy M', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Johnson, Kimberly J', 'Hilden, Joanne M', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Slater ME', 'Linabery AM', 'Spector LG', 'Johnson KJ', 'Hilden JM', 'Heerema NA', 'Robison LL', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA77598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA077598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA079940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA99936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA79940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Household Products/*poisoning', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors']",PMC4836386,['NIHMS775386'],2011/06/22 06:00,2011/12/30 06:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2010/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10552-011-9798-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2011 Aug;22(8):1197-204. doi: 10.1007/s10552-011-9798-4.

Immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutation status is a powerful prognostic factor in patients with CLL. The presence or absence of IGHV mutation status is currently the gold-standard prognostic factor, but this technique is labor-intensive and costly. The expression of zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70), detected by flow cytometry, has been served as a potential surrogate for the absence of IGHV mutation status since 2003. Given the current problems with the standardization of ZAP-70 assessment by flow cytometry, this chapter reviews the analysis of ZAP-70 expression by flow cytometry and the relative experimental conditions using the associated publications for ""ZAP-70"" and ""detection method"" on Medline since 2003. Thus, mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio method yielded a more reproducible and easily adaptable method to routine use in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.

MPLW515L/K was the commonest mutation; 2 patients showed novel mutations (L513ins and Q516-P518insAAAA). The US and Italy patient cohorts were separately analyzed for comparison of survival and clinical features between MPL-mutated, JAK2-mutated and JAK2/MPL-unmutated cases. JAK2/MPL-unmutated patients were significantly younger than their JAK2-mutated counterparts, in both patient cohorts (P<0.01). In the Florence only cohort, the presence of mutant MPL was associated with older age (P<0.01) and constitutional symptoms (P=0.04) and JAK2V617F with higher hemoglobin (P<0.01) and leukocyte (P=0.03) count; neither patient cohort showed significant associations with platelet count, hemoglobin <10 g/dl, abnormal/unfavorable karyotype, spleen size or prognostic score distribution. To date, 240 deaths and 79 leukemic transformations have been documented among all 603 study patients. Multivariable analysis disclosed no significant difference in overall or leukemia-free survival between the three molecular subgroups. We conclude that the presence of mutant MPL has narrow and inconsistent phenotypic effect in PMF and does not influence overall or leukemia-free survival.","['Pardanani, A', 'Guglielmelli, P', 'Lasho, T L', 'Pancrazzi, A', 'Finke, C M', 'Vannucchi, A M', 'Tefferi, A']","['Pardanani A', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Lasho TL', 'Pancrazzi A', 'Finke CM', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Tefferi A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",,,2011/06/22 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011161 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Dec;25(12):1834-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.161.

SB1518 shows potent effects on cellular JAK/STAT pathways, inhibiting tyrosine phosphorylation on JAK2 (Y221) and downstream STATs. As a consequence SB1518 has potent anti-proliferative effects on myeloid and lymphoid cell lines driven by mutant or wild-type JAK2 or FLT3, resulting from cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. SB1518 has favorable pharmacokinetic properties after oral dosing in mice, is well tolerated and significantly reduces splenomegaly and hepatomegaly in a JAK2(V617F)-driven disease model. SB1518 dose-dependently inhibits intra-tumor JAK2/STAT5 signaling, leading to tumor growth inhibition in a subcutaneous model generated with SET-2 cells derived from a JAK2(V617F) patient with megakaryoblastic leukemia. Moreover, SB1518 is active against primary erythroid progenitor cells sampled from patients with myeloproliferative disease. In summary, SB1518 has a unique profile and is efficacious and well tolerated in JAK2-dependent models.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces clinical remission in APL patients by enhancing the rapid differentiation of APL cells and the clearance of PML-RARalpha, APL's hallmark oncoprotein. In the present study, we demonstrated that both autophagy and Beclin 1, an autophagic protein, are upregulated during the course of ATRA-induced neutrophil/granulocyte differentiation of an APL-derived cell line named NB4 cells. This induction of autophagy is associated with downregulation of Bcl-2 and inhibition of mTOR activity. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of BECN1 expression enhances apoptosis triggered by ATRA in NB4 cells but does not affect the differentiation process. These results provide evidence that the upregulation of Beclin 1 by ATRA constitutes an anti-apoptotic signal for maintaining the viability of mature APL cells, but has no crucial effect on the granulocytic differentiation. This finding may help to elucidate the mechanisms involved in ATRA resistance of APL patients, and in the ATRA syndrome caused by an accumulation of mature APL cells.","['Trocoli, Aurore', 'Mathieu, Julie', 'Priault, Muriel', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Souquere, Sylvie', 'Pierron, Gerard', 'Besancon, Francoise', 'Djavaheri-Mergny, Mojgan']","['Trocoli A', 'Mathieu J', 'Priault M', 'Reiffers J', 'Souquere S', 'Pierron G', 'Besancon F', 'Djavaheri-Mergny M']","['INSERM U916 VINCO, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Autophagy', 'Beclin-1', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Microscopy, Electron/methods', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",PMC3242613,,2011/06/22 06:00,2012/03/31 06:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/31 06:00 [medline]']","['16623 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.7.10.16623 [doi]']",ppublish,Autophagy. 2011 Oct;7(10):1108-14. doi: 10.4161/auto.7.10.16623.

Complete remission was achieved in 89%. A total of 237 patients were then randomized to either TSC consolidation (120 patients) or HDAraC consolidation cycles (117 patients). Overall, there was no significant difference between the 2 consolidation arms (5-year event-free survival [EFS]: 41% for HDAraC vs 35% for TSC), or cumulative incidence of relapse, or treatment-related mortality. Cytogenetically normal AML NPM1(+) or CEBPA(+) and FLT3-ITD(-) had the same outcome as those with favorable cytogenetics. When considering favorable and unfavorable risk groups, the trend was in favor of HDAraC. However, the difference became significant when considering intermediate cytogenetics (5-year EFS: 49% vs 29%; P = .02), especially cytogenetically normal AML (5-year EFS: 48% vs 31%; P = .04), which was related to lower relapse rate and less toxicity.

Oligo-array CGH identified two 6q21 regions that were most frequently deleted (14 of 39 or 36%). One of these regions included POPDC3, PREP, PRDM1, ATG5, and AIM1, whereas the other included LACE1 and FOXO3. All genes located in these regions, except for POPDC3 and AIM1, were down-regulated in neoplastic samples, as determined by gene-expression analysis, and were therefore considered to be candidate tumor-suppressor genes. A20 and HACE1, the well-known tumor-suppressor genes located on 6q21-23, were included as candidate genes because they also demonstrated frequent genomic deletions and down-regulated expression. The Tet-Off NK cell line NKL was subsequently established for functional analyses. Seven candidate genes were transduced into Tet-Off NKL and forced re-expression was induced. Re-expression of FOXO3 and PRDM1 suppressed NKL proliferation, but this was not the case after re-expression of the other genes. This effect was confirmed using another NK cell line, SNK10. Furthermore, genomic analyses detected nonsense mutations of PRDM1 that led to functional inactivation in one cell line and one clinical sample. PRDM1 and FOXO3 are considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of NK-cell neoplasms.","['Karube, Kennosuke', 'Nakagawa, Masao', 'Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Takeuchi, Ichiro', 'Honma, Keiichiro', 'Nakashima, Yasuhiro', 'Shimizu, Norio', 'Ko, Young-Hyeh', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Nakamura, Shigeo', 'Seto, Masao']","['Karube K', 'Nakagawa M', 'Tsuzuki S', 'Takeuchi I', 'Honma K', 'Nakashima Y', 'Shimizu N', 'Ko YH', 'Morishima Y', 'Ohshima K', 'Nakamura S', 'Seto M']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization/*methods', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', '*Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genome, Human', 'Genomics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,,2011/06/22 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40603-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-04-346890 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 22;118(12):3195-204. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-04-346890.

To additionally expand our knowledge on the role of immune stimulation in the causation of AML and MDS, we have conducted a large, population-based study to evaluate the risk of AML and MDS associated with a prior history of a broad range of infections or autoimmune diseases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: By using population-based central registries in Sweden, we included 9,219 patients with AML, 1,662 patients with MDS, and 42,878 matched controls. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the association of AML or MDS with infectious and/or autoimmune diseases. RESULTS: Overall, a history of any infectious disease was associated with a significantly increased risk of both AML (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.4) and MDS (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 1.5). These associations were significant even when we limited infections to those occurring 3 or more years before AML/MDS. A previous history of any autoimmune disease was associated with a 1.7-fold (95% CI, 1.5 to 1.9) increased risk for AML and 2.1-fold (95% CI, 1.7 to 2.6) increased risk for MDS. A large range of conditions were each significantly associated with AML and MDS. CONCLUSION: Our novel findings indicate that chronic immune stimulation acts as a trigger for AML/MDS development. The underlying mechanisms may also be due to a common genetic predisposition or an effect of treatment for infections/autoimmune conditions.","['Kristinsson, Sigurdur Y', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Hultcrantz, Malin', 'Derolf, Asa R', 'Landgren, Ola', 'Goldin, Lynn R']","['Kristinsson SY', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Hultcrantz M', 'Derolf AR', 'Landgren O', 'Goldin LR']","['Dept of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. sigurdur.kristinsson@karolinska.se']",['eng'],['Z01 CP004410-31/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Communicable Diseases/complications/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",PMC3138717,,2011/06/22 06:00,2011/09/17 06:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2011.34.8540 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2011.34.8540 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2011 Jul 20;29(21):2897-903. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.8540.

By weighing each cell in two fluids of different densities, our technique measures the single-cell mass, volume, and density of approximately 500 cells per hour with a density precision of 0.001 g mL(-1). We observe that the intrinsic cell-to-cell variation in density is nearly 100-fold smaller than the mass or volume variation. As a result, we can measure changes in cell density indicative of cellular processes that would be otherwise undetectable by mass or volume measurements. Here, we demonstrate this with four examples: identifying Plasmodium falciparum malaria-infected erythrocytes in a culture, distinguishing transfused blood cells from a patient's own blood, identifying irreversibly sickled cells in a sickle cell patient, and identifying leukemia cells in the early stages of responding to a drug treatment. These demonstrations suggest that the ability to measure single-cell density will provide valuable insights into cell state for a wide range of biological processes.","['Grover, William H', 'Bryan, Andrea K', 'Diez-Silva, Monica', 'Suresh, Subra', 'Higgins, John M', 'Manalis, Scott R']","['Grover WH', 'Bryan AK', 'Diez-Silva M', 'Suresh S', 'Higgins JM', 'Manalis SR']","['Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['K08 DK083242-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK083242/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM085457/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK083242-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P50GM68762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK083242-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK083242-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK083242/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01GM085457/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL094270/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL094270/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 GM068762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 DK083242-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['Anemia, Sickle Cell/blood', 'Animals', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cell Count/*instrumentation/*methods', 'Cell Size', 'Erythrocytes/cytology/parasitology', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/blood/drug therapy', 'Malaria, Falciparum/blood/parasitology', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/instrumentation/methods']",PMC3131325,,2011/06/22 06:00,2011/09/10 06:00,['2011/06/22 06:00'],"['2011/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['1104651108 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1104651108 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jul 5;108(27):10992-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1104651108.

Cytogenetic analysis has been used to identify the molecular background of haematological malignancies.

Among 111 T-LBL cases in our clinical trial, we obtained complete cytogenetic data from 56 patients. The comparison between our cytogenetic findings and those from three published T-LBL studies revealed no significant difference. However, meta-analysis showed that translocations involving chromosome region 9q34 were significantly more common in T-LBL than in T-ALL. In particular, four out of the 92 T-LBL cases, but none of the 523 paediatric T-ALL cases, showed translocation t(9;17)(q34;q22-23) (P=0.0004).

This pilot study describes the first attempt to characterize non-cycling cells from a small series of human FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutation positive samples. CD34+ AML cells from patients with FLT3 mutation positive AML were cultured on murine stroma. In expansion cultures, non-cycling cells were found to retain CD34+ expression in contrast to dividing cells. Leukaemic gene rearrangements could be detected in non-cycling cells, indicating their leukaemic origin. Significantly, the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was found in the non-cycling fraction of four out of five cases. Exposure to the FLT3-directed inhibitor TKI258 clearly inhibited the growth of AML CD34+ cells in short-term cultures and colony-forming unit assays. Crucially, non-cycling cells were not eradicated, with the exception of one case, which exhibited exquisite sensitivity to the compound. Moreover, in longer-term cultures, TKI258-treated non-cycling cells showed no growth impairment compared to treatment-naive non-cycling cells. These findings suggest that non-cycling cells in AML may constitute a disease reservoir that is resistant to TK inhibition.

Our previous published data have demonstrated that arsenite exposure induces apoptosis in the HepG2 human hepatoma cells via activating JNKs/AP-1 pathway, but the upstream signaling events responsible for JNKs (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) cascade activation have not been fully discovered. Since cross-talk between IKK/NF-kappaB and JNKs pathways under stress conditions is a hot topic, in this article, we investigate the potential roles of IKKalpha and IKKbeta, the catalytic subunits of IKK complexes, in the arsenite-induced JNKs pathway activation in the HepG2 cells. We found that arsenite exposure induced JNKs and AP-1 activation accompanying with a significant reduction of both IKKalpha and IKKbeta expressions. Overexpression of IKKbeta, but not of IKKalpha, inhibited arsenite-induced MKK7/JNKs/AP-1 pathway activation as well as the apoptotic response. Therefore, we conclude that the downregulation of IKKbeta expression is the prerequisite signaling event for mediating JNKs pathway activation and the cellular apoptotic response in the HepG2 cells under arsenite exposure. Targeting IKKbeta might be helpful to enhance the tumor therapeutic effect of arsenite.","['Li, Yi', 'Hao, Yi', 'Gao, Ming', 'Dong, Wen', 'Hu, Meiru', 'Yuan, Shengtao', 'Song, Lun']","['Li Y', 'Hao Y', 'Gao M', 'Dong W', 'Hu M', 'Yuan S', 'Song L']","[""Department of Cellular Immunology, Beijing Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*enzymology/pathology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",,,2011/06/21 06:00,2012/02/22 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-011-0921-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2011 Dec;358(1-2):61-6. doi: 10.1007/s11010-011-0921-3.

After its original discovery in prostate cancer tissue from North American patients, it was subsequently detected in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome from the same continent. However, most other research groups, mainly from Europe, reported negative results. The positive results could possibly be attributed to contamination with mouse products in a number of cases, as XMRV is nearly identical in nucleotide sequence to endogenous retroviruses in the mouse genome. But the detection of integrated XMRV proviruses in prostate cancer tissue proves it to be a genuine virus that replicates in human cells, leaving the question: how did XMRV enter the human population? We will discuss two possible routes: either via direct virus transmission from mouse to human, as repeatedly seen for, e.g., Hantaviruses, or via the use of mouse-related products by humans, including vaccines. We hypothesize that mouse cells or human cell lines used for vaccine production could have been contaminated with a replicating variant of the XMRV precursors encoded by the mouse genome.","['van der Kuyl, Antoinette Cornelia', 'Cornelissen, Marion', 'Berkhout, Ben']","['van der Kuyl AC', 'Cornelissen M', 'Berkhout B']","['Laboratory of Experimental Virology, Department of Medical Microbiology, Center for Infection and Immunity Amsterdam, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam Amsterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC3109487,,2010/01/01 00:00,2010/01/01 00:01,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2010/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2010/12/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2010.00147 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2011 Jan 17;1:147. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2010.00147. eCollection 2010.,20110117,['NOTNLM'],"['XMRV', 'mouse', 'retrovirus', 'transmission', 'vaccine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of the signaling pathways mediating this leukemia/microenvironment interplay is critical for the development of novel molecular targeted therapies.We observed that primary leukemia B-cell precursors aberrantly express receptors of the BAFF-system, BAFF-R, BCMA, and TACI. These receptors are functional as their ligation triggers activation of NF-kappaB, MAPK/JNK, and Akt signaling. Leukemia cells express surface BAFF and APRIL ligands, and soluble BAFF is significantly higher in leukemia patients in comparison to age-matched controls. Interestingly, leukemia cells also express surface APRIL, which seems to be encoded by APRIL-delta, a novel isoform that lacks the furin convertase domain. Importantly, we observed BM microenvironmental cells express the ligands BAFF and APRIL, including surface and secreted BAFF by BM endothelial cells. Functional studies showed that signals through BAFF-system receptors impact the survival and basal proliferation of leukemia B-cell precursors, and support the involvement of both homotypic and heterotypic mechanisms.This study shows an unforeseen role for the BAFF-system in the biology of precursor B-cell leukemia, and suggests that the target disruption of BAFF signals may constitute a valid strategy for the treatment of this cancer.","['Maia, Sara', 'Pelletier, Marc', 'Ding, Jixin', 'Hsu, Yen-Ming', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Rao, Sambasiva P', 'Nadler, Lee M', 'Cardoso, Angelo A']","['Maia S', 'Pelletier M', 'Ding J', 'Hsu YM', 'Sallan SE', 'Rao SP', 'Nadler LM', 'Cardoso AA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor)', '0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)', '0 (Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics', 'B-Cell Activation Factor Receptor/*genetics', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor Protein/*genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/chemistry/genetics']",PMC3110793,,2011/06/21 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0020787 [doi]', 'PONE-D-11-03397 [pii]']",ppublish,PLoS One. 2011;6(6):e20787. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0020787.

Inherited (HFE genotype) and treatment-related factors (blood units (BU), Iron overload) affecting hepcidin (measured by C-ELISA) were studied in 42 consecutive patients with AML prior to and after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Results. Elevated serum ferritin pre- and post-HCT was present in all patients. Median hepcidin pre- and post-HCT of 358 and 398 ng/mL, respectively, were elevated compared to controls (median 52 ng/mL) (P < .0001). Liver and renal function, prior chemotherapies, and conditioning had no impact on hepcidin. Despite higher total BU after HCT compared to pretransplantation (P < .0005), pre- and posttransplant ferritin and hepcidin were similar. BU influenced ferritin (P = .001) and hepcidin (P = .001). No correlation of pre- or posttransplant hepcidin with pretransplant ferritin was found. HFE genotype did not influence hepcidin. Conclusions.

In the present study, we determined global protein expression profiles of these bacteria cultured in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60. Mass spectrometric (MS) analyses identified a total of 1,212 A. phagocytophilum and 1,021 E. chaffeensis proteins, representing 89.3 and 92.3% of the predicted bacterial proteomes, respectively. Nearly all bacterial proteins (>/=99%) with known functions were expressed, whereas only approximately 80% of ""hypothetical"" proteins were detected in infected human cells. Quantitative MS/MS analyses indicated that highly expressed proteins in both bacteria included chaperones, enzymes involved in biosynthesis and metabolism, and outer membrane proteins, such as A. phagocytophilum P44 and E. chaffeensis P28/OMP-1. Among 113 A. phagocytophilum p44 paralogous genes, 110 of them were expressed and 88 of them were encoded by pseudogenes. In addition, bacterial infection of HL-60 cells up-regulated the expression of human proteins involved mostly in cytoskeleton components, vesicular trafficking, cell signaling, and energy metabolism, but down-regulated some pattern recognition receptors involved in innate immunity. Our proteomics data represent a comprehensive analysis of A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis proteomes, and provide a quantitative view of human host protein expression profiles regulated by bacterial infection. The availability of these proteomic data will provide new insights into biology and pathogenesis of these obligatory intracellular pathogens.","['Lin, Mingqun', 'Kikuchi, Takane', 'Brewer, Heather M', 'Norbeck, Angela D', 'Rikihisa, Yasuko']","['Lin M', 'Kikuchi T', 'Brewer HM', 'Norbeck AD', 'Rikihisa Y']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI030010/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI047885/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC3109344,,2011/06/21 06:00,2011/06/21 06:01,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2010/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2011.00024 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2011 Feb 17;2:24. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2011.00024. eCollection 2011.,20110217,['NOTNLM'],"['Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Ehrlichia chaffeensis', 'human granulocytic anaplasmosis', 'human leukocytes', 'human monocytic ehrlichiosis', 'proteomic analysis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the administration of Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitors to patients with PMF often dramatically reduces the degree of splenomegaly and improves in systemic symptoms, these drugs do not correct the cytopenias associated with PMF, nor do they reverse abnormalities of BM architecture or substantially influence the JAK2V617F allele burden. Furthermore, the effects of such small-molecule therapy on the natural history of PMF and the rate of its evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain uncertain. Recently, additional genetic alterations that precede or accompany JAK2V617F in PMF have been documented. These findings indicate that therapies directed against a single genetic lesion such as JAK2V617F are unlikely to be curative of PMF. These observations have led us to consider alternative therapeutic targets for drug development. The dysregulation of the hematopoietic microenvironment in PMF provides an attractive therapeutic target. Novel agents capable of correcting the abnormalities seen in PMF would probably be used in combination with the currently available therapeutic armamentarium, including the JAK2 inhibitors, to treat patients with PMF, which would represent a paradigm shift in the management of such patients.","['Hoffman, Ronald']",['Hoffman R'],"['Myeloproliferative Disorders Program, Tisch Cancer Institute, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, Box 1079, One Gustave L.

The dynamic instability of microtubules has an important role in this process, and has been shown to be an effective target for cancer chemotherapy. Several agents that target non-microtubule mitotic proteins, including the motor protein Eg5, Aurora kinases and Polo-like kinases, are currently being developed as chemotherapeutic drugs. However, because the efficacies of these drugs remain elusive, new molecular targets that have essential roles in tumor cells are desired. Here, we provide in vivo evidence that transforming acidic coiled-coil-3 (Tacc3) is a potential target for cancer chemotherapy. Using MRI, we showed that Tacc3 loss led to the regression of mouse thymic lymphoma in vivo, which was accompanied by massive apoptosis. By contrast, normal tissues, including the thymus, showed no overt abnormalities, despite high Tacc3 expression. in vitro analysis indicated that Tacc3 depletion induced multi-polar spindle formation, which led to mitotic arrest, followed by apoptosis. Similar responses have been observed in Burkitt's lymphoma and T-ALL. These results show that Tacc3 is a vulnerable component of the spindle assembly in lymphoma cells and is a promising cancer chemotherapy target.","['Yao, R', 'Natsume, Y', 'Saiki, Y', 'Shioya, H', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Yamori, T', 'Toki, H', 'Aoki, I', 'Saga, T', 'Noda, T']","['Yao R', 'Natsume Y', 'Saiki Y', 'Shioya H', 'Takeuchi K', 'Yamori T', 'Toki H', 'Aoki I', 'Saga T', 'Noda T']","['Department of Cell Biology, Cancer Institute, The Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan. ryao@jfcr.or.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (TACC3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Fetal Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous/*genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology']",,,2011/06/21 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['onc2011235 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2011.235 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2012 Jan 12;31(2):135-48. doi: 10.1038/onc.2011.235.

LEF1 has an important role in lymphopoiesis, and is normally expressed in T and pro-B cells but not mature B cells. However, gene expression profiling demonstrates overexpression of LEF1 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and knockdown of LEF1 decreases the survival of the leukemic cells. So far, the data on LEF1 expression in B-cell lymphomas are limited. This study represents the first attempt to assess LEF1 by immunohistochemistry in a large series (290 cases) of B-cell lymphomas. Strong nuclear staining of LEF1 was observed in virtually all neoplastic cells in 92 of 92 (100%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas including two CD5- cases, with strongest staining in cells with Richter's transformation. LEF1 also highlighted the morphologically inconspicuous small lymphocytic lymphoma component in three composite lymphomas. All 53 mantle cell lymphomas, 31 low-grade follicular lymphomas and 31 marginal zone lymphomas, including 3 CD5+ cases, were negative. In 12 grade 3 follicular lymphomas, LEF1 was positive in a small subset (5-15%) of cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, however, demonstrated significant variability in LEF1 expression with overall positivity in 27 of 71 (38%) cases. Our results demonstrate that nuclear overexpression of LEF1 is highly associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and may serve as a convenient marker for differential diagnosis of small B-cell lymphomas. The expression of beta-catenin, the coactivator of LEF1 in WNT signaling, was examined in 50 chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas, of which 44 (88%) showed negative nuclear staining. The findings of universal nuclear overexpression of LEF1 but lack of nuclear beta-catenin in the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma suggest that the pro-survival function of LEF1 in this disease may be independent of WNT/beta-catenin signaling.","['Tandon, Bevan', 'Peterson, Loann', 'Gao, Juehua', 'Nelson, Beverly', 'Ma, Shuo', 'Rosen, Steven', 'Chen, Yi-Hua']","['Tandon B', 'Peterson L', 'Gao J', 'Nelson B', 'Ma S', 'Rosen S', 'Chen YH']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Chicago', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/*analysis', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/chemistry/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/chemistry/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta Catenin/analysis']",,,2011/06/21 06:00,2012/03/01 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/01 06:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2011103 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2011.103 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2011 Nov;24(11):1433-43. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2011.103.

Numerous clinical studies have shown that alemtuzumab is effective as first-line treatment and in patients who have relapsed disease or who are refractory to fludarabine. Despite improvements in response rates and survival compared with combination chemotherapy, there remains some hesitation to incorporate alemtuzumab into management because of known toxicities. Adverse events in patients treated with standard-dose, single-agent alemtuzumab occur at generally predictable time points during treatment and can be managed effectively; this outcome is less established when alemtuzumab is incorporated into combination regimens. Variability in alemtuzumab dosing, route of administration, and duration of therapy has led to inconsistent and sometimes adverse safety consequences. This article presents an overview of clinical studies with alemtuzumab as a single agent, in combination, or in consolidation, with discussion of toxicity and suggestions for ensuring that the efficacious outcomes following alemtuzumab therapy are not outweighed by safety concerns.","['Elter, Thomas', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Montillo, Marco']","['Elter T', 'Hallek M', 'Montillo M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology Cologne-Bonn, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. thomas.elter@uk-koeln.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab']",,,2011/06/21 06:00,2011/10/07 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2011 May;9(5):364-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds can cause apoptosis in human cells, but the mechanisms underlying chromium-induced apoptosis are not clear. A marker of apoptosis is the exposure of phosphatidylserine on cell membrane and the modification of phosphatidylserine metabolism. The aim of this study was to verify whether chromium could cause phosphatidylserine exposure and modification of its metabolism in human lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (MOLT-4). METHODS: Phosphatidylserine exposure was evaluated by annexin V binding whereas phosphatidylserine metabolism was studied measuring the incorporation of [(3)H]serine. RESULTS: Cell treatment with Cr(VI) increases phosphatidylserine exposure and cell apoptosis, but decreases the incorporation of [(3)H]serine into phosphatidylserine in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: The Cr(VI)-induced apoptosis also through modification of phosphatidylserine exposure and metabolism.","['Gambelunghe, Angela', 'Buratta, Sandra', 'Ferrara, Giuseppina', 'Mozzi, Rita', 'Marchetti, Cristina', 'Murgia, Nicola', 'Muzi, Giacomo']","['Gambelunghe A', 'Buratta S', 'Ferrara G', 'Mozzi R', 'Marchetti C', 'Murgia N', 'Muzi G']","['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Section of Occupational Medicine, University of Perugia, Piazzale G.

A comparison was made between the properties of cell lines isolated from in vivo- and in vitro-obtained blastocysts. Our results showed that 57.1% of the in vivo-obtained blastocysts attached to the feeder layer and that 33.3% of them started to grow in a monolayer. The percentage of attached in vitro-produced blastocysts was lower (24.6%), and only 6.9% of them started to grow. Outgrowths from the in vitro-produced blastocysts formed mainly trophectoderm or epithelial-like monolayer, whereas the in vivo-obtained blastocysts formed heterogeneous outgrowths that also contained cells with embryonic stem (ES)-like morphology. Detailed analyses showed that the primary outgrowths with ES-like morphology expressed the pluripotency markers OCT-4 and NANOG and revealed intensive alkaline phosphatase staining, while they did not express markers of differentiation. The majority of passaged cells, including those with ES-like morphology, lacked OCT-4 protein and revealed expression of specific differentiation markers (cytokeratin 18, lamins A/C, transferrin, alpha-fetoprotein and GATA-4), although they still expressed NANOG and exhibited weak alkaline phosphatase activity. Moreover, these cells spontaneously differentiated into neural, fibroblast or epithelial-like cells, even in the presence of leukaemia inhibitory factor.

In fact, comorbidities have been identified as significant determinants of response to therapy in older patients with acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer. The Charlson comorbidity index and adult comorbidity evaluation-27 are lists of comorbidities with a weight assigned from 1 to 6 for the former and from 0 to 3 for the latter score, derived from relative risk estimates of a proportional hazard regression model using clinical data. DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the Charlson index and adult comorbidity evaluation-27 score in a cohort of 125 elderly (> 60 years) patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia who received dasatinib after showing resistance or intolerance to imatinib with the aim of establishing associations between comorbidities and the development of pleural effusions or compliance with the drug treatment. RESULTS: We found a significant association between the Charlson index as well as the adult comorbidity evaluation-27 score and the rate of drug reduction or suspension: with regards to the Charlson index, 49% of score 0 patients had a dose reduction compared to 63% of patients with score 1, 74% of those with score 2 and 100% of patients with score 3-5 (P=0.03); with regards to the adult comorbidity evaluation-27 score, 45% of patients had score 0-1 and 69% of patients with score 2-3 had a dose reduction. Of the 65 patients with Charlson score 0, 29% had at least one suspension of treatment (79% for hematologic and 21% for non-hematologic toxicity), compared to 46% of patients with score 1 (37% for hematologic and 69% for non-hematologic toxicity), 58% of patients with score 2 (36% for hematologic and 64% for non-hematologic toxicity) and 100% of patients with score 3 or 4 (all patients for both types of toxicity). High adult comorbidity index-27 scores identified patients at high risk of grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity. Forty-one patients (32.8%) experienced pleural effusion during treatment: the highest scores for both indices were associated with an increased risk of pleural effusions. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated with dasatinib, the rate of drug reduction or suspension and the incidence of pleural effusions seem to be associated with the presence of comorbidities: stratification according to the Charlson index and adult comorbidity evaluation-27 score before dasatinib therapy may enable the identification of patients at risk of major toxicities.","['Breccia, Massimo', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Russo Rossi, Antonella', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Vigneri, Paolo', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Sica, Simona', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Alimena, Giuliana']","['Breccia M', 'Latagliata R', 'Stagno F', 'Luciano L', 'Gozzini A', 'Castagnetti F', 'Fava C', 'Cavazzini F', 'Annunziata M', 'Russo Rossi A', 'Pregno P', 'Abruzzese E', 'Vigneri P', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Sica S', 'Pane F', 'Santini V', 'Specchia G', 'Rosti G', 'Alimena G']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Roma, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Pleural Effusion/*complications/epidemiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC3186306,,2011/06/21 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.041251 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.041251 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Oct;96(10):1457-61. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.041251.

The FLT3-D835 mutation was not significantly associated with any clinical or biological characteristic. Univariate analysis showed higher relapse and lower survival rates in patients with a FLT3-internal tandem duplication, while no impact was observed in relation to FLT3-D835. The prognostic value of the FLT3-internal tandem duplication was not retained in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations are associated with several hematologic features in acute promyelocytic leukemia, in particular with high white blood cell counts, but we were unable to demonstrate an independent prognostic value in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline-based regimens.","['Barragan, Eva', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Camos, Mireia', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Calasanz, Maria J', 'Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Gomez-Casares, Maria T', 'Ayala, Rosa', 'Lopez, Javier', 'Fuster, Oscar', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Chillon, Carmen', 'Larrayoz, Maria J', 'Sanchez-Godoy, Pedro', 'Gonzalez-Campos, Jose', 'Manso, Felix', 'Amador, Maria L', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Barragan E', 'Montesinos P', 'Camos M', 'Gonzalez M', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Roman-Gomez J', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Ayala R', 'Lopez J', 'Fuster O', 'Colomer D', 'Chillon C', 'Larrayoz MJ', 'Sanchez-Godoy P', 'Gonzalez-Campos J', 'Manso F', 'Amador ML', 'Vellenga E', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sanz MA']","['Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC3186308,,2011/06/21 06:00,2012/02/11 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2011.044933 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2011.044933 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2011 Oct;96(10):1470-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2011.044933.

We randomized newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML patients with a low or intermediate Sokal risk score and in imatinib-induced complete hematologic remission either to receive a combination of pegylated IFN-alpha2b (Peg-IFN-alpha2b) 50 mug weekly and imatinib 400 mg daily (n = 56) or to receive imatinib 400 mg daily monotherapy (n = 56). The primary endpoint was the major molecular response (MMR) rate at 12 months after randomization. In both arms, 4 patients (7%) discontinued imatinib treatment (1 because of blastic transformation in imatinib arm). In addition, in the combination arm, 34 patients (61%) discontinued Peg-IFN-alpha2b, most because of toxicity. The MMR rate at 12 months was significantly higher in the imatinib plus Peg-IFN-alpha2b arm (82%) compared with the imatinib monotherapy arm (54%; intention-to-treat, P = .002). The MMR rate increased with the duration of Peg-IFN-alpha2b treatment (< 12-week MMR rate 67%, > 12-week MMR rate 91%). Thus, the addition of even relatively short periods of Peg-IFN-alpha2b to imatinib markedly increased the MMR rate at 12 months of therapy. Lower doses of Peg-IFN-alpha2b may enhance tolerability while retaining efficacy and could be considered in future protocols with curative intent.","['Simonsson, Bengt', 'Gedde-Dahl, Tobias', 'Markevarn, Berit', 'Remes, Kari', 'Stentoft, Jesper', 'Almqvist, Anders', 'Bjoreman, Mats', 'Flogegard, Max', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Lindblom, Anders', 'Malm, Claes', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Myhr-Eriksson, Kristina', 'Ohm, Lotta', 'Rasanen, Anu', 'Sinisalo, Marjatta', 'Sjalander, Anders', 'Stromberg, Ulla', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weiss', 'Ehrencrona, Hans', 'Gruber, Franz', 'Kairisto, Veli', 'Olsson, Karin', 'Sandin, Fredrik', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Nielsen, Johan Lanng', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Porkka, Kimmo']","['Simonsson B', 'Gedde-Dahl T', 'Markevarn B', 'Remes K', 'Stentoft J', 'Almqvist A', 'Bjoreman M', 'Flogegard M', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Lindblom A', 'Malm C', 'Mustjoki S', 'Myhr-Eriksson K', 'Ohm L', 'Rasanen A', 'Sinisalo M', 'Sjalander A', 'Stromberg U', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Ehrencrona H', 'Gruber F', 'Kairisto V', 'Olsson K', 'Sandin F', 'Nagler A', 'Nielsen JL', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Porkka K']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Uppsala and Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. bengt.simonsson@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'Q46947FE7K (peginterferon alfa-2a)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/06/21 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40607-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2011-02-336685 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Sep 22;118(12):3228-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2011-02-336685.

The nuclear oncogene SKI is up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with -7/del7q. Here we asked whether loss of miRNAs on chromosome 7q may explain this up-regulation. miR-29a expression was found to be down-regulated in AML with -7/del7q. Forced expression of miR-29a down-regulated Ski and its target gene, Nr-CAM, whereas miR-29a inhibition induced Ski expression. Luciferase assays validated a functional binding site for miR-29a in the 3' untranslated region of SKI. Finally, in samples of AML patients, we observed an inverse correlation of Ski and miR-29a expression, respectively. In conclusion, up-regulation of Ski in AML with -7/del7q is caused by loss of miR-29a. miR-29a may therefore function as an important tumor suppressor in AML by restraining expression of the SKI oncogene.","['Teichler, Sabine', 'Illmer, Thomas', 'Roemhild, Josephine', 'Ovcharenko, Dmitriy', 'Stiewe, Thorsten', 'Neubauer, Andreas']","['Teichler S', 'Illmer T', 'Roemhild J', 'Ovcharenko D', 'Stiewe T', 'Neubauer A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University of Marburg, Medical Center of the University Giessen and Marburg, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '126648-96-2 (SKI protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2011/06/21 06:00,2011/10/13 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)41104-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2010-09-306258 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2011 Aug 18;118(7):1899-902. doi: 10.1182/blood-2010-09-306258.

Support Vector Machines are a wide spread approach for classifying biological data, due to their high accuracy, their ability to deal with structured data such as strings, and the ease to integrate various types of data. However, it is unclear how to correct for confounding factors such as population structure, age or gender or experimental conditions in Support Vector Machine classification. RESULTS: In this article, we present a Support Vector Machine classifier that can correct the prediction for observed confounding factors. This is achieved by minimizing the statistical dependence between the classifier and the confounding factors. We prove that this formulation can be transformed into a standard Support Vector Machine with rescaled input data. In our experiments, our confounder correcting SVM (ccSVM) improves tumor diagnosis based on samples from different labs, tuberculosis diagnosis in patients of varying age, ethnicity and gender, and phenotype prediction in the presence of population structure and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.

""CRp,"" a response criterion defined as fulfillment of all criteria for CR except platelet count recovery to >/=100 x 10(9)/L, is associated with inferior outcomes following chemotherapy. The prognostic importance of CRp before allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains unknown. We analyzed a cohort of AML (n = 334) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 10) patients to determine the prognostic significance of achieving CR versus CRp before allo-SCT. At time of transplantation, 266 patients were in CR (CR1 and >/=CR2) and 78 in CRp (CR1p and >/=CR2p). Median follow-up was 38 months (3-131 months). Overall survival, progression-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were most favorable in patients transplanted in CR (CR1 or >/=CR2) compared with CRp (CR1p or >/=CR2p). Achieving CR is therefore associated with improved posttransplantation outcomes compared with achieving CRp and is a significant prognostic factor that needs to be considered when evaluating AML/MDS patients for clinical trials and allo-SCT.","['Alatrash, Gheath', 'Pelosini, Matteo', 'Saliba, Rima M', 'Koca, Ebru', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Andersson, Borje S', 'Chiattone, Alexandre', 'Zhang, Weiqing', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Cernosek, Amanda M', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Khouri, Issa F', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'de Lima, Marcos J']","['Alatrash G', 'Pelosini M', 'Saliba RM', 'Koca E', 'Rondon G', 'Andersson BS', 'Chiattone A', 'Zhang W', 'Giralt SA', 'Cernosek AM', 'Kebriaei P', 'Alousi AM', 'Popat UR', 'Hosing C', 'Khouri IF', 'Champlin RE', 'de Lima MJ']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*physiology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4061975,['NIHMS589050'],2011/06/21 06:00,2012/06/01 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2010/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/06/01 06:00 [medline]']","['S1083-8791(11)00237-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2011 Dec;17(12):1841-5. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2011.05.018.

Thus, recognition of the long-term sequelae of treatment (ie, surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) is particularly important in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To review the adverse effects and the risk of secondary malignancy in long-term survivors of testicular cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We conducted a Medline search to identify original articles and reviews on the long-term effects of testicular cancer treatment. Although the search included articles from January 1948 to February 2011, the majority of the included articles were published in the last two decades. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: All studies examining the long-term sequelae of treatment in testicular cancer are retrospective in nature, with most classified as cohort, case-control, and/or epidemiologic studies. Given that no standardized method of reporting long-term complications exists, evidence synthesis is limited. CONCLUSIONS: Recent evidence suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity, and mild reductions in renal function in survivors of testicular cancer. Treatment of testicular malignancy can also negatively affect gonadal function and fertility and has been shown to result in an increased risk of solid malignancy and leukemia.","['Abouassaly, Robert', 'Fossa, Sophie D', 'Giwercman, Aleksander', 'Kollmannsberger, Christian', 'Motzer, Robert J', 'Schmoll, Hans-Joachim', 'Sternberg, Cora N']","['Abouassaly R', 'Fossa SD', 'Giwercman A', 'Kollmannsberger C', 'Motzer RJ', 'Schmoll HJ', 'Sternberg CN']","['Urological Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA. robert.abouassaly@UHhospitals.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Eur Urol,European urology,7512719,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/etiology', 'Kidney Diseases/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/etiology', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology', '*Orchiectomy/adverse effects', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/06/21 06:00,2011/12/13 00:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/13 00:00 [medline]']","['S0302-2838(11)00603-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.eururo.2011.05.055 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur Urol. 2011 Sep;60(3):516-26. doi: 10.1016/j.eururo.2011.05.055.

The 5-year estimates of leukemia-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality were 30%, 25%, and 45%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the only risk factor associated with relapse was the interval between the first relapse and the second relapse. Second relapses occurring >26 months from the first relapse were associated with lower risk for post-HCT relapse compared with second relapses occurring at </=26 months (relative risk, 0.4; P = .01). Relapse risk was lowest when late second relapse was preceded by late first relapse (>36 months from diagnosis), as demonstrated by a 3-year relapse rate of 9% (P = .0009).

In general, a single miRNA concurrently downregulates hundreds of target mRNAs. Thus, miRNAs play a key role in fine-tuning of diverse cellular functions, such as development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. However, it remains to be fully elucidated whether a set of miRNA target genes regulated by an individual miRNA in the whole human microRNAome generally constitute the biological network of functionally-associated molecules or simply reflect a random set of functionally-independent genes. METHODS: The complete set of human miRNAs was downloaded from miRBase Release 16. We explored target genes of individual miRNA by using the Diana-microT 3.0 target prediction program, and selected the genes with the miTG score >== 20 as the set of highly reliable targets. Then, Entrez Gene IDs of miRNA target genes were uploaded onto KeyMolnet, a tool for analyzing molecular interactions on the comprehensive knowledgebase by the neighboring network-search algorithm. The generated network, compared side by side with human canonical networks of the KeyMolnet library, composed of 430 pathways, 885 diseases, and 208 pathological events, enabled us to identify the canonical network with the most significant relevance to the extracted network. RESULTS: Among 1,223 human miRNAs examined, Diana-microT 3.0 predicted reliable targets from 273 miRNAs. Among them, KeyMolnet successfully extracted molecular networks from 232 miRNAs. The most relevant pathway is transcriptional regulation by transcription factors RB/E2F, the disease is adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia, and the pathological event is cancer. CONCLUSION: The predicted targets derived from approximately 20% of all human miRNAs constructed biologically meaningful molecular networks, supporting the view that a set of miRNA targets regulated by a single miRNA generally constitute the biological network of functionally-associated molecules in human cells.","['Satoh, Jun-Ichi', 'Tabunoki, Hiroko']","['Satoh J', 'Tabunoki H']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Molecular Neuropathology, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, 2-522-1 Noshio, Kiyose, Tokyo 204-8588, Japan. satoj@my-pharm.ac.jp.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BioData Min,BioData mining,101319161,,,,PMC3130707,,2011/06/21 06:00,2011/06/21 06:01,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2010/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2011/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/06/21 06:01 [medline]']","['1756-0381-4-17 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-0381-4-17 [doi]']",epublish,BioData Min. 2011 Jun 17;4:17. doi: 10.1186/1756-0381-4-17.,20110617,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is the principal cytokine linked to cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis (OA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the global effect of EGCG on IL-1beta-induced expression of proteins associated with OA pathogenesis in human chondrocytes. METHODS: Primary OA chondrocytes were pretreated with EGCG (10 to 100 uM) and then stimulated with IL-1beta (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours. Culture supernatants were incubated with cytokine antibody arrays and immunoreactive proteins (80 proteins) were visualized by enhanced chemiluminiscence. Effect of EGCG on IL-1beta-induced expression of 18 selected genes was verified by Real time-PCR and effect on IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production was determined using specific ELISAs. Western immunoblotting was used to analyze the effect of EGCG on the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF-6) proteins in IL-1beta-stimulated chondrocytes. The role of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the regulation of selected genes and the mechanism involved in EGCG mediated modulation of these genes was determined by using specific inhibitors for NF- kappaB (MG132) and MAPKs (p38-MAPK, SB202190; JNK-MAPK, SP600125, ERK-MAPK, PD98059). RESULTS: Out of 80 proteins present on the array, constitutive expression of 14% proteins was altered by EGCG treatment. No significant stimulatory effect was observed on the proteins associated with cartilage anabolic response. Stimulation with IL-1beta enhanced the expression of 29 proteins. Expression of all 29 proteins up-regulated by IL-1beta was found to be suppressed by EGCG. EGCG also inhibited the expression of the signaling intermediate TRAF-6 at 50 and 100 uM concentrations (P < 0.05). Our results identified several new targets of EGCG, including epithelial neutrophil activating peptide-78 (ENA-78), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulation factor (GM-CSF), growth- related oncogene (GRO), GRO-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), MCP-3, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta), granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2), MIP-3alpha, interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), nucleosome assembly protein-2 (NAP-2) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The inhibitory effects of EGCG were mainly mediated by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB and c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)-MAPK in human chondrocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the potential of EGCG in OA treatment/prevention may be related to its ability to globally suppress the inflammatory response in human chondrocytes. These results identify additional new targets of EGCG and advocate that EGCG may be a potent chondroprotective agent in OA.","['Akhtar, Nahid', 'Haqqi, Tariq M']","['Akhtar N', 'Haqqi TM']","['Department of Medicine/Rheumatology, MetroHealth Medical Centre, Case Western Reserve University, 2500 MetroHealth Drive, Cleveland, OH 44109, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 AT-003267/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AT-005520/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-AT504615/AT/NCCIH NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arthritis Res Ther,Arthritis research & therapy,101154438,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitrites)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects/immunology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/immunology/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitrites/metabolism', 'Osteoarthritis/*drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",PMC3218908,,2011/06/21 06:00,2012/03/14 06:00,['2011/06/21 06:00'],"['2011/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2011/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['ar3368 [pii]', '10.1186/ar3368 [doi]']",epublish,Arthritis Res Ther. 2011 Jun 17;13(3):R93. doi: 10.1186/ar3368.,20110617,,,['Arthritis Res Ther. 2011;13(4):121.

Amphotericin B was for more than 40 years the gold standard for almost all IFI, but toxicity and resistance, especially of new and emerging pathogens remained important issues. Fluconazole and itraconazole have also the same disadvantage of resistance. Voriconazole, a new triazole antifungal has offered an additional option, but the problem of resistant aspergillosis, and zygomycosis remains. Echinocandins (caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin) are active only against Candida and Aspergillus spp., but not against Fusarium, Scedosporium and Zygomycetes. Posaconazole is the most recently approved triazole with broad spectrum activity against Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Zygomycetes, dermatiaceous, dimorphic, and other fungal pathogens. Interestingly, posaconazole is active against Candida spp., resistant to fluconazole and itraconazole, and Aspergillus fumigatus resistant to fluconazole itraconazole, amphotericin B, and voriconazole. The results from clinical trials of posaconazole as salvage treatment are encouraging. Multicenter clinical trials have also established its role in the prophylaxis of (IFI) in the severely immunocompromised patients such as those after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) who developed graft versus host disease (GVHD), as well as the neutropenic patients with an acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after myeloablative chemotherapy.

Currently, no reliable biomarkers are available to predict the onset or progression of cGVHD. Therefore, in this study, we collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four patients with cGVHD and four ones with non-GVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and employed Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays to screen the genes differentially expressed in cGVHD versus non-GVHD groups, with the aim to identify potential clinical biomarkers to predict cGVHD risk or progression. Microarray analysis demonstrated that the expression of 3180 genes changed significantly in cGVHD versus non-GVHD, with 879 genes upregulated and 2301 genes downregulated. Among them we chose CD28 and PI3K as candidates for further verification. Flow cytometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the significant upregulation of CD28 and PI3K in samples from patients with cGVHD compared with patients with non-GVHD, respectively. In conclusion, our study suggested that the upregulation of CD28 and PI3K contributed to the onset and progression of cGVHD and provided evidence that CD28 and PI3K may serve as promising biomarkers for cGVHD.","['Lai, Peilong', 'Weng, Jianyu', 'Lu, Zesheng', 'Guo, Rong', 'Luo, Chenwei', 'Wu, Suijing', 'Ling, Wei', 'Geng, Suxia', 'Du, Xin']","['Lai P', 'Weng J', 'Lu Z', 'Guo R', 'Luo C', 'Wu S', 'Ling W', 'Geng S', 'Du X']","['Department of Haematology, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangzhou, P.R.

Whether this risk is specific to ALL subtypes is unknown, and low case numbers have prevented investigation of the rarer leukemias. Here we address these associations using a large population-based dataset. PROCEDURE: Using the National Registry of Childhood Tumors, birth weights of 7,826 leukemia cases, defined by immunophenotype and cytogenetic subgroup, were compared with those of 10,785 controls born in England and Wales between 1980 and 2007. RESULTS: The risk for overall leukemia increases 7% with each 0.5 kg increase in birth weight (OR 1.07, 95%CI 1.04-1.10). This risk is limited to the lymphoid leukemias (OR 1.08, 95%CI 1.05-1.12) diagnosed between 1 and 9 years of age. Analysis by cytogenetic feature reveals that there appears to be association with specific chromosomal abnormality: the risk of tumors with high hyperdiploid karyotypes increases 12% per 0.5 kg increase in birth weight (OR 1.12, 95%CI 1.05-1.20), and t(1;19) tumors show an increased risk of 41% per 0.5 kg increase (OR 1.41, 95%CI 1.09-1.84). The risk of acute myeloid leukemia is elevated in high and low birth weight babies. There is no significant risk relationship to other leukemias or myeloproliferative diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Birth weight is a risk factor for ALL and AML. Other subtypes of the disease are not significantly affected. There appears to be association with specific chromosomal abnormality, which may aid our understanding of the development of childhood leukemia in utero.","[""O'Neill, Kate A"", 'Bunch, Kathryn J', 'Vincent, Tim J', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Murphy, Michael F G']","[""O'Neill KA"", 'Bunch KJ', 'Vincent TJ', 'Spector LG', 'Moorman AV', 'Murphy MF']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. kate.oneill@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Birth Weight', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*etiology/metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology/metabolism', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2012/01/13 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2011/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23209 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2012 Jan;58(1):7-11. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23209.

The aim of this study was to present the epidemiology of childhood leukemia in the Dr. Sardjito Hospital (DSH) region, which catchment area extends beyond the boundaries of the Yogyakarta Special Province (YSP). PROCEDURE: Health records of children, 0-14 years of age, who were diagnosed with leukemia between January 1998 and December 2009, were reviewed. Diagnosis of leukemia was confirmed by morphological and histochemical examination of marrow samples. RESULTS: The estimated average annual incidence rate (AAIR) of childhood acute leukemia in DSH was 46.2 per million per year. Interestingly, the annual incidence rate (AIR) of childhood acute leukemia from the catchment area of DSH significantly increased from 35 in 1999 to 70 in 2009 (ANOVA, P = 0.003). The YSP population data, analyzed separately, showed an increase in AIR from 15.7 to 32.9 (ANOVA, P = 0.325) and an AAIR of 28.8. Remarkably, a relatively high frequency (25.5% in DSH and 27.7% in YSP) of children with AML was found in the group of acute leukemias. CONCLUSION: The DSH incidence calculations may be overestimated due to an underestimation of the population number. Since the population count for YSP is more precise, the data of YSP were used for comparison with developed countries. AAIR of ALL (20.8) is relatively low compared to Western countries (22.4-37.9). The AAIR of AML (8.0) is similar to Western countries (5.0-8.0) resulting a relatively high percentage of AML versus ALL (27.7%) in YSP.","['Supriyadi, Eddy', 'Widjajanto, Pudjo H', 'Purwanto, Ignatius', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Sutaryo, Sutaryo']","['Supriyadi E', 'Widjajanto PH', 'Purwanto I', 'Cloos J', 'Veerman AJ', 'Sutaryo S']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Pediatrics, Dr. Sardjito Hospital, Medical Faculty, Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. e.supriyadi@yahoo.co.id']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/14 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.23109 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Oct;57(4):588-93. doi: 10.1002/pbc.23109.

PROCEDURES: We randomized 289 children with AML in first remission after intensive chemotherapy to receive IL-2 infused on days 0-3 and 8-17 (IL-2 group) or no further therapy (AML control group). We measured sequential serum sIL-2ralpha concentrations in both groups before, during and after therapy in both groups and in reference controls without AML. RESULTS: Before treatment, mean sIL-2ralpha concentrations were similar in the IL-2 group and AML controls, but significantly higher than in reference controls. Both AML groups experienced reduction in sIL-2ralpha concentration after chemotherapy. Thereafter in the IL-2 group, mean sIL-2ralpha concentration increased from 2,669 pg/ml before IL-2 to 15,534 pg/ml on day 4 (P < 0.001) and 10,585 pg/ml on day 18 (P < 0.001). In the control group sIL-2ralpha concentration did not change after 28 days of follow-up. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 51% in the IL-2 group and 58% in the controls (P = 0.489) and overall survival was 70% and 73%, respectively (P = 0.727). CONCLUSION: SIL-2ralpha concentration was elevated in AML at diagnosis and tended to normalize after chemotherapy. IL-2 infusion significantly increased sIL-2ralpha concentration, but did not improve DFS or survival in pediatric AML. Furthermore, sIL-2ralpha concentration was not predictive of outcome before, during or after treatment for AML.","['Lange, Beverly J', 'Yang, Richard K', 'Gan, Jacek', 'Hank, Jaquelyn A', 'Sievers, Eric L', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Sondel, Paul M']","['Lange BJ', 'Yang RK', 'Gan J', 'Hank JA', 'Sievers EL', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gerbing RB', 'Sondel PM']","[""The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA. lange@email.chop.edu""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA032685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087025-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA032685-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008692/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 087025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098413-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA013539-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 RR025011-05/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 032685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (IL2RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*blood/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Solubility', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC3172052,['NIHMS253436'],2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/15 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2010/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.22966 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2011 Sep;57(3):398-405. doi: 10.1002/pbc.22966.

We found that feeder cells provide a relatively low concentration (25 unit/ml) of LIF, which is insufficient to maintain the ESCs/iPSCs pluripotency in feeder free conditions. To identify additional factors involved in the maintenance of pluripotency, we carried out a global transcript expression profiling of mouse iPSCs cultured on feeder cells and in feeder-free (LIF-treated) conditions. This identified 17 significantly differentially expressed genes (adjusted p value <0.05) including seven chemokines overexpressed in iPSCs grown on feeder cells. Ectopic expression of these chemokines in iPSCs revealed that CC chemokine ligand 2 (Ccl2) induced the key transcription factor genes for pluripotency, Klf4, Nanog, Sox2, and Tbx3. Furthermore, addition of recombinant Ccl2 protein drastically increased the number of Nanog-green fluorescent protein-positive iPSCs grown in low-LIF feeder free conditions. We further revealed that pluripotency promotion by Ccl2 is mediated by activating the Stat3-pathway followed by Klf4 upregulation. We demonstrated that Ccl2-mediated increased pluripotency is independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and that Tbx3 may be upregulated by Klf4. Overall, Ccl2 cooperatively activates the Stat3-pathway with LIF in feeder-free conditions to maintain pluripotency for ESCs/iPSCs.","['Hasegawa, Yuki', 'Takahashi, Naoko', 'Forrest, Alistair R R', 'Shin, Jay W', 'Kinoshita, Yohei', 'Suzuki, Harukazu', 'Hayashizaki, Yoshihide']","['Hasegawa Y', 'Takahashi N', 'Forrest AR', 'Shin JW', 'Kinoshita Y', 'Suzuki H', 'Hayashizaki Y']","['RIKEN Omics Science Center, RIKEN Yokohama Institute, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Ccl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sox2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (Tbx3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Markers', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2011/11/16 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.673 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2011 Aug;29(8):1196-205. doi: 10.1002/stem.673.,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2011 AlphaMed Press.'],,,,,,,,,

Unlike previous reports using human ESCs, postmeiotic cells arose without the over-expression of germline related transcription factors. Moreover, we consistently obtained haploid cells from hiPSCs of different origin (keratinocytes and cord blood), produced with a different number of transcription factors, and of both genetic sexes, suggesting the independence of our approach from the epigenetic memory of the reprogrammed somatic cells.

NF1 and PTPN11 are molecular lesions associated with Neurofibromatosis Syndrome Type I (NF1 Syndrome) and Noonan's Syndrome, respectively. The occurrence of JMML is rare; even among those predisposed with these syndromes to development of disease, and secondary genetic events likely contribute to the development and progression of disease. In NF1 syndrome, loss of p53 function is a common event in solid tumors, but uncommon in JMML, suggesting that the p53 pathway may be modified by other events in this hematopoietic disorder. The work presented here investigates the possible role of the p19(Arf) (p19) tumor suppressor in development of MPD associated with Nf1 gene loss in mice. We find that Nf1 mutant hematopoietic cells with loss of p19 develop accelerated hematopoietic disease similar to acute leukemia with a variable phenotype. This suggests that p19 may play a role in development of JMML and evaluation of the human p19 homolog (p14(ARF)) in JMML may be informative.","['Wiesner, Stephen M', 'Geurts, Jennifer L', 'Diers, Miechaleen D', 'Bergerson, Rachel J', 'Hasz, Diane E', 'Morgan, Kelly J', 'Largaespada, David A']","['Wiesner SM', 'Geurts JL', 'Diers MD', 'Bergerson RJ', 'Hasz DE', 'Morgan KJ', 'Largaespada DA']","['Center for Allied Health Programs, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['R29 CA078269/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA084221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurofibromin 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",PMC3506005,['NIHMS421436'],2011/06/18 06:00,2011/08/23 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/08/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.22035 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2011 Jul;86(7):579-85. doi: 10.1002/ajh.22035.,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,

FND-R, a combination regimen of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, and rituximab, has been shown to be an effective regimen for low-grade lymphomas. METHODS: This dose-escalation study, with an expansion cohort, was conducted to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of FPD-R, in which pixantrone was substituted for mitoxantrone in the FND-R regimen, in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Escalated doses of pixantrone were administered to newly enrolled patients on day 2 of each 28-day cycle of FPD-R. RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 29 enrolled patients received at least 1 cycle of FPD-R (median, 5 cycles). Pixantrone 120 mg/m(2) was identified as the recommended dose in this regimen. Grade 3-4 adverse events were primarily hematologic; grade 3-4 lymphopenia occurred in 89% of patients and leukopenia in 79%. No patients developed congestive heart failure or grade 3-4 cardiac adverse events. Left ventricular ejection fraction decreases occurred in 8 (29%) patients, and most were grade 1 or 2, transient, and asymptomatic. The overall response rate was 89%. Estimated survival was 96% after 1 year and 92% after 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: The FPD-R regimen was well-tolerated and highly active in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL.","['Srokowski, Tomasz P', 'Liebmann, James E', 'Modiano, Manuel R', 'Cohen, Gary I', 'Pro, Barbara', 'Romaguera, Jorge E', 'Kuepfer, Christine', 'Singer, Jack W', 'Fayad, Luis E']","['Srokowski TP', 'Liebmann JE', 'Modiano MR', 'Cohen GI', 'Pro B', 'Romaguera JE', 'Kuepfer C', 'Singer JW', 'Fayad LE']","['Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'F5SXN2KNMR (pixantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*administration & dosage', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2012/01/10 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2011/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2011/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.26121 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2011 Nov 15;117(22):5067-73. doi: 10.1002/cncr.26121.

In past decades, intensive studies on the biology and treatment of this disease have resulted in a remarkably thorough understanding of its pathogenesis and improvement of treatment outcomes. In particular, the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid to conventional chemotherapy improved dramatically the remission and survival rates of APL patients and consequently became the major treatment modality for it. In the last decade, the groundbreaking development of arsenic further improved the survival rate of APL patients. As the most active agent in APL, arsenic directly degrades the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript, leading to the differentiation and apoptosis of leukemia cells and the potential eradication of APL leukemiainitiating cells (LICs), thus making the disease a potentially curable type of leukemia. More notably, the recent development of oral arsenic compounds may further enhance not only clinical outcomes but also the convenience of patients, which may dramatically change the APL clinical scenario in the near future.","['Hu, Jiong']",['Hu J'],"['Department of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. hujiong@medmail.com.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Front Med,Frontiers of medicine,101549428,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2011/11/01 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2011/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/11/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11684-011-0117-y [doi]'],ppublish,Front Med. 2011 Mar;5(1):45-52. doi: 10.1007/s11684-011-0117-y.

METHODS: Children >/= 12 years of age receiving intensive chemotherapy for leukemia/lymphoma or undergoing stem cell transplantation were asked to complete the OMDQ daily for 21 days after chemotherapy. Other measures of mucositis obtained concurrently with OMDQ included the World Health Organization (WHO) mucositis scale, the pain visual analog scale (VAS), and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Esophageal Cancer Sub-scale (FACT-ECS). The importance of mucositis was estimated using a VAS, time trade-off technique, and willingness to pay to avoid mucositis. RESULTS: Fifteen children participated. Test-retest reliability demonstrated at least moderate correlation for all questions within the OMDQ. Assessment of construct validity of the OMDQ revealed at least moderate correlation with WHO, VAS, and FACT-ECS for questions regarding pain, swallowing, drinking, and eating. Effect on sleeping and talking had lower correlations than that expected a priori. The diarrhea question of the OMDQ did not correlate with other measures of mucositis. Severe mucositis is important to children, while mild mucositis is less important to them. Children were willing to pay moderate amounts of money to prevent mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: The OMDQ exhibits test-retest reliability, and most questions show construct validity with the exceptions of the sleep, talking, and diarrhea questions. Therefore, the OMDQ should not be used unmodified as a self-report instrument in children with cancer. Severe mucositis is of importance to these children.","['Manji, Arif', 'Tomlinson, Deborah', 'Ethier, Marie-Chantal', 'Gassas, Adam', 'Maloney, Anne-Marie', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Manji A', 'Tomlinson D', 'Ethier MC', 'Gassas A', 'Maloney AM', 'Sung L']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['86648/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Pain Measurement', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Psychometrics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Stomatitis/diagnosis/etiology/*pathology', '*Surveys and Questionnaires']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2012/09/18 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2010/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2011/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00520-011-1211-z [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2012 Jun;20(6):1251-8. doi: 10.1007/s00520-011-1211-z.

Thus far, data are limited on the technical performance in a clinical diagnostic setting. Here, we investigated as an international consortium the robustness, precision and reproducibility of amplicon next-generation deep sequencing across 10 laboratories in eight countries. In a cohort of 18 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients, mutational analyses were performed on TET2, a frequently mutated gene in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Additionally, hotspot regions of CBL and KRAS were investigated. The study was executed using GS FLX sequencing instruments and the small volume 454 Life Sciences Titanium emulsion PCR setup. We report a high concordance in mutation detection across all laboratories, including a robust detection of novel variants, which were undetected by standard Sanger sequencing. The sensitivity to detect low-level variants present with as low as 1-2% frequency, compared with the 20% threshold for Sanger-based sequencing is increased. Together with the output of high-quality long reads and fast run time, we demonstrate the utility of deep sequencing in clinical applications. In conclusion, this multicenter analysis demonstrated that amplicon-based deep sequencing is technically feasible, achieves high concordance across multiple laboratories and allows a broad and in-depth molecular characterization of cancer specimens with high diagnostic sensitivity.","['Kohlmann, A', 'Klein, H-U', 'Weissmann, S', 'Bresolin, S', 'Chaplin, T', 'Cuppens, H', 'Haschke-Becher, E', 'Garicochea, B', 'Grossmann, V', 'Hanczaruk, B', 'Hebestreit, K', 'Gabriel, C', 'Iacobucci, I', 'Jansen, J H', 'te Kronnie, G', 'van de Locht, L', 'Martinelli, G', 'McGowan, K', 'Schweiger, M R', 'Timmermann, B', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Young, B D', 'Dugas, M', 'Haferlach, T']","['Kohlmann A', 'Klein HU', 'Weissmann S', 'Bresolin S', 'Chaplin T', 'Cuppens H', 'Haschke-Becher E', 'Garicochea B', 'Grossmann V', 'Hanczaruk B', 'Hebestreit K', 'Gabriel C', 'Iacobucci I', 'Jansen JH', 'te Kronnie G', 'van de Locht L', 'Martinelli G', 'McGowan K', 'Schweiger MR', 'Timmermann B', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Young BD', 'Dugas M', 'Haferlach T']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany. alexander.kohlmann@mll.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KRAS protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Female', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2012/02/01 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/01 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011155 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.155 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Dec;25(12):1840-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.155.

The protocols included two direct lysis methods with and without detergents and proteinase K, and two commercial column-based kits. The direct lysis method using detergents and proteinase K showed the highest DNA recovery and the best performance in the multiplex PowerPlex16 STR assay. DNA isolated with this method also showed the highest sensitivity in chimerism analysis using singleplex PCR reactions of EuroChimerism STR markers. Sensitivity was reached ranging from 1 to 20% of recipient cells in a donor background.

Although splicing of the CALM-AF10 fusion transcripts has been described in AML patients, the contribution of different CALM and AF10 domains to in vivo leukemogenesis remains to be defined. We therefore performed detailed structure-function studies of the CALM-AF10 fusion protein. We demonstrate that fusion of the C-terminal 248 amino acids of CALM, which include the clathrin-binding domain, to the octapeptide motif-leucine-zipper (OM-LZ) domain of AF10 generated a fusion protein (termed CALM-AF10 minimal fusion (MF)), with strikingly enhanced transformation capabilities in colony assays, providing an efficient system for the expeditious assessment of CALM-AF10-mediated transformation. Leukemias induced by the CALM-AF10 (MF) mutant recapitulated multiple aspects of full-length CALM-AF10-induced leukemia, including aberrant Hoxa cluster upregulation, a characteristic molecular lesion of CALM-AF10 leukemias. In summary, this study indicates that collaboration of the clathrin-binding and the OM-LZ domains of CALM-AF10 is sufficient to induce AML. These findings further suggest that future approaches to antagonize CALM-AF10-induced transformation should incorporate strategies, which aim at blocking these key domains.","['Deshpande, A J', 'Rouhi, A', 'Lin, Y', 'Stadler, C', 'Greif, P A', 'Arseni, N', 'Opatz, S', 'Quintanilla-Fend, L', 'Holzmann, K', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Dohner, K', 'Dohner, H', 'Xu, G', 'Armstrong, S A', 'Bohlander, S K', 'Buske, C']","['Deshpande AJ', 'Rouhi A', 'Lin Y', 'Stadler C', 'Greif PA', 'Arseni N', 'Opatz S', 'Quintanilla-Fend L', 'Holzmann K', 'Hiddemann W', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Xu G', 'Armstrong SA', 'Bohlander SK', 'Buske C']","['Department of Medicine III, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Clathrin)', '0 (Mllt10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins)', '0 (PICALM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clathrin/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Monomeric Clathrin Assembly Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2011/12/23 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2011153 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2011.153 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2011 Nov;25(11):1718-27. doi: 10.1038/leu.2011.153.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the development of psychological problems in children with cancer during the initial 6-month period of intensive treatment. METHODS: This prospective, comparative study was conducted at one of the largest Greek pediatric oncology units in Athens. The sample comprised 132 children with cancer treated during a 30-month period and 100 children with no cancer as control group. Data were collected using the Rutter instruments for parents and teachers. For patients, it was completed by their parents at 1 (T1), 3 (T2), and 6 months (T3) from diagnosis and by teachers at T3. In the control group, the questionnaire was completed by teachers and parents once. RESULTS: The comparison of total Rutter scores for patients at T1, T2, and T3, according to parents' responses, showed statistically significant difference (P < .001). The difference in scores for patients (at T3) and control subjects was also significant according to both parents' (P < .00001) and teachers' (P < .001) responses. Children with leukemia had higher score reduction during treatment (P = .009) compared with the rest. Only age had a marginal impact on score of patients at T1 (R = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Based on parental reports, children treated for cancer develop psychological problems during the period of intensive treatment. The development and evolution of these problems depend on their age and type of cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This information can be used for relevant interventions in specific groups.","['Gerali, Maria', 'Servitzoglou, Marina', 'Paikopoulou, Dimitra', 'Theodosopoulou, Helen', 'Madianos, Michael', 'Vasilatou-Kosmidis, Helen']","['Gerali M', 'Servitzoglou M', 'Paikopoulou D', 'Theodosopoulou H', 'Madianos M', 'Vasilatou-Kosmidis H']","['Nursing Education Office, Faculty of Nursing, University of Athens, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mental Disorders/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",,,2011/06/18 06:00,2011/10/22 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2011/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181fa5698 [doi]', '00002820-201107000-00003 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2011 Jul-Aug;34(4):269-76. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0b013e3181fa5698.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our primary aims were to identify common comorbidities and concomitant pancreatitis etiologies in children with drug-associated pancreatitis. Our secondary aims were to identify the most commonly associated drugs in the different age groups, evaluate management practices, and compare drug-associated cases with non-drug-associated cases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the present study, we examined children (ages 0-20 years) admitted to Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital with pancreatitis between 1994 and 2007. RESULTS: Of a total of 271 pediatric cases, drugs were associated with pancreatitis in 25.6% (55). The 3 most common comorbidities in children with drug-associated pancreatitis were seizure disorders, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and Crohn disease. One third of drug-associated cases had an additional pancreatitis etiology. The most commonly associated drugs were valproic acid and corticosteroids. Compared with non-drug-associated cases, children with drug-associated cases were more likely to undergo CT scanning (54.5% vs 28.4%; P < 0.001), stay in the hospital longer (10 vs 4 days; P < 0.001), and transition to parenteral nutrition from a nil per os status (37.5% vs 21.2%; P < 0.05). There was a higher frequency of valproic acid-associated cases in children younger than 11 years (29.4% vs 9.5% in the 11- to 20-year-old age group). CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the importance of considering drugs as a cause and a contributor to pancreatitis in children, particularly valproic acid in young children.","['Bai, Harrison X', 'Ma, Michael H', 'Orabi, Abrahim I', 'Park, Alexander', 'Latif, Sahibzada U', 'Bhandari, Vineet', 'Husain, Sohail Z']","['Bai HX', 'Ma MH', 'Orabi AI', 'Park A', 'Latif SU', 'Bhandari V', 'Husain SZ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK083327/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK083327-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK093491/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK093491-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,8211545,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Crohn Disease/*epidemiology', 'Epilepsy/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Pancreatitis/*chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Parenteral Nutrition', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3626448,['NIHMS366334'],2011/06/18 06:00,2012/02/03 06:00,['2011/06/18 06:00'],"['2011/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2011/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2012/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPG.0b013e318228574e [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2011 Oct;53(4):423-8. doi: 10.1097/MPG.0b013e318228574e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
