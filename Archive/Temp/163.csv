Depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane has been supposed to initiate neutrophil spontaneous apoptosis, as neutrophils gradually lose the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and Bax translocates and inserts into the mitochondrial membrane. However, other reports show that caspase 8 is required for neutrophil apoptosis, suggesting the involvement of DR (death receptor) signalling. As DR ligation is not required for neutrophil apoptosis, this raises the intriguing possibility that activation of caspase 8 during neutrophil apoptosis occurs via a novel mechanism. In the present paper, we discuss the current evidence for mechanisms occurring in neutrophil apoptosis, which could trigger DR signalling in the absence of DR ligation.",['Copyright 2004 Biochemical Society'],"['Scheel-Toellner, D', 'Wang, K-Q', 'Webb, P R', 'Wong, S H', 'Craddock, R', 'Assi, L K', 'Salmon, M', 'Lord, J M']","['Scheel-Toellner D', 'Wang KQ', 'Webb PR', 'Wong SH', 'Craddock R', 'Assi LK', 'Salmon M', 'Lord JM']","['MRC Centre for Immune Regulation, University of Birmingham Medical School, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry', 'Mitochondria/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",34,2004/05/26 05:00,2005/01/13 09:00,['2004/05/26 05:00'],"['2004/05/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BST0320461 [doi]', 'BST0320461 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2004 Jun;32(Pt3):461-4. doi: 10.1042/BST0320461.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show here that in avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV)-transformed chicken erythroleukaemic cells, where globin gene expression is abortive, the whole domain of alpha-globin genes is transcribed for about 33 kb in the globin direction and that this RNA is part of the nuclear matrix. Northern blot hybridisation with strand-specific riboprobes, recognising genes and intergenic sequences, and RT-PCR with downstream primers, show that the continuous full domain transcript (FDT) starts in the vicinity of a putative LCR and includes all the genes as well as known regulatory sites, the replication origin, and the DNA loop anchorage region in the upstream area. Absent in chicken fibroblasts, the globin FDT overlaps the major part of the ggPRX housekeeping gene that is transcribed in the opposite direction. RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation with genic and extra-genic globin probes demonstrated that the globin FDT is a component of the nuclear matrix. We suggest that the globin FDTs keep the domain in an active state, and the globin RNAs on the processing pathway are a component of the nuclear matrix.

Responding patients received two consolidation courses of idarubicin, AraC, and etoposide, followed by a late consolidation course of intermediate-dose AraC (600 mg/m2 IV every 12 h x 5 days) and amsacrine (60 mg/m2 IV x 5 days). A total of 112 patients (57 male/55 female) with a median age of 58 years (range: 22-75) have been entered and are evaluable for response: 19 refractory anemia with excess of blast cells in transformation (RAEB-T), 84 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 9 secondary AML after chemotherapy/radiotherapy.

We have now investigated the mechanism through which Tax-2B represses p53 using GFPTax-2B fusion proteins. We present evidence that Tax-2B inhibition of p53 function is not linked to CREB/ATF activation, but is uniquely correlated with the interaction of CREB binding protein (CBP), but not p300, with the C-terminus of Tax-2B. Wild type, but not a Tax-2B-M47 mutant, inhibits p53 function in adherent cells. We demonstrate that both Tax-2B and Tax-2B-M47 can bind p300, while Tax-2B-M47 is impaired for CBP binding. Importantly, transfection of increasing amounts of CBP but not p300 or p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) could rescue p53 transcriptional activity in the presence of Tax-2B in nonlymphocytic cells. In lymphoid cells, Tax-2B mediated inhibition of p53 is correlated with the NF-kappaB pathway activation and could be prevented by the overexpression of an IkappaBalpha mutant. Given the similarities between the functional domains of CBP and p300, these results are intriguing and suggest that Tax-2B must bind the CR2 domain of CBP, but not that of p300 in order to repress p53.",,"['Meertens, Laurent', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia', 'Quere, Nelly', 'Brady, John', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Mahieux, Renaud']","['Meertens L', 'Pise-Masison C', 'Quere N', 'Brady J', 'Gessain A', 'Mahieux R']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Docteur Roux, 75724 Paris cedex 15, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2004/05/25 05:00,2004/08/24 05:00,['2004/05/25 05:00'],"['2004/05/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207719 [doi]', '1207719 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Jul 15;23(32):5447-58. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207719.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxically, evidence is mounting that structurally intact Runx genes are also oncogenic when overexpressed. All the three murine genes act as targets for transcriptional activation by retroviral insertional mutagenesis, and the oncogenic potential of Runx2 has been confirmed in transgenic mice. Moreover, the RUNX1 gene is often amplified or overexpressed in cases of acute leukemia.

In addition, recent studies have demonstrated point mutations in the RUNX1 gene as another mode of genetic alteration in development of leukemia. Monoallelic germline mutations in RUNX1 result in familial platelet disorder predisposed to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML). Sporadic point mutations are frequently found in three leukemia entities: AML M0 subtype, MDS-AML, and secondary (therapy-related) MDS/AML. Therapy-related leukemias resulting from anticancer treatments are not uncommon, and the incidence of RUNX1 point mutations appears comparable to the incidence of the t(8;21) AML M2 subtype and the inv(16) AML M4Eo subtype. Half of the point mutations in M0 cases are biallelic, although the frequency varies with ethnicity. Most of the RUNX1 mutations are clustered in the Runt domain and result in defective DNA binding but active beta-subunit binding, which is consistent with three-dimensional structural findings and may explain the dominant inhibitory effects.

In AML1/EVI-1, an N-terminal half of AML1 including a runt homology domain is fused to the entire zinc-finger EVI-1 protein. AML1 is essential for hematopoietic cell development in fetal liver and its lineage-specific differentiation in adult. In contrast, EVI-1 is barely expressed in normal hematopoietic cells, but it is overexpressed in chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis and myelodysplastic syndrome-derived leukemia. There are at least four mechanisms identified in AML1/EVI-1 fusion protein that possibly lead into malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells. Firstly, AML1/EVI-1 exerts dominant-negative effects over AML1-induced transcriptional activation. Although target genes repressed by AML1/EVI-1 are still not known, binding competition to a specific DNA sequence and histone deacetylase recruitment through a co-repressor CtBP in EVI-1 part are conceivable underlying mechanisms for the dominant-negative effects. Secondly, AML1/EVI-1 interferes with TGF beta signaling and antagonizes the growth-inhibitory effects of TGF beta. The first zinc-finger domain of EVI-1 associates with Smad3, a TGF beta signal transducer, and represses its transcriptional activity by recruiting histone deacetylase through CtBP that interacts with EVI-1. Thirdly, AML1/EVI-1 blocks JNK activity and prevents stress-induced apoptosis. AML1/EVI-1 associates with JNK through the first zinc-finger domain of EVI-1 and disturbs the association between JNK and its substrates. Lastly, AML1/EVI-1 enhances AP-1 activity by activating the c-Fos promoter depending on the second zinc-finger domain of EVI-1, and promotes cell proliferation.

Detection of MC is a prerequisite in both myeloablative and nonmyeloablative HSCT, in order to assess the graft status and decide later therapeutic strategies such as donor lymphocyte infusion. In this review, we discuss various techniques including erythrocyte phenotyping, cytogenetic analysis, fluorescent in situ hybridization, restriction fragment length polymorphism, STR/VNTR analysis and real-time quantitative PCR, along with the various methods used to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in different diseases such as chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myelomonocytic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Legionella pneumophila (predominantly serogroup 1) is detected in most cases of legionellosis; other species only occasionally cause infections, predominantly in immunocompromized patients. Aquiferous technical systems are the primary source of infection (air-conditioning systems, refrigerators, showers, whirlpools, springs, taps, moisturizing equipment, medical nebulizers, and swimming pools). Legionellae are present in the water in these systems, within the amoebae, flagellates, and ciliates in which they replicate. After inhalation of contaminated aerosols, the bacteria multiply intracellularly within alveolar macrophages. The ability to multiply within monocytic host cells is usually considered to correspond to pathogenicity. The mechanisms of intracellular replication have been only partially characterized. Analysis of the molecular pathogenesis of Legionella infection, both in the pathogen itself and in the host cell, is the subject of current research and may lead to new options in prophylaxis and treatment. We have established the human Mono Mac 6 cell line (MM6) instead of the previously used histiocytic lymphoma cell line U 937 or the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 to investigate the intracellular replication of legionellae and the molecular pathogenesis of Legionella infection within human monocytic host cells. MM6 cells represent a more mature macrophage-like cell line that expresses phenotypic and functional properties of mature monocytes and that does not need to be stimulated by phorbol esters or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. A good correlation between the prevalence of a given Legionella species and its intracellular multiplication in MM6 cells could be demonstrated.In addition to Legionella, MM6 cells were found to support the intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Chlamydia pneumoniae, two other important bacterial agents involved in induction of pneumonia. Therefore, the MM6 model might be adaptable to investigations of the molecular pathogenesis of other intracellular bacteria that can replicate within human monocytes and induce disease.",,"['Neumeister, Birgid']",['Neumeister B'],"['Department of Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,IM,"['Acanthamoeba/cytology/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Legionella/cytology/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Monocytes/*microbiology', 'Virulence']",,2004/05/25 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/05/25 05:00'],"['2004/05/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['1-59259-766-1:141 [pii]', '10.1385/1-59259-766-1:141 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2004;268:141-51. doi: 10.1385/1-59259-766-1:141.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence suggests that the translocation usually occurs in utero during fetal hemopoiesis and most probably constitutes an initiating or first-hit mutation that is necessary but insufficient for the development of overt, clinical leukemia. The mechanism by which TEL-AML1 contributes to this early stage of leukemogenesis is unknown. To address this question we have analyzed hemopoiesis in mice syngeneically transplanted with TEL-AML1-transduced bone marrow stem cells. TEL-AML1 expression was associated with an accumulation/expansion of primitive c-kit-positive multipotent progenitors and a modest increase in myeloid colony-forming cells. TEL-AML1 expression was, however, permissive for myeloid differentiation. Analysis of B lymphopoiesis revealed an increase in early, pro-B cells but a differentiation deficit beyond that stage, resulting in reduced B cell production in the marrow. TEL-AML1-positive B cell progenitors exhibited reduced expression of the surrogate light-chain component lambda5 and the IL-7 receptor, both of which may contribute to impedance of differentiation in vivo and account for their reduced in vitro clonogenicity in IL-7. A selective differentiation deficit of B lineage progenitors (i) is consistent with the phenotype of TEL-AML1-associated leukemia in children and (ii) provides a potential mechanism for the protracted preleukemic state that often precedes ALL. These results provide mechanistic insight into the role of the t(12;21) translocation in the initiation of common B cell precursor ALL.",,"['Tsuzuki, Shinobu', 'Seto, Masao', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Enver, Tariq']","['Tsuzuki S', 'Seto M', 'Greaves M', 'Enver T']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2004/05/25 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/05/25 05:00'],"['2004/05/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0402063101 [doi]', '0402063101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Jun 1;101(22):8443-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0402063101.

Tax binds the three viral cAMP-response elements (CREs) with ATF/CREB (activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein) and recruits the cellular coactivators CBP/p300. HTLV-1 also utilizes other cellular transcription factors that bind to the promoter to regulate transcription. One of these factors, Sp1, has been shown to bind to the viral promoter at two elements; one located within the third viral CRE, and the second located between the second and third viral CREs. The functional significance of Sp1 binding at each of these regions of the viral promoter is not completely understood. We set out to characterize Sp1 binding and to evaluate the functional significance of Sp1, both in the absence and presence of Tax. We found that Sp1 binds preferentially to the element located between the second and third viral CREs, and modestly activates transcription in vitro and in vivo.

In support of prior studies, we found that short-term (5-30 min) application of the adenosine receptor (AR) agonist 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) induces an increase in 5-HT uptake Vmax in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells that is enhanced by pretreatment with the cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil. NECA stimulation is blocked by the A3 AR antagonist 3-ethyl-5-benzyl-2-methyl-phenylethynyl-6-phenyl-1,4(+/-)dihydropyridine-3,5-dica rboxylate (MRS1191), by the phospholipase C inhibitor 1-(6-[[17beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl] amino]hexyl)-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione (U73122), by the intracellular Ca2+ chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, and by the guanyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one. Hydroxylamine, a nitric-oxide donor, and 8-bromo-cGMP, a membrane-permeant analog of cGMP, mimic the effects of NECA on 5-HT uptake, whereas the protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor N-[2-(methylamino)ethy]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide (H8) blocks NECA, hydroxylamine, and 8-bromo-cGMP effects. NECA stimulation activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whereas p38 MAPK inhibitors block NECA stimulation of SERT activity, as does the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor calyculin A. 5-HT-displaceable [125I]3beta-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane-2beta-carboxylic acid methylester tartrate (RTI-55) whole-cell binding is increased by NECA or sildenafil, and both surface binding and cell surface SERT protein are elevated after NECA or sildenafil stimulation of AR/SERT-cotransfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Whereas p38 MAPK inhibition blocks NECA stimulation of 5-HT activity, it fails to blunt stimulation of SERT surface density. Moreover, inactivation of existing surface SERTs fails to eliminate NECA stimulation of SERT. Together, these results reveal two PKG-dependent pathways supporting rapid SERT regulation by A3 ARs, one leading to enhanced SERT surface trafficking, and a separate, p38 MAPK-dependent process augmenting SERT intrinsic activity.",,"['Zhu, Chong-Bin', 'Hewlett, William A', 'Feoktistov, Igor', 'Biaggioni, Italo', 'Blakely, Randy D']","['Zhu CB', 'Hewlett WA', 'Feoktistov I', 'Biaggioni I', 'Blakely RD']","['Department of Psychiatry, Vanderbilt School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-8548, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Slc6a4 protein, rat)', '0 (Sulfones)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", 'BW9B0ZE037 (Sildenafil Citrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.12 (Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Guanylate Cyclase)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"[""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)/pharmacology"", 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Female', 'Guanylate Cyclase/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Purines', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/*physiology', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Sildenafil Citrate', 'Sulfones', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2004/05/25 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/25 05:00'],"['2004/05/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1124/mol.65.6.1462 [doi]', '65/6/1462 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2004 Jun;65(6):1462-74. doi: 10.1124/mol.65.6.1462.,,,['DA07390/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies reveal that several Galpha subunits are capable of activating signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which Galpha14 mediates receptor-induced stimulation of STAT3. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, coexpression of Galpha14 with delta-opioid receptor supported [D-Pen2, D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE)-induced STAT3 phosphorylations at both Tyr705 and Ser727 in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. The constitutively active Galpha4QL mutant also induced STAT3 phosphorylations at these sites and promoted STAT3-dependent luciferase activity. Requirements for PLCbeta, protein kinase C (PKC), and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) in Galpha14QL-induced STAT3 activation were demonstrated by their respective inhibitors as well as by coexpression of their dominant-negative mutants. Inhibition of c-Src and Janus kinase 2 and 3 activities abolished STAT3 activation induced by Galpha14QL, but no physical association between Galpha14QL and c-Src could be detected by coimmunoprecipitation. Various intermediates along the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling cascade were apparently required for Galpha14QL-induced STAT3 activation; they included Ras/Rac1, Raf-1, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1/2. In contrast, functional blockade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase had no effect on Galpha14QL-induced responses. PLCbeta, PKC, and CaMKII were shown to be involved in Galpha14QL-mediated c-Src phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained with human erythro-leukemia cells upon DPDPE treatment.

We found that chemokine receptor (CCR)7, CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)4, or CXCR5, the main chemokine receptors that mediate B cell entry into secondary lymphoid tissues and their homing to T cell and B cell zones therein, were highly expressed in B malignancies with widespread involvement of lymph nodes. Conversely, those pathologies with little or no nodular dissemination showed no expression to very low levels of CCR7 and CXCR5 and low to moderate levels of CXCR4. These findings provide evidence for the role of CCR7, CXCR4, and CXCR5 in determining the pattern of lymphoid organ involvement of B tumors. Functional studies were performed on B malignancies expressing different levels of CCR7, CXCR5, and CXCR4. Multiple myeloma (MM) cells did not express CCR7 nor CXCR5 and did not migrate in response to their ligands; a moderate expression of CXCR4 on MM cells was accompanied by a migratory response to its ligand, CXCL12. By contrast, cells from B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) expressed the highest levels of these chemokine receptors and efficiently migrated in response to all ligands of CCR7, CXCR4, and CXCR5. In addition, the migration index of B-CLL cells in response to both of the CCR7 ligands correlated with the presence of clinical lymphadenopathy, thus indicating that the high expression of functional chemokine receptors justifies the widespread character of B-CLL, representing a clinical target for the control of tumor cell dissemination.",,"['Lopez-Giral, Sonia', 'Quintana, Nuria E', 'Cabrerizo, Maria', 'Alfonso-Perez, Manuel', 'Sala-Valdes, Monica', 'De Soria, Valle Gomez Garcia', 'Fernandez-Ranada, Jose Maria', 'Fernandez-Ruiz, Elena', 'Munoz, Cecilia']","['Lopez-Giral S', 'Quintana NE', 'Cabrerizo M', 'Alfonso-Perez M', 'Sala-Valdes M', 'De Soria VG', 'Fernandez-Ranada JM', 'Fernandez-Ruiz E', 'Munoz C']","['Department of Immunology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, C/Diego de Leon, 62, 28006 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR5 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR5)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/genetics', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Chemotaxis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoid Tissue/physiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, CCR7', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR5', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism']",,2004/05/25 05:00,2004/09/04 05:00,['2004/05/25 05:00'],"['2004/05/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.1203652 [doi]', 'jlb.1203652 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 Aug;76(2):462-71. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1203652.

To further understand mechanisms mediating chemotherapy resistance, we identified 556 differentially regulated genes in HL-60 cells stably expressing p210(BCR-ABL) versus those expressing an empty vector using cDNA macro- and oligonucleotide microarrays. These BCR-ABL-regulated gene products play diverse roles in cellular function including apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, intracellular signaling, transcription, and cellular adhesion. In particular, we identified up-regulation of the inducible form of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), and further explored the mechanism for its up-regulation. In HL-60/BCR-ABL and K562 cells (expressing p210(BCR-ABL)), abundant cytoplasmic Hsp70 expression was detected by immunoblot analysis. Moreover, cells isolated from bone marrow aspirates of patients in different stages of CML (chronic, aggressive, and blast crisis) express Hsp70. Expression of p210(BCR-ABL) in BCR-ABL negative cells induced transcription of the proximal Hsp70 promoter. Mutational analysis mapped the major p210(BCR-ABL) responsive element to a high affinity 5'(A/T)GATA(A/G)-3' ""GATA"" response element (GATA-RE) that binds GATA-1 in CML cells. The GATA-RE was sufficient to confer p210(BCR-ABL)- and p185(BCR-ABL)-mediated trans-activation to an inert promoter. Short interfering RNA mediated ""knockdown"" of Hsp70 expression in K562 cells induced marked sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Together these findings indicate that BCR-ABL confers chemotherapeutic resistance through intracellular signaling to the GATA-RE element found in the promoter region of the anti-apoptotic Hsp70 protein.

Recently, imatinib, a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been proven to be an effective treatment for Ph(+) ALL, but nearly all patients rapidly acquire resistance. High-dose imatinib administration might overcome this resistance; however, systemic toxicities would likely limit this approach. Therefore, a new delivery system allowing for the specific targeting of imatinib is urgently needed. Because almost all Ph(+) ALL cells express CD19 on their surface, we have developed an immunoliposome carrying anti-CD19 antibody (CD19-liposomes). The internalization efficiency of the CD19-liposomes approached 100% in all Ph(+) ALL cells but was very low in CD19(-) cells. The cytocidal effect of imatinib-encapsulated CD19-liposomes (imatinib-CD19-liposomes) on Ph(+) ALL cell lines and primary leukemia cells from patients with Ph(+) ALL was much greater than that of imatinib with or without control liposomes. Importantly, the imatinib-CD19-liposomes did not affect the colony formation of CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, even at inhibitory concentration of free imatinib. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that the imatinib-CD19-liposomes induced specific and efficient death of Ph(+) ALL cells.

In T lymphocytes, Tax-mediated p53 inhibition is dependent on Tax activation of the NF-kappaB pathway and is linked to p53 phosphorylation. We now report that blocking NF-kappaB transcriptional activation in HTLV-I-transformed cells restores p53 activity. Further, using mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) null cells and antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit expression of NF-kappaB family members, we demonstrate that the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB is uniquely involved in p53 inhibition. Coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrate an interaction between p65 and p53 in HTLV-I-transformed cells. In transient transfection assays, we demonstrate that Tax induces the p53-p65 interaction. Phosphorylation of p53 at serines 15 and 392 is critical for complex formation. Importantly, Tax-mediated p53 inhibition correlates with p65 and p53 interaction. By using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we find that in HTLV-I-transformed cells p53 and p65 form a complex on the inactive, p53-responsive murine double minute 2 (MDM2) promoter. Consistent with reduced transcriptional activity, transcription factor IID (TFIID) binding is not observed.

More selective delivery of chemotherapeutic agents is also feasible using humanised monoclonal antibodies, with the intriguing possibility of increasing treatment delivery without increasing the toxicity.

Early work established that a dose of 14.8 MBq/kg (0.4 mCi/kg) is safe and effective in patients with < 25% bone marrow involvement and adequate marrow reserves, as is a dose of 11.1 MBq/kg (0.3 mCi/kg) in patients with mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts 100 x 10(9)-150 x 10(9)/l). To date, 5 clinical trials using 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan have been reported, one of which assessed the efficacy in rituximab-refractory patients with follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) histology. Within the 54 follicular lymphoma patients, an overall response (OR) rate of 74% and a complete response (CR) rate of 15% were achieved, despite patients having received a median of 4 prior therapies and 73% having tumors > or = 5 cm in diameter. In addition, a major phase III randomized trial directly compared 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan with the unlabeled anti-CD20 MAb rituximab. Results from the randomized trial demonstrated that OR and CR rates were significantly higher with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, compared with rituximab (OR rate 80% vs. 56%, P = 0.002; CR rate 30% vs. 16%, P = 0.004). Time to progression (TTP) was 11.2 vs. 10.1 months (P = 0.173). Treatment was generally well tolerated; the primary toxicity associated with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan therapy is reversible myelosuppression, which correlates with the degree of bone marrow involvement at baseline. In an integrated analysis of safety data from 5 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan studies, only 7% of patients were hospitalized due to infection during the treatment period. In addition, 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan therapy was not shown to increase the risk of developing secondary malignancies (myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia), or preclude subsequent therapy upon relapse. Current investigations are focussing on the potential role of 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan earlier in the treatment algorithm, including as single-agent therapy for relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients not eligible for transplantation, and consolidation treatment for low-grade NHL patients after first-line, alkylating agent-based therapy.",,"['Hagenbeek, Anton']",['Hagenbeek A'],"['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. a.hagenbeek@azu.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications/*therapy', 'Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/therapeutic use']",50,2004/05/25 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/25 05:00'],"['2004/05/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428190310001616944 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003;44 Suppl 4:S37-47. doi: 10.1080/10428190310001616944.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacodynamic (PD) rationale is based on the role of Gln as the main amino group donor for Asn synthesis from aspartate by the enzyme asparagine synthetase (AS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Relationships between ASNase enzymatic activity and Asn or Gln levels were examined in 274 pairs of pre- and post-ASNase serum specimens from 200 high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients from the Children's Cancer Group (CCG-1961). Data were analyzed according to a novel PD model based on previous best-fit projections (NONMEM) from the CCG-1962 standard-risk ALL study. RESULTS: The PD results from high-risk and standard-risk ALL patients were superimposable. The percentages of Asn and Gln deamination were predicted by ASNase activity in patients' sera. Pharmacodynamic analyses strongly suggested that > 90% deamination of Gln must occur before optimal Asn deamination takes place in vivo. Asparaginase activity > or = 0.4 IU/ml yielded mean Gln and Asn % deamination values of 90%. Lower ASNase concentrations yielded lower Gln or Asn % deamination. This ASNase concentration coincides with the in vitro determined IC50 value on CEM/0 human T-lymphoblastic leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: Asparaginase activity of > or = 0.4 IU/ml provided optimal Asn and Gln deamination in high-risk ALL patients. Deamination of Gln correlates with enhanced serum Asn deamination in vivo.

The present review provides an overview of the role of IL-1alpha in testicular physiology. Bioactive IL-1alpha isolated from adult rat testis was found to consist of three distinct immunoreactive protein species with apparent sizes of 45, 24 and 19 kDa. These isoforms showed bioactivity in a thymocyte proliferation and steroidogenesis assays with different biopotencies. The background of the molecular heterogeneity and processing, secretion and regulation of the isoforms of testicular IL-1alpha are discussed.

Cytokines in pregnancy/early abortion: reexamining the TH1/TH2 paradigm.,93-119,"In this paper, we briefly survey the history of concepts in reproductive immunology from antibody-mediated tolerance to the ""fetal allograft"" to the current concept of an embryo ""bathing in a sea of cytokines"". We then review the paradigm that ""allopregnancy is a Th2 phenomenon"" and some of the evidence gained in animals and humans supporting it. We continue by discussing the light it sheds on immunologically caused recurrent abortion, and the present status of the concepts. We next show the limits of the Th1/Th2 paradigm by reviewing the role of ""inflammatory"" cytokines in implantation (as first seen with leukemia inhibitory factor). We go on to discuss recent data showing that interferon-gamma is not solely a ""bad guy"", e.g. abortifacient as the paradigm would predict, but is needed at low doses for the vascular development and transformation of uterine spiral arteries required for implantation and successful pregnancy. We conclude by discussing the emerging role of NK and IL-12, IL-15, IL-18 tripods and other cytokines in local angiogenesis and tissue remodelling, a series of new data bringing us well beyond the Th1/Th2 paradigm in pregnancy which, in this context, appears now obsolete and an oversimplification, although it has indeed been useful at first. Rather, step-specific events have to be considered and a key role is seen in local tissue remodelling, in which immune cytokines play an important role while not always being secreted by immune cells.","['Copyright 2004 S.

We report the beneficial effect of an alternative chemotherapeutic regimen containing 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin) and the monoclonal antibody anti-CD20 (rituximab) in 5 patients with resistant/relapsing CLL. PATIENTS: Five patients (4 men and 1 woman) with CLL at stage C, according to Binet's classification, were included in the therapeutic protocol. The median age of the patients was 76 years (range 57-84 years). Previous treatment consisted of chlorambucil-prednisolone, fludarabine, and CHOP. The current regimen comprised six 2-week cycles of pentostatin, 4 mg/m(2) i.v., combined with four cycles of rituximab, in a dose of 375 mg/m(2), every other week. RESULTS: Three patients responded to therapy, 2 achieved complete remission and 1 a partial response. Two patients did not respond to treatment. Toxicity was mild and well tolerated. The median survival duration of the responders was 19 months. These promising results suggest that salvage therapy with a combination regimen including pentostatin and rituximab may have a beneficial effect in patients with resistant/relapsing CLL.","['Copyright 2004 S.

Like leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-6R/IL-6 inhibits the differentiation of murine ES cells into embryoid bodies. In the present study, we show that this recombinant cytokine may be efficiently used to stimulate the differentiation of oligodendrocytes if added to ES cell-derived neural precursors. IL-6R/IL-6 leads to an increase in early chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan positive and late O4 positive progenitors and to a stimulation of maturation into O1 and myelin basic protein expressing oligodendrocytes.

Analysis of leukemic blasts from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis revealed that CDCP1 is predominantly expressed on CD34(+)CD133+ myeloid leukemic blasts. However, CDCP1 was not strictly correlated with CD34 and/or CD133 expression, suggesting that CDCP1 is a novel marker for leukemia diagnosis. Stimulation of CD34+ BM cells with CDCP1-reactive monoclonal antibody CUB1 resulted in an increased (approximately twofold) formation of erythroid colony-forming units, indicating that CDCP1 plays an important role in early hematopoiesis. Finally, we show that CDCP1 is also expressed on cells phenotypically identical to mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs). In conclusion, CDCP1 is not only a novel marker for immature hematopoietic progenitor cell subsets but also unique in its property to recognize cells with phenotypes reminiscent of MSC and NPC.",,"['Buhring, Hans-Jorg', 'Kuci, Selim', 'Conze, Tim', 'Rathke, Gisa', 'Bartolovic, Kerol', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Scherl-Mostageer, Marwa', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Schweifer, Norbert', 'Lammers, Reiner']","['Buhring HJ', 'Kuci S', 'Conze T', 'Rathke G', 'Bartolovic K', 'Grunebach F', 'Scherl-Mostageer M', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Schweifer N', 'Lammers R']","['University of Tubingen, Department of Internal Medicine II, Division of Hematology, Immunology, Oncology and Rheumatology, Tubingen, Germany. hans-joerg.buehring@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CDCP1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colonic Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism']",,2004/05/22 05:00,2005/10/05 09:00,['2004/05/22 05:00'],"['2004/05/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.22-3-334 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2004;22(3):334-43. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.22-3-334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported previously that nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was constitutively activated in ATL cells, although expression of the viral proteins was barely detectable, including Tax, which was known to persistently activate NF-kappaB. Here we demonstrate that ATL cells that do not express detectable Tax protein exhibit constitutive IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity. Transfection studies revealed that a dominant-negative form of IKK1, and not of IKK2 or NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activity in ATL cells. This IKK activity was accompanied by elevated expression of p52, suggesting that the recently described noncanonical pathway of NF-kappaB activation operates in ATL cells. We finally show that specific inhibition of NF-kappaB by a super-repressor form of IkappaBalpha (SR-IkappaBalpha) in HTLV-I-infected T cells results in cell death regardless of Tax expression, providing definitive evidence of an essential role for NF-kappaB in the survival of ATL cells. In conclusion, the IKK complex is constitutively activated in ATL cells through a cellular mechanism distinct from that of Tax-mediated IKK activation.

RESULTS: Expression of bcl-2 mRNA and protein were found to be favourably associated with outcome for patients, supporting a prognostic role for bcl-2 in breast cancer, whereas mcl-1 expression, at the mRNA or protein level, did not correlate with tumour size, grade, lymph node or ER status, age of patient at diagnosis, or disease outcome. CONCLUSION: As these analyses of mcl-1 expression may have co-detected mcl-1(S/deltaTM) (a more recently identified, shorter variant, that may be pro-apoptotic) with the anti-apoptotic wild-type of mcl-1, it is possible that future studies may indicate some significant clinical correlations if the isoforms can be independently investigated.",,"[""O'Driscoll, L"", 'Cronin, D', 'Kennedy, S M', 'Purcell, R', 'Linehan, R', 'Glynn, S', 'Larkin, A', 'Scanlon, K', 'McDermott, E W', 'Hill, A D', ""O'Higgins, N J"", 'Parkinson, M', 'Clynes, M']","[""O'Driscoll L"", 'Cronin D', 'Kennedy SM', 'Purcell R', 'Linehan R', 'Glynn S', 'Larkin A', 'Scanlon K', 'McDermott EW', 'Hill AD', ""O'Higgins NJ"", 'Parkinson M', 'Clynes M']","['National Institute for Cellular Biotechnology, Dublin City University, Glasnevin, Dublin 9, Ireland.

The 369 bp RNA competitor was constructed by restriction enzyme treatment of an ALV-J specific 545 bp PCR product, ligation, transformation into Escherichia coli, and in vitro transcription. The competitor contained the same amplification primer annealing sites and sequence as the original viral RNA, except that it had a 176 bp internal deletion. Coamplified RT-PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining, and fluorescences were quantified using computer-assisted image analysis.

Nineteen patients (median age 7.8 years, 14 boys) required 24 ICU admissions post-HSCT. The most frequent underlying diseases were acute myeloid leukemia (n=5). The survival rate on discharge from ICU was 54%. In univariate analysis, risk factors of mortality included earlier requirement of ICU admission post-HSCT (median 34 versus 166 days, p=0.002), a longer delay before ICU admission (median 12 versus 5 h, p=0.02), lack of neutrophil (p=0.011) or platelet engraftment (p=0.008), macroscopic hemorrhage (p<0.001), tachypnoea (p=0.033), hypoxemia (p=0.031), renal impairment (p=0.011), coagulopathy (p=0.012), mechanical ventilation (p<0.001), and an increasing number of organ failures (p=0.003).

This abnormality is associated with myelocytic leukaemia with dysplastic granulopoiesis. Here, we demonstrate that when expressed in a normal human (CD34(+)) progenitor population, AML1-ETO selectively inhibits granulocyte colony formation but not monocyte colony formation. In bulk liquid culture, we found that though AML1-ETO transiently inhibited the proliferation of CD34(+) cells, it promoted long-term growth of myeloid cells for more than 80 days, suggesting that differentiation was inhibited. In support of this, cultures expressing AML1-ETO demonstrated enhanced retention of colony-forming capacity. Phenotypic examination of AML1-ETO cultures revealed a defect in granulocytic differentiation in terms of retention of CD34(+) cells within the culture and delayed CD11b upregulation. Morphologically, granulocyte terminal differentiation in AML1-ETO-expressing cells was inhibited by 83+/-5%, giving rise to a build-up of early to intermediate granulocytes that exhibited a number of morphological features associated with t(8;21) leukaemias. In contrast, AML1-ETO had little or no effect on monocytic differentiation.

In this study, we show that cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), even at low doses, induced CD80 expression in vitro in mouse DA1-3b leukemic cells, by a mechanism that involved reactive oxygen species. In vivo experiments in the mouse DA1-3b/C3H whole-animal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model showed that injection of Ara-C induced expression of CD80 and CD86, and decreased expression of B7-H1, indicating that chemotherapy can modify costimulatory molecule expression in vivo, in a way not necessarily observed in vitro. Mouse leukemic cells exposed in vivo to Ara-C were more susceptible to specific cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing. Ara-C also induced CD80 or CD86 expression in 14 of 21 primary cultured human AML samples. In humans being treated for AML, induction chemotherapy increased CD86 expression in the leukemic cells.

METHODS: The study included 91 patients (50 males) who underwent BMT from 1985 to 1995 at the age of 0.6-21 years. Sixty patients had neoplastic disease such as leukemia or lymphoma, and the remainder had non-neoplastic diseases. Preconditioning regimen for BMT included 12 Gy of fractionated-total body irradiation (TBI) for patients with neoplastic disease and 3-8 Gy of irradiation for the remaining patients, in addition to chemotherapy. Evaluation of thyroid function was performed by serial assessment of basal serum FT4, FT3, TSH concentrations as well as by TRH test. RESULTS: No patient had overt hypothyroidism or elevated basal TSH concentrations (>10 mU/L). However, 6 (7%) of patients experienced exaggerated peak TSH response to TRH stimulation several years after BMT. In 33 patients whose thyroid status was evaluated before, within 3 months, and 1 year after BMT, serum FT3 concentrations as well as peak TSH response to TRH stimulation significantly decreased immediately after BMT (<3 months) and normalized within 1 year. However, serum FT4 concentrations did not change significantly. One patient developed primary hypothyroidism and another developed follicular adenoma of the thyroid 5 and 12 years after BMT, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short-term changes in thyroid function after BMT can indicate euthyroid sick syndrome rather than tertiary hypothyroidism.

Biochemical fractionation revealed that a significant proportion of AIRE is associated with the nuclear matrix, which directs the functional domains of chromatin to provide sites for gene regulation. Upon proteasome inhibition, AIRE NBs were increased with concomitant reduced expression in the cytoplasm, suggesting that subcellular targeting of AIRE is regulated by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We also found that AIRE NBs compete for cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300, a common coactivator of transcription, with the promyelocytic leukemia gene product.

The rate and predictors of physical and emotional recovery after HCT have not been adequately defined in prospective long-term studies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the course of recovery and return to work after HCT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study at a US academic center specializing in HCT. Function was assessed from pretransplantation to 5-year follow-up for 319 adults who had myeloablative HCT for treatment of leukemia or lymphoma and spoke English. Of the 99 long-term survivors who had no recurrent malignancy, 94 completed 5-year follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Physical limitations, return to work, depression, and distress related to treatment or disease were evaluated before transplantation, at 90 days, and at 1, 3, and 5 years after HCT. RESULTS: Physical recovery occurred earlier than psychological or work recovery. Only 21 patients (19%) recovered on all outcomes at 1 year. The proportion without major limitations increased to 63% (n = 57) by 5 years. Among survivors without recurrent malignancy, 84% (n = 74) returned to full-time work by 5 years. Patients with slower physical recovery had higher medical risk and were more depressed before HCT (P< or =.001). Patients with chronic graft-vs-host disease (P =.01), with less social support before HCT (P =.001), and women (P<.001) were more depressed after transplantation. Transplant-related distress was slower to recover for allogeneic transplant recipients and those with less social support before HCT (P< or =.01). Patients who had more experience with cancer treatment before beginning HCT had more rapid recovery from depression (P =.04) and treatment-related distress (P =.009). CONCLUSIONS: Full recovery after HCT is a 3- to 5-year process. Recovery might be accelerated by more effective interventions to increase work-related capabilities, improve social support, and manage depression.",,"['Syrjala, Karen L', 'Langer, Shelby L', 'Abrams, Janet R', 'Storer, Barry', 'Sanders, Jean E', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Martin, Paul J']","['Syrjala KL', 'Langer SL', 'Abrams JR', 'Storer B', 'Sanders JE', 'Flowers ME', 'Martin PJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. ksyrjala@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,IM,"['Absenteeism', 'Adult', '*Convalescence/psychology', 'Depression', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology/psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Stress, Psychological', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/05/20 05:00,2004/05/25 05:00,['2004/05/20 05:00'],"['2004/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1001/jama.291.19.2335 [doi]', '291/19/2335 [pii]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2004 May 19;291(19):2335-43. doi: 10.1001/jama.291.19.2335.,,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 63030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simple and established notion that FP is an inhibitor of transcription predicts its effects. Because Mdm-2 targets p53 for degradation, FP, as predicted, dramatically induced p53 by inhibiting Mdm-2. Once p53 was induced, restoration of transcription (by removal of FP) resulted in superinduction of p21 and Mdm-2. Similarly, low concentrations of FP (50 nm) induced p21 and Mdm-2 because of their initial down-regulation. A sustained decrease of Mdm-2/p21 expression and accumulation of p53 coincided with near-maximal cytotoxicity of FP at concentrations >100 nm. Induction of p53 was a marker, not a cause, of cytotoxicity. FP caused rapid apoptosis (caspase-dependent cell death) in p53-null leukemia cells. In these cells, FP-induced apoptosis was converted to growth arrest by inhibitors of caspases.

PKC412, an inhibitor of FLT-3 kinase activity, is being clinically evaluated in AML. Present studies demonstrate that treatment of human acute leukemia MV4-11 cells (containing a FLT-3 LM) with the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-demethoxy geldanamycin (17-AAG) attenuated the levels of FLT-3 by inhibiting its chaperone association with heat shock protein 90, which induced the poly-ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of FLT-3. Treatment with 17-AAG induced cell cycle G(1) phase accumulation and apoptosis of MV4-11 cells. 17-AAG-mediated attenuation of FLT-3 and p-FLT-3 in MV4-11 cells was associated with decrease in the levels of p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, and p-STAT5, as well as attenuation of the DNA binding activity of STAT-5. Treatment with 17-AAG, downstream of STAT5, reduced the levels of c-Myc and oncostatin M, which are transactivated by STAT5. Cotreatment with 17-AAG and PKC412 markedly down-regulated the levels of FLT-3, p-FLT-3, p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, and p-STAT5, as well as induced more apoptosis of MV4-11 cells than either agent alone. Furthermore, the combination of 17-AAG and PKC412 exerted synergistic cytotoxic effects against MV4-11 cells. Importantly, 17-AAG and PKC412 induced more loss of cell viability of primary AML blasts containing FLT-3 LM, as compared with those that contained wild-type FLT-3. Collectively, these in vitro findings indicate that the combination of 17-AAG and PKC412 has high level of activity against AML cells with FLT-3 mutations.",,"['George, Prince', 'Bali, Purva', 'Cohen, Pamela', 'Tao, Jianguo', 'Guo, Fei', 'Sigua, Celia', 'Vishvanath, Anasuya', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Scuto, Anna', 'Annavarapu, Srinivas', 'Moscinski, Lynn', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['George P', 'Bali P', 'Cohen P', 'Tao J', 'Guo F', 'Sigua C', 'Vishvanath A', 'Fiskus W', 'Scuto A', 'Annavarapu S', 'Moscinski L', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida 33612, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/05/20 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2004/05/20 05:00'],"['2004/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0006 [doi]', '64/10/3645 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 May 15;64(10):3645-52. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-04-0006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 inhibitors, BH3I-2' and HA14-1, are small cell-permeable nonpeptide compounds, are able to induce apoptosis by mediating cytochrome c release, and also lead to dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). This study aimed to use the Bcl-2 inhibitors to sensitize CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by switching on the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. We found that a low dose of BH3I-2' or HA14-1, which did not induce cytochrome c release, greatly sensitized CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In a similar manner to the classical uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), both BH3I-2' and HA14-1 induced a reduction in DeltaPsim, a generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), an increased mitochondrial respiration, and a decreased ATP synthesis. This uncoupling function of the Bcl-2 inhibitors was responsible for the synergy with TRAIL-induced apoptosis. CCCP per se did not induce apoptosis but again sensitized CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by uncoupling mitochondrial respiration. The uncoupling effect facilitated TRAIL-induced Bax conformational change and cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Inhibition of caspases failed to block TRAIL-mediated cell death when mitochondrial respiration was uncoupled. We observed that BH3I-2', HA14-1, or CCCP can overcome resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cell lines, such as CEM, HL-60, and U937. Our results suggest that the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration can sensitize leukemic cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising agent for cancer therapy, including cholangiocarcinoma. However, many cholangiocarcinoma cells are resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus, our aim was to examine the intracellular mechanisms responsible for TRAIL resistance in human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines. Three TRAIL-resistant human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were identified. All of the cell lines expressed TRAIL receptor 1/death receptor 4 (TRAIL-R1/DR4) and TRAIL-R2/DR5. Expression of TRAIL decoy receptors and the antiapoptotic cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) was inconsistent across the cell lines. Of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins profiled (Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Mcl-1), Mcl-1 was uniquely overexpressed by the cell lines. When small-interfering-RNA (siRNA) technology was used to knock down expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), and Mcl-1, only the Mcl-1-siRNA sensitized the cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In a cell line stably transfected with Mcl-1-small-hairpin-RNA (Mcl-1-shRNA), Mcl-1 depletion sensitized cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis despite Bcl-2 expression. TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in the stably transfected cells was associated with mitochondrial depolarization, Bax activation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria, and caspase activation. Finally, flavopiridol, an anticancer drug that rapidly down-regulates Mcl-1, also sensitized cells to TRAIL cytotoxicity. In conclusion, these studies not only demonstrate that Mcl-1 mediates TRAIL resistance in cholangiocarcinoma cells by blocking the mitochondrial pathway of cell death but also identify two strategies for circumventing this resistance.",,"['Taniai, Makiko', 'Grambihler, Annette', 'Higuchi, Hajime', 'Werneburg, Nate', 'Bronk, Steve F', 'Farrugia, Daniel J', 'Kaufmann, Scott H', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Taniai M', 'Grambihler A', 'Higuchi H', 'Werneburg N', 'Bronk SF', 'Farrugia DJ', 'Kaufmann SH', 'Gores GJ']","['Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/biosynthesis', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2004/05/20 05:00,2004/08/03 05:00,['2004/05/20 05:00'],"['2004/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2770 [doi]', '64/10/3517 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 May 15;64(10):3517-24. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-03-2770.,,,"['R01 CA069008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK59427/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CCSST is typified by a chromosomal t(12;22)(q13;q12) translocation resulting in a fusion between the Ewing sarcoma gene (EWSR1) and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1), of which the activity in nontransformed cells is regulated by cyclic AMP. Our aim was to identify critical differentially expressed genes in CCSST tumor cells in comparison with other solid tumors affecting children and young adults to better understand signaling pathways regulating specific features of the development and progression of this tumor entity. We applied Affymetrix Human Genome U95Av2 oligonucleotide microarrays representing approximately 12,000 genes to generate the expression profiles of the CCSST cell lines GG-62, DTC-1, KAO, MST2, MST3, and Su-CC-S1 in comparison with 8 neuroblastoma, 7 Ewing tumor, and 6 osteosarcoma cell lines. Subsequent hierarchical clustering of microarray data clearly separated all four of the tumor types from each other and identified differentially expressed transcripts, which are characteristically up-regulated in CCSST. Statistical analysis revealed a group of 331 probe sets, representing approximately 300 significant (P < 0.001) differentially regulated genes, which clearly discriminated between the CCSST and other tumor samples. Besides genes that were already known to be highly expressed in CCSST, like S100A11 (S100 protein) or MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), this group shows an obvious portion of genes that are involved in cyclic AMP response or regulation, in pigmentation processes, or in neuronal structure and signaling. Comparison with other expression profile analyses on neuroectodermal childhood tumors confirms the high robustness of this strategy to characterize tumor entities based on their gene expression. We found the avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homologue 3 (ERBB3) to be one of the most dramatically up-regulated genes in CCSST. Quantitative real-time PCR and Northern blot analysis verified the mRNA abundance and confirmed the absence of the inhibitory transcript variant of this gene. The protein product of the member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family ERBB3 could be shown to be highly present in all of the CCSST cell lines investigated, as well as in 18 of 20 primary tumor biopsies.

More recently, arsenic trioxide has been shown to be efficient in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. The exact mechanism of action has not been elucidated yet, but it seems to be related to arsenic binding to vicinal thiol groups of regulatory proteins. Glutathione is the major intracellular thiol and plays important roles in the cellular defense and metabolism. This paper reports on a study of the interactions between arsenic(III) and either cysteine or glutathione in aqueous solution. The behavior observed for the As(III)-glutathione system is very similar to that of As(III)-cysteine. In both cases, the formation of two complexes in aqueous solution was evidenced by NMR and electronic spectroscopies and by potentiometry. The formation constants of the cysteine complexes [As(H(-1)Cys)(3)], log K = 29.84(6), and [As(H(-2)Cys)(OH)(2)](-), log K = 12.01(9), and of the glutathione complexes [As(H(-2)GS)(3)](3-), log K = 32.0(6), and [As(H(-3)GS)(OH)(2)](2-), log K = 10(3) were calculated from potentiometric and spectroscopic data. In both cases, the [As(HL)(3)] species, in which the amine groups are protonated, predominate from acidic to neutral media, and the [As(L)(OH)(2)] species appear in basic medium (the charges were omitted for the sake of simplicity). Spectroscopic data clearly show that the arsenite-binding site in both complexes is the sulfur atom of cysteine.

It is not known, however, how MyoD initially recognizes its binding site in a chromatin context.

These domains are necessary for the stable binding of MyoD to the myogenin promoter through an interaction with an adjacent protein complex containing the homeodomain protein Pbx, which appears to be constitutively bound at this site.

Most cases have been reported in the Caribbean. Although several million people are estimated to be infected by HTLV-1 in sub-Saharan Africa, no case of ID has been reported in this area. OBJECTIVES: To identify and to describe cases of HTLV-1-associated ID in Senegal, West Africa. METHODS: Over a 3-year period, a serological test for HTLV-1 was performed at a dermatological centre in Dakar, Senegal, in children who presented with a picture suggestive of ID. Complementary haematological, immunological and virological investigations were performed in infected children and in their mothers. RESULTS: Five patients with typical HTLV-1-associated ID were identified, of ages 17, 5, 4, 3 and 3 years; two patients belonged to the same family. They all presented with repeated flares of superinfected dermatitis involving typical sites of ID (mainly the scalp, external ears, nares and eyelids), associated with nasal discharge, and less commonly with a nonspecific papular rash on the face or trunk. Although oral antibiotic therapy always gave effective control of the symptoms, recurrences were constant. A persisting dry dermatitis of the retroauricular folds was common between flares. Infection in the oldest patient was associated with a chronic adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma. The mothers of three patients, and the grandmother of another, were all infected by HTLV-1 strains belonging to the Cosmopolitan molecular subtype, with a perfect nucleotide identity of long-terminal repeat and env gp21 genomic regions within each family. CONCLUSIONS: We present the clinical and virological features of the first reported African cases of HTLV-1-associated ID. When compared with data from the Caribbean, infectious features seemed particularly prominent. ID appears to be overlooked in sub-Saharan Africa, where it might be easily confused with common pyoderma. Breast feeding appears to be the origin of HTLV-1 contamination of the children.",,"['Mahe, A', 'Meertens, L', 'Ly, F', 'Sow, P S', 'Diop, C T', 'Samb, N D', 'Diop, O M', 'Valensi, F', 'Gessain, A']","['Mahe A', 'Meertens L', 'Ly F', 'Sow PS', 'Diop CT', 'Samb ND', 'Diop OM', 'Valensi F', 'Gessain A']","[""Institut d'Hygiene Sociale, Dakar, Sengal. mahe@refer.sn""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatitis/pathology/*virology', 'Facial Dermatoses/pathology/virology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/transmission', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phylogeny', 'Senegal']",,2004/05/20 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/05/20 05:00'],"['2004/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.05834.x [doi]', 'BJD5834 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2004 May;150(5):958-65. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2004.05834.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients belonging to the refractory anemia (RA) subtype are usually treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO). Not all patients respond to EPO administration and they are strictly dependent on supportive therapy with red cell blood (RBC) transfusions. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of an alternative combination regimen containing EPO, low-dose methylprednisolone and nandrolone decanoate, in patients with RA unresponsive to EPO administration alone. Ten patients, 4 women and 6 men, median age: 70 years (range: 55-78 years) with refractory anemia unresponsive to EPO administration and RBC transfusion-dependent were included in the study. Median hematological data at baseline were Hb: 8.7 g/dl, (range 6.2-9.8), WBC: 3.35x10(9)/l (range 2.1-4), PLT: 82.5x10(9)/l (range 59-110). EPO 150 U/Kg three times/week subcutaneously, low-dose methylprednisolone 8 mg/day orally and nandrolone decanoate (Decadurabolin) 50 mg two-times/week intramuscularly were administered. As complete response (CR) to treatment was considered the normalization of the peripheral blood and bone marrow smears and biopsy. As partial response (PR) was considered increase in Hb level > or = 2 g/dl, or up to 10 g/dl and discontinuation of RBC transfusions. The response to therapy was evaluated on the 4th week after the initiation of the combination treatment. Bone marrow smear evaluation was carried out at baseline and every six months afterwards. After a 4-week treatment all patients achieved PR and discontinued RBC transfusions. Median and range hematological values on the 4th week after treatment initiation were Hb: 11.2 g/dl, (range: 9.8-12.8), WBC: 4.4x10(9)/l (3.5-6.6), PLT: 130x10(9)/l (95-160). The increase observed in hematological values was significant (p = 0.0001, 0.0004 and < 0.0001, respectively, for Hb, WBC and PLT counts). Treatment was well tolerated. Furthermore, two women, on treatment with the combination regimen, achieved CR one after six months and the second after 12 months. They are alive after 5 years from initiation of the combination treatment. After a median period of 18 months (range 12 to 20 months) in PR three men developed acute leukemia; they received intensive antileukemic chemotherapy without any response and died during the phase of pancytopenia. Three other men achieved CR, one after 6 and two after 12 months of therapy and they are on regular follow-up. Two women after 10 and 14 months in PR developed acute leukemia and died. In conclusion, combination therapy with EPO, nandrolone decanoate and low-dose methylprednisolone may be effective as an alternative treatment for RBC transfusion-dependent patients with RA unresponsive to EPO administration alone.",,"['Tsiara, S N', 'Chaidos, A', 'Gouva, M', 'Christou, L', 'Panteli, K', 'Kapsali, E', 'Bourantas, K L']","['Tsiara SN', 'Chaidos A', 'Gouva M', 'Christou L', 'Panteli K', 'Kapsali E', 'Bourantas KL']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece. stsiara@cc.uoi.gr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '6PG9VR430D (Nandrolone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Androgens/analysis', 'Anemia/therapy', 'Anemia, Refractory/*therapy', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Erythrocytes', 'Erythropoietin/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Nandrolone/*administration & dosage', 'Recombinant Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors']",,2004/05/20 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/05/20 05:00'],"['2004/05/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2004 Mar;23(1):47-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have thus developed an innovative ensemble decision approach, which can efficiently perform multiple gene mining tasks. An application of this approach to analyze two publicly available data sets (colon data and leukemia data) identified 20 highly significant colon cancer genes and 23 highly significant molecular signatures for refining the acute leukemia phenotype, most of which have been verified either by biological experiments or by alternative analysis approaches.

Data included self- and parent-report questionnaires completed during active treatment. RESULTS: Siblings did not exhibit increased rates of behavior problems, but did display more social and academic difficulties. Empathy was a significant predictor of externalizing and total problems. Cancer knowledge was not related to adjustment, but was associated with empathy.

We have previously used an in vitro differentiation model of embryonic stem (ES) cells and demonstrated that hematopoietic and endothelial cells develop via sequentially generated FLK1(+) and SCL(+) cells. To gain a better understanding of cellular and molecular events leading to hematopoietic specification, we examined factors necessary for FLK1(+) and SCL(+) cell induction in serum-free conditions. We demonstrate that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 was required for the generation of FLK1(+) and SCL(+) cells, and that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was necessary for the expansion and differentiation of SCL-expressing hematopoietic progenitors. Consistently, Flk1-deficient ES cells responded to BMP4 and generated TER119(+) and CD31(+) cells, but they failed to expand in response to VEGF. The Smad1/5 and map kinase pathways were activated by BMP4 and VEGF, respectively. The overexpression of SMAD6 in ES cells resulted in a reduction of FLK1(+) cells. In addition, a MAP kinase kinase 1 specific inhibitor blocked the expansion of SCL(+) cells in response to VEGF. Finally, VEGF mediated expansion of hematopoietic and endothelial cell progenitors was inhibited by TGFbeta1, but was augmented by activin A. Our studies suggest that hematopoietic and endothelial commitment from the mesoderm occurs via BMP4-mediated signals and that expansion and/or differentiation of such progenitors is achieved by an interplay of VEGF, TGFbeta1 and activin A signaling.",,"['Park, Changwon', 'Afrikanova, Iva', 'Chung, Yun Shin', 'Zhang, Wen Jie', 'Arentson, Elizabeth', 'Fong Gh, Guo hua', 'Rosendahl, Alexander', 'Choi, Kyunghee']","['Park C', 'Afrikanova I', 'Chung YS', 'Zhang WJ', 'Arentson E', 'Fong Gh Gh', 'Rosendahl A', 'Choi K']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, 660 South Euclid Avenue, Campus Box 8118, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (SMAD1 protein, human)', '0 (SMAD5 protein, human)', '0 (SMAD6 protein, human)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (Smad1 Protein)', '0 (Smad1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Smad5 Protein)', '0 (Smad5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Smad6 Protein)', '0 (Smad6 protein, mouse)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tgfb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '0 (U 0126)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (nonmuscle myosin type IIB heavy chain)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Butadienes/pharmacology', 'CD4 Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myosin Heavy Chains', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIB', 'Phosphoproteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Smad Proteins', 'Smad1 Protein', 'Smad5 Protein', 'Smad6 Protein', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/*metabolism']",,2004/05/19 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2004/05/19 05:00'],"['2004/05/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/dev.01130 [doi]', '131/11/2749 [pii]']",ppublish,Development. 2004 Jun;131(11):2749-62. doi: 10.1242/dev.01130.,,,['R01 HL63736/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although most anticancer drugs are believed not to cause acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS), concerns have been raised by reports of QT interval prolongation, ventricular fibrillation and death associated with amsacrine treatment. Since blockade of cardiac human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium currents is an important cause of acquired LQTS, we investigated the acute effects of amsacrine on cloned HERG channels to determine the electrophysiological basis for its proarrhythmic potential. 2 HERG channels were heterologously expressed in human HEK 293 cells and Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the respective potassium currents were recorded using patch-clamp and two-microelectrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. 3 Amsacrine blocked HERG currents in HEK 293 cells and Xenopus oocytes in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 209.4 nm and 2.0 microm, respectively. 4 HERG channels were primarily blocked in the open and inactivated states, and no additional voltage dependence was observed. Amsacrine caused a negative shift in the voltage dependence of both activation (-7.6 mV) and inactivation (-7.6 mV). HERG current block by amsacrine was not frequency dependent. 5 The S6 domain mutations Y652A and F656A attenuated (Y652A) or abolished (F656A, Y652A/F656A) HERG current blockade, indicating that amsacrine binding requires a common drug receptor within the pore-S6 region. 6 In conclusion, these data demonstrate that the anticancer drug amsacrine is an antagonist of cloned HERG potassium channels, providing a molecular mechanism for the previously reported QTc interval prolongation during clinical administration of amsacrine.",,"['Thomas, Dierk', 'Hammerling, Bettina C', 'Wu, Kezhong', 'Wimmer, Anna-Britt', 'Ficker, Eckhard K', 'Kirsch, Glenn E', 'Kochan, Mary C', 'Wible, Barbara A', 'Scholz, Eberhard P', 'Zitron, Edgar', 'Kathofer, Sven', 'Kreye, Volker A W', 'Katus, Hugo A', 'Schoels, Wolfgang', 'Karle, Christoph A', 'Kiehn, Johann']","['Thomas D', 'Hammerling BC', 'Wu K', 'Wimmer AB', 'Ficker EK', 'Kirsch GE', 'Kochan MC', 'Wible BA', 'Scholz EP', 'Zitron E', 'Kathofer S', 'Kreye VA', 'Katus HA', 'Schoels W', 'Karle CA', 'Kiehn J']","['Department of Cardiology, Medical University Hospital Heidelberg, Germany.

Therefore, investigation of Tax effect on the expression of these viruses is of particular clinical importance, since HTLV-I infection of carriers harboring such latent viruses may trigger their related diseases. In this study we focused on simian virus 40 and demonstrated that Tax activates the promoter of this virus through NF-kappaB-associated pathway. Furthermore, we show that this activation requires an interaction of the NF-kappaB factor p65(RelA) with CBP, which depends on PKA-mediated phosphorylation of p65(RelA). Finally, the present study proves that the nuclear Tax plays a critical role in Tax-induced NF-kappaB-mediated SV40 activation.",,"['Tabakin-Fix, Yulia', 'Huleihel, Mahmoud', 'Aboud, Mordechai']","['Tabakin-Fix Y', 'Huleihel M', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and Cancer Research Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",,2004/05/19 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/05/19 05:00'],"['2004/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/05/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.04.137 [doi]', 'S0006291X04009076 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004 Jun 11;318(4):1052-6. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2004.04.137.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that deletion of at least one copy of the p16INK4A gene is associated with an increased risk of relapse in pediatric leukemia. Our data suggest that hemizygous p16INK4A deletion may be constitutional, conferring susceptibility to leukemia. Confirmation of this association is worthy of a larger study. Data from primary leukemia specimens are also presented here which examined the possibility that the remaining allele of the gene was inactivated by another mechanism such as mutation or was silenced by methylation. These possibilities were formally excluded in a case of hemizygous loss of the p16INK4A gene in leukemia, establishing that in this case the p16INK4A deletion was either semidominant or fully haploinsufficient for relapse susceptibility in this disease. Implementation of high throughput methods such as those used here for detecting hemizygous loss of tumor suppressor genes will become increasingly important for molecular diagnosis of cancer.

Expression of cyclin E is regulated on the level of gene transcription mainly by members of the E2F trrnscription factor family and by its degradation via the proteasome pathway. Cyclin E binds and activates the kinase Cdk2 and by phosphorylating its substrates, the so-called ""pocket proteins"", the cyclic/Cdk2 complexes initiate a cascade of events that leads to the expression of S-phase specific genes. Aside from this specific function as a regulator of S-phase-entry, cyclin E plays a direct role in the initiation of DNA replication, the control of genomic stability, and the centrosome cycle. Surprisingly, recent studies have shown that the once thought essential cyclin E is dispensable for the development of higher eukaryotes and for the mitotic division of eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, high level cyclin E expression has been associated with the initiation or progression of different human cancers, in particular breast cancer but also leukemia, lymphoma and others.

There are two major populations of blood DCs, myeloid DCs (myDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pcDCs). pcDCs are particularly important in antiviral as well as in general host defence, as they are the principal producers of type I interferons (IFNs). In this study, we analysed myDCs and pcDCs in healthy controls, human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected asymptomatic carriers (ACs), and patients with adult T-cell leukaemia (ATL). ATL patients had significantly decreased number of pcDCs and myDCs compared with controls. IFN-alpha production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was markedly reduced in ATL patients. Purified pcDCs from ACs were found to have impaired IFN-alpha-producing capacity, suggesting a functional defect in pcDCs in HTLV-I-infected individuals. Interestingly, pcDCs were shown to be susceptible to HTLV-I infection. Thus, impaired IFN-alpha production by pcDCs may contribute to the immunodeficiency observed in ATL. Furthermore, IFN-alpha-producing capacity was inversely correlated with HTLV-I proviral load in PBMCs from ACs, suggesting a role for pcDCs in maintaining the carrier state. Taken together, we hypothesize that the depletion and impaired IFN-alpha-producing capacity of blood DCs may contribute to the immunodeficiency in ATL and/or the development of ATL.",,"['Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Imada, Kazunori', 'Kitawaki, Toshio', 'Ueda, Maki', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu', 'Uchiyama, Takashi']","['Hishizawa M', 'Imada K', 'Kitawaki T', 'Ueda M', 'Kadowaki N', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism/virology', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/virology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasma Cells/*metabolism/virology', 'Viral Load']",,2004/05/19 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/19 05:00'],"['2004/05/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04956.x [doi]', 'BJH4956 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 Jun;125(5):568-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04956.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the functions of E2A-HLF and E4BP4 in cell survival, a tetracycline-inducible system was established in Baf-3 cells to express E4BP4 or E2A-HLF. Upon IL-3 withdrawal, expression of E2A-HLF conferred resistance to apoptosis whereas overexpression of E4BP4 did not. E4BP4 and E2A-HLF both recognized the same DNA sequence in reporter gene assays, but had opposite effects on transcription. E2A-HLF acts as a transcriptional activator and E4BP4 as a transcriptional repressor. Furthermore, E4BP4 is a downstream transcriptional target of E2A-HLF.

This idea is supported by analysis of gene-knockout mice, which uncovered crucial roles of several transcription factors in normal hematopoiesis, and of individuals with leukemia, in whom transcription factors are frequently downregulated or mutated. However, analysis of knockout animals has not shown a direct link between abrogated transcription factors and the pathogenesis of AML. Sfpi1, encoding the lineage-specific transcription factor PU.1, is indispensable for normal myeloid and lymphoid development. We found that mice carrying hypomorphic Sfpi1 alleles that reduce PU.1 expression to 20% of normal levels, unlike mice carrying homo- or heterozygous deletions of Sfpi1, developed AML. Unlike complete or 50% loss, 80% loss of PU.1 induced a precancerous state characterized by accumulation of an abnormal precursor pool retaining responsiveness to G-CSF with disruption of M- and GM-CSF pathways.

Furthermore, selective effects of this individual isomers of CLA on desaturation steps involved in the biosynthesis of PUFAs associated with cell growth were investigated. CLA isomers supplemented in the culture medium was readily incorporated and esterified into phospholipids (PLs) in the four cell lines in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The incorporation of the specific CLA isomers in PLs was similar to LA. All four incubating leukemia cells (40 microM CLA for 48 h) showed very high cellular CLA content in PLs (range: 32-63 g FA/100 g total phospholipid fatty acid) affected by the nature of CLA and the cell type. Supplementation with CLA or LA altered also cell membrane composition by n-6 PUFA synthesis. Accordingly, CLA metabolism interferes with LA metabolism. We were able to show that CLA isomers are converted by the leukemia cells of the same metabolic pathway into conjugated diene fatty acids (CDFAs) as LA into non-conjugated PUFAs. In this view, the gas chromatography-flame ionization detector detection of major CDFAs (CD-18:3, CD-20:2 and CD-20:3) in cell membrane of CLA-treated cultures resulted from successive Delta6-desaturation, elongation and Delta5-desaturation of CLA isomers. However, in comparison to LA, relatively lower amounts of elongation and/or desaturation metabolites were detected for CLA(9c,11t), and only minor amounts or trace CDFAs were observed for CLA(9c,11c). Furthermore, CLA(9c,11t) revealed only very low levels of CD-20:4 FA and no CLA(9c,11c)-conversion could be detected. The metabolization of CLA indicated that CLA(9c,11c)<CLA(9c,11t) were a poorer substrates in compared to LA for the Delta5,6-desaturation/elongation in REH, CCRF-CEM and U937 cells or for the Delta5-desaturation/elongation in the K562 cells. CLA(9c,11t) suppresses Delta6-desaturation in CCRF-CEM, REH, and U937 cells (43.5, 54.6 and 58.8% Delta6-inhibition, respectively) and as well Delta9-desaturation in all four cell lines (Delta9-inhibition; 47.1, 33.9, 29.8 and 25.9% for CCRF-CEM, REH, K562 and U937 cells, respectively). However, CLA(9c,11c) does not inhibit or only slightly affected these desaturations. CLA(9c,11t) isomer was found as an Delta6-desaturase inhibitor with a dose-dependent relationship between inhibition of Delta6-desaturase activity and decreases in cell growth. The growth inhibitory effects of CLA (with 30-120 microM) on leukemia cells were dependent upon the type and concentration of CLA isomers present. CLA-supplemented cells with low concentrations (<60 microM) were not sufficient to impair cell proliferation. Nevertheless, higher amounts of CLAs (>60 microM) had the CLA type dependent antiproliferative effects. Thus, the 9cis,11trans- and the 9cis,11cis-CLA isomers regulate cell growth and survival in different leukemia cell types through their existence alone and/or by their inhibitory effects of desaturase activity.",,"['Agatha, Gerhard', 'Voigt, Astrid', 'Kauf, Eberhard', 'Zintl, Felix']","['Agatha G', 'Voigt A', 'Kauf E', 'Zintl F']","[""Friedrich-Schiller-University of Jena, Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Kochstrasse 2, D-07745 Jena, Germany. gerhard.agatha@med.uni-jena.de""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Linoleic Acids, Conjugated)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Chromatography, Gas', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Linoleic Acid/pharmacology', 'Linoleic Acids, Conjugated/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",,2004/05/18 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/05/18 05:00'],"['2003/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/20 00:00 [revised]', '2003/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.canlet.2003.11.022 [doi]', 'S0304383503008127 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2004 Jun 8;209(1):87-103. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2003.11.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we describe work carried on subline of acute monocytic leukemia, THP-1 resistant to calcitriol induced differentiation.

The resulting fusion of the BCR and ABL1 loci produces the constitutively active BCR/ABL1 tyrosine kinase. A wide range of signal transduction molecules are activated by BCR/ABL1, including MYC, PI-3 kinase, and different STAT molecules. In contrast, relatively few genes are known to be regulated by BCR/ABL1 at the level of transcription. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an effort to better understand the transcriptional program activated by BCR/ABL1, we used cDNA microarrays to evaluate the relative expression of approximately 6450 human genes in U937 myelomonocytic cells expressing P210 BCR/ABL1 via a tetracycline-inducible promoter. RESULTS: We confirmed the previously reported up-regulation of the PIM1 and JUN oncogenes by BCR/ABL1. In addition, we identified 59 more genes up-regulated by BCR/ABL1. Interestingly, roughly one third of these were genes previously reported to be interferon (IFN)-responsive, including the OAS1, IFIT1, IFI16, ISGF3G, and STAT1 genes. An additional seven BCR/ABL1-regulated genes were found to be IFN-responsive in U937 cells. The expression profile also included genes encoding transcription factors, kinases, and signal transduction molecules, as well as genes regulating cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and cell adhesion, features previously suggested to be affected by BCR/ABL1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients received two cycles of induction paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) on Day 1) and topotecan (1 mg/m(2) on Days 1-5) with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support, followed by three cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve = 5 on Day 1) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2) on Days 1-3). TRT (70 Gy, 2 Gy/fx/7 weeks) was initiated with the first cycle of carboplatin and etoposide. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was offered to patients achieving a complete response or good partial response. RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients (57 of 63) proceeded to protocol TRT. There was one treatment-related fatality. Nonhematologic Grade 3/4 toxicities affecting more than 10% of patients, during or after TRT, were dysphagia (16%/5%) and febrile neutropenia (12%/4%).

We now identify faulty expression of a specific mediator of transcriptional repression in a solid tumor. Loss of the adenomatosis polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor induces HDAC2 expression depending on the Wnt pathway and c-Myc.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel Rab7-like GTPase, which shares highest homology with Rab7 and thus is designated as Rab7b. Northern blot analysis shows that Rab7b mRNA is expressed in human heart, placenta, lung, skeletal muscle, and peripheral blood leukocyte. RT-PCR or Western blot analysis of Rab7b expression shows that Rab7b is selectively expressed in monocytes, monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs), and promyeloid or monocytic leukemia cell lines. In the peripheral blood, Rab7b is specifically detected in CD14(+) cells, but not in CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+) or CD56(+) cells. When immature DCs are matured with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Rab7b expression is gradually downregulated, while Rab7b is upregulated when monocytes are activated by LPS treatments. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) HL-60 and NB4 cell lines, Rab7b expression is upregulated after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced monocytic differentiation. By immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that Rab7b is associated with lysosomal organelles.

METHODS: There were 210 cases of childhood AL, of which 130 cases were male and 80 were female with a mean age of 9 years old. Using a panel of 27 fluorochrome directly labeled monoclonal antibodies, 210 samples from the patients were analyzed with CD45/SSC double parameters and multi-color flow cytometry to determine the expression of CD19. RESULTS: In the 93 cases of B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the positive rate (98.9%, 92/93) of CD19 was significantly higher than that of the other B cell related antigens, such as CD10 (88.2%, 82/93, P = 0.003), CD20 (24.7%, 23/93, P = 0.001) and CD22 (60.2%, 56/93, P = 0.001). CD19 was expressed on all 8 cases of B/myeloid (My) hybrid acute leukemia (HAL) and 1 case of B/T HAL, but was not expressed on all 24 cases of T lineage leukemia and 5 cases of T/My HAL. In the 79 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), only 5 (6.3%) cases expressed CD19. The positive rate (6.3%) of CD19 on AML was significantly lower than that on B lineage ALL (98.9%, P = 0.001). The percentage of CD19 positive cells in B/My HAL (41.6% - 88.7% with a mean of 73.8%) was significant higher than that in CD19(+)-AML (21.4% - 50.4% with a mean of 24.2%; Run Sum test, P = 0.0084). Of the 210 cases, 102 were B lineage related AL including B lineage ALL, B/My HAL and B/T HAL. In B lineage related AL, the sensitivity and the specificity of CD19 was 99.0% (101/102) and 95.4% (13/108) while the positive predictive and the negative predictive values to B lineage were 95.3% (101/106) and 99.0% (103/104), respectively. Using CD19(+) as a single reagent to diagnose B lineage, the false positive rate was 4.6% (5/108) and the false negative rate was 1.0% (1/102) with a general diagnosis index (GDI) of 94.4% [GDI = 1-(false positive rate + false negative rate)]. CONCLUSION: CD19 is continuously and stably expressed on all stages of B lineage differentiation. It is a reliable cell membrane marker for diagnosing B lineage ALL and an ideal target for antibody-targeting treatment of leukemia as well; the expression degree of CD19 can be used to distinguish B/My HAL from CD19(+)-AML; CD19 didn't express on normal myeloid cells but did on some AML cells. Therefore it can be used to detect the minimal residual disease.",,"['Chen, Ying-hu', 'Tang, Yong-min', 'Shen, Hong-qiang', 'Song, Hua', 'Yang, Shi-long', 'Shi, Shu-wen', 'Qian, Bai-qin', 'Xu, Wei-qun', 'Ning, Bo-tao']","['Chen YH', 'Tang YM', 'Shen HQ', 'Song H', 'Yang SL', 'Shi SW', 'Qian BQ', 'Xu WQ', 'Ning BT']","[""Children's Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,0417427,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*immunology']",,2004/05/18 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/18 05:00'],"['2004/05/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Er Ke Za Zhi. 2004 Mar;42(3):188-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H460 lung carcinoma cells and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal), respectively. Transduced H460 cells were administered to nude mice by either intravenous or subcutaneous injection and MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of such mice to induce primary tumor and metastatic lung tumor formation. High-level EGFP expression was maintained in transduced H460 cells in metastatic lung nodules for up to 6 weeks and transgene expression in vitro persisted for at least 23 days after retrieval of EGFP-positive H460 cells from the lungs of tumor-bearing mice and subsequent cultivation in vitro. Likewise, beta-Gal expression levels in metastatic MDA-MB-231 cells in lungs remained high for up to 11 weeks. Southern blot analyses carried out with DNA from lung nodules showed that proviral DNAs in H460 cells were maintained stably over many cell generations and during subsequent reimplantation in vivo.

As both hormones can cause proliferation of normal and malignant cells, the possibility that GH therapy may induce cancer, increase the risk of tumour recurrence in those previously treated for a malignancy, or increase the risk of cancer in those with a predisposition, has resulted in concerns over its use. There are theoretical and epidemiological reasons that suggest GH and IGF-I may be important in tumour formation and proliferation. Malignant tumours have been induced in animals exposed to supraphysiological doses of GH, whereas hypophysectomy appears to protect animals from carcinogen-induced neoplasms. In vitro, proliferation and transformation of normal haemopoetic and leukaemic cells occurs with supraphysiological doses of GH, but not with physiological levels. IGF, IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) and IGFBP proteases influence the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro; however, GH is probably not involved in this process. Epidemiological studies have suggested an association between levels of IGF-I and cancer, and an inverse relationship between IGFBP-3 and cancer; however, these associations have been inconsistent. A number of studies have been undertaken to determine the risk of the development of cancer in children treated with GH, either de novo, or the recurrence of cancer in those previously treated for a malignancy. Despite early concerns following a report of a cluster of cases of leukaemia in recipients of GH, there appears to be no increased risk for the development of leukaemia in those treated with GH unless there is an underlying predisposition. Even in children with a primary diagnosis of cancer, subsequent GH use does not appear to increase the risk of tumour recurrence. However, a recent follow-up of pituitary GH recipients has suggested an increase in colorectal cancer. In addition, follow-up of oncology patients has suggested an increase in second neoplasms in those who also received GH therapy.

Despite advances in anti-fungal therapy and surgical techniques, the morbidity and mortality remain high. Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been proposed based on pathophysiology and several favorable clinical reports. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A chart review of mucormycosis patients referred to the HBO service was performed. Also an electronic search in Medline of relevant literature was undertaken. RESULTS: Five mucormycosis patients referred for HBO had complete charts available. Four had craniofacial involvement and one had left upper extremity involvement. The predisposing diseases were leukemia (n = 3), diabetes mellitus plus sarcoidosis (n = 1), and trauma (n = 1). All patients were managed with amphotericin B, surgical debridement and HBO.

Differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue is particularly difficult as there is a considerable overlap in histological presentation. We report a case of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia with involvement of the peripheral blood, bone marrow and stomach. Serum chemistry revealed an IgM of 5.4 g/dl, but Bence-Jones protein in urine was negative. Abnormal lymphoid cells were detected in both blood and the bone marrow. Flow cytometry of the bone marrow aspirate showed that majority of cells were CD20(+), CD38(+), expressing immunoglobulin lambda light chain, but CD5(-) and CD10(-). Gastric biopsies revealed infiltration of the gastric mucosa by small lymphoid cells showing plasmacytoid differentiation and occasional Dutcher bodies. Lymphoepithelial lesions and Helicobacter pylori were not seen. Thus, the differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma was raised. To resolve this, we performed BCL10 immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the API2-MALT1 fusion transcript of t(11;18)(q21;q21). Both bone marrow and gastric biopsies showed strong BCL10 nuclear staining, similar to that seen in t(1;14)(p22;q32) positive mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, but absence of the API2-MALT1 fusion transcript. To further ascertain whether the detection of t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(11;18)(q21;q21) can be reliably used for the differential diagnosis between lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, we screened for these translocations by BCL10 immunohistochemistry in 58 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas and RT-PCR for t(11;18)(q21;q21) in 40 lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, respectively. None of the lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas studied harbored these translocations.

Tel-Abl Y314F and Deltae5 were unable to transform fibroblasts to anchorage-independent growth and were defective for B-lymphoid transformation in vitro and lymphoid leukemogenesis in vivo. Previously, we demonstrated that full-length Tel-Abl induced two distinct myeloproliferative diseases in mice: CML-like leukemia similar to that induced by Bcr-Abl and a novel syndrome of small-bowel myeloid infiltration endotoxemia and hepatic and renal failure.

In contrast, the LPA-stimulated rho response in PC-3 cells is dependent on PDZrhoGEF expression. Suppression of p115rhoGEF had no effect.

The present study was designed to investigate whether leptin can directly regulate the expression of LIF and its receptor (LIF-R) in human endometrial cells and/or whether leptin-induced effects are linked to, or regulated in part by IL-1 signaling. Primary endometrial cells and endometrial epithelial cell lines (HES and Ishikawa cells) were cultured for 24-48 h in a medium containing insulin (5 microg/ml) and leptin (3, 10, and 62 nm) or IL-1beta (0.6, 3, and 10 nm) in the presence or absence of cytokines and/or receptor antagonists. The endpoints included phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the relative levels of LIF, LIF-R, IL-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1R tI) as determined by ELISA or Western blotting techniques. Leptin treatment increases the level of phosphorylated STAT3, LIF-R, and LIF. Leptin also increases the levels of IL-1 ligand, receptor, and antagonist as was previously reported. Blockade of OB-R with antibodies or with a specific OB-R inhibitor (leptin peptide antagonist-2) abrogated leptin-induced effects, suggesting that leptin binding to its receptor activates Janus kinase 2/STAT3 signaling. Treatment of endometrial cells with IL-1beta also results in elevated levels of LIF-R. Interestingly, the inhibition of IL-1R tI with a specific antibody or with IL-1Ra negatively affects both leptin-induced and IL-1-induced effects on LIF-R levels. Abnormal endometrial LIF expression has been associated with human infertility and leptin has profound effects on the levels of LIF, IL-1, and their cognate receptors in vitro. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that leptin's role in vivo could include the regulation of other key cytokines to be fundamental to endometrial receptivity during implantation (i.e. LIF and IL-1).",,"['Gonzalez, R R', 'Rueda, B R', 'Ramos, M P', 'Littell, R D', 'Glasser, S', 'Leavis, P C']","['Gonzalez RR', 'Rueda BR', 'Ramos MP', 'Littell RD', 'Glasser S', 'Leavis PC']","['Boston Biomedical Research Institute, Watertown, Massachusetts 02472, USA. gonzalezr@bbri.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Endometrium/chemistry/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/analysis', 'Interleukin-6/*analysis', 'Leptin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/analysis']",,2004/05/15 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/05/15 05:00'],"['2004/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/en.2004-0383 [doi]', 'en.2004-0383 [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2004 Aug;145(8):3850-7. doi: 10.1210/en.2004-0383.

To determine its carcinogenic activity, long-term administration of APNH was investigated in 93 male and 90 female F344 rats. Rats were fed diets containing 0, 20 or 40 p.p.m. from 7 weeks of age. All animals were killed after 85 weeks treatment and necropsy was performed. Hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) were induced at incidences of 10 and 79% in male rats fed 20 and 40 p.p.m. APNH, and 34% in female rats fed 40 p.p.m. of APNH, respectively. In addition, colon adenocarcinomas were found at incidences of 3 and 9% in male rats, and 4 and 13% in female rats fed 20 and 40 p.p.m. of APNH, respectively. Other tumors, including thyroid carcinomas and mononuclear cell leukemia, were also seen in rats fed APNH. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis revealed beta-catenin gene mutations in 24% of HCCs and K-ras, beta-catenin and Apc gene mutations were found in 22, 44 and 33% of colon cancers induced by APNH, respectively. Most mutations occurred at G:C base pairs. beta-Catenin protein accumulations in the nucleus and cytoplasm were also revealed in both liver and colon tumors. Thus, APNH induced liver and colon cancers with K-ras, beta-catenin and Apc gene mutations in F344 rats.",,"['Kawamori, Toshihiko', 'Totsuka, Yukari', 'Uchiya, Naoaki', 'Kitamura, Tomohiro', 'Shibata, Hideyuki', 'Sugimura, Takashi', 'Wakabayashi, Keiji']","['Kawamori T', 'Totsuka Y', 'Uchiya N', 'Kitamura T', 'Shibata H', 'Sugimura T', 'Wakabayashi K']","['Cancer Prevention Basic Research Project, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Tsukiji 5-chome, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Carbolines)', '0 (Ctnnb1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '4FHH5G48T7 (Harmine)', '94HMA1I78O (norharman)', ""NMC04J95OA (9-(4'-aminophenyl)-9H-pyrido(3,4-b)indole)"", 'SIR7XX2F1K (aniline)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/chemically induced', 'Aniline Compounds/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carbolines', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*chemically induced', 'Colon/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, APC/physiology', 'Genes, ras/physiology', 'Harmine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Indoles/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Pyridines/*toxicity', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'beta Catenin']",,2004/05/15 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/05/15 05:00'],"['2004/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/carcin/bgh189 [doi]', 'bgh189 [pii]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2004 Oct;25(10):1967-72. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgh189.

The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway is a post-replicational DNA repair system that maintains genetic stability by repairing mismatched bases and insertion/deletion loops mistakenly incorporated during DNA replication. Deficiencies in proteins pivotal to this pathway result in a higher mutation rate, particularly at regions of microsatellite DNA. We have investigated the proficiency of the MMR pathway in clinical samples and myeloma cell lines. Microsatellite analysis showed instability at one or more of nine loci examined in 15 from 92 patients: 7.7% of MGUS/SMM, 20.7% of MM/plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) and 12.5% of relapsed MM/PCL. An in vitro heteroduplex G/T repair assay found reduced repair in two cell lines, JIM1 and JIM3, and in two of four PCL cases and was associated with aberrant expression of at least one mismatch repair protein.

In APL, expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha) fusion protein, owing to the t(15; 17) reciprocal translocation, leads to a block in the promyelocytic stage of differentiation. Here, we studied molecular mechanisms involved in ATRA-induced growth inhibition and myeloid cell differentiation in APL. By employing comprehensive high-throughput proteomic methods of 2-dimensional (2-D) gel electrophoresis and amino acid-coded mass tagging coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry, we systematically identified a total of 59 differentially expressed proteins that were consistently modulated in response to ATRA treatment. The data revealed significant down-regulation of eukaryotic initiation and elongation factors, initiation factor 2 (IF2), eukaryotic initiation factor 4AI (eIF4AI), eIF4G, eIF5, eIF6, eukaryotic elongation factor 1A-1 (eEF1A-1), EF-1-delta, eEF1gamma, 14-3-3epsilon, and 14-3-3zeta/delta (P <.05). The translational inhibitor DAP5/p97/NAT1 (death-associated protein 5) and PML isoform-1 were found to be up-regulated (P <.05). Additionally, the down-regulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) C1/C2, UP2, K, and F; small nuclear RNPs (snRNPs) D3 and E; nucleoprotein tumor potentiating region (TPR); and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) were found (P <.05); these were found to function in pre-mRNA processing, splicing, and export events.

Twenty-one of 40 ALL tumors responded normally to IR, exhibiting accumulation of p53 and p21 proteins and cleavage of caspases 3, 7, and 9 and of PARP1. Nineteen tumors exhibited apoptotic resistance and lacked PARP1 and caspase cleavage; although 15 of these tumors had normal accumulation of p53 and p21 proteins, examples exhibited abnormal expression of TRAF5, TRAF6, and cIAP1 after IR, suggesting increased NF-kappaB prosurvival signaling as the mechanism of apoptotic resistance. The presence of a hyperactive PARP1 mutation in one tumor was consistent with such increased NF-kappaB activity. PARP1 inhibition restored p53-dependent apoptosis after IR in these leukemias by reducing NF-kappaB DNA binding and transcriptional activity. In the remaining 4 ALL tumors, apoptotic resistance was associated with a TP53 mutation or with defective activation of p53.

Efficient engraftment of donor cells generally requires ablation of the host hematopoietic system. The zebrafish has recently emerged as a developmental and genetic system to study hematopoiesis. To enable the study of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology, immune cell function, and leukemogenesis in zebrafish, we have developed hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) into adult recipient animals conditioned by gamma irradiation. Dose-response experiments showed that the minimum lethal dose (MLD) of 40 Gy led to the specific ablation of hematolymphoid cells and death by 14 days after irradiation. Sublethal irradiation doses of 20 Gy predominantly ablated lymphocytes and permitted transplantation of a lethal T-cell leukemia. Finally, transplantation of hematopoietic cells carrying transgenes yielding red fluorescent erythrocytes and green fluorescent leukocytes showed that HCT is sufficient to rescue the MLD, that recipient hematolymphoid tissues were repopulated by donor-derived cells, and that donor blood cell lineages can be independently visualized in living recipients.

The effect of imatinib on the expression of PI-3K pathway proteins was investigated by kinase assays and Western blotting; PI-3K was inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, Jak2 by AG490 and farnesylation by FTI II; progenitor cell proliferation (self-renewal) was measured by growing myeloid colonies in vitro, then replating them to observe secondary colony formation. Suppression of p210(Bcr-Abl) with imatinib indirectly suppressed the activity of PI-3K and its downstream targets (Erk, Akt and p70S6 kinase), thereby implicating the PI-3K pathway in p210(Bcr-Abl)-mediated signalling in primary CML progenitor cells. The PI-3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002 reproduced the differential effects of imatinib on normal and CML progenitor cell proliferation in vitro by increasing normal cell (P = 0.001) and reducing CML cell proliferation (P = 0.0003). This differential effect was attributable to dysregulated signalling by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in CML. The responses of individual patient's cells to wortmannin correlated with their responses to imatinib (P = 0.004) but not their responses to AG490 (Jak2 kinase inhibitor) or FTI II (farnesyltransferase inhibitor). Individual responses to wortmannin also correlated with responses to interferon alpha (IFNalpha) (P = 0.016). Imatinib-resistant K562 cells were sensitive to LY294002. Inhibition of the PI-3K pathway may be common to imatinib and IFNalpha and reflect dysregulated cytokine signalling. As imatinib-resistant cells remained sensitive to wortmannin and LY294002, targeting the PI-3K pathway may provide an alternative therapy for imatinib-resistant patients.",,"['Marley, S B', 'Lewis, J L', 'Schneider, H', 'Rudd, C E', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Marley SB', 'Lewis JL', 'Schneider H', 'Rudd CE', 'Gordon MY']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Androstadienes/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-gamma/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Morpholines/therapeutic use', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/analysis', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tyrphostins/therapeutic use', 'Wortmannin']",,2004/05/15 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/05/15 05:00'],"['2004/05/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04933.x [doi]', 'BJH4933 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2004 May;125(4):500-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2004.04933.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GvHD was 37.4% for PBSCT and 32.0% for BMT. The cumulative incidence of extensive chronic GvHD at 1 year was significantly higher after PBSCT than BMT (42% vs. 27%; P < 0.01). The organ involvement patterns of GvHD were different between the two groups. By multivariate analyses, the incidence of chronic GvHD was significantly increased in PBSCT, whereas the stem cell source did not affect the incidence of acute GvHD, transplant-related mortality, relapse or survival.

However, the advent of the targeted molecule imatinib mesylate (formerly STI-571) against the bcr-abl chimeric protein in the disease has brought the issue of managing newly diagnosed CML patients, especially those with available donors, to the crossroads. Although the curative potential of this agent remains unknown, it can produce complete cytogenetic response in > 60% of newly diagnosed patients. METHODS: From May 1991 to October 2002, a total of 55 Ph+ CML-chronic phase patients received oral busulphan 16 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg i.v. as a conditioning regimen. All patients received human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor haematopoletic stem cells--bone marrow in 41 patients (74.5%) and peripheral blood stem cells in 14 (25.4%). Post-transplant prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease included a short course of methotrexate (on days +1, +3, +6 and +11) and cyclosporin till day +180 in 38 patients (69.1%), while a combination of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone was used in the remaining 17 (29%). RESULTS: At a median follow up of 48 months (10-144 months), 26 patients (47.3%) are alive. Early mortality (100-day) occurred in 17 patients (30.9%). Acute graft-versus-host disease developed in 37 patients (67.3%), and was grade IV in 6 of them. Chronic graft-versus-host disease developed in 17 patients (30.9%). Relapse occurred in only 2 patients (3.6%) till date. The leukaemia-free survival is 64.3% in the peripheral stem cell group, whereas it is 41.5% in the bone marrow recipient group. CONCLUSION: Allogeneic BMT appears to result in eradication of CML and ensure disease-free survival in about half the patients.

A few in vivo experimental investigations of its efficacy in solid tumours have been done. This study was designed to explore the differentiation-inducing effect, and the possible mechanisms involved, of As2O3 on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CSNE-1 xenografts. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell CSNE-1 was established as a xenograft in nude mice. The tumour-bearing mice were treated with As2O3 at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day. To assess tumour differentiation, tumour growth was observed and histological changes were analysed under light and electron microscopy. Expression of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and cytokeratin 4 (CK4) was determined by immunohistochemistry. A PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay (TRAP-ELISA) was used to measure telomerase activity. RESULTS: The xenografts underwent differentiation. LMP 1 of the cells decreased significantly and there was a pronounced decline in telomerase activity.

Human exposure to benzene is associated with the development of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenous leukemia. Hydroquinone is genotoxic in several in vitro and in vivo test systems, inducing micronuclei (MN), sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), and chromosomal aberrations. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a superfamily of polymorphic enzymes involved in the conjugation of reactive chemical intermediates to soluble forms. These enzymes play a key role in the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous compounds, and the polymorphic genes GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 have been associated with the differential metabolism of several genotoxicants. In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms on the frequency of MN and SCE induced by hydroquinone in human lymphocytes. Lymphocytes were obtained from 15 healthy non-smoking donors, and their GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 genotypes determined. Treatment of cultures of the lymphocytes with hydroquinone significantly increased the overall frequencies of MN and SCE (P<0.0001). Individuals with the GSTM1 null genotype had a significantly higher frequency of MN compared with GSTM1-present individuals (P=0.013); in contrast, the GSTM1 genotype had no effect on hydroquinone-induced SCE frequency. The other polymorphisms did not significantly affect the frequencies of MN or SCE. These results suggest that GSTM1 is involved in the metabolic fate of hydroquinone and that polymorphisms in GSTM1 could be related to inter-individual differences in DNA damage arising from the exposure to this compound.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Silva, Maria do Ceu', 'Gaspar, Jorge', 'Duarte Silva, Isabel', 'Faber, Ana', 'Rueff, Jose']","['Silva Mdo C', 'Gaspar J', 'Duarte Silva I', 'Faber A', 'Rueff J']","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Medical Sciences, New University of Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (GSTT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)', 'EC 3.1.1.67 (fatty acyl ethyl ester synthase)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*genetics', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/drug effects', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Portugal', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/drug effects']",,2004/05/14 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2004/05/14 05:00'],"['2004/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/em.20015 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 2004;43(4):258-64. doi: 10.1002/em.20015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low response in epidemiological studies may decrease the acceptance of the results. Response, however, is not identical with the quality of a study. In the first part of this paper various definitions of response (contact, cooperation, response, recruitment proportions) are introduced and discussed in the context of different study designs with reference to practical examples. A population-based survey such as the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) investigates the distribution of risk factors and health-related endpoints. Surveys should yield representative results which can be generalised to apply to the entire population (external validity). This study design usually requires large participitation proportions. In a prospective cohort study such as the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) the emphasis is on internal validity. A stable study population willing to participate in regular follow-ups is a primary recruitment goal. If the response in a case-control study such as the Northern Germany Leukaemia and Lymphoma Study (NLL) is low, the priority is to achieve approximately equal response proportions for cases and controls. Simultaneous public relation and media activities can improve participitation in a study.

Moreover, neoplastic lymphocytes in the epidermal Pautrier abscesses associated with early stages of MF did not express activated STAT3. To address the role of STAT3 in survival/apoptosis, CTCL tumor cells from an advanced skin tumor were transfected with either wild-type STAT3 (STAT3wt) or dominant-negative STAT3 (STAT3D). Forced inducible expression of STAT3D triggered a significant increase in tumor cells undergoing apoptosis, whereas forced expression of STAT3wt or empty vector had no effect. In conclusion, a profound in vivo activation of STAT3 is observed in MF tumors but not in the early stages of MF. Moreover, STAT3 protects tumor cells from apoptosis in vitro.

METHOD: A nine-year prospective cohort study was carried out on 1,212,906 Koreans, 30-95 years of age. The study population includes participants in a national insurance program, who completed a questionnaire on smoking and other risk factors. The main outcome measures were death from cancer and cancer incidence, obtained through record linkage. At baseline, 472,970 men (57.0%) and 20,548 (5.4%) women were current cigarette smokers. RESULTS: In multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, controlling for age, current smoking among men increased the risks of mortality for cancer of the lung (relative risk (RR), 4.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-5.3) and other cancers, including larynx, bile duct, esophagus, liver, stomach, pancreas, bladder, and also leukemia. Current smoking among women increased the risk of lung cancer mortality (RR = 2.5, 95% CI = 2.0-3.1). Similar results were found for incidence among men and women.

This type of resistance is often acquired in response to drug exposure; however, the mechanisms of this adverse reaction are complex and elusive. Here, we have studied acquired resistance to Adriamycin, Vinca alkaloids, and etoposide in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, KB-3-1 epidermoid carcinoma cells, and other cancer cell lines to determine if there is an association between expression of glucosylceramide synthase, the enzyme catalyzing ceramide glycosylation to glucosylceramide, and the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype. This work shows that glucosylceramide levels increase concomitantly with increased drug resistance in the KB-3-1 vinblastine-resistant sublines KB-V.01, KB-V.1, and KB-V1 (listed in order of increasing MDR). The levels of glucosylceramide synthase mRNA, glucosylceramide synthase protein, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) also increased in parallel. Increased glucosylceramide levels were also present in Adriamycin-resistant KB-3-1 sublines KB-A.05 and KB-A1. In breast cancer, detailed analysis of MCF-7 wild-type and MCF-7-AdrR cells (Adriamycin-resistant) demonstrated enhanced glucosylceramide synthase message and protein, P-gp message and protein, and high levels of glucosylceramide in resistant cells. Similar results were seen in vincristine-resistant leukemia, etoposide-resistant melanoma, and Adriamycin-resistant colon cancer cell lines. Cell-free glucosylceramide synthase activity was higher in lysates obtained from drug-resistant cells. Lastly, glucosylceramide synthase promoter activity was 15-fold higher in MCF-7-AdrR compared with MCF-7 cells. We conclude that selection pressure for resistance to natural product chemotherapy drugs selects for enhanced ceramide metabolism through glucosylceramide synthase in addition to enhanced P-gp expression. A possible connection between glucosylceramide synthase and P-gp in drug resistance biology is suggested.",,"['Gouaze, Valerie', 'Yu, Jing Y', 'Bleicher, Richard J', 'Han, Tie-Yan', 'Liu, Yong-Yu', 'Wang, Hongtao', 'Gottesman, Michael M', 'Bitterman, Arie', 'Giuliano, Armando E', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Gouaze V', 'Yu JY', 'Bleicher RJ', 'Han TY', 'Liu YY', 'Wang H', 'Gottesman MM', 'Bitterman A', 'Giuliano AE', 'Cabot MC']","[""John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center, Santa Monica, California 90404, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Glucosylceramides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.80 (ceramide glucosyltransferase)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Biological Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Glucosylceramides/metabolism', 'Glucosyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",,2004/05/14 05:00,2005/01/12 09:00,['2004/05/14 05:00'],"['2004/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/12 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2004 May;3(5):633-9.,,,['CA95339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same reaction on viruses bearing alpha-Gal may serve as a barrier to zoonotic infection. Expressing human complement regulatory proteins or knocking out alpha-Gal epitopes in pig in order to overcome HAR may therefore pose an increased risk in xenotransplantation with regard to zoonosis. We investigated whether amphotropic murine leukemia virus, porcine endogenous retrovirus, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) budding from primary transgenic pig aortic endothelial (TgPAE) cells expressing human CD55 (hCD55 or hDAF) was protected from human-complement-mediated inactivation. VSV propagated through the ST-IOWA pig cell line, in which alpha-galactosyl-transferase genes were disrupted (Gal null), was also tested for sensitivity to human complement. The TgPAE cells were positive for hCD55, and all pig cells except the Gal-null ST-IOWA expressed alpha-Gal epitopes. Through antibody binding, we were able to demonstrate the incorporation of hCD55 onto VSV particles. Viruses harvested from TgPAE cells were relatively resistant to complement-mediated inactivation by the three sources of human sera tested. Additionally, VSV from Gal-null pig cells was resistant to human complement inactivation.

An aspartic acid-to-lysine change at position 84 (D84K) of ecotropic Moloney MLV Env abolishes virus binding and infection. We recently identified lysine 234 (rK234) in mATRC1 as a residue that influences virus binding and infection. Here we show that D84K virus infection increased 3,000-fold on cells expressing receptor with an rK234A change and 100,000-fold on cells expressing an rK234D change. The stronger complementation of D84K virus infection by rK234D than by the rK234A receptor suggests that although the major reason for loss of infection of D84K and D84R virus is due to steric hindrance and charge repulsion, the loss of an interaction of D84 with receptor appears to contribute as well. Taken together, these results indicate that D84 is very close to rK234 of mATRC1 in the bound complex and there is likely an interaction between them.

Since Nef is known to interact with proteins involved in actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, we tested the possibility that Nef may enhance HIV infectivity via a mechanism that involves the actin cytoskeleton. We find that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton complements the Nef infectivity defect. The ability of disruption of the actin cytoskeleton to complement the Nef defect was specific to envelopes that fuse at the cell surface, including a variety of HIV envelopes and the murine leukemia virus amphotropic envelope. In contrast, the infectivity of HIV virions pseudotyped to enter cells via endocytosis, which is known to complement the HIV Nef infectivity defect and can naturally penetrate the cortical actin barrier, was not altered by actin cytoskeleton disruption.

A chimeric HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in which the MA and CA of HIV-1 are replaced with the MA, p12, and CA encoding sequences from murine leukemia virus (MLV) loses the ability to efficiently infect nondividing cells. Analysis of the accumulation of two-long-terminal-repeat circles implies that the impairment of nuclear transport of preintegration complexes is responsible for the restricted infection of this chimeric virus in nondividing cells.

PTAP-type L domains act by recruiting the ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for transport I) component Tsg101, and YPXL/LXXLF-type L domains recruit AIP-1/ALIX, both of which are class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) factors, normally required for the generation of vesicles within endosomes. The binding cofactors for PPXY-type L domains have not been unambiguously resolved but may include Nedd4-like ubiquitin ligases. Largely because they act as autonomous binding sites for host factors, L domains are generally transferable and active in a context-independent manner. Ebola virus matrix protein (EbVP40) contains two overlapping L-domain motifs within the sequence ILPTAPPEYMEA. Here, we show that both motifs are required for efficient EbVP40 budding. However, upon transplantation into two different retroviral contexts, the relative contributions of the PTAP and PPEY motifs differ markedly. In a murine leukemia virus carrying the EbVP40 sequence, both motifs contributed to overall L domain activity, and budding proceeded in a partly Tsg101-independent manner. Conversely, when transplanted into the context of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), EbVP40 L-domain activity was entirely due to a PTAP-Tsg101 interaction. In fact, a number of PPXY-type L domains were inactive in the context of HIV-1. Surprisingly, PTAP and YPXL-type L domains that simulated HIV-1 budding reduced the amount of ubiquitin conjugated to Gag, while inactive PPXY-type L domains increased Gag ubiquitination. These observations suggest that active L domains recruit deubiquitinating enzymes as a consequence of class E VPS factor recruitment. Moreover, context-dependent L-domain function may reflect distinct requirements for host functions during the morphogenesis of different viral particles or the underlying presence of additional, as yet undiscovered L domains.",,"['Martin-Serrano, Juan', 'Perez-Caballero, David', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Martin-Serrano J', 'Perez-Caballero D', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, 455 First Ave., New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '0 (VP40 protein, virus)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ebolavirus/*chemistry', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*chemistry', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*chemistry', '*Virus Assembly']",,2004/05/14 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/05/14 05:00'],"['2004/05/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/05/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/JVI.78.11.5554-5563.2004 [doi]', '78/11/5554 [pii]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2004 Jun;78(11):5554-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.78.11.5554-5563.2004.,,,"['R01 AI050111/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI50111/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI52774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC415830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Morphologic changes were observed under light microscope with Wright-Giemsa staining, fluorescence microscope with Hoechst 33,258 staining and electron microscope. Alteration of cell cycle of different dose treating groups at the fourth day and 0.8 mg.mL-1 treatment group at the first, second, third, fourth day was analyzed by Flow cytometry. DNA ladder was detected with gel electrophoresis. RESULT: From the third day after treatment of matrine, typical apoptosis features of cells were observed under light microscope and electron microscope in all test groups, and the features were more prominent with the time prolonging. At fourth day, flow cytometry analysis showed that there were sub-G1 peaks in all groups. From 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 to 0.8 g.L-1 treatment groups, the rate of apoptotic cells to total cells were 3.1%, 2. 5%, 13.3%, 40.4%, 48.6%, respectively, and what in the control group was 1.4%; the rate of S phase cells to total cells was 28.9%, 26.1%, 27.7%, 0.9%, 14.2%, what in the control group was 30.4%; the rate of G1 phase cells to total cells was 63. 2%, 67.5%, 68.1%, 75.2%, 83.6%, what in the control group was 41.8%; From the first, second, third to fourth day, the rate of apoptotic cells to total cells of 0.8 mg.mL-1 treatment group were 3.0%, 3.7%, 9.1%, 48.6%, respectively; the rate of S phase cells to total cells was 28.6%, 17.5%, 19.1%, 14.2%; the rate of G1 phase cells to total cells were 45.5%, 77.3%, 77.2%, 83.6%.

The goal of the current study was to investigate and characterize these rare SNs. METHODS: The authors reviewed clinical and treatment data on all institutional patients age < 22 years at diagnosis of a primary CNS tumor who developed any type of SN. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 were excluded. Cumulative incidence rates were estimated, and putative risk factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The SNs investigated in the current study included 10 gliomas (42%), 5 meningiomas (21%), 2 desmoid tumors, 2 myelodysplastic syndromes, 2 basal cell carcinomas, 1 leukemia, 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and 1 thyroid carcinoma. Twenty-one patients had previously received radiotherapy, and 12 patients had received chemotherapy. The SN was related to a genetic cause in 7 patients (29%). Eleven patients died of their SNs, including 8 patients with glioma and 2 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The estimated 15-year cumulative incidence rate for malignant SNs was 4%. Children with choroid plexus tumors had an estimated 10-year cumulative incidence rate of 20.2%; 2 of those patients had germline TP53 mutations. Age </= 2 years was a significant risk factor (P = 0.016) for development of an SN only when patients with genetic conditions were included in the analysis. No significant difference in the estimated cumulative incidence of SNs was found among patients who had received different types of therapy.

METHODS: Patients with histologically proven CD20-positive RS and < 25% lymphoma and/or chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the bone marrow were treated. Patients received an imaging dose of (111)In-labeled ibritumomab tiuxetan of 1.6 mg (5.0 mCi of (111)In) intravenously. One week later, they received 0.3 or 0.4 mCi/kg of (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan.

Craniospinal irradiation (CSI) has been shown to improve survival in children who develop a CNS recurrence of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). However, to the authors' knowledge, the role of CSI in adults with a CNS recurrence of leukemia is unknown. METHODS: A retrospective review of adult patients treated with CSI for a CNS recurrence of leukemia identified 16 patients treated between 1986 and 2001. The median age of the patients was 34 years (range, 16-58 years). The diagnoses included seven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), eight patients with ALL, and one patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. All patients had achieved a complete disease remission prior to the CNS recurrence. Eleven patients had an isolated CNS recurrence and 5 patients had concurrent disease identified in the blood/bone marrow. The median dose of radiation was 24 grays (Gy) (range, 18-34.5 Gy) to the cranium and 18 Gy (range, 15-30 Gy) to the spine. The median fraction size was 1.8 Gy (range, 1.5-2.0 Gy) to the cranium and 1.5 Gy (range, 1.5-2.0 Gy) to the spine. Fifteen patients were also treated with intrathecal chemotherapy. RESULTS: One patient failed to complete radiation treatment because of disease progression. Thirteen patients achieved a complete response in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The median time to disease progression was 3 months from the first day of CSI and 7 months from CNS recurrence. The median survival was 4 months and 9 months, respectively. No CNS recurrences occurred, but there were 11 bone marrow failures, 2 patients without recurrence at > 5 years, and 3 deaths without a documented site of failure. Thirteen patients had no evidence of disease in the CSF until their death or the time of last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: CSI with or without intrathecal chemotherapy appears to be effective at eliminating leukemia in the craniospinal axis. However, the eradication of disease in the CNS was not found to be effective at preventing disease recurrence in the bone marrow, and despite improved control of disease in the CNS, adult patients with a CNS recurrence still had a poor prognosis. Furthermore, the rapidly fatal course of disease prevented an assessment of the durability of CNS response to irradiation.",['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],"['Sanders, Kevin E', 'Ha, Chul S', 'Cortes-Franco, Jorge E', 'Koller, Charles A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cox, James D']","['Sanders KE', 'Ha CS', 'Cortes-Franco JE', 'Koller CA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Cox JD']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas M.

They assessed the possibility of predicting transformation to RS in bone marrow smears by counting the percentages of prolymphocytes and large cells in 78 patients with CLL and 29 patients with lymph node biopsy-confirmed RS. RESULTS: The percentage of large cells was found to be correlated with decreasing survival in a continuous fashion (P = 0.006). It is interesting to note that patients who had > 7% large cells in the bone marrow and elevated beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-M) levels (> 5 mg/L) had a survival duration identical to that of patients with RS, and these factors together were a strong predictor of RS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CLL who had bone marrow that contained > 7% large cells and who had beta(2)-M levels > 5 mg/L had a disease that was similar to RS, and the combination of large cells and beta(2)-M can be used as a surrogate marker for RS.",['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],"['Ma, Yupo', 'Mansour, Adnan', 'Bekele, B Nebiyou', 'Zhou, Xian', 'Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis J', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Ma Y', 'Mansour A', 'Bekele BN', 'Zhou X', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles FJ', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

These diseases include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythenia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis, and others. Receptor tyrosine kinases-the platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs) and c-Kit-and their respective ligands have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MPDs. For example, a constitutively activated PDGFR fusion tyrosine kinase (FIP1L1-PDGFRA) was identified in some patients with HES, a disease characterized by sustained overproduction of eosinophils that has been classified by the World Health Organization as a chronic subtype of the MPDs. Imatinib is a selective inhibitor of PDGFRs, c-Kit, Abl and Arg protein-tyrosine kinases, as well as Bcr-Abl, the oncogenic tyrosine kinase that causes chronic myeloid leukemia. The efficacy of imatinib in treating HES, systemic mast cell disease, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia associated with PDGFRbeta fusion genes, and (to a lesser extent) PV and idiopathic myelofibrosis was reviewed from institutional experience and a review of the literature. In 3 studies that involved 11 patients with PV, 10 patients had reductions in phlebotomy with imatinib. Eight studies of 42 patients with HES indicated that 70% achieved complete hematologic remissions with imatinib. Four studies of 6 patients with MPD indicated responses with imatinib in 5 patients.

However, lack of EVI1 expression has been reported in several cases, and overexpression of EVI1 was detected in 9% of AML cases without 3q26 abnormalities. We report the molecular characterization of seven patients with inv(3)(q21q26), t(3;3)(q21;q26) or related abnormalities. EVI1 expression was detected in only one case, and thus ectopic expression of this gene failed to explain all of these cases. GATA2 (3q21) was found to be overexpressed in 5 of the 7 patients. GATA2 is highly expressed in stem cells, and its expression dramatically decreases when erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation proceeds.

It is characterized by qualitative and quantitative platelet defects and predisposition to the development of myeloid malignancies. Causal mutations have been identified in the RUNX1 gene (also known as AML1, CBFA2) in the 11 families so far analyzed. RUNX1 is a gene frequently involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, through acquired chromosome rearrangements and point mutations. We report an Italian family with three members affected with FPD/AML, two sibs and their father, who developed myelodysplastic syndromes (which in one subsequently evolved into AML). Direct sequencing and polymorphisms haplotype analysis of the region of chromosome 21 where RUNX1 is mapped demonstrated that FPD/AML in this family was not caused by any mutation of the RUNX1 gene, thus providing evidence for the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. Cytogenetic studies showed monosomy 7 in the marrow of all the three affected subjects, as well as an independent clone with trisomy 8 in the father. The importance of mutator effects in the pathogenesis of familial myeloid malignancies characterized by relevant chromosome changes, in the presence or absence of an underlying Mendelian disorder, has already been suggested. Our results and a review of the cytogenetic literature led us to postulate that mutations also causing FPD/AML may have a mutator effect that could give origin to myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemias through acquired chromosome changes.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Minelli, Antonella', 'Maserati, Emanuela', 'Rossi, Gabriele', 'Bernardo, Maria Ester', 'De Stefano, Piero', 'Cecchini, Maria Paola', 'Valli, Roberto', 'Albano, Veronica', 'Pierani, Paolo', 'Leszl, Anna', 'Sainati, Laura', 'Lo Curto, Francesco', 'Danesino, Cesare', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Pasquali, Francesco']","['Minelli A', 'Maserati E', 'Rossi G', 'Bernardo ME', 'De Stefano P', 'Cecchini MP', 'Valli R', 'Albano V', 'Pierani P', 'Leszl A', 'Sainati L', 'Lo Curto F', 'Danesino C', 'Locatelli F', 'Pasquali F']","['Biologia Generale e Genetica Medica, Universita di Pavia, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Monosomy/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Trisomy/genetics']",,2004/05/13 05:00,2004/07/28 05:00,['2004/05/13 05:00'],"['2004/05/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20030 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2004 Jul;40(3):165-71. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied the schedule-dependent toxicity of high-dose etoposide when combined with high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin (IDEA) in 138 patients with acute leukemia. Four groups of patients were studied: group I, relapse; group II, secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML); group III, de novo AML, age >60 years; and group IV, induction failure or blast crisis of myeloproliferative syndrome. Treatment for groups I-III was idarubicin 8 mg/m(2) per day days 1-3, cytarabine 2000 mg/m(2) once a day days 1-6, and etoposide 1600 mg/m(2) total dose. Group IV treatment differed by cytarabine given twice daily days 1-6. Patients were randomized to etoposide as a continuous infusion days 1-6 or as a bolus infusion over 10 h on day 7. RESULTS: Continuous infusion etoposide produced significantly more oral mucositis than bolus etoposide. In groups I-III, comparing continuous and bolus etoposide, there was a median of 3 vs 0 days of grade 2 or more oral mucositis (P<0.0001) and 13.5 vs 0 days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (P=0.0003). Group IV patients had a median 7 vs 0 days of grade 2 or more oral mucositis (P<0.01) and 21 vs 7 days of TPN (P<0.003), respectively. There were no differences in hematologic recovery, length of hospital stay, complete remission rate or overall survival between the two etoposide schedules.

Resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant has been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in animal models. The purpose of this study was to examine whether resveratrol can sensitise cancer cells to X-irradiation. The human cancer cell lines examined were HELA (cervix carcinoma), K-562 (chronic myeloid leukemia) and IM-9 (multiple myeloma). The assays that were performed following X-irradiation (doses from 0 to 8 Gy) and/or incubation in the presence of resveratrol (concentrations ranging from 0 to 200 microM), were the following: trypan blue exclusion test to determine cell viability, cell morphology after May-Grunwald Giemsa staining, DNA profile analysis by flow cytometry to assess cell cycle distribution and the presence of the sub-G1 peak. The cell lines showed different radiation sensitivity (IM-9, high radiation sensitivity, K-562, intermediate radiation sensitivity and HELA, low radiation sensitivity) as seen by the X-irradiation dose related inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. The addition of resveratrol alone to the cell cultures induced apoptosis and inhibited cell growth from 50 (IM-9), 100 (EOL-1) or 200 microM (HELA) resveratrol concentrations. Concomitant treatment of the cells with either resveratrol and X-irradiation induced a synergical effect at the highest dose of 200 microM.

Telomere length was determined by either the terminal restriction fragment method or flow-FISH, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, chemosensitivity was examined in telomestatin-treated U937 cells before ultimate telomere shortening. Treatment with telomestatin reproducibly inhibited telomerase activity in U937 and NB4 cells followed by telomere shortening. Enhanced chemosensitivity toward daunorubicin and cytosine-arabinoside was observed in telomestatin-treated U937 cells, before ultimate telomere shortening. Telomere shortening associated with apoptosis by telomestatin was evident in some freshly obtained leukemia cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients, regardless of sub-types of AML and post-myelodysplasia AML. These results suggest that disruption of telomere maintenance by telomestatin limits the cellular lifespan of AML cells, as well.

Sensitisation to TNF-induced apoptosis was prevented by the broad caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, whereas overexpression of Bcl-2 had no effect. Mithramycin also potentiated cell death induced by Fas agonistic antibodies. In contrast, mithramycin reduced the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis due to factor withdrawal. TNF-induced activation of NF-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent gene expression was not modulated by mithramycin treatment. Concomitantly with the increased sensitivity, the protein level of the short-spliced cFLIP variant was downregulated.

Immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplant recipients is complicated by high rates of malignant disease, one condition being Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). CASE REPORT: A 22-year-old woman developed KS 1 year after renal transplantation, and then developed AML another 4 years later. When KS was diagnosed it was already in extensive stage, and she received ABV combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus bleomycin plus vincristine intravenously (i.v.) once daily every 2 weeks. She entered remission but the KS relapsed and 8 cycles of i.v. etoposide monotherapy were given and she re-entered remission. 19 months later, the patient was admitted to hospital with severe malaise, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The diagnosis was AML (FABM4). The patient received induction chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine and idarubicin. After completion of this induction therapy she developed neutropenic infection, dyspnea and confusion. Her condition deteriorated rapidly after that, and she died. CONCLUSION: KS is one of the most common malignancies in renal allograft recipients, whereas AML is a less frequent problem. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of these two different malignancies developing after renal transplantation. The pathogenesis of the AML is discussed.","['Copyright 2004 S.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a period of 16 years 21 treatments according to the current cooperative protocols were performed in 14 children of Jehovah's Witnesses. Various hematological supportive care measures such as supplementation with iron, human erythropoietin, interleukin 11, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and autologous or allogeneic stem cell rescue had been applied. For comparison matched pairs treated in our hospitals not belonging to Jehovah's Witnesses and 50 pediatric and adult oncological patients belonging to Jehovah's Witnesses reviewed from the international literature were analyzed with respect to transfusions and outcome. RESULTS: So far, 9 of 14 children are surviving 16-195 months (median 26 months). During the primary therapy they received markedly less transfusions than the control cohort (-39,1% red blood cell transfusions and -37,5% platelet transfusions). The review of 50 reported cases showed that oncological therapy can also be successfully performed with a restricted transfusion regimen in children and particularly in adults. CONCLUSION: Pediatric cancer patients belonging to Jehovah's Witnesses can be treated similarly to other patients. A restrictive transfusion policy and the broad application of hematopoietic supportive care measures may reduce transfusions. This treatment policy and a continuous collaboration with the Hospital Liaison Committee for Jehovah's Witnesses appears to create an oncological treatment situation with a high compliance of patients and parents where court orders may not be necessary.","['Copyright 2004 S.

Using gene expression profiling, we investigated the molecular consequences of fludarabine treatment of patients with CLL in vivo. In 7 patients with CLL, a consistent gene expression signature of in vivo fludarabine exposure was identified. Many of the fludarabine signature genes were known p53 target genes and genes involved in DNA repair. In vitro treatment of CLL cells with fludarabine induced the same set of genes as observed in vivo, and many of these genes were also induced by in vitro exposure of CLL cells to ionizing radiation. Using isogenic p53 wild-type and null lymphoblastoid cell lines, we confirmed that many of the fludarabine signature genes were also p53 target genes. Because in vivo treatment with fludarabine induces a p53-dependent gene expression response, fludarabine treatment has the potential to select p53-mutant CLL cells, which are more drug resistant and associated with an aggressive clinical course.

Free-ranging Namibian cheetahs share ancestry with captive cheetahs, but their susceptibility to infectious diseases has not been investigated. The largest remaining population of free-ranging cheetahs resides on Namibian farmlands, where they share habitat with domestic dogs and cats known to carry viruses that affect cheetah health. To assess the extent to which free-ranging cheetahs are exposed to feline and canine viruses, sera from 81 free-ranging cheetahs sampled between 1992 and 1998 were evaluated for antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV), feline coronavirus (feline infectious peritonitis virus; FCoV/ FIPV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) and for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigens. Antibodies against CDV, FCoV/FIPV, FHV1, FPV, and FCV were detected in 24, 29, 12, 48, and 65% of the free-ranging population, respectively, although no evidence of viral disease was present in any animal at the time of sample collection. Neither FIV antibodies nor FeLV antigens were present in any free-ranging cheetah tested. Temporal variation in FCoV/FIPV seroprevalence during the study period suggested that this virus is not endemic in the free-ranging population. Antibodies against CDV were detected in cheetahs of all ages sampled between 1995 and 1998, suggesting the occurrence of an epidemic in Namibia during the time when CDV swept through other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. This evidence in free-ranging Namibian cheetahs of exposure to viruses that cause severe disease in captive cheetahs should direct future guidelines for translocations, including quarantine of seropositive cheetahs and preventing contact between cheetahs and domestic pets.",,"['Munson, Linda', 'Marker, Laurie', 'Dubovi, Edward', 'Spencer, Jennifer A', 'Evermann, James F', ""O'Brien, Stephen J""]","['Munson L', 'Marker L', 'Dubovi E', 'Spencer JA', 'Evermann JF', ""O'Brien SJ""]","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, California 95616, USA. lmunson@ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Wildl Dis,Journal of wildlife diseases,0244160,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Acinonyx/blood/*virology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Domestic/virology', 'Animals, Wild/*virology', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', 'Disease Susceptibility/*veterinary/virology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Namibia/epidemiology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/transmission/*veterinary']",,2004/05/13 05:00,2004/10/01 05:00,['2004/05/13 05:00'],"['2004/05/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/13 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.7589/0090-3558-40.1.23 [doi]'],ppublish,J Wildl Dis. 2004 Jan;40(1):23-31. doi: 10.7589/0090-3558-40.1.23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Testing included serology for canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus (CPV), canine adenovirus, Leptospira interrogans, feline calicivirus (FCV), feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), feline immunodeficiency virus, feline leukemia virus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella henselae. Testing was also performed for Dirofilaria immitis. Significantly more gray foxes were seropositive for CPV in the urban zone than in the rural zone. In addition, radio-tracking of gray foxes in the rural zone indicated that all three of the rural CPV-seropositive foxes had traveled into adjoining small towns, whereas only one of the 11 seronegative animals had done so. Significantly more bobcats were seropositive for FCV in the rural zone than in the urban zone. Individual bobcats with positive FCV antibody titers had patterns of movement that intercepted park inholdings where domestic cats lived. Bobcat samples were seronegative for all five of the other viral feline pathogens, with the exception of a FECV-seropositive bobcat. High seroprevalence was detected for B. henselae and T. gondii in both zones. Variation in the seroprevalence for different pathogens might be related to differences in the exposure of bobcats and foxes to domestic animals: in the urban zone, gray foxes were located in residential areas outside the park, whereas bobcats were not. Although for most of the pathogens examined there was no relationship between urbanization and exposure, our results for CPV in foxes and FCV in bobcats indicated that proximity to urban areas or contact with humans can increase the risk of disease exposure for wild carnivore populations.

In a great variety of organisms they are recognized to function critically during antero-posterior patterning and the development of the intestinal epithelium. The Cdx homologues, when expressed, modulate a diverse set of processes including proliferation, apoptosis, cell-adhesion, and columnar morphology. They are also necessary for the expression of an increasing number of intestine-specific genes. By targeting these processes and genes, the Cdx homologues promote the appearance of a mature intestinal cell phenotype. In addition to these critical roles during development, accumulating evidence suggests that the Cdx homologues may play significant roles in oncogenesis in the gastrointestinal tract and other tissues. In the colon, several studies suggest the Cdx homologues may act as tumor suppressors. However, ectopic Cdx1 and Cdx2 expression is involved in the development of the precancerous intestinal metaplasia in the stomach and esophagus, and may be a transforming event in one form of acute myelogenous leukemia.

At present MRD testing in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) is not applied as a standard diagnostic or prognostic method. DESIGN AND METHODS: Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using patient-specific TaqMan probes together with LightCycler technology was performed to quantify minimal residual disease in MM. Relative levels of clonotypic cells were assessed as IgH/2beta-actin ratios with a sensitivity of 10(-4) to 10(-5). RESULTS: Following stem cell transplantation, a significant reduction of clonotypic cells was observed in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples of 11 patients, comparing pre-treatment values with those of best response (median: 13% to 0.09% and 0.03% to 0%, respectively). In 5 patients with ongoing clinical remission IgH/2beta-actin ratios remained stable at a low level, while in 6 patients an increase to 2% in BM and 0.4% in PB was associated with progression of the disease. In 4 of these 6 patients the increase of clonotypic cells in PB was detectable a median of 3 months (range: 0.5-6) before relapse. Furthermore, time-to-progression of patients with pre-transplantation IgH/2b-actin ratios > 0.03% in BM was significantly shorter than that of patients with lower MRD levels. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: MRD in patients with MM can be quantified reliably using TaqMan chemistry adapted to the LightCycler system.

We improved the identification of this parameter by implementing multiparameter flow cytometry to quantify bone marrow cells carrying leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIP). DESIGN AND METHODS: In 106 uniformly treated patients flow cytometric analyses were performed at diagnosis and one week after induction therapy (day 16). The log-difference between LAIP-positive cells on day 1and day 16 (LD16) was determined for each patient. RESULTS: The LD16 (median, 2.11; range, -0.37 to 4.20) was significantly correlated to CR rate, event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS). Separation of patients by the median LD16 resulted in significant differences in CR rate (81% vs. 51%, p=0.002), EFS (53% at 2 years vs. median 2.8 months, p<0.0001), 2-year OS (58% vs. 43%, p=0.0133), and 2-year RFS (65% vs. 30%, p=0.0037). Multivariate analysis revealed that LD16 was an independent prognostic parameter for CR rate, EFS, and RFS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric evaluation of early response may serve as a new response parameter in AML. It may be used for development of risk-adapted therapies.

Both Ankrd2 and CARP are involved in striated muscle hypertrophy. The mechanism by which muscle stretch is sensed and signals are transduced is still unknown; however, Ankrd2 and CARP could play similar roles in pathways leading to hypertrophy, the triggering mechanisms being heart pressure overload monitored by CARP and mechanical stretch in skeletal muscle monitored by Ankrd2. Recently Ankrd2 and CARP have been proposed as members of a family of muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs) that form a complex with titin, myopalladin and calpain protease p94, involved in signaling and regulation of gene expression in response to muscle stress. Here, we show that Ankrd2 is able to interact with the Z-disc protein telethonin as well as being able to interact with three transcription factors: YB-1, PML and p53. Ankrd2 binding to the ubiquitous transcription factor YB-1 can be demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo; this is not very surprising, since a similar interaction was previously described for CARP. However, the interactions with PML and p53 are unexpected new findings, with interesting implications in the Ankrd2 signaling cascade. Ankrd2 co-localizes with the transcriptional co-activator and co-repressor PML in nuclear bodies (NBs) in human myoblasts as detected by confocal immunofluorescence. Interestingly, we show that Ankrd2 not only binds the tumor suppressor protein p53 both in vitro and in vivo but also enhances the up-regulation of the p21(WAFI/CIPI) promoter by p53. Therefore, our findings strengthen the hypothesis that Ankrd2 may be involved in sensing stress signals and linking these to muscle gene regulation.",,"['Kojic, Snezana', 'Medeot, Elisa', 'Guccione, Ernesto', 'Krmac, Helena', 'Zara, Ivano', 'Martinelli, Valentina', 'Valle, Giorgio', 'Faulkner, Georgine']","['Kojic S', 'Medeot E', 'Guccione E', 'Krmac H', 'Zara I', 'Martinelli V', 'Valle G', 'Faulkner G']","['International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Padriciano 99, I-34012 Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (ANKRD1 protein, human)', '0 (ANKRD2 protein, human)', '0 (Ankrd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Connectin)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TCAP protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Y-Box-Binding Protein 1)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Connectin', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Muscle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'NFI Transcription Factors', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Sarcomeres/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation', 'Y-Box-Binding Protein 1']",,2004/05/12 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/05/12 05:00'],"['2004/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2004/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jmb.2004.03.071 [doi]', 'S0022283604003894 [pii]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2004 May 28;339(2):313-25. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2004.03.071.,,,"['1278/Telethon/Italy', 'B.57/Telethon/Italy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the hypothalamic-pituitary axis falls within the radiation fields, the patient is at risk of developing hypopituitarism. The effect of radiation is determined by the dose and the time that has elapsed since treatment. Classically, growth hormone (GH) is the most sensitive of the anterior pituitary hormones to irradiation, followed by gonadotrophins, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Low-dose irradiation in prepubertal children can initially cause early or precocious puberty and subsequently gonadotrophin deficiency. Higher doses may cause gonadotrophin deficiency and pubertal delay. The ACTH and TSH axes are relatively resistant to the effects of irradiation, but minor abnormalities may occur.

Recently, we have reported that NG suppressed the cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by H(2)O(2), a typical pro-oxidant, in mouse leukemia P388 cells. Cytosine arabinoside (1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine; Ara-C) is the most important antimetabolite chemotherapeutic drug used for acute leukemia. It has been suggested that Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity is caused by apoptosis, which is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we examined the effect of NG on the cytotoxicity and apoptosis in mouse leukemia P388 cells treated with Ara-C. Ara-C caused cytotoxicity in a concentration and time-dependent manner in the cells. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), cystamine (CysA) or a reduced form of glutathione (GSH), typical antioxidants significantly blocked Ara-C-induced cytotoxicity. Similarly, Ara-C-induced cell death was completely prevented by NG. NG strongly reduced ROS production caused by Ara-C in the cells. NG slightly increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. Ara-C caused apoptosis with nuclear morphological change and DNA fragmentation. NG remarkably attenuated the Ara-C-induced apoptosis. NG completely blocked the DNA damage caused by Ara-C treatment at 6 h using the Comet assay. Our data suggest that NG reduces Ara-C-induced oxidative stress through both an inhibition of the generation of ROS production and an increase in antioxidant enzyme activities. Consequently, NG blocked apoptosis caused by Ara-C-induced oxidative stress, resulting in the inhibition of the cytotoxicity of Ara-C.",,"['Kanno, Syu-Ichi', 'Shouji, Ai', 'Hirata, Riki', 'Asou, Keiko', 'Ishikawa, Masaaki']","['Kanno S', 'Shouji A', 'Hirata R', 'Asou K', 'Ishikawa M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Cancer Research Institute, Tohoku Pharmaceutical University, 4-4-1 Komatsushima, Aoba, Sendai 981-8558, Japan. syu-kan@tohoku-pharm.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'N7TD9J649B (naringin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catalase/biosynthesis', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Comet Assay', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Superoxide Dismutase/biosynthesis', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",,2004/05/12 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/05/12 05:00'],"['2003/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.lfs.2003.12.019 [doi]', 'S0024320504002425 [pii]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2004 Jun 4;75(3):353-65. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2003.12.019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, overall cell viability was not significantly changed by the presence of hemin.

Chemoprevention of cancer is an intervention in the carcinogenic process by chemical agents that block or reverse the malignant transformation of cells. Retinoids are prime candidates for cancer chemoprevention since cancer is characterized by abnormal growth with a lack of differentiation, which could be modified by retinoids. Retinoids exert their biological functions through nuclear receptors, retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR). A number of experimental and clinical studies have been performed in the past two decades with retinoids showing that they inhibit or reverse the carcinogenic process in some organs, including hematological malignancy as well as premalignant and malignant lesions in the oral cavity, head and neck, breast, skin and liver. We particularly focus upon the therapeutic application of all-trans RA (atRA) to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and on the preventive approach to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by a synthetic retinoid analog, acyclic retinoid. In both malignancies, malfunction of retinoid nuclear receptors is closely related to their carcinogenic process. In APL, a chromosomal translocation produces a chimeric protein between RAR alpha and a protein called promyelocyte leukemia protein (PML). PML-RAR alpha works as a dominant negative receptor in the leukemic cells, interfering with the normal function of RAR alpha and/or PML, which in turn results in the arrest of cell maturation at the stage of promyelocytes. Oral administration of atRA induces differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells to mature neutrophils, and leads to a high rates (over 90%) of complete remission. AtRA therapy has become standard in the treatment of APL. In the case of HCC, post-translational modification of RXR by phosphorylation impairs its function, which leads to uncontrolled cell growth. Acyclic retinoid suppresses the phosphorylation of RXR alpha, restores its function in the presence of its endogenous ligand, 9-cis RA, and thereby induces apoptosis of the cancer cells. Acyclic retinoid given orally successfully suppresses the development of second primary tumors in cirrhotic patients who undergo curative removal of preceding HCC. Eradication of (pre)malignant clones ('clonal deletion') from the liver is suggested as a mechanism of the chemopreventive effect. Further development of more effective retinoids as well as their use in combination with other classes of anticancer agents including immunopreventive drugs like interferons may provide strategies for cancer prevention.",,"['Okuno, Masataka', 'Kojima, Soichi', 'Matsushima-Nishiwaki, Rie', 'Tsurumi, Hisashi', 'Muto, Yasutoshi', 'Friedman, Scott L', 'Moriwaki, Hisataka']","['Okuno M', 'Kojima S', 'Matsushima-Nishiwaki R', 'Tsurumi H', 'Muto Y', 'Friedman SL', 'Moriwaki H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Gifu University School of Medicine, Gifu 501-1194, Japan. mokuno@cc.gifu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/physiology', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Retinoids/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",85,2004/05/12 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/05/12 05:00'],"['2004/05/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2174/1568009043333023 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2004 May;4(3):285-98. doi: 10.2174/1568009043333023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dependent upon a myriad of genetic aberrations for its pathogenesis, cancer has been the focus of gene expression profiling studies that have highlighted the potential clinical applications of this technology. This type of molecular profiling has the potential to enhance the ability of pathologists and oncologists to correctly classify tumors, not just into existing subgroups which may or may not have clear prognostic implications, but into new groups which carry predictable correlations with outcomes.

Immunotherapy seems most effective for patients with a low AML cell burden, and a possible strategy is therefore to administer immunotherapy early after intensive chemotherapy when patients have a low leukemia cell burden and severe treatment-induced cytopenia. To further investigate this possible therapeutic approach we used a whole blood assay to characterize the proliferative responsiveness (3H-thymidine incorporation) of circulating T cells from AML patients with severe treatment-induced leukopenia, i.e., peripheral blood leukocyte counts < 0.5x10(9)/l. This assay will reflect both quantitative and qualitative differences. Responses were compared for 17 AML patients, 6 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and a group of 21 healthy controls. Most circulating leukocytes in the AML patients were T lymphocytes, whereas B lymphocytes and monocytes usually constituted < 10%. Anti-CD3-stimulated proliferation was significantly lower for AML patients compared with healthy controls. However, proliferation in response to anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 did not differ for AML patients and healthy controls, an observation suggesting that T cells from AML patients have an increased responsiveness in the presence of optimal costimulation that compensates for the quantitative T-cell defect. In contrast, the responses were significantly lower for ALL than for AML patients. We conclude that the remaining T-cell population in AML patients with severe chemotherapy-induced cytopenia show an increased proliferative responsiveness and may represent a therapeutic target when antileukemic immunotherapy is tried in combination with intensive chemotherapy.",,"['Wendelbo, Oystein', 'Nesthus, Ingerid', 'Sjo, Malvin', 'Paulsen, Kristin', 'Ernst, Peter', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Wendelbo O', 'Nesthus I', 'Sjo M', 'Paulsen K', 'Ernst P', 'Bruserud O']","['Division for Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Norway. oystein.wendelbo@helse-bergen.no']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",,2004/05/11 05:00,2004/08/18 05:00,['2004/05/11 05:00'],"['2003/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-004-0505-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2004 Aug;53(8):740-7. doi: 10.1007/s00262-004-0505-0.

To elucidate the cell surface dynamics of CD94/NKG2A receptors, we have expressed CD94/NKG2A-EGFP receptors in the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell line. Photobleaching experiments revealed that CD94/NKG2A-EGFP receptors move freely within the plasma membrane and accumulate at the site of contact with ligand. The enriched CD94/NKG2A-EGFP is markedly less mobile than the nonligated receptor. We observed that not only are lipid rafts not required for receptor polarization, they are excluded from the site of receptor contact with the ligand. Furthermore, the lipid raft patches normally observed at the sites where FcepsilonR1 activation receptors are cross-linked were not observed when CD94/NKG2A was coengaged along with the activation receptor. These results suggest that immobilization of the CD94/NKG2A receptors at ligation sites not only promote sustenance of the inhibitory signal, but by lipid rafts exclusion prevent formation of activation signaling complexes.",,"['Sanni, Tolib B', 'Masilamani, Madhan', 'Kabat, Juraj', 'Coligan, John E', 'Borrego, Francisco']","['Sanni TB', 'Masilamani M', 'Kabat J', 'Coligan JE', 'Borrego F']","['Receptor Cell Biology Section, Laboratory of Allergic Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Klrd1 protein, rat)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Lectins, C-Type/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/immunology/*physiology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Photobleaching', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",,2004/05/11 05:00,2005/02/03 09:00,['2004/05/11 05:00'],"['2004/05/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1091/mbc.e03-11-0779 [doi]', 'E03-11-0779 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2004 Jul;15(7):3210-23. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e03-11-0779.

METHODS: Cancer incidence data collected by the Shanghai Cancer Registry during 1991 to 1999 was used in the analysis to calculate the crude and age-adjusted rates, percent changes (PCs) and annual percent changes (APCs). APCs were estimated by a linear regression of the logarithm on the incidence rates during the nine years. It also introduced a method for partitioning a linear trend in age-adjusted rates into site-specific contributions to the overall floating trend. 95% confidence intervals for the APCs and contributions were described in the paper. RESULTS: A decreasing rates were observed for cancers of stomach and esophagus among both men and women in urban Shanghai from 1991 to 1999. The increasing rates among men would include cancers of colon, rectum, gall bladder, pancreas, prostate, urinary bladder, kidney and leukemia. The rates of cancers among women increased for colon, rectum, lung, breast, gall bladder, endometrium, ovary, urinary bladder and kidney.

METHODS: Sixty-two formalin fixed, paraffin embedded bone marrow biopsy specimens were studied. Immunohistochemical and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies were performed in each case. RESULTS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) demonstrated mainly and interstitial infiltration by dysplastic lymphocytes, with intertrabecular nodular arrangement or in dispersion. Sometimes, pseudofollicles may be noted. A predominantly para- or intertrabecular infiltration by nodules of lymphoma cells was characteristic of follicle center cell lymphoma (FCL) cases. In most lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (LPL) cases, there was infiltration by small lymphocytes and plasma cells between bony trabeculae. In marginal zone cell lymphoma (MZL), vague inter- or para-trabecular nodules of polymorphic lymphoma cells with clear cytoplasm might be noted. Small to medium-sized dysplastic lymphocytes, with absence of paraimmunoblasts or pseudofollicles, were the most frequent findings in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) might be identified by the presence of distinct cell membrane and abundant clear cytoplasm, resulting in a ""fried-egg"" appearance. Tumor cells with large nuclei and eosinophilic nucleoli were characteristically seen in lymphomatosis diffusa (Hodgkin's disease, HD). In T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with BMI, dispersed or clusters of intertrabecular neoplastic lymphoid cells with clear cytoplasm and gyriform nuclei were often observed. In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL), the tumor cells were large and isolated or arranged in diffuse pattern. Immunohistochemically, a panel of markers, including CD3 CD20, and CD79 are valuable for the differential diagnosis of T- and B-cell lymphomas. The neoplastic cells in MCL were cyclin D1- and CD5-positive, while BCL2- and CD10-positivity was characteristic for FCL. CLL/SLL cells might be stained with CD5 and CD23, in addition to CD20 and CD79. CD25 expression might be noted in HCL: the positivity for CD15, CD30 and fascin suggests HD. There was a higher positivity rate for IgH gene rearrangement in CLL/SLL, LPL MZL and DLBL (80%, 60%, 66.7%, 70% respectively) and for T- cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement in T-cell lymphoma (66.7%).

METHODS: After exposing the cultured THP-1 macrophages to ox-LDL for different periods, cholesterol efflux was determined by FJ-2107P type liquid scintillator. ABCA1 mRNA and protein level were determined by reverse trancriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively. The cholesterol level in THP-1 macrophage foam cells was detected by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: ox-LDL elevated ABCA1 in both protein and mRNA levels and increased apolipoprotein (apo) A-I-mediated cholesterol efflux in a time- and dose-dependent manner. 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 9-cis-retinoic acid did significantly increase cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage foam cells (P<0.05), respectively. Both of them further promoted cholesterol efflux (P<0.01). As expected, liver X receptor (LXR) agonist decreased content of esterified cholesterol in the macrophage foam cells compared with control, whereas only a slight decrease of free cholesterol was observed. LXR activity was slightly increased by oxidized LDL by 12 % at 12 h compared with 6 h.

Busulfan is bifunctional and thus may effectively induce DNA damage, which may play an important role in the cytotoxicity. In this study, we compared the cytotoxicity of bifunctional busulfan with that of monofunctional ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Busulfan showed a significant inhibitory effect on cell growth, whereas the cells grew in the presence of EMS. To clarify the mechanism of cytotoxicity of busulfan, we investigated DNA damage induced by busulfan using 32P-5'-end-labeled DNA fragments obtained from the human p16 tumor suppressor gene. Busulfan induced DNA damage dose-dependently, whereas EMS caused little DNA damage. DNA-sequencing experiments using piperidine and 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase indicated that busulfan caused double-base lesions mainly at 5'-GA-3' and, to a lesser extent, at 5'-GG-3' sequences. Time of flight mass spectrometry confirmed that busulfan forms an intrastrand cross-link at the 5'-GA-3' sequence, in addition to mono-alkylation.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the neoplastic cell growth of ATL remains unclear. In this study, we established a leukemic cell line, termed SYK-11L(+), from tumor cells (S-YU) in an in vivo cell proliferation model of ATL using severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Unexpectedly, SYK-11L(+) was found to have no tumorigenicity in SCID mice. Flow cytometric analysis showed that S-YU expressed cell adhesion molecules including CD44, ICAM-1 and OX40, whereas SYK-11L(+) had lost the expression of these molecules. The administration of anti-OX40 monoclonal antibody inhibited the engraftment of S-YU cells into SCID mice, suggesting that OX40 is a potential target for immunotherapy. Significant differences in responsiveness to IL-2 and IL-15 were observed between the two cell types. To better understand the molecular basis of tumorigenicity, cDNA microarray analysis was performed using tumorigenic S-YU and non-tumorigenic SYK-11L(+) cells. We obtained several candidate genes differentially overexpressed in S-YU compared with SYK-11L(+). Interestingly, one such gene, regulator of G protein signaling 1 (RGS1), was shown to be overexpressed in most ATL patients.

In the context of clinical diagnosis, the central goal of class discovery algorithms is to simultaneously find putative (sub-)types of diseases and to identify informative subsets of genes with disease-type specific expression profile. Contrary to many other approaches in the literature, the method presented implements a wrapper strategy for feature selection, in the sense that the features are directly selected by optimizing the discriminative power of the used partitioning algorithm. The usual combinatorial problems associated with wrapper approaches are overcome by a Bayesian inference mechanism. On the technical side, we present an efficient optimization algorithm with guaranteed local convergence property. The only free parameter of the optimization method is selected by a resampling-based stability analysis. Experiments with Leukemia and Lymphoma datasets demonstrate that our method is able to correctly infer partitions and corresponding subsets of genes which both are relevant in a biological sense.

The recommended daily dosage of 400-600 mg requires simultaneous intake of up to six of the current 100-mg capsules. Due to the need to swallow multiple capsules per dose, there is a potential negative impact on treatment adherence; therefore, a new imatinib 400-mg film-coated tablet has been developed. To improve dosing flexibility, particularly with regard to the pediatric population and the management of adverse events, a scored 100-mg film-coated tablet has also been introduced. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A group of 33 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences, in which they received imatinib as 4 x 100-mg capsules (reference), 4 x 100-mg scored tablets (test), and 1 x 400-mg tablet (test). Blood sampling was performed for up to 96 h after dosing, followed by a 10-day washout period prior to the next sequence. After the third dosing, subjects were monitored to assess delayed drug-related adverse events. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using concentration-time curves for plasma imatinib and its metabolite CGP74588. RESULTS: Median Tmax was 2.5 h for capsules and tablets. Mean AUC((0-inf)) values were 27,094, 26,081 and 25,464 ng.h/ml for 4 x 100-mg capsules, 4 x 100-mg tablets, and 1 x 400-mg tablets, respectively. Cmax values were 1748, 1638 and 1606 ng/ml, and t(1/2) values were 15.8, 15.9 and 15.7 h. The test/reference ratios for AUC((0-inf)), AUC((0-96) (h)), and C(max) were 0.98, 0.98 and 0.95 for 4 x 100-mg tablets versus 4 x 100-mg capsules, and 0.95, 0.95 and 0.92 for 1 x 400-mg tablet versus 4 x 100-mg capsules. The 95% confidence intervals were fully contained within the interval (0.80, 1.25). Eight mild and one moderate adverse event considered to be drug related were reported. These events showed no clustering by type of dosage form and were of little to no clinical significance.

LIF-mediated survival and astrocytic differentiation of cortical precursor cells were differentially regulated, depending on the developmental ages of embryos from which cortical precursors were isolated. LIF did not enhance the survival of cortical precursor cells isolated from later embryos (embryonic day 16, E16). Moreover, LIF-mediated astrocytic differentiation was not observed in early (E12) cortical precursors. Inhibition studies revealed that Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt pathways participate in both the LIF-mediated effects. However, mitogen-activated protein kinase, another signal pathway activated by LIF, was specifically responsible for astrocytic differentiation.

RESULTS: As(2)O(3) provoked Bax expression in all tested neuroblastoma cell lines, including SK-N-BE(2) cells with mutated p53 and LA-N-1 cells, which have a deleted p53. In all cell lines exposed to As(2)O(3), p21 Bax was proteolytically cleaved in a calpain-dependent way into the more proapoptotic p18 Bax, which was detected exclusively in a mitochondria-enriched subcellular fraction. As(2)O(3) also caused an increase of cytoplasmic cytochrome c, translocation of antiapoptosis-inducing factor to the nuclei, and a slight activation of caspase 3. However, inhibition of caspase 3 did not prevent cell death, whereas inhibition of Bax cleavage was associated with a decreased As(2)O(3)-induced cell death. CONCLUSIONS: We show that multidrug-resistant neuroblastoma cells die after exposure to As(2)O(3), independent of functional p53, suggesting activation of a cytotoxic pathway different from that induced by conventional chemotherapeutic agents. We further propose that proteolytic activation of Bax is an important event in As(2)O(3)-induced cell death.",,"['Karlsson, Jenny', 'Ora, Ingrid', 'Porn-Ares, Isabella', 'Pahlman, Sven']","['Karlsson J', 'Ora I', 'Porn-Ares I', 'Pahlman S']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Carboplatin/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2004/05/08 05:00,2004/11/13 09:00,['2004/05/08 05:00'],"['2004/05/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-03-0309 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2004 May 1;10(9):3179-88. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-03-0309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: For that purpose, an F11782-resistant P388 leukemia subline (P388/F11782) has been developed in vivo and characterized. RESULTS: Weekly subtherapeutic doses of F11782 (10 mg/kg) induced complete resistance to F11782 after 8 weekly passages. This resistant P388/F11782 subline retained some in vivo sensitivity to several DNA-topoisomerase II and/or I complex-stabilizing poisons and showed marked collateral sensitivity to cisplatin, topotecan, colchicine, and Vinca alkaloids, while proving completely cross-resistant only to merbarone and doxorubicin. Therefore, resistance to F11782 did not appear to be associated with a classic multidrug resistance profile, as further reflected by unaltered drug uptake and no overexpression of resistance-related proteins or modification of the glutathione-mediated detoxification process. In vivo resistance to F11782 was, however, associated with a marked reduction in topoisomerase IIalpha protein (87%) and mRNA (50%) levels, as well as a diminution of the catalytic activity of topoisomerase IIalpha. In contrast, only minor reductions in topoisomerases IIbeta and I levels were recorded. However, of major interest, nucleotide excision repair activity was decreased 3-fold in these P388/F11782 cells and was more specifically associated with a decreased (67%) level of XPG (human xeroderma pigmentosum group G complementing protein), an endonuclease involved in this DNA repair system.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Seven pediatric patients with various malignancies received etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m(2) i.v. over 1 h daily for 5 days. Blood samples were taken at selected time points on days 1 and 5. Plasma and protein-free plasma concentrations of etoposide and etoposide catechol were determined using a validated liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters of both etoposide and etoposide catechol were calculated using the WinSAAM modeling program developed at NIH. RESULTS: The mean maximum concentration (C(max)) for total (0.262 +/- 0.107 micro g/ml) and free catechol (0.0186 +/- 0.0082 micro g/ml) on day 5 were higher than the mean C(max) for total (0.114 +/- 0.028 micro g/ml) and free catechol (0.0120 +/- 0.0091 micro g/ml) on day 1. The mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)(24h) for total (105.4 +/- 49.1 micro g.min/ml) and free catechol (4.89 +/- 2.23 micro g x min/ml) on day 5 were much greater (P < 0.05) than those for total (55.9 +/- 16.1 micro g x min/ml) and free catechol (3.04 +/- 1.04 micro g x min/ml) on day 1. In contrast, the AUC(24h) for etoposide was slightly lower on day 5 than on day 1. CONCLUSIONS: The C(max) and AUC(24h) for etoposide catechol were significantly higher on day 5 than on day 1. This suggests that metabolism of etoposide to its catechol metabolite increases in pediatric patients receiving multiple-day bolus etoposide infusions.

The aims of our study were (a) to compare the methylation profiles of the major forms of hematological malignancies and (b) to determine the methylation profile of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and compare it with that of multiple myeloma (MM). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We compared the aberrant promoter methylation profile of 14 known or suspected tumor suppressor genes in leukemias (n = 48), lymphomas (n = 42), and MMs (n = 40). We also examined the methylation profile of MGUS (n = 20), a premalignant plasma cell dyscrasia. The genes studied represent five of the six ""hallmarks of cancer."" RESULTS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes (n = 14) from healthy volunteers were negative for methylation of all genes, and methylation percentages in 41 nonmalignant tissues (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, bone marrows, and lymph nodes) from hematological patients were low (0-9%) for all 14 genes, confirming that methylation was tumor specific. Ten of the genes were methylated at frequencies of 29-68% in one or more tumor types, and the methylation indices (an indicator of overall methylation) varied from 0.25 to 0.34. With two exceptions, the methylation patterns of leukemias and lymphomas were similar. However, the pattern of MMs varied from the other tumor types for six genes. In general, the methylation pattern of MGUS was similar to that of MM, although the methylation frequencies were lower (the methylation index of MGUS was 0.15, and that of MM was 0.3). However, the methylation frequencies of six genes were significantly higher in MGUS than in control tissues. The relatively high frequencies of methylation in MGUS are consistent with it being a premalignant condition.

Elucidation of the molecular mechanism mediating this activity will provide further relevant information for understanding its effects on the cellular physiology of untransformed cells and for considering its possible clinical application. Here, we show that violacein causes apoptosis in HL60 leukemic cells but is ineffective in this respect in other types of leukemia cells or in normal human lymphocytes and monocytes. Violacein cytotoxicity in HL60 cells was preceded by activation of caspase 8, transcription of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) target genes, and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation. Thus, violacein effects resemble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) signal transduction in these cells. Accordingly, infliximab, an antibody that antagonizes TNF-alpha-induced signaling abolished the biologic activity of violacein. Moreover, violacein directly activated TNF receptor 1 signaling, because a violacein-dependent association of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to this TNF receptor was observed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments.

Oligomerized chimeras may also sequester essential partners or cofactors to exert dominant-negative effects on target gene expression. A key mechanistic feature, and one with major clinical implications, is the nature of the transcriptional cofactors that are recruited by the dimerized oncoprotein. Chimeric RARalpha and acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1) proteins induce constitutive repression after the recruitment of corepressors, whereas inappropriate maintenance of target gene expression by mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) chimeras may result from the recruitment of coactivators or the basal transcriptional machinery. Molecular therapies directed at enzymatic activities of the aberrantly recruited cofactors, or antagonism of dimerization itself, represent promising avenues of current and future investigation.",,"['So, Chi Wai', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['So CW', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, 300 Pasteur Dr, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. ericso@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",43,2004/05/08 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/05/08 05:00'],"['2004/05/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-03-0992 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43527-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Aug 15;104(4):919-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-03-0992.

Though it was previously shown that tetrandrine causes a G1 blockade and apoptosis in various cell types, however, the mechanism by which tetrandrine initiates apoptosis remains poorly understood. In present study, we investigated the mechanisms of apoptosis induced by tetrandrine in U937 leukemia cells. Tetrandrine inhibited U937 cell growth by inducing apoptosis. After treatment of U937 cells with tetrandrine (10microM) for 24h, alteration of cell morphology, chromatin fragmentation, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation were observed. Tetrandrine also induced early oxidative stress, which resulted in activation of JNK, but not ERK and p38 MAPK. A broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor and antioxidants significantly blocked tetrandrine-induced caspase-3 activation. However, inhibition of the JNK activity with SP600125 did not block tetrandrine-induced apoptosis. Tetrandrine-induced apoptosis of U937 cells also required activity of PKC-delta, because pretreatment with a specific PKC-delta inhibitor greatly blocked tetrandrine-induced caspase-3 activation. In addition, the apoptotic response to tetrandrine was significantly attenuated in dominant-negative PKC-delta transfected MCF-7 cells, suggesting that PKC-delta plays an important role in tetrandrine-induced apoptosis and can induce caspase activation. These results suggest that tetrandrine induces oxidative stress, JNK activation, and caspase activation. However, JNK activation by ROS is not involved in the tetrandrine-induced apoptosis. In addition, tetrandrine induces caspase-dependent generation of a catalytically active fragment of PKC-delta, and this fragment also appears to play a role in the activation of caspases.",,"['Jang, Byeong-Churl', 'Lim, Ki-Jo', 'Paik, Ji-Hye', 'Cho, Jae-We', 'Baek, Won-Ki', 'Suh, Min-Ho', 'Park, Jae-Bok', 'Kwon, Taek Kyu', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Kim, Sang-Pyo', 'Shin, Dong-Hoon', 'Song, Dae-kyu', 'Bae, Jae-Hoon', 'Mun, Kyo-Cheol', 'Suh, Seong-Il']","['Jang BC', 'Lim KJ', 'Paik JH', 'Cho JW', 'Baek WK', 'Suh MH', 'Park JB', 'Kwon TK', 'Park JW', 'Kim SP', 'Shin DH', 'Song DK', 'Bae JH', 'Mun KC', 'Suh SI']","['Chronic Disease Research Center, Institute for Medical Science, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu 700-712, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (immunosuppressive acidic protein)', '29EX23D5AJ (tetrandrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Benzylisoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2004/05/08 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/08 05:00'],"['2003/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.bcp.2004.01.018 [doi]', 'S0006295204000656 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2004 May 15;67(10):1819-29. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2004.01.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This stability measure quantifies the reproducibility of clustering solutions on a second sample, and it can be interpreted as a classification risk with regard to class labels produced by a clustering algorithm. The preferred number of clusters is determined by minimizing this classification risk as a function of the number of clusters.

In addition, several arguments strongly suggest the existence of host genetic factors, that could be involved in the HTLV-1 infection as well as in the development of ATLL among HTLV-1 infected individuals. ATLL can be classified into 4 major subtypes: a smoldering type, a chronic type, a lymphoma type and a leukemic type. The demonstration by Southern blot analysis of the clonal integration of an HTLV-1 provirus in the tumoral cells represents the gold-standard to define biologically ATLL.

Daily use of hydroquinone causes it to accumulate in the body as absorption into the skin is faster than excretion in the urine. The use of hydroquinone as a skin-bleaching agent is accordingly unsafe and should be completely banned.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway plays an important role in GM-CSF-dependent proliferation and also has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the benzene metabolite, hydroquinone (HQ), on alterations in the GM-CSF signaling pathway in TF-1 erythroleukemia cells and human CD34+ BM cells. HQ treatment in TF-1 cells results in a strong proliferative response that is dependent on ERK activation and GM-CSF production. HQ also induces ERK-dependent AP-1 activation with concomitant increased transcriptional activity of AP-1 reporter gene. However, the kinetics of ERK activation are different between rhGM-CSF and HQ in TF-1 cells: rhGM-CSF results in immediate activation of ERK, whereas HQ activation of ERK is delayed. Further, HQ and rhGM-CSF together produce an immediate increase in ERK phosphorylation, which is sustained for over 48 h. HQ also stimulates colony formation, AP-1 DNA binding and GM-CSF production in human CD34+ BM cells. These results suggest that HQ stimulates proliferation via activation of ERK/AP-1 and is at least partially mediated via the production of GM-CSF.",,"['Zheng, J H', 'Pyatt, D W', 'Gross, S A', 'Le, A T', 'Kerzic, P J', 'Irons, R D']","['Zheng JH', 'Pyatt DW', 'Gross SA', 'Le AT', 'Kerzic PJ', 'Irons RD']","['Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",,2004/05/07 05:00,2004/07/24 05:00,['2004/05/07 05:00'],"['2004/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2403389 [doi]', '2403389 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2004 Jul;18(7):1296-304. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2403389.,,,['ES06258/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The substrates used in this system are viral particles that are trapped before completing membrane fusion. These virions are induced to fuse out of endosomes and the viral cores are released into solution where they are amenable to biochemical manipulation. This system revealed that membrane fusion is not sufficient to stimulate the formation of a reverse transcription complex. Instead, ATP hydrolysis and cellular factors >5 kDa in size are required.

A TLT1 splice variant (TLT1sp) encodes a different cytoplasmic tail lacking ITIMs. Both isoforms are expressed in resting platelet alpha-granules, which are up-regulated to the cell surface following activation. TLT1 recruited Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-2 to the ""classical"" ITIM (Y281) but not the ""nonclassical"" ITIM (Y245). In contrast to previously characterized ITIM receptors, TLT1 enhanced, rather than inhibited, FcepsilonRI-mediated calcium signaling in rat basophilic leukemia cells, a property dependent on the SHP-2 recruiting classical Y281 ITIM.

To identify genes involved in specifying segmental identity in the vertebrate head, we screened for mutations affecting cartilage patterning in the zebrafish larval pharynx. We present the positional cloning and initial phenotypic characterization of a homeotic locus discovered in this screen. We show that a zebrafish ortholog of the human oncogenic histone acetyltransferase MOZ (monocytic leukemia zinc finger) is required for specifying segmental identity in the second through fourth pharyngeal arches. In moz mutant zebrafish, the second pharyngeal arch is dramatically transformed into a mirror-image duplicated jaw. This phenotype resembles a similar but stronger transformation than that seen in hox2 morpholino oligo (hox2-MO) injected animals. In addition, mild anterior homeotic transformations are seen in the third and fourth pharyngeal arches of moz mutants. moz is required for maintenance of most hox1-4 expression domains and this requirement probably at least partially accounts for the moz mutant homeotic phenotypes. Homeosis and defective Hox gene expression in moz mutants is rescued by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity with Trichostatin A. Although we find early patterning of the moz mutant hindbrain to be normal, we find a late defect in facial motoneuron migration in moz mutants. Pharyngeal musculature is transformed late, but not early, in moz mutants. We detect relatively minor defects in arch epithelia of moz mutants. Vital labeling of arch development reveals no detectable changes in CNC generation in moz mutants, but later prechondrogenic condensations are mispositioned and misshapen. Mirror-image hox2-dependent gene expression changes in postmigratory CNC prefigure the homeotic phenotype in moz mutants. Early second arch ventral expression of goosecoid (gsc) in moz mutants and in animals injected with hox2-MOs shifts from lateral to medial, mirroring the first arch pattern. bapx1, which is normally expressed in first arch postmigratory CNC prefiguring the jaw joint, is ectopically expressed in second arch CNC of moz mutants and hox2-MO injected animals. Reduction of bapx1 function in wild types causes loss of the jaw joint. Reduction of bapx1 function in moz mutants causes loss of both first and second arch joints, providing functional genetic evidence that bapx1 contributes to the moz-deficient homeotic pattern. Together, our results reveal an essential embryonic role and a crucial histone acetyltransferase activity for Moz in regulating Hox expression and segmental identity, and provide two early targets, bapx1 and gsc, of moz and hox2 signaling in the second pharyngeal arch.",,"['Miller, Craig T', 'Maves, Lisa', 'Kimmel, Charles B']","['Miller CT', 'Maves L', 'Kimmel CB']","['Institute of Neuroscience, 1254 University of Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403, USA. ctm@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (kat6a protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Body Patterning/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*genetics', 'Genes, Homeobox/genetics', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Pharynx/*embryology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Zebrafish/*embryology/*genetics', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*genetics']",,2004/05/07 05:00,2004/08/19 05:00,['2004/05/07 05:00'],"['2004/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/19 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1242/dev.01134 [doi]', '131/10/2443 [pii]']",ppublish,Development. 2004 May;131(10):2443-61. doi: 10.1242/dev.01134.,,,"['DE13834/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HD22486/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-four birth certificate-friend control pairs were enrolled (n = 128). Additionally, 192 ""ideal"" controls were selected without tracing from the birth records. Data on parental ages, parental education, mother's reproductive history, and birth weight were obtained from the birth certificates of all 320 subjects. For all variables except birth weight, the differences between birth certificate and ideal controls were smaller than those between friend and ideal controls. None of the differences between birth certificate and ideal controls was significant, whereas two factors were significantly different between friend and ideal controls. These findings suggest that friend controls may be less representative than birth certificate controls.

They regulate cell cycle, apoptosis and proliferation of different cells via the influence on gene transcription. Because STAT5s are constitutively activated in certain haematooncologic diseases, they are suggested to play an important role in leukaemogenesis. However, the real function of these proteins in haematopoietic cell transformation and proliferation is not clear enough. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of suppression of STAT5A and STAT5B expression on the clonogenicity and apoptosis of the chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blast cells from 34 newly diagnosed patients with CML and AML were used in our experiments. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) were applied to block STAT5A and STAT5B at the mRNA level and the RT-PCR method was used to study STAT5 mRNA expression in the cells after incubation with ODNs. Moreover, Western blot analysis of the STAT5 proteins was performed. The effect of ODN pretreatment on cell clonogenicity in methylocellulose cultures was examined according to the type of oligodeoxynucleotide and the time of exposure. The induction of apoptosis in cells was also estimated by the Annexin V/PI staining and the TUNEL method using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Perturbation of STAT5 expression decreased proliferative potential of the CML and the AML blasts as well as enhanced their apoptosis (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our studies showed that the STAT5 proteins may be critical in the regulation of growth and apoptosis of the CML and AML leukaemic cells.",,"['Baskiewicz-Masiuk, Magdalena', 'Machalinski, Boguslaw']","['Baskiewicz-Masiuk M', 'Machalinski B']","['Department of General Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland. poziomka@med.pam.szczecin.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (STAT5B protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Milk Proteins', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2004/05/07 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/05/07 05:00'],"['2004/05/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00242.x [doi]', 'EJH242 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 Jun;72(6):420-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00242.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angiogenin is a powerful factor produced by neoplastic cells and host microenvironment. High levels of soluble angiogenin (sAng) correlate with a poor prognosis in patients affected by acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, but no data are available on sAng in chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD). Therefore, in this study we investigated the clinical significance of the angiogenin in sera of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) (n = 14) or essential thrombocythaemia (ET) (n = 20), and correlated them with those of soluble transforming growth factor-beta(1) (sTGF beta(1)).

The highest levels of sAng were detected in CML patients (1349.23 +/- 549.55 pg/mL).

Based on these findings, areas of special interest were fine mapped, and relevant probes constructed for use in interphase-fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) investigations. Thus, using the CGH data from 52 HCL and 61 SMZL patients, we identified the characteristic profiles of copy number imbalances for both diseases. These were a gain of 5q13-31 (19%) and loss of 7q22-q35 (6%) for HCL, and gain of 3q25 (28%), loss of 7q31 (16%), and gain of 12q15 (16%) for SMZL. A partial loss of 7q unusual for low-malignant B-cell diseases was found to be common to the two diseases. This loss was therefore fine mapped with BAC/PAC clones. Fine mapping revealed that in SMZL the minimal lost region covers 11.4 Mb spanning from 7q31.33 to 7q33 located between sequence tagged site (STS)-markers SHGC-3275 and D7S725. This area was distinct from the commonly deleted 7q region of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukaemia (MDS/AML). A FISH probe specific for the 7q region was constructed. Using this probe in an interphase-FISH investigation we showed the minimal lost 7q-region of HCL and SMZL to be one and the same. In one HCL case, this investigation furthermore showed the extent of the deleted region to be below the detection limit of CGH, whereas interphase-FISH screening of 36 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cases showed no deletion of the 7q area. In conclusion, we have identified characteristic profiles of copy number imbalances in HCL and SMZL and fine mapped the minimal extent of a commonly lost 7q area of special interest.

It is characterized by lymphoblastoid morphology without cytoplasmic granules and immature NK cell immunophenotypes (CD56+, CD57-, CD16-). It has predilection for extranodal organ involvement, and the prognosis of affected patients is extremely poor under the current chemotherapy. We present a 14-year-old girl who was diagnosed as having blastic NK cell leukemia with mediastinal, pleural, and pericardial involvement. Immunophenotyping of her leukemic cells showed positive for CD2, CD5, CD7, CD34, CD56, HLA-DR, and cytoplasmic CD3. T cell receptor (TCR) and Immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were not rearranged. She received chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia incorporating L-asparaginase (L-asp) which successfully induced complete remission. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from her HLA-identical sibling was conducted after two courses of consolidation therapy. Expression of aspargine synthetase (AS) protein in the leukemic cells at diagnosis was examined by an immunocytochemical method. She remains in hematological remission for over 36 months after BMT. The expression of AS protein was negative, suggesting that the leukemic cells were sensitive to L-asp. Induction and consolidation therapy incorporating L-asp followed by allo-BMT might be a promising treatment for child hood blastic NK cell leukemia, but more samples of the rare leukemia need to be studied before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Hyakuna, Nobuyuki', 'Toguchi, Suzuka', 'Higa, Takeshi', 'Okudaira, Taeko', 'Taira, Naoya', 'Masuda, Masato', 'Kitoh, Toshiyuki', 'Ohta, Takao']","['Hyakuna N', 'Toguchi S', 'Higa T', 'Okudaira T', 'Taira N', 'Masuda M', 'Kitoh T', 'Ohta T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan. hyakunan@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparagine/*therapeutic use', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction']",,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20034 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Jun;42(7):631-4. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have investigated the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric measurements of brain regions of interest and cognitive functioning. This study examined the relationship between hippocampal volumes and long-term memory abilities in survivors of ALL. PROCEDURE: Ten survivors of ALL and ten matched controls underwent MRI acquisition. The participants completed a battery of tests measuring both visual and verbal long-term memory. Volumetric measurements of the hippocampus were obtained by consecutive manual tracing using the NIH Image 1.52 program. Estimates of whole brain volume were also obtained. RESULTS: No significant group differences were found in right or left hippocampi. Nor were there significant differences between the two groups on measures of long-term memory. Correlations between volumetric measurements of the hippocampus and measures of long-term memory were non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our hypothesis of deficits in both long-term memory and its neural substrates was not supported. It was concluded that the hippocampus, as an early developing structure, may be less vulnerable to chemotherapy treatment.

Hearing deteriorated following SCT in 20/45 (44%) of these children. Those with worse hearing following SCT were more likely to have neuroblastoma (odds ratio [OR] 16.0 [95% CI 1.8, 143.2; P = 0.003]), receive carboplatin conditioning (OR 7.7 [95% CI 1.4, 41.9; P = 0.01]), have abnormal baseline hearing (OR 5.1 [95% CI 1.3, 19.5; P = 0.02]), and have higher baseline serum creatinine (OR for every increase of 5 micromol/L of serum creatinine of 1.5 [95% CI 1.03, 2.1; P = 0.03]).

Although leukemia is the most common cancer of childhood, until now fertility in survivors has not been comprehensively assessed. PROCEDURE: We investigated functional impairment of fertility in women who were long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a retrospective cohort study. Proven fertility (defined as ever pregnant) was evaluated by self-report among 182 females treated on protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (age at interview, 22.6 years on average) and 170 controls drawn from among the survivors' female siblings (23.4 years). The interview included psychosocial inventories designed to detect mood problems. RESULTS: Significant fertility deficits were noted in female survivors treated with cranial radiotherapy (CRT) at any dose around the time of menarche (relative fertility (RF)) = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.09, 0.82, P = 0.03). Controlling for marital status, mood at interview, and many fertility-related situations did not change the association. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence for fertility deficits after treatment for ALL with CRT, and, in addition, for the first time, suggests that girls treated around the time of menarche are especially at risk. Clinical confirmation of these results is needed. If gonadal damage occurs in women receiving these treatments, their risk for further sequelae, such as osteoporosis and heart disease, may be significantly raised, requiring active management and intervention.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Byrne, Julianne', 'Fears, Thomas R', 'Mills, James L', 'Zeltzer, Lonnie K', 'Sklar, Charles', 'Nicholson, H Stacy', 'Haupt, Riccardo', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Meadows, Anna T', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Byrne J', 'Fears TR', 'Mills JL', 'Zeltzer LK', 'Sklar C', 'Nicholson HS', 'Haupt R', 'Reaman GH', 'Meadows AT', 'Robison LL']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA. jbyrne@cnmc.org""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Fertility', 'Humans', 'Menarche/radiation effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*radiotherapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20033 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Jun;42(7):589-97. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20033.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these survivors did receive prophylactic cranial radiotherapy during their oncological treatment. The effect of cranial irradiation on the hypothalamus is considered to be progressive. Therefore, late effects, such as reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion, may remain undetected until adulthood. PROCEDURE: Records from all patients treated for ALL before the onset of puberty in the region of West Sweden, between 1 January 1973 and 31 December 1985 were included, provided they were in first remission with a minimum follow-up time of 15 years, and a minimum age of 20. These criteria were met by 47 young adults aged 20-32 years, of whom 35 agreed to participate. We studied spontaneous GH secretion over 24 hr, IGF-I and IGFBP-3, final height and BMI. The patients had been treated according to three consecutive Swedish childhood leukaemia group protocols. The median follow-up time was 20 years, and 19 of the patients had been treated with cranial irradiation (CRT+), 16 had not (CRT-). RESULTS: CRT+ patients had significantly lower maximal peaks of GH than CRT- patients. Fifty percent of the CRT+ patients had a GH(max) below the cut-off level (3.3 microg/l), for GH treatment. CRT- patients all had GH(max) levels considered within the normal range. Final height of all the patients, except one CRT+ women, was in the range of expected midparental height, the median loss in final height in the CRT+ patients was 0.8 standard deviation (SD). No patient in this study was obese by definition (BMI <30 kg/m(2)). IGF-I and IGFBP-3 concentrations did not correlate to variations in spontaneous GH secretion in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the little effect on final height, we found impaired spontaneous GH secretion in 79% of young adults 20-32 years of age, and GH deficiency (GHD) in 47% after low-dose cranial irradiation in early childhood. The consequences of this low-GH secretion need to be investigated.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Jarfelt, M', 'Bjarnason, R', 'Lannering, B']","['Jarfelt M', 'Bjarnason R', 'Lannering B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Sahlgrenska Academy of Goteborg University, Goteborg, Sweden. marianne.jarfelt@vgregion.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Body Height', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/physiopathology/*radiotherapy']",,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.20020 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Jun;42(7):582-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The risk of secondary neoplasm was studied in a cohort of 1,577 patients treated for childhood cancer registered in the Cancer Registry of Slovenia (CRS) between 1961 and 2000. The time at risk was defined from the date of diagnosis of first malignancy to the time of death or the end of the study. RESULTS: The most frequent primary malignancies were: acute leukemia 28.5%, central nervous system (CNS) tumors 21.3%, and lymphomas 16.6%. Median observation time was 7.8 years. Forty-eight patients developed second neoplasms. CNS tumors, acute leukemias, and thyroid carcinoma were most frequent second neoplasms. The cumulative risk for second neoplasm in the entire cohort was 0.06% at 5 years, 5.1% at 15 years, and 12.6% at 25 years after diagnosis of first cancer.

The formation of the tandem diabody is determined by the association of complementary V(H) and V(L) domains located on different polypeptide chains, and depends on the length and probably the amino acid composition of the three linkers joining the variable domains. We generated a number of single-chain constructs using four V(H) and V(L) domains specific either for human CD3, a component of T-cell receptor (TCR) complex, or for CD19, a human B-cell antigen, separated by different rationally designed peptide linkers of 6-27 amino acid residues.

We sought structural changes in the MCL-1 gene in CLL patients and associated these with clinical parameters of the disease. METHODS: The MCL-1 gene from peripheral blood lymphocytes from 58 CLL patients and 18 control subjects and from the RL and BC-3 lymphoma cell lines was sequenced. Mcl-1 mRNA expression (in 20 consecutive patients and four control subjects) was analyzed by RNase protection assay, and Mcl-1 protein expression (in 18 consecutive patients and four controls) was analyzed by western blotting. Genetic changes in MCL-1 were associated with biochemical and clinical characteristics, including expression of CD38, a negative prognostic factor. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to determine the prognostic importance of changes in the MCL-1 gene, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze patient survival. All statistical tests were two sided. RESULTS: A 6- or 18-nucleotide sequence insertion was found in the same site in the MCL-1 promoter in 17 of 58 patients and in BC-3 cells; it was absent in all control subjects and in RL cells. Of 21 CD38-negative patients, 10 had a promoter insertion; of 17 CD38-positive patients, one had a promoter insertion (P =.0099). Patients with a promoter insertion had higher mRNA (median = 26.8 relative units, interquartile range [IQR] = 14.9 to 35.2, versus median = 8.8 relative units, IQR = 3.9 to 15.7, P =.030, U-test) and protein (median = 0.84 relative units, IQR = 0.81 to 1.0 versus median = 0.47, IQR = 0.32 to 0.70, P =.021, U-test) expression, more rapid disease progression (P =.012), poorer response to chemotherapy (P =.001), and shorter overall (P =.0088) and disease-specific (P <.001) survival than patients with a normal promoter. The presence of an MCL-1 promoter insertion had prognostic significance in a Cox model (P =.001).

Reports suggest that imatinib may also be effective against ABL and platelet-derived growth factor receptor kinase-dependent pathological conditions. These mechanisms provide a wide scope of possible clinical applications for the drug. Potentially, diseases instigated by constitutive kinase activity that can be inhibited with imatinib should be treatable with this drug. We evaluated the effects of imatinib on the viability, cycling, and tyrosine phosphorylation of ATC cells in vitro. Our data indicate that imatinib has negligible antineoplastic activity against ATC cell lines within established therapeutically useful concentrations. No constitutive kinase activity was detected in these cell lines that could be exploited as a therapeutic target by imatinib.

OBJECTIVE: To describe preimplantation HLA typing, not involving identification of a causative gene, for couples who had children with bone marrow disorders at need for HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: HLA matching procedures conducted at a single site during 2002-2003 in an in vitro fertilization program for 9 couples with children affected by acute lymphoid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or Diamond-Blackfan anemia requiring HLA-matched stem cell transplantation. In 13 clinical cycles, DNA in single blastomeres removed from 8-cell embryos following in vitro fertilization was analyzed for HLA genes simultaneously with analysis for short tandem repeats in the HLA region to select and transfer only those embryos that were HLA matched to affected siblings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of HLA matching and pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: As a result of testing a total of 199 embryos, 45 (23%) HLA-matched embryos were selected, of which 28 were transferred in 12 clinical cycles, resulting in 5 singleton pregnancies and birth of 5 HLA-matched healthy children.

AGN193198 also abolished growth (by 50% at 130-332 nM) and induced apoptosis in primary cultures established from prostatic carcinoma (13 patients) and gastrointestinal carcinoma (1 patient). Apoptosis was induced rapidly, as indicated by mitochondrial depolarization and DNA fragmentation. Molecular events provoked by AGN193198 included activation of caspase-3, -8, -9, and -10 (by 4-6 h) and the production of BID/p15 (by 6 h).

However, very little is known about FAK in normal and leukemic myeloid cells. In this study, FAK protein expression and mRNA were detected in 25 of 60 cases (42%) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whereas FAK was expressed in 46% of CD34+ AML cells, it was not detected in normal purified CD34+ cells. Conversely, the FAK homologue proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) was found to be expressed both in normal and leukemic myeloid cells. When expressed, FAK displayed phosphorylation on Tyr-397, an important step for its activation. Moreover, FAK expression was correlated with the phosphorylation of PYK2 on Tyr-881, a critical site for the PYK2 function in cell migration. FAK+ AML cells displayed significantly higher migration capacities and resistance to daunorubicin, compared with FAK- cells. The implication of FAK in both cell motility and drug resistance was demonstrated by small interfering RNA experiments with the FAK-positive KG1 cell line. However, adhesion on fibronectin efficiently protected FAK- AML cells from daunorubicin-mediated killing, suggesting that cellular adhesion mediated-drug resistance is not mediated by FAK. Finally, in a retrospective cohort of 60 AML patients, FAK expression was significantly correlated with high blast cell count, early death, and shorter survival rate. Altogether, this study shows that FAK is aberrantly expressed and activated in about half of the cases of AML and suggests that FAK may contribute to the regulation of AML cell transit from the marrow to blood compartment and that it may influence clinical outcome.",,"['Recher, Christian', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Ruidavets, Jean-Bernard', 'Cariven, Pascal', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Payrastre, Bernard', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Racaud-Sultan, Claire']","['Recher C', 'Ysebaert L', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Ruidavets JB', 'Cariven P', 'Demur C', 'Payrastre B', 'Laurent G', 'Racaud-Sultan C']","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale Unite 563, Departement d'Oncogenese et Signalisation Cellulaire dans les Cellules Hematopoietiques, Institut Federatif de Recherche (IFR)30, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology']",,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-3005 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 May 1;64(9):3191-7. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-3005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible stress protein that catalyzes the degradation of heme and has recently been implicated in the regulation of growth and survival of various neoplastic cells. In the present study, we analyzed the expression and role of HO-1 in CML cells. As assessed by Northern and Western blot analysis as well as immunostaining, primary CML cells were found to express HO-1 mRNA and the HO-1 protein in a constitutive manner. Exposure of these cells to the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 resulted in decreased expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein. In addition, BCR/ABL was found to up-regulate HO-1 promoter activity, mRNA levels, and protein levels in Ba/F3 cells. To investigate the role of HO-1 for survival of primary CML cells, the HO-1 inducer hemin was used. Hemin-induced expression of HO-1 was found to protect CML cells from STI571-induced cell death. In addition, inhibition of HO-1 by zinc-(II)-deuteroporphyrin-IX-2,4-bisethyleneglycol resulted in a substantial decrease of cell viability.

Incorporation of FLT3 inhibitors into existing chemotherapeutic regimens has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in this high-risk group of patients. CEP-701, an indolocarbazole-derived selective FLT3 inhibitor, potently induces apoptosis in FLT3/ITD-expressing cell lines and primary leukemic blasts. We conducted a series of in vitro cytotoxicity experiments combining CEP-701 with chemotherapy using the FLT3/ITD-expressing cell lines MV4-11 and BaF3/ITD as well as a primary blast sample from a patient with AML harboring a FLT3/ITD mutation. CEP-701 induced cytotoxicity in a synergistic fashion with cytarabine, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, or etoposide if used simultaneously or immediately following exposure to the chemotherapeutic agent. In contrast, the combination of pretreatment with CEP-701 followed by chemotherapy was generally antagonistic, particularly with the more cell cycle-dependent agents such as cytarabine. This effect appears to be due to CEP-701 causing cell cycle arrest. We conclude that in FLT3/ITD-expressing leukemia cells, CEP-701 is synergistic with standard AML chemotherapeutic agents, but only if used simultaneously with or immediately following the chemotherapy. These results should be considered when designing trials combining chemotherapy with each of the FLT3 inhibitors currently in clinical development.",,"['Levis, Mark', 'Pham, Rosalyn', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Small, Donald']","['Levis M', 'Pham R', 'Smith BD', 'Small D']","['Department of Oncology, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. levisma@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Carbazoles/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Furans', 'Indoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/05/06 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2004-01-0388 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43556-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Aug 15;104(4):1145-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2004-01-0388.

As trioxide (As(2)0(3)) has been recently used as a mitochondria-targeting drug in acute promyelocytic leukemia. In the present study, we examined the intracellular action of these metals using rat kidney tubular cells and cells tolerant to the metals. The cells were cultured with CdCl(2) (1-10 micro M) or As(2)O(3) (1-2.5 micro M). Cells tolerant to Cd and As (Cd-T and As-T, respectively) were defined as cells that survived at toxic concentrations of each metal. Both Cd and As induced cell toxicity in a dose-dependent fashion, which was accompanied by fragmented DNA and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) increased with the increase of Cd and As concentration. In Cd-T and As-T cells, GSH levels were twice those observed in normal cells. When each metal-tolerant culture was exposed to the other different metal, i.e., As or Cd, the protective property was maintained. However, when buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) was added to the metal-tolerant cultures, apoptosis was restored in both Cd-T and As-T. Our results indicate that (1) although GSH is increased in NRK52E by the addition of Cd and As, mitochondria-mediated apoptosis can be still induced, (2) the protective property against metal-induced cytotoxicity is identical in Cd-T and As-T cultures, and (3) although GSH was higher in the metal-tolerant cell lines, depression of GSH by BSO induced apoptosis. We conclude that Cd- and As-induced apoptosis is mediated by an identical mechanism involving intracellular GSH reactive oxidation.",,"['Jimi, Shiro', 'Uchiyama, Masanobu', 'Takaki, Aya', 'Suzumiya, Jyunji', 'Hara, Syuji']","['Jimi S', 'Uchiyama M', 'Takaki A', 'Suzumiya J', 'Hara S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukuoka University, 7-45-1 Nanakuma, Jonanku, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan. sjimi@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic/*toxicity', 'Cadmium/*toxicity', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Glutathione/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney Tubules/cytology', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Metallothionein/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats']",,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-662-41088-2_32 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2004 Apr;1011:325-31. doi: 10.1007/978-3-662-41088-2_32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In unstimulated interphase cells calmodulin was concentrated in the cell cortex and at a single central location. Disruption of cortical actin eliminated the concentration of calmodulin at the cortex while the central calmodulin concentration was associated with an enrichment of tubulin and is likely to represent the centrosome. Following stimulation with either an agonist that crosslinks Fc receptors or co-application of phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore the interior of the cells lost calmodulin while cortical fluorescence became more pronounced but also less uniform. After stimulation discrete bright puncta of calmodulin-EGFP (CaM-EGFP) appeared in the cell interior. Puncta colocalised with moving lysotracker-labelled granules, suggesting that calmodulin may play a role in organising their transport.

Chronic myelofibrosis is a clonal disorder with marrow fibrosis, myeloid metaplasia, gross splenomegaly, and teardrop cells. Acute myelofibrosis differs by its aggressiveness, by the fact that it is more common in children, and by lack of organomegaly or anisopoikilocytosis. Surprisingly, in early childhood and infancy, splenomegaly and teardrop red cells become an important feature. Infantile myelofibrosis is a rare disease, except in Down syndrome. Familial occurrence of infantile myelofibrosis is exceedingly rare. The author describes an unfortunate family whose four consecutive children died of a very fulminant form of acute myelofibrosis during their first year of life. The fulminant nature of the disease, the degree of splenomegaly, and the prominence of anisopoikilocytosis were even more marked than in currently reported cases of infantile myelofibrosis. The mode of inheritance remained illusive. With two female children, sex-linked inheritance was not possible. It could not have been inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with normal parents and with two normal children from the father's second marriage. A new autosomal dominant mutation in the germ cell of either parent is another possibility. Autosomal recessive inheritance remained a logical explanation, although such a high degree of disease presentation in a non-consanguineous marriage seems to put that possibility in question.",,"['Sheikha, Anwar']",['Sheikha A'],"['Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, King Khalid University, P.O.

However, inadequate folinic acid rescue is often not considered as a cause of this complication. To clarify whether adequate folinic acid rescue prevents methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity without reducing the cure rate in childhood ALL, published evidence that supported or refuted this claim was investigated. A literature search was conducted and the authors of the relevant studies were contacted. The published data supported the contention that neurotoxicity can be prevented by adequate folinic acid rescue even after very high doses of methotrexate. The safe minimum dose of folinic acid can be defined in terms of the dose of methotrexate given; the time to start of rescue is probably less important. There was no evidence that higher doses of folinic acid, such as those used after methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma, rescue leukemia cells. No change in cure rate was found in relation to changes in scheduling or clinically relevant doses of folinic acid rescue. The accumulation of folinic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid did not seem to be of clinical relevance. No studies indicate that doses of folinic acid after high-dose methotrexate administration interfere with the killing of leukemia cells, nor that delaying the start of rescue beyond a certain point increases the antileukemic effect; neurotoxicity will, however, be increased. Review of current protocols that use low-dose folinic acid rescue and are associated with neurotoxicity is highly recommended.",,"['Cohen, Ian J']",['Cohen IJ'],"[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, 14 Kaplan Street, Petah Tiqva 49202, Israel. icohen@tau.ac.il""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/*therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",60,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/07/02 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200403000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Mar;26(3):156-63. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200403000-00004.,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 Jun;26(6):333-5.

When these disorders occur on the hands, they are often clinically indistinguishable, but they can sometimes be separated histologically by the presence of papillary dermal edema (Sweet's syndrome), ulceration and necrosis (pyoderma gangrenosum), or vasculitis (pustular vasculitis). These distinctions may be arbitrary, however, and reflect differences in the temporal course of the disease and in the degree of inflammation at the time of biopsy. METHODS: We report four cases of neutrophilic dermatosis affecting the hands and a review of the literature for similar cases. RESULTS: Of the four patients presented, two had associated carcinomas and one had myelodysplasia in transition to leukemia. The cutaneous symptoms preceded the finding of an occult malignancy. Thirty-two reported cases of neutrophilic dermatoses presenting on the hands showed clinicopathologic features similar to those in our series. Taken together, the mean age at diagnosis was 60.5 years, and 58% of the patients were female. Twenty-five per cent (nine patients) also had myelodysplasia or leukemia, 14% (five patients) ulcerative colitis, 6% (two patients) carcinoma, 6% (two patients) Crohn's disease, and 6% (two patients) seropositive arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: These cases illustrate the importance of recognizing that neutrophilic dermatoses may present uniquely or predominantly on the hands. This presentation is distinctive, and prompt diagnosis may prevent unnecessary medical or surgical therapy and may lead to the earlier diagnosis and treatment of an associated malignancy or other systemic disorder.",,"['Weenig, Roger H', 'Bruce, Alison J', 'McEvoy, Marian T', 'Gibson, Lawrence E', 'Davis, Mark D P']","['Weenig RH', 'Bruce AJ', 'McEvoy MT', 'Gibson LE', 'Davis MD']","['Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. weenig.roger@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Hand Dermatoses/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/surgery', 'Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/therapy', 'Precancerous Conditions/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sweet Syndrome/*pathology/therapy']",34,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.01845.x [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2004 Feb;43(2):95-102. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-4632.2004.01845.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the recent GMALL study minimal residual disease (MRD) was added to the risk model. Trials in childhood and adult ALL showed convincingly that MRD is a relevant and independent prognostic factor. It is of particular value in standard risk (SR) patients as defined by conventional factors. In the current GMALL study a risk stratification according to conventional factors is followed by a MRD based stratification in SR patients. Whereas high and very high risk patients receive a stem cell transplantation (SCT) in first CR after induction and first consolidation, SR patients receive cyclic consolidation therapy for one year with MRD monitoring. At the end of the first year a stratification according to course and level of MRD takes place. Treatment is stopped in patients with low risk whereas in high risk patients a SCT is planned. Patients who cannot be allocated to either group are treated as intermediate risk and receive one year of intensified maintenance therapy.

Severe side effects are encountered in all patients of which, however, only the minority is life-threatening. The leading cause of failure in childhood ALL is still recurrence of disease. To reduce the rate of relapses, but also to limit treatment morbidity, the ALL-BFM group has aimed to improve the risk-adaptation of therapy. The most important addition to clinical factors (e.g. age, WBC, extramedullary involvement), and biological characteristics (such as immunphenotype and cytogenetics), was the recognition of early in vivo treatment response as the strongest predictor for relapse. The determination of leukemic blasts in peripheral blood after exposure to 7 days of prednisone (PRED) and one dose of intrathecal methotrexate (prednisone response) as developed by BFM identified multidrug resistant patients: Such patients had still more than 1,000 blasts per microL at day 8 of therapy (defined as PRED poor responders, 10% of all patients). Prognosis for these was only approximately 35% as compared to approximately 80% in patients with adequate PRED response. Patient characteristics at relapse reveal that most of them were originally comprised in ""good risk"" patient subgroups: e.g., in trial ALL-BFM 90, 50% of the relapses were noted in patients with c-ALL even though that group had an EFS of 82% (SE 1%). 70% of the recurrences are found among patients with good response to PRED indicating the lack of specificity in the definition of that subgroup. Therefore, the more refined way of determining in vivo response based on the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) at defined timepoints by identifying clone-specific T-cell receptor- (TCR) or immunglobuline (Ig) gene rearrangements appears to be able to define the patient at high risk to relapse more specifically. In the current ALL-BFM strategy, the high sensitivity of the method is utilized to apply treatment reduction in patients with fast clearance of leukemia. Persistent disease in contrast is an indication for treatment modification and intensification.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred-nine children with previously untreated AML were registered in the LAME 89/91 protocol. This three-cycle intensive regimen included an induction phase (mitoxantrone plus cytarabine) and, for non-allografted patients, two consolidation courses, one containing timed-sequential high-dose cytarabine, asparaginase and amsacrine. In the LAME 89 study, patients were given an additional MT consisting of mercaptopurine and cytarabine for 18 months. In the LAME 91 trial, patients were randomized to be given or not MT after consolidation therapy. RESULTS: Out of 309 patients, 276 (90%) achieved a complete remission. The overall survival (OS) and event-free survival at 6 years for all patients were 60% +/- 6% and 48% +/- 6%, respectively. For the complete responders after consolidation therapy, the 5-year OS was significantly better in patients randomized for no further treatment than in patients randomized for MT (81% +/- 13% vs 58% +/- 15%; p = 0.04) whilst the 5-year disease-free survival was not significantly different (60% +/- 19% vs 50% +/- 15%; p = 0.25). The improvement of OS in MT-patients appeared to be related to a higher salvage rate after relapse. CONCLUSION: Over 50% of patients can be cured of AML in childhood. In the context of a very short and drug-intensive regimen, low-dose MT, owing to the lack of improvement in disease control and the worsening of survival, should not be recommended. Over the past 20 years, the outcome of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in children has improved substantially. In the eighties, complete remission (CR) was achieved in nearly 90% of patients but event-free survival (EFS) was poor. Myeloablative therapy followed by allogenic bone-marrow transplantation (allo BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling was demonstrated, in our experience, to be the treatment of choice for improving DFS in children with AML in first remission. The major issue was how best to maintain complete remission for patients without an HLA sibling donor. Whereas several groups continued to include low-dose MT and others decided to omit it, in 1991, our group undertook a prospective randomized trial (LAME 91 protocol), the main aim of which was to assess the efficacy of MT in addition to an intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy.

Since 1995 the most recent trial AML 12 has taken those figures to two thirds event free survival and similar overall survival. Resistant disease rates remain at 4% overall but the death rate in complete remission has fallen from 11% to 6% despite increasing intensity of therapy, and due to advances in supportive care including nutrition and antibiotics/antifungals. However, although relapse rates have continued to fall, the biggest challenge is to reduce the currently one third relapse rate. We are much better at predicting who is likely to relapse, based mainly on primary resistance to therapy and karyotype. Analysis of 629 out of the last 808 cases in whom cytogenetic testing was successful (78%) has shown very clearly that t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16) are independent good risk features. Additionally, loss of a sex chromosome in the 8;21 group defines a group which does exceptionally well, with 93% EFS at 5 years. Chromosome 7 abnormalities also remain of independent prognostic significance when age, WHO classification and white cell count are taken into account, with monosomy 7 doing even worse than 7q abnormalities. The current trial MRC AML 15 investigates the role of fludarabine--idarubicin combination therapy in the induction courses and the role of high dose cytarabine during consolidation; the aim being to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity, particularly that involving the heart.

Thus, inappropriate modulation of chromatin structure by HDACs and subsequently repression of gene expression that is critical for myeloid differentiation appear to be major factors in the development of the disease. They identify inhibitors of HDACs as prime candidates for novel anti leukemic drugs. Over the last years several candidate compounds have been introduced into clinical trials and have successfully been used in compassionate use protocols. Amongst them phenylbutyrate served as the first example to establish proof of principle. Novel drugs such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are developed for example by modifications of the microbial HDAC inhibitory compound trichostatin A with a hydroxamic acid as the key structural element. The branched chain carboxylic acid valproic acid (VPA) that is in use as antiepileptic drug over decades was also discovered to inhibit HDACs and preferentially class I HDACs. HDAC inhibition is likely to mediate the teratogenic side effects of VPA but not the antiepileptic activity. In contrast to other HDAC inhibitors VPA also induces proteasomal degradation of HDAC2. None of the currently available compounds may be the optimum HDAC inhibitory drug but each of them may serve to answer urgent questions concerning the concept of HDAC inhibition in the treatment of malignant diseases. Prominent questions are i) whether and by which mechanisms HDAC inhibition can be expected to affect a malignant disease not only in the early stage but also at later stages that have acquired additional genetic defects, ii) which forms of cancer in addition to myelocytic leukemia respond to HDAC inhibition, iii) by which markers those susceptible forms could be identified and iv) which individual HDACs are the most critical isoenzymes to address in treatment of malignant diseases.",,"['Gottlicher, M']",['Gottlicher M'],"['Institute of Toxicology and Environmental Hygiene, Technical University Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Valproic Acid/*pharmacology']",27,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0850-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004;83 Suppl 1:S91-2. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0850-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid malignancies are appropriate disease targets, in that they express relevant biologic targets, such as Ras, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), AKT, and others that may depend upon farnesyl protein transferase (FTase) activity to promote proliferation and survival. Phase I trials in acute leukemias and myelodysplasia have demonstrated biologic and clinical activities as determined by target enzyme inhibition, low toxicity, and both complete and partial responses. As a result, phase II trials have been initiated in a variety of hematologic malignancies and disease settings, in order to further validate clinical activity and to identify downstream signal transduction targets that may be modified by these agents. It is anticipated that these studies will serve to define the optimal roles of FTIs in patients with hematologic malignancies and provide insight into effective methods by which to combine FTIs with other agents.",,"['Karp, J E', 'Lancet, J E']","['Karp JE', 'Lancet JE']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans Street, Room 289, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)']",IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2004/05/06 05:00,2004/07/01 05:00,['2004/05/06 05:00'],"['2004/05/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-004-0850-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2004;83 Suppl 1:S87-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-004-0850-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It represents the only established example of successful differentiation therapy. With current therapy which includes all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy for induction, anthracycline-based consolidation and maintenance with ATRA and/or low-dose chemotherapy, approximately 75-85% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) remain alive and disease-free at 5 years, and most patients are likely to be cured, an unprecedented achievement in the field of hematologic malignancies. However, several causes for failure to be cured need to be addressed. The first is early death which occurs in approximately 10% and is frequently attributable to hemorrhage due to the characteristic coagulopathy. The second is relapse, particularly in intermediate- and high-risk patients. Analyses of new prognostic factors may permit refinement of current risk classification and identify patients warranting alternative therapy. Finally, long-term consequences of current treatment will be important to recognize, including delayed cardiomyopathy, extramedullary relapse related to sanctuary sites, and the potential for second malignancies. For patients who do relapse, arsenic trioxide appears to be the treatment of choice since the majority of patients achieve a second complete morphologic, cytogenetic, and even molecular remission. While some patients achieving a second complete remission have prolonged disease-free survival with consolidation and maintenance arsenic, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation appears to offer the highest likelihood of cure.

The antiproliferative and proapopotic effects of STI-571 in these experiments are mainly explained by its ability to specifically block the fusion-protein BCR/ABL which has a constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity. We investigated the effects of STI-571 in combination with Ara-C on BCR/ABL negative leukemia cell lines and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells in-vitro. Raji, HL-60, K562, Kasumi and KG1a leukemia cells and CD34+ cells from healthy donors were incubated with 5-20 microg/ml Ara-C for 5 h alone or in combination with 10 microg/ml STI-571. Intracellular levels of Ara-CTP measured by HPLC were increased 1.5-3 fold in leukemia cells with most promiment effects in HL-60, Kasumi and Raji cells. In HL-60 cells a linear correlation between the concentration of STI-571 (1-10 microg/ml) and the subsequent levels of Ara-CTP was observed. A linear increase of Ara-CTP could be induced by increasing the incubation time with STI-571 from 2-6 h with a ceiling effect after 8 h. In contrast coincubation of mononuclear cells or purified CD34+ cells with STI-571 at therapeutic concentrations lead to decreased intracellular levels of Ara-CTP. The synergism between Ara-C and STI-571 was even more pronounced in Raji and HL-60 cells when 300 ng/ml G-CSF were added at the beginning of the culture period.

Whilst in many instances it remains uncertain as to which abnormalities represent primary events in the pathogenesis of AML, those which provide critical second hits that are required for progression to full blown leukemia or those that are merely markers of the leukemic process, it is nevertheless clear that diagnostic karyotype is a key determinant of outcome in this disease. Indeed there is mounting evidence to support the notion that cytogenetic analysis can serve to identify biologically distinct subsets of AML that demand tailored therapeutic approaches. This underpins the trend towards more widespread adoption of routine cytogenetic and molecular analysis in the characterization of patients with a diagnosis of acute leukemia.

Two tyrosine residues in the ITAM (immuno-receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) of CD3 epsilon were required for apoptosis signalling of Jurkat T lymphocytes. Stable cell lines TJK and T3JK produced from CD8(-) Jurkat T lymphocytes by transfection with wild-type and mutant CD8 epsilon (fusion of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of human CD8 alpha to the intracellular domain of mouse CD3 epsilon), were used with CD8(-) Jurkat T lymphocytes for studying the role of single intact CD3 epsilon. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapeutic drug can induce cell death of many tumour cell lines. In the present experiments, we examined the expression of caspase-3, p53 and Bid in the three cell lines induced by 5-FU and/or anti-CD8 antibody. We found high expression of p53 during activation-induced cell death of TJK cells mediated by anti-CD8 antibody and apoptosis of TJK and T3JK induced by 5-FU, implicating p53 involvement in apoptosis of leukemia cells induced by anti-CD8 antibody and 5-FU. We also detected the active form of caspase-3 and Bid in apoptotic leukemia cells after treatment with 5-FU and/or anti-CD8 antibody, indicating that the drug and antibody induced cell death through caspase-3 and the signal pathway may involve the Bcl-2 protein family. Our results showed that combined treatment with 5-FU and anti-CD8 antibody could enhance the rate of apoptosis induced by 5-FU or anti-CD8 antibody through increased expression of p53 and by promoting activation of caspase-3 and Bid. This suggests that the combination of 5-FU and anti-CD8 antibody may play an important role in inducing apoptosis of leukemia cells.","['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Cheng, Hong', 'Liu, Yanxin', 'Liu, Shilian', 'Zheng, Dexian']","['Cheng H', 'Liu Y', 'Liu S', 'Zheng D']","['National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cd3e protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorouracil/*pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/genetics/immunology/metabolism']",,2004/05/05 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/05/05 05:00'],"['2004/05/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.1083 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2004 May-Jun;22(3):187-95. doi: 10.1002/cbf.1083.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that monoallelic methylation of two CpG islands correlates with transcriptional silencing of L3MBTL, and that L3MBTL transcription occurs from the paternally derived allele in five individuals from two families. Expression of the paternally derived allele was observed in multiple hematopoietic cell types as well as in bone marrow derived mesenchymal cells. Deletions of 20q associated with myeloid malignancies resulted in loss of either the unmethylated or methylated allele.

To identify genes silenced by K9 modifications, we probed a human CpG island microarray with DNA obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in a cancer cell line using an anti-H3-K9 methylated antibody or an anti-H3-K9 acetylated antibody. Of the 27 clones with the highest signal ratio of K9 methylation over acetylation (Me/Ac), 13 contained repetitive sequences. Among 14 nonrepetitive clones, we identified 11 genes (seven known and four previously undescribed), one EST, and two unknown fragments. Using ChIP-PCR, all 18 examined clones showed higher ratios of H3-K9 Me/Ac than the active gene control, P21, thus confirming the microarray data. In addition, we found a strong correlation between the K9 Me/Ac ratio and CpG island DNA methylation (R = 0.92, P < 0.01), and five of seven genes examined (megalin, thrombospondin-4, KR18, latrophilin-3, and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase P101 subunit) showed lack of expression by RT-PCR and reactivation by DNA methylation and/or histone deacetylase inhibition, suggesting that these genes are true targets of silencing through histone modifications. All five genes also showed significant DNA methylation in a cell line panel and in primary colon cancers. Our data suggest that CpG island microarray coupled with ChIP can identify novel targets of gene silencing in cancer. This unbiased approach confirms the tight coupling between DNA methylation and histone modifications in cancer and could be used to probe gene silencing in nonneoplastic conditions as well.",,"['Kondo, Yutaka', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Yan, Pearlly S', 'Huang, Tim Hui-Ming', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Kondo Y', 'Shen L', 'Yan PS', 'Huang TH', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

AML1 binds to sequences present in the regulatory regions of a number of hematopoiesis-specific genes, including certain cytokines such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) up-regulated after T cell receptor stimulation. Here we show that both subunits of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (CN), which is activated upon T cell receptor stimulation, interact directly with the N-terminal runt homology domain-containing part of AML1. The regulatory CN subunit binds AML1 with a higher affinity and in addition also interacts with the isolated runt homology domain. The related Runx2 transcription factor, which is essential for bone formation, also interacts with CN. A constitutively active derivative of CN is shown to activate synergistically the GM-CSF promoter/enhancer together with AML1 or Runx2. We also provide evidence that relief of the negative effect of the AML1 sites is important for Ca(2+) activation of the GM-CSF promoter/enhancer and that AML1 overexpression increases this Ca(2+) activation. Both subunits of CN interact with AML1 in coimmunoprecipitation analyses, and confocal microscopy analysis of cells expressing fluorescence-tagged protein derivatives shows that CN can be recruited to the nucleus by AML1 in vivo. Mutant analysis of the GM-CSF promoter shows that the Ets1 binding site of the promoter is essential for the synergy between AML1 and CN in Jurkat T cells. Analysis of the effects of inhibitors of the protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and in vitro phosphorylation/dephosphorylation analysis of Ets1 suggest that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta-phosphorylated Ets1 is a target of AML1-recruited CN phosphatase at the GM-CSF promoter.",,"['Liu, Hebin', 'Holm, Magnus', 'Xie, Xiao-Qi', 'Wolf-Watz, Magnus', 'Grundstrom, Thomas']","['Liu H', 'Holm M', 'Xie XQ', 'Wolf-Watz M', 'Grundstrom T']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Umea University, Umea S-901 87, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Gsk3b protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcineurin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2004/05/05 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/05/05 05:00'],"['2004/05/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M403173200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71191-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jul 9;279(28):29398-408. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M403173200.

Whether pet, stray or feral, health status, indoor/outdoor access, and sex had no significant effect. Overall FCoV seropositivity was associated with time spent in a shelter but this association was not linear. Cats that had spent more than 60 days in a shelter were over five times as likely to be seropositive. This may be the result of a change in husbandry from solitary to communal housing for cats remaining in shelters long term. Rescue of cats for less than 60 days was not associated with a significant increasing risk of seropositivity. Significant variation existed in seropositivity between individual shelters overall and in cats rescued for less than 5 days. These findings may reflect inter-shelter variation in cat husbandry and variation in seropositivity of shelter intake respectively.",,"['Cave, Thomas A', 'Golder, Matthew C', 'Simpson, Joyce', 'Addie, Diane D']","['Cave TA', 'Golder MC', 'Simpson J', 'Addie DD']","['Institute for Comparative Medicine, Companion Animal Diagnostics, University of Glasgow, Bearsden Road, Glasgow, Scotland G61 1QH, UK. oncovetuk@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['*Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Cat Diseases/blood/*epidemiology/virology', 'Cats', 'Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Coronavirus, Feline/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2004/05/05 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/05/05 05:00'],"['2004/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.jfms.2004.01.003 [doi]', 'S1098612X04000348 [pii]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2004 Apr;6(2):53-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jfms.2004.01.003.,,,,,PMC7129206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It covers the insights made during the past 20 years into the destructive processes of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) related to cytokines. The biochemical knowledge of the matrix components (i.e. collagen) and enzymology (i.e. collagenase) available in the 1950s led to the identification of cells from synovial tissue producing collagenase (fibroblast-like cells) and their interaction with other immune cells, i.e. monocyte-macrophages (Mphi) and lymphocytes (1976-1979). This insight led to the isolation of soluble factors produced by Mphi, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TNF, the principal cytokines inducing collagenase and PGE(2) in many target cells (i.e. synovial fibroblasts, chondrocytes, bone-derived cells) (1981-1985). Further advances resulted from observations that, in clinical conditions (i.e. leukaemia, juvenile RA), a remission of fever and inflammation may occur spontaneously and that tissue catabolism may persist despite the absence of systemic inflammation; this gave rise to the concept and identification of endogenous cytokine inhibitors (i.e. IL-1 receptor antagonist and TNF soluble receptor) (1984-1989). The fourth milestone was the observation that the production of IL-1 and TNF by Mphi was induced mainly by direct contact with lymphocytes, prompting studies of the ligands and counter-ligands on Mphi and lymphocytes as well as inhibitors involved in this cell-cell contact, some of these inhibitors being involved in lipid metabolism and acute-phase proteins (HDL-apo A-1).",,"['Dayer, Jean-Michel']",['Dayer JM'],"['Division of Immunology and Allergy, University Hospital, 24, Rue Micheli-du-Crest, 1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland. jean-michel.dayer@hcuge.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,Best practice & research.

The main human health concern associated with benzene exposure is leukemia. The toxic effects of benzene are dependent on its metabolism by the cytochrome p450 enzyme system. The cytochrome p450 enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP2F2 are the major contributors to the bioactivation of benzene in rats and mice. Although benzene metabolism has been shown to occur with mouse and human lung microsomal preparations, little is known about the ability of human CYP2F to metabolize benzene or the lung cell types that might activate this toxicant. Our studies compared bronchiolar derived (BEAS-2B) and alveolar derived (A549) human cell lines for benzene metabolizing ability by evaluating the roles of CYP2E1 and CYP2F1. BEAS-2B cells that overexpressed CYP2F1 and recombinant CYP2F1 were also evaluated. BEAS-2B cells overexpressing the enzyme CYP2F1 produced 47.4 +/- 14.7 pmols hydroxylated metabolite/10(6) cells/45 min. The use of the CYP2E1-selective inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate and the CYP2F2-selective inhibitor 5-phenyl-1-pentyne demonstrated that both CYP2E1 and CYP2F1 are important in benzene metabolism in the BEAS-2B and A549 human lung cell lines. The recombinant expressed human CYP2F1 enzyme had a K(m) value of 3.83 microM and a V(max) value of 0.01 pmol/pmol p450 enzyme/min demonstrating a reasonably efficient catalysis of benzene metabolism (V(max)/K(m) = 2.6). Thus, these studies have demonstrated in human lung cell lines that benzene is bioactivated by two lung-expressed p450 enzymes.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Sheets, Patrick L', 'Yost, Garold S', 'Carlson, Gary P']","['Sheets PL', 'Yost GS', 'Carlson GP']","['School of Health Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2051, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1823-14-9 (5-phenyl-1-pentyne)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', '99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)', 'EC 1.14.13.- (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP2F1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 2)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Alkynes/pharmacology', 'Benzene/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Benzene Derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2E1 Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P450 Family 2', 'Ditiocarb/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lung/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2004/05/04 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/05/04 05:00'],"['2004/05/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.20010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2004;18(2):92-9. doi: 10.1002/jbt.20010.,,,"['HL13645/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL60143/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SEREX screening of testis libraries has previously identified cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) that may act as disease-specific targets for immunotherapy. Screening a testis cDNA expression library with serum from a DLBCL patient identified a total of 94 positive clones, representing 28 distinct antigens. Two of these antigens were novel, 8 were previously uncharacterised, and the remainder were proteins of known function. Screening of the antigens with sera from DLBCL (n = 10), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML, n = 10) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML, n = 10) patients, alongside normal healthy donor controls (n = 20), revealed that 7 of the antigens were recognised by DLBCL sera but not normal donor sera, whilst 2 of these antigens were also recognised by leukaemic sera. Some of the genes identified here were already known to be transcribed in DLBCL. The mRNA expression of the majority of the remaining antigens was confirmed in DLBCL cell lines using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR).

Children with the disease have been enrolled into international treatment protocols designed to improve survival and minimize the serious irreversible late effects. Our oncology unit uses the international protocol: GBTLI LLA-85 and 90, with the drugs methotrexate, cytosine, arabinoside, dexamethasone, and radiotherapy. However, these treatments can cause gonadal damage and growth impairment. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The authors analyzed 20 children off therapy in order to determine the role of the various doses of radiotherapy regarding endocrinological alterations. They were divided into 3 groups according to central nervous system prophylaxis: Group A underwent chemotherapy, group B underwent chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (18 Gy), and group C underwent chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (24 Gy). Serum concentrations of LH, FSH, GH, and testosterone were determined. Imaging studies included bone age, pelvic ultrasound and scrotum, and skull magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Nine of the patients who received radiotherapy had decreased pituitary volume. There was a significant difference in the response to GH and loss of predicted final stature (Bayley-Pinneau) between the 2 irradiated groups and the group that was not irradiated, but there was no difference regarding the radiation doses used (18 or 24 Gy). The final predicted height (Bayley-Pinneau) was significantly less (P = 0.0071) in both groups treated with radiotherapy.

Recently, we have found that high levels of ARTS induce apoptosis without additional pro-apoptotic stimuli. Further, ARTS promotes apoptosis in response to a wide variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli. Here, we report that the expression of ARTS is lost in all lymphoblasts of more than 70% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The loss of ARTS is specific, as the related non-apoptotic protein H5, bearing 83% identity to ARTS, is unaffected. During remission, ARTS expression is detected again in almost all patients. Two leukemic cell lines, ALL-1 and HL-60 lacking ARTS, were resistant to apoptotic induction by ara-C. Transfection of ARTS into these cells restored their ability to undergo apoptosis in response to this chemotherapeutic agent.

In all, 47 patients received intravenous (i.v.) busulfan and cyclophosphamide (i.v.BuCy2) with allotx at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) during 1995-1999. The remaining 1765 patients, whose data were supplied by the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR), received alternative preparative regimens, primarily Cy-total body irradiation ( approximately 45%) or oral BuCy ( approximately 35%) during 1997-1998. As patients were not randomized between conditioning regimens, the i.v.BuCy2-versus-alternative treatment effect is confounded with a possible center effect due to nontreatment differences associated with factors differing between MDACC and the IBMTR centers. Additional complications are that the i.v.BuCy2-MDACC patients all survived 100 days, and three prognostic subgroups were included. Bayesian sensitivity analyses were performed to assess treatment effect on the probability of 100-day mortality, over a range of possible MDACC-versus-IBMTR center effects.

Fourteen women with regular menstrual cycles and proven fertility, admitted to the hospital for tubal ligation, were randomly allocated to control or treatment groups. Mifepristone 200 mg was given on day LH+2. Surgery was performed on day LH+3 to LH+5. Biopsies were obtained from the ampullar and isthmic regions of the tubes. Expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was analysed using immunohistochemistry. All cytokines except IL-8 showed the same staining intensity both in the ampullar and isthmic region, while IL-8 was more pronounced in the ampullar region in both epithelial and stromal cells. Exposure to mifepristone made the spatial difference in IL-8 disappear and increased the expression of TNFalpha in the epithelium of the isthmus, but had no effect on the expression of TGFbeta1 or LIF.

CCE cells expressing Rx/rax as well as enhanced green fluorescent protein (CCE-RX/E cells) proliferated and remained in the undifferentiated state in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor, as did parental ES cells. We made use of mouse embryo retinal explant cultures to address the differentiation ability of grafted ES cells. Dissociated embryoid bodies were treated with retinoic acid for use as donor cells and cocultured with retina explants for 2 weeks. In contrast to the parental CCE cells, which could not migrate into host retinal cultures, CCE-RX/E cells migrated into the host retina and extended their process-like structures between the host retinal cells. Most of the grafted CCE-RX/E cells became located in the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers and expressed ganglion and horizontal cell markers.

To gain spatiotemporal insight into these oncogenic processes, we employed fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that the intracellular localization of each of the X-RAR alpha proteins was distinct from that of RAR alpha and established which portion(s) of each X-RAR alpha protein-X, RAR, or both-contributed to its altered localization. Using FRAP, we demonstrated that the intranuclear mobility of each X-RAR alpha was reduced compared to that of RAR alpha. In addition, the mobility of each X-RAR alpha was reduced further by ligand addition, in contrast to RAR alpha, which showed no change in mobility when ligand was added. Both the reduced baseline mobility of X-RAR alpha and the ligand-induced slowing of X-RAR alpha could be attributed to the protein interaction domain contained within X. RXR alpha aberrantly colocalized within each X-RAR alpha; colocalization of RXR alpha with promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-RAR alpha resulted in reduced mobility of RXR alpha. Thus, X-RAR alpha may interfere with RAR alpha through its aberrant nuclear dynamics, resulting in spatial and temporal sequestration of RXR alpha and perhaps other nuclear receptor coregulators critical for myeloid differentiation.",,"['Dong, Shuo', 'Stenoien, David L', 'Qiu, Jihui', 'Mancini, Michael A', 'Tweardy, David J']","['Dong S', 'Stenoien DL', 'Qiu J', 'Mancini MA', 'Tweardy DJ']","['Section of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2004/05/04 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/05/04 05:00'],"['2004/05/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.24.10.4465-4475.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 May;24(10):4465-75. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.10.4465-4475.2004.,,,"['R01 CA086430/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86430/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC400470,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Using data from the Danish Central Population Registry, the authors identified 1,999,072 parents of offspring born after 1935. By linking this nationwide population-based parent cohort to the Danish Psychiatric Central Register, they identified 19,856 parents of offspring with schizophrenia. Follow-up for cancer in the Danish Cancer Registry began on the date of birth of the oldest child or April 1, 1969, and ended on the date of cancer diagnosis, death, or Dec. 31, 1997, yielding a total of 48,343,430 person-years at risk and 211,681 cases of cancer. The relative risk for cancer among parents with schizophrenic offspring compared to parents with no schizophrenic offspring was estimated by Poisson regression analysis and adjusted for age, period, and number of children. RESULTS: The risk for all cancer was 1.01 for fathers and 1.00 for mothers of schizophrenics. Mothers of schizophrenic patients had an increased risk of 1.20 for lung cancer and a nonsignificant risk of 1.14 for tobacco-related cancers combined. Apart from a reduced risk for leukemia in both mothers and fathers of schizophrenics, there was no difference in risk for any other cancer.

From 1999 to 2001, 11 cases were diagnosed in this county of 23,982 people. Exposures related to a nearby naval air station such as jet fuel or an infectious agent carried by naval aviators have been hypothesized as potential causes. The possibility that the cluster could be attributed to chance was also considered. We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) to examine the likelihood that chance could explain this cluster. We also used SEER and California Cancer Registry data to evaluate rates of childhood leukemia in other U.S. counties with military aviation facilities. The age-standardized rate ratio (RR) in Churchill County was 12.0 [95% confidence interval (CI), 6.0-21.4; p = 4.3 times symbol 10(-9)]. A cluster of this magnitude would be expected to occur in the United States by chance about once every 22,000 years. The age-standardized RR for the five cases diagnosed after the cluster was first reported was 11.2 (95% CI, 3.6-26.3).

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1264 consecutive patients referred to an ocular oncology service because of space-occupying orbital lesions. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was carried out for 1264 consecutive patients referred for a suspected orbital mass over a 30-year period. The lesions were grouped into general categories, as shown in ""Results."" The specific diagnosis in each case was based on clinical findings, computed tomography scan results, magnetic resonance imaging results, and histopathologic analysis results, when available. The number and percentage of benign and malignant tumors per age group also was determined. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence of orbital tumors and pseudotumors. RESULTS: Among 1264 consecutive patients, the number and percentage of lesions in each general category were as follows: cystic, 70 cases (6%); vasculogenic, 213 cases (17%); peripheral nerve lesions, 23 (2%); optic nerve and meningeal tumors, 105 (8%); fibrocytic lesions, 13 (1%); osseous and fibro-osseous tumors, 21 (2%); cartilaginous lesions, 1 (<1%); lipocytic and myxoid lesions, 64 (5%); myogenic tumors, 36 (3%); lacrimal gland lesions, 114 (9%); primary melanocytic lesions, 11 (<1%); metastatic tumors, 91 (7%); lymphoma and leukemia lesions, 130 (10%); secondary orbital tumors, 142 (11%); histiocytic lesions, 17 (1%); thyroid-related orbitopathy, 67 cases (5%); other inflammatory lesions, 133 cases (11%); and miscellaneous other lesions, 13 (1%). The most common diagnoses were: lymphoid tumor (139 cases;11%), idiopathic orbital inflammation (135 cases; 11%), cavernous hemangioma (77 cases; 6%), lymphangioma (54 cases; 4%), meningioma (53 cases; 4%), optic nerve glioma (48 cases; 4%), metastatic breast cancer (44 cases;4%), orbital extension of uveal melanoma (41 cases; 3%), capillary hemangioma (36 cases;3%), rhabdomyosarcoma (35 cases; 3%), dermolipoma (31 cases; 3%), herniated orbital fat (30 cases; 2%), dermoid cyst (26 cases; 2%), varix (26 cases; 2%), dacryops (19 cases; 2%), and other less common lesions. Of the 1264 lesions, 810 (64%) were benign and 454 (36%) were malignant. The percentage of malignant lesions was 20% in children (age range, 0-18 years), 27% in young adults and middle-aged patients (age range, 19-59 years), and 58% in older patents (age range, 60-92 years). Rhabdomyosarcoma was the most common malignancy in children, representing 3% of all orbital masses, and lymphoma was the most common malignancy in older patients, representing 10% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of tumors and pseudotumors can involve the orbit. In this series of 1264 lesions, 64% were benign and 36% were malignant. The percentage of malignant tumors increased with age, with malignancies being common in older patients because of the higher incidence of lymphoma and metastasis in the elderly.",,"['Shields, Jerry A', 'Shields, Carol L', 'Scartozzi, Richard']","['Shields JA', 'Shields CL', 'Scartozzi R']","['Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Lecture', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology', 'Orbital Pseudotumor/classification/*epidemiology', 'Philadelphia/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2004/05/04 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/05/04 05:00'],"['2002/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ophtha.2003.01.002 [doi]', 'S0161-6420(03)01495-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 2004 May;111(5):997-1008. doi: 10.1016/j.ophtha.2003.01.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classical Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) based retroviral vectors have been used for over 20 years to transfer genes into dividing cells. Cell lines for production of retroviral vectors have become commonly available and modifications in retroviral vector design and use of envelope proteins have made the production of high titer, helper-free, infectious virus stocks relatively easy. More recently, lentiviral vectors, another class of retroviruses, have been modified for in vitro and in vivo gene transfer. The ability of lentiviral vectors to transduce non-dividing cells has made them especially attractive for in vivo gene transfer into differentiated, non-dividing tissues. Several improvements in helper plasmids and vectors have made lentivirus a safe vector system for ex vivo and in vivo gene transfer.

In mice, benzene induces chromosomal breaks as a primary mode of genotoxicity in the bone marrow (BM). Benzene-induced DNA lesions can lead to changes in hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that give rise to leukemic clones. To gain insight into the mechanism of benzene-induced leukemia, we investigated the DNA damage repair and response pathways in total bone marrow and bone marrow fractions enriched for HSC from male 129/SvJ mice exposed to benzene by inhalation. Mice exposed to 100 ppm benzene for 6h per day, 5 days per week for 2 week showed significant hematotoxicity and genotoxicity compared to air-exposed control mice. Benzene exposure did not alter the level of apoptosis in BM or the percentage of HSC in BM. RNA isolated from total BM cells and the enriched HSC fractions from benzene-exposed and air-exposed mice was used for microarray analysis and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Interestingly, mRNA levels of DNA repair genes representing distinct repair pathways were largely unaffected by benzene exposure, whereas altered mRNA expression of various apoptosis, cell cycle, and growth control genes was observed in samples from benzene-exposed mice. Differences in gene expression profiles were observed between total BM and HSC. Notably, p21 mRNA was highly induced in BM but was not altered in HSC following benzene exposure. The gene expression pattern suggests that HSC isolated immediately following a 2 weeks exposure to 100 ppm benzene were not actively proliferating. Understanding the toxicogenomic profile of the specific target cell population involved in the development of benzene-associated diseases may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of benzene-induced leukemia and may identify important interindividual and tissue susceptibility factors.",,"['Faiola, Brenda', 'Fuller, Elizabeth S', 'Wong, Victoria A', 'Recio, Leslie']","['Faiola B', 'Fuller ES', 'Wong VA', 'Recio L']","['CIIT Centers for Health Research, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzene/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Male', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2004/05/04 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/05/04 05:00'],"['2003/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2003/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2003.12.022 [doi]', 'S0027510704000673 [pii]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2004 May 18;549(1-2):195-212. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2003.12.022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both HSC and HPC are comprised within the population of CD34(+) cells, normally present in bone marrow (BM). In the present study, we have separated two different subpopulations of CD34(+) cells from CML marrow: Population I, enriched for CD34(+) Lin(-) cells; and Population II, enriched for CD34(+) CD36(-) CD38(-) CD45RA(-) Lin(-) cells, and assessed their progenitor cell content as well as their capacity to proliferate and expand in response to a combination of hematopoietic cytokines in serum- and stroma-free long-term liquid cultures. The absolute cell numbers recovered in Population I from normal and CML samples were similar; in contrast, we found that Population II from CML was amplified four-fold, as compared to normal. In spite of this latter observation, no significant differences were observed in terms of the absolute number of CFC when comparing Populations I and II from CML patients and normal subjects. Interestingly, the proliferation and expansion potentials of CML cells were clearly deficient as compared to their normal counterparts. Indeed, in cultures of Population I cells the maximum fold increase in total and progenitor cell numbers corresponded to 30 and 8%, respectively, of those observed in cultures of normal marrow-derived Population I cells. Such functional deficiencies were even more evident in Population II cells in which the maximum fold increase in total and progenitor cell numbers corresponded to 3 and 0.5%, respectively, of the levels found in cultures of Population II cells from normal marrow. The present study demonstrates that bone marrow-derived CD34(+) cells from CML patients possess functional abnormalities, clearly evident in the in vitro system used by us. Among the two CML subpopulations studied here, the more immature one (Population II; enriched for CD34(+) CD36(-) CD38(-) CD45RA(-) Lin(-) cells) was the one that showed the most severe abnormalities, as compared to its relatively more mature counterpart (Population I; enriched for CD34(+) Lin(-) cells).",,"['Chavez-Gonzalez, Antonieta', 'Rosas-Cabral, Alejandro', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge', 'Gonzalez, Jose Carlos', 'Mayani, Hector']","['Chavez-Gonzalez A', 'Rosas-Cabral A', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Gonzalez JC', 'Mayani H']","['Oncolgical Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, National Medical Center, IMSS, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",,2004/05/04 05:00,2004/06/23 05:00,['2004/05/04 05:00'],"['2003/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2003.11.005 [doi]', 'S0145212603003953 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 Jun;28(6):639-47. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2003.11.005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used CD34(+) cord blood cells, KG1a cell line, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a transformed HUVECs ECV-304 cells to study the effect of PF4 on cell adhesion. When CD34(+) cord blood cells were cultured either in fibronectin-coated (FN) culture plate or over the layer of HUVECs for 2h, a concentration-dependent increase of the number of adhered cells was observed in the culture containing PF4. FACS analysis revealed that the treatment of PF4 resulted in an increased expression of CD49d and CXCR-4 on CD34(+) cells. Moreover, when CD34(+) cells were expanded in the presence of PF4, the adhesive ability to culture plate of CD34(+) cells was significantly increased. To elucidate the mechanism of action of PF4, KG1a cells were incubated with or without PF4 for 2h on pre-established layer of ECV-304 cells. The percentage of CD49d(+) KG1a cells increased about 1.56 +/- 0.4 fold, and that of CD54(+) ECV-304 increased about 1.7 +/- 0.6 fold.

Allogeneic SCT early in the course of the disease did not significantly affect median survival in RA patients evaluated either according to FAB criteria (63.2 months in 17 SCT patients versus 64.4 months in 89 non-transplanted (non-SCT) patients) or in subgroups classified separately according to WHO (64.0 months in SCT versus 91.0 months in non-SCT RA patients and 66.2 months in SCT versus 43.0 months in non-SCT refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) patients) or International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) criteria despite decreased incidence of leukemic transformation (5% in SCT versus 32% in non-SCT patients). Neither univariate or multivariate analysis of different clinical and laboratory parameters revealed a significant effect of SCT on 3 or 5 years survival in RA patients. The most probable explanation was a relatively high rate of transplantation related mortality (41%) on one hand together with a slow disease progression towards leukemia (24% at 5 years in non-SCT) on the other hand. A more refined stratification of patients based on the combined WHO morphology classification and IPSS cytogenetic criteria revealed subgroup of 11 non-SCT patients with RCMD and poor karyotype with median survival significantly different from that in five SCT patients (9.2 months in non-SCT versus 89.3 months in SCT, P=0.05).

Women diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who decline both termination and chemotherapy often die with the previable fetus in utero. Safe use of chemotherapy, especially during the second and third trimester, have been reported, and pregnant women with cancer can accept therapy without definite neonatal harm. Here, we review the use of chemotherapy in pregnancy by trimester of exposure and summarise neonatal outcomes, including malformations, perinatal complications, and oldest age of neonatal follow-up.

During ethnobotanical fieldwork among the Yanomami Amerindians in Venezuela we observed that Phyllanthus piscatorum was exclusively cultivated and used by the women. Aerial parts of this herbaceous shrub are employed as fish poison and medicine to treat wounds and fungal infections. In addition, the leaves are used as tobacco substitute. Ethnobotanical data regarding the context of the use of this plant are presented. To validate ethnobotanical information related to its medicinal indications, antimicrobial, and antiprotozoal properties of water, methanol (MeOH) and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts were studied. No activity against Gram-positive bacterial strains but significant activity against the fungi Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and the yeast Candida albicans were found. All extracts showed weak in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The extracts were further investigated for cytotoxic effects in an in vitro test system with leukemia Jurkat T, HeLa, and human peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMCs). During the first 48 h the extracts did not exhibit any cytotoxicity. After 72 h the DCM extract potently inhibited viability of HeLa cells.

Oxysterol-resistant HL60 cells were generated by continuous exposure to three different oxysterols-25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC), 7-beta-hydroxycholesterol (7beta-OHC) and 7-keto-cholesterol (7kappa-C). We investigated the effects of 25-OHC, 7beta-OHC, 7kappa-C and the apoptotic agent staurosporine on these cells. The effect of the calcium channel blocker nifedipine on oxysterol cytotoxicity was also investigated. Differential display and real-time PCR were used to quantitate gene expression of oxysterol-sensitive and -resistant cells. Our results demonstrate that resistance to the cytotoxic effects of oxysterols is relatively specific to the type of oxysterol, and that the cytotoxicity of 25-OHC but not that of 7beta-OHC and 7kappa-C, appears to occur by a calcium dependent mechanism. Oxysterol-resistant cells demonstrated no significant difference in the expression of several genes previously implicated in oxysterol resistance, but expressed the bcl-2 gene at significantly lower levels than those observed in control cells. We identified three novel genes differentially expressed in resistant cells when compared to HL60 control cells.

The canonical Wnt pathway is one of the three major Wnt-mediated intracellular signaling pathways and is thought to activate Dvl followed by the stabilization of beta-catenin. In Xenopus, this pathway is involved in dorsal determination, anterior-posterior patterning during gastrulation, and neural induction. Here we describe a role for the Xenopus ELL (Eleven-nineteen Lysine-rich Leukemia) gene product in canonical Wnt signaling. Translocation of ELL has been associated with acute myeloid leukemia and the protein possesses three functional domains. We identified rELL-C from a rat brain cDNA library as a binding factor for Dishevelled (Dvl); it represents a partial sequence of rat ELL lacking the pol II elongation domain and has been shown to suppress canonical Wnt signaling. Next, we isolated two Xenopus homologs of ELL, xELL1 and xELL2. No obvious phenotypes were observed with microinjection of full-length xELL1 or xELL2 mRNA, however, microinjection with their occludin homology domain inhibited Wnt signaling at the level of Dvl and upstream of beta-catenin. Intracellular localization of microinjected xELL1- and xELL2-GFP mRNAs showed localization of the full-length products in the nucleus and the occludin-homology domain products in cytoplasm. These results raise the possibility that ELL, which is thought to function as a transcription factor in nuclei, can serve other, novel roles to suppress canonical Wnt signaling in the cytoplasm.",,"['Sakurai, Kenji', 'Michiue, Tatsuo', 'Kikuchi, Akira', 'Asashima, Makoto']","['Sakurai K', 'Michiue T', 'Kikuchi A', 'Asashima M']","['Department of Biology, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo, 3-8-1 Komaba, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Zoolog Sci,Zoological science,8702287,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DVL1 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Dishevelled Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, Xenopus)', '0 (ELL2 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Dishevelled Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Xenopus/*metabolism/physiology', 'Xenopus Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,2004/05/01 05:00,2004/08/10 05:00,['2004/05/01 05:00'],"['2004/05/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2108/zsj.21.407 [doi]'],ppublish,Zoolog Sci. 2004 Apr;21(4):407-16. doi: 10.2108/zsj.21.407.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present the results of a prospective multicenter study to investigate (1) whether relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can be determined in advance by serial analysis of chimerism, and (2) if outcome can be influenced by withdrawal of immunosuppression and/or by low-dose donor lymphocyte infusion when increasing MC is detected. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial and quantitative analysis of chimerism was performed using a fluorescent-based short-tandem-repeat-polymerase chain reaction in 163 children with ALL. RESULTS: One hundred one patients revealed complete chimerism (CC) or low-level MC (CC/low-level MC); increasing MC was found in 46 patients; and decreasing MC, in 16 patients. Relapse was significantly more frequent in patients with increasing MC (26 of 46) than in patients with CC/low-level MC (eight of 101) or in patients with decreasing MC (0 of 16; P <.0001). The probability of 3-year event-free survival (EFS) was 54% for all patients, 66% for patients with CC/low-level MC (n = 101), 66% for patients with decreasing MC (n = 16), and 23% for patients with increasing MC (n = 46; P <.0001).

How these regimens induce apoptosis is incompletely defined, especially in cells with nonfunctional p53. We report here that the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Bid is required for mitochondrial permeabilization and apoptosis induction by etoposide and gamma-radiation in p53 mutant T leukemic cells. Bid is not transcriptionally up-regulated in response to these stimuli but is activated by cleavage on aspartate residues 60 and/or 75, which are the targets of caspase-8 and granzyme B. Bid activity is not inhibitable by c-Flip(L), CrmA, or dominant negative caspase-9 and therefore is independent of inducer caspase activation by death receptors or the mitochondria. Caspase-2, which has been implicated as inducer caspase in DNA damage pathways, appeared to be processed in response to etoposide and gamma-radiation but downstream of caspase-9. Knock down of caspase-2 by short interfering RNA further excluded its role in Bid activation by DNA damage. Caspase-2 was implicated in the death receptor pathway however, where it contributed to effector caspase processing downstream of inducer caspases. Granzyme B-specific serpins could not block DNA damage-induced apoptosis, excluding a role for granzyme B in the generation of active Bid.

Because these conditions occur in myocardial ischemia and pressure overload, we investigated the regulation of CCN1 in cardiomyocytes in vitro and in the heart in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ang II, signaling via the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor, and alpha1-adrenergic stimulation with phenylephrine induced CCN1 expression in ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from 1- to 3-day-old rats. Cell culture supernatant of Ang II-treated cardiomyocytes induced migration of smooth muscle cells, which was abolished by neutralizing antibody to CCN1. Ang II- and phenylephrine-mediated induction of CCN1 expression in cardiomyocytes was completely abolished by inhibition of MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) or protein kinase C (PKC). Likewise, mechanical stretch induced CCN1 expression in cardiomyocytes, an effect that was prevented by AT1 receptor blockade or PKC inhibition. Similarly, pressure overload in vivo upregulated myocardial CCN1 expression levels via AT1 receptor- and PKC-dependent mechanisms. After myocardial infarction in mice, CCN1 expression was strongly induced in both ischemic and remote left ventricular myocardium. Marked CCN1 protein expression was noted in cardiomyocytes of patients with end-stage ischemic cardiomyopathy but was almost absent in nonfailing human myocardium. CONCLUSIONS: Pressure overload, ischemia, and neurohormonal factors, such as Ang II or alpha1-adrenergic stimuli, induce myocardial expression of CCN1, a potent proangiogenic factor, supporting the notion that CCN1 may play an important role in the adaptation of the heart to cardiovascular stress.",,"['Hilfiker-Kleiner, Denise', 'Kaminski, Karol', 'Kaminska, Agnieszka', 'Fuchs, Martin', 'Klein, Gunnar', 'Podewski, Edith', 'Grote, Karsten', 'Kiian, Ioulia', 'Wollert, Kai C', 'Hilfiker, Andres', 'Drexler, Helmut']","['Hilfiker-Kleiner D', 'Kaminski K', 'Kaminska A', 'Fuchs M', 'Klein G', 'Podewski E', 'Grote K', 'Kiian I', 'Wollert KC', 'Hilfiker A', 'Drexler H']","['Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (CCN1 protein, human)', '0 (CCN1 protein, mouse)', '0 (CCN1 protein, rat)', '0 (Cysteine-Rich Protein 61)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (calphostin complex)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'U5SYW473RQ (Telmisartan)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids', 'Angiotensin II/pharmacology', 'Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers', 'Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cysteine-Rich Protein 61', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myocardial Infarction/metabolism/pathology', 'Myocardial Ischemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Smooth Muscle/cytology/drug effects', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Norepinephrine/pharmacology', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Phenanthridines/pharmacology', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1/physiology', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/agonists/physiology', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'Telmisartan', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2004/05/01 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/05/01 05:00'],"['2004/05/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1161/01.CIR.0000127952.90508.9D [doi]', '01.CIR.0000127952.90508.9D [pii]']",ppublish,Circulation. 2004 May 11;109(18):2227-33. doi: 10.1161/01.CIR.0000127952.90508.9D.

ET-1 induces cardiac gene transcription and protein expression of antiapoptotic B cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2) in a calcineurin-dependent manner. A cellular target of adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein, p300 also activates bcl-2 transcription in cardiac myocytes and is required for their survival. p300 acts as a calcineurin-regulated nuclear factors of activated T lymphocytes (NFATc), downstream targets of calcineurin. In addition, the bcl-2 promoter contains multiple NFAT consensus sequences. These findings prompted us to investigate the role of NFATc in ET-1-dependent and p300-dependent bcl-2 transcription in cardiac myocytes. In primary cardiac myocytes prepared from neonatal rats, mutation of 2 NFAT sites within the bcl-2 promoter completely abolished the ET-1- and p300-induced increases in the activity of this promoter. We show here that p300 markedly potentiates the binding of NFATc1 to the bcl-2 NFAT element by interacting with NFATc1 in an E1A-dependent manner. On the other hand, stimulation of cardiac myocytes with ET-1 causes nuclear translocation of NFATc1, which interacts with p300 and increases DNA binding. Expression of E1A did not change the cardiac nuclear localization of NFATc1 but blocked its interaction with p300, DNA binding, and bcl-2 promoter activation. These findings suggest that ET-1-dependent NFATc signaling associates with p300 in the transactivation of bcl-2 gene in cardiac myocytes.",,"['Kawamura, Teruhisa', 'Ono, Koh', 'Morimoto, Tatsuya', 'Akao, Masaharu', 'Iwai-Kanai, Eri', 'Wada, Hiromichi', 'Sowa, Naoya', 'Kita, Toru', 'Hasegawa, Koji']","['Kawamura T', 'Ono K', 'Morimoto T', 'Akao M', 'Iwai-Kanai E', 'Wada H', 'Sowa N', 'Kita T', 'Hasegawa K']","['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC1 protein, human)', '0 (Nfatc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Ep300 protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Endothelin-1/*physiology', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*physiology', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,2004/05/01 05:00,2004/12/18 09:00,['2004/05/01 05:00'],"['2004/05/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/18 09:00 [medline]', '2004/05/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1161/01.RES.0000129701.14494.52 [doi]', '01.RES.0000129701.14494.52 [pii]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2004 Jun 11;94(11):1492-9. doi: 10.1161/01.RES.0000129701.14494.52.

Flavonoids are a group of differentiation-inducing chemicals with a potentially lower toxicology profile than retinoids. Flavonoid-rich polyphenol fractions from the pomegranate (Punica granatum) fruit exert anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, anti-eicosanoid, and pro-apoptotic actions in breast and prostate cancer cells and anti-angiogenic activities in vitro and in vivo. Here we tested flavonoid-rich fractions from fresh (J) and fermented (W) pomegranate juice and from an aqueous extraction of pomegranate pericarps (P) as potential differentiation-promoting agents of human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. Four assays were used to assess differentiation: nitro blue tetrazolium reducing activity, nonspecific esterase activity, specific esterase activity, and phagocytic activity. In addition, the effect of these extracts on HL-60 proliferation was evaluated. Extracts W and P were strong promoters of differentiation in all settings, with extract J showing only a relatively mild differentiation-promoting effect. The extracts had proportional inhibitory effects on HL-60 cell proliferation.

The Microbiology Laboratory's database of the University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece, was searched for cases of L. monocytogenes during the period from January 1990 to December 2002. Listerial meningitis occurred in three patients: one with brain tumour, one with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and one with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. All the patients were older than 70 and they were actively receiving therapy for their malignancy. L. monocytogenes type 4b was isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid. All were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, but they died shortly after the initiation of the treatment. Experience with the three present cases indicated the high mortality rate due to listerial meningitis in this immunosuppressed population.

Although often described as common, the incidence of this translocation in nodal lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma has never been investigated. Recent studies of patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (often corresponding to marrow-based lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma) have failed to identify the t(9;14). These studies have suggested that either nodal and marrow-based lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas have distinct pathogenetic mechanisms or that the t(9;14) is less frequent in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma than was believed previously. We therefore analyzed a series of nodal or other extramedullary lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas for the presence of the t(9;14) with paraffin section interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. We developed a BAC contig probe spanning all previously described PAX5 breakpoints and validated this assay with the KIS-1 cell line that expresses a t(9;14). Analysis with the PAX5 probe showed a lack of PAX5 rearrangements in all cases that were analyzed successfully. Similarly, analysis by an IGH fluorescence in situ hybridization probe showed no evidence of translocations involving the IGH locus.

In these cells, MS-275 demonstrated an in vitro LC(50) that was one log lower than for normal mononuclear cells. Following MS-275 treatment, histones H3 and H4 showed increased acetylation and HDAC enzymatic activity was reduced. Caspase-8, -9, and -3 were activated, and caspase substrates PARP and BID were cleaved. Additionally, FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) was downmodulated following MS-275 incubation. MS-275 treatment caused detectable ROS generation after 15 h of incubation, which was blocked by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. Overexpression of Bcl-2 protein protected against MS-275-induced apoptosis. These data demonstrate that MS-275 is a promising therapy for the treatment of CLL, but that in contrast to previous reports, ROS generation does not precede commitment to apoptosis.

The line was initially derived as a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-dependent strain that underwent replicative senescence and, following ethylnitrosourea treatment, as a phenotypically similar immortalized line. Immortalization was associated with broadened cytokine sensitivity but not growth autonomy, in contrast to three previously derived APL lines. Both the AP-1060 strain and line had shortened telomeres and low telomerase activity, while the line had higher expression of many genes associated with macromolecular synthesis. The karyotype was 46,XY,t(3;14)(p21.1;q11.2),t(15;17)(q22;q11)[100%]; the unique t(3;14) was observed in 4/9 t(15;17)-positive metaphase cells at previous relapse on ATRA therapy. The PML-RARalpha mRNA harbored a missense mutation in the RARalpha-region ligand-binding domain (Pro900Ser).

The curative potential of this procedure is mediated by donor-derived alloreactive T cells, resulting in a graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, B-CLL may escape T-cell-mediated immune reactivity since these cells lack expression of costimulatory molecules. We examined the most optimal method to transform B-CLL cells into efficient antigen-presenting cells (APC) using activating cytokines, by triggering toll-like receptors (TLRs) using microbial pathogens and by CD40 stimulation with CD40L-transfected fibroblasts. CD40 activation in the presence of IL-4 induced strongest upregulation of costimulatory and adhesion molecules on B-CLL cells and induced the production of high amounts of IL-12 by the leukemic cells. In contrast to primary B-CLL cells as stimulator cells, these malignant APCs were capable of inducing the generation of B-CLL-reactive CD8(+) CTL lines and clones from HLA class I-matched donors. These CTL lines and clones recognized and killed primary B-CLL as well as patient-derived lymphoblasts, but not donor cells.

The MLF1IP gene locus is at chromosome 4q35.1 and is composed of 14 exons spanning 75.8 kb of genomic DNA. The MLF1IP cDNA encodes a 46-kDa protein that contains two bipartite and two classical nuclear localization signals, two nuclear receptor-binding motifs (LXXLL), two leucine zippers, two PEST residues and several potential phosphorylation sites. MLF1IP transcripts are expressed in a variety of tissues (e.g. fetal liver, bone marrow, thymus and testis). MLF1IP appears to be a lineage-specific gene whose expression is confined exclusively to the CFU-E erythroid precursor cells, but not in mature erythrocytes.

Recent identification of SHP-2 mutations in childhood leukemia further emphasizes the importance of SHP-2 regulation in hematopoietic cells. We previously reported that SHP-2 played a positive role in IL-3-induced activation of Jak2 kinase in a catalytic-dependent manner. Interestingly, enforced expression of wild-type (WT) SHP-2 in Ba/F3 cells enhanced growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. Biochemical analyses revealed that although IL-3 activation of Jak2 kinase was increased, tyrosyl phosphorylation of its downstream substrate STAT5 was disproportionately decreased by the overexpression of SHP-2. Following IL-3 deprivation, the tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT5 that is required for its antiapoptotic activity was rapidly diminished in SHP-2 overexpressing cells. As a result, reduction of the putative downstream targets of STAT5-Bcl-X(L) and pim-1 was accelerated by overexpression of SHP-2. Further investigation showed that SHP-2 associated with STAT5, and that it was indeed able to dephosphorylate STAT5. Finally, overexpression of SHP-2 in primary bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells compromised their differentiative and proliferative potential, and enhanced growth factor withdrawal-induced cell death. And, the effect of SHP-2 overexpression on growth factor-dependent survival was diminished in STAT5-deficient hematopoietic cells. Taken together, these results suggest that SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase negatively regulates hematopoietic cell survival by dephosphorylation of STAT5.",,"['Chen, Jing', 'Yu, Wen-Mei', 'Bunting, Kevin D', 'Qu, Cheng-Kui']","['Chen J', 'Yu WM', 'Bunting KD', 'Qu CK']","['Department of Hematopoiesis, Jerome H Holland Laboratory for the Biomedical Sciences, American Red Cross, 15601 Crabbs Branch Way, Rockville, MD 20855, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism']",,2004/04/30 05:00,2004/06/02 05:00,['2004/04/30 05:00'],"['2004/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207471 [doi]', '1207471 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Apr 29;23(20):3659-69. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207471.,,,"['R01 DK059380/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL68212/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we provided evidence that 2-arachidonoylglycerol, but not anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine), is the true natural ligand for the cannabinoid receptors. In the present study, we examined in detail the effects of 2-arachidonoylglycerol on the production of chemokines in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. We found that 2-arachidonoylglycerol induced a marked acceleration in the production of interleukin 8. The effect of 2-arachidonoylglycerol was blocked by treatment of the cells with SR144528, a cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonist, indicating that the effect of 2-arachidonoylglycerol is mediated through the CB2 receptor. Augmented production of interleukin 8 was also observed with CP55940, a synthetic cannabinoid, and an ether-linked analog of 2-arachidonoylglycerol. On the other hand, neither anandamide nor the free arachidonic acid induced the enhanced production of interleukin 8. A similar effect of 2-arachidonoylglycerol was observed in the case of the production of macrophage-chemotactic protein-1. The accelerated production of interleukin 8 by 2-arachidonoylglycerol was observed not only in undifferentiated HL-60 cells, but also in HL-60 cells differentiated into macrophage-like cells. Noticeably, 2-arachidonoylglycerol and lipopolysaccharide acted synergistically to induce the dramatically augmented production of interleukin 8. These results strongly suggest that the CB2 receptor and its physiological ligand, i.e., 2-arachidonoylglycerol, play important regulatory roles such as stimulation of the production of chemokines in inflammatory cells and immune-competent cells. Detailed studies on the cannabinoid receptor system are thus essential to gain a better understanding of the precise regulatory mechanisms of inflammatory reactions and immune responses.",,"['Kishimoto, Seishi', 'Kobayashi, Yuriko', 'Oka, Saori', 'Gokoh, Maiko', 'Waku, Keizo', 'Sugiura, Takayuki']","['Kishimoto S', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Oka S', 'Gokoh M', 'Waku K', 'Sugiura T']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Sagamiko, Kanagawa 199-0195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (CCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Camphanes)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cyclohexanols)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Glycerides)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2)', '0 (SR 144528)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '83003-12-7', '(3-(2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl)-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol)', '8D239QDW64 (glyceryl 2-arachidonate)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Camphanes/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Cyclohexanols/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glycerides/pharmacology/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB2/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Time Factors']",,2004/04/30 05:00,2005/03/22 09:00,['2004/04/30 05:00'],"['2004/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jb/mvh063 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 2004 Apr;135(4):517-24. doi: 10.1093/jb/mvh063.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying the process remain elusive. To address the problem, we developed a model SSC culture system, first, by establishing techniques to obtain enriched populations of stem cells, and second, by establishing a serum-free culture medium. Flow cytometric cell sorting and the SSC transplantation assay demonstrated that Thy-1 is a unique surface marker of SSCs in neonatal, pup, and adult testes of the mouse. Although the surface phenotype of SSCs is major histocompatibility complex class I(-) Thy-1(+) alpha 6-integrin(+) alpha v-integrin(-/dim) throughout postnatal life, the most enriched population of SSCs was obtained from cryptorchid adult testes by cell-sorting techniques based on Thy-1 expression. This enriched population of SSCs was used to develop a culture system that consisted of serum-free defined medium and STO (SIM mouse embryo-derived thioguanine and ouabain resistant) feeders, which routinely maintained stem cell activity for 1 wk. Combining the culture system and the transplantation assay provided a mechanism to study the effect of single growth factors. A negative effect was demonstrated for several concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, whereas glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and stem cell factor appeared to have a positive effect on stem cell maintenance.

Rapid diagnosis is critical for treatment decision since all-trans-retinoic acid must be administrated promptly. The microgranular variant may be of difficult diagnosis, as it may be confused with other diseases on morphological grounds. The purpose of this study was to determine if the microgranular variant has the same antigenic profile as the classical hypergranular type. The immunophenotype of leukemic cells from the bone marrow of 50 patients, with the PML-RARalpha gene rearrangement confirmed by RT-PCR, was determined by flow cytometry using a large panel of 22 monoclonal antibodies and a polyclonal anti-TdT antibody. Thirty-four cases were classified as classical APL and 16 as microgranular APL. The immunophenotypic profile of the two subtypes was indistinguishable concerning the presence or absence of these antigens, including the absence of reactivity for the HLA-DR antigen. The simultaneous immunophenotypic combination of a unique major cell population, heterogeneous intensity of expression of CD13, and the typical pattern of CD15/CD34 expression were similarly present in the hypergranular and microgranular subtypes. Homogeneous expression of CD33 was observed in 76% of the classical APL cases and in 100% of the microgranular cases. Additionally, we have studied two cases of PLZF-RARalpha APL that also displayed the same immunophenotype described for classical APL. Thus, the immunophenotypic profile highly characteristic of the PML-RARalpha gene rearrangement was also observed in microgranular and PLZF-RARalpha variants of APL.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Rizzatti, Edgar G', 'Portieres, Fernando L', 'Martins, Sergio L R', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Zago, Marco A', 'Falcao, Roberto P']","['Rizzatti EG', 'Portieres FL', 'Martins SL', 'Rego EM', 'Zago MA', 'Falcao RP']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism', 'CD13 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2004/04/29 05:00,2004/06/04 05:00,['2004/04/29 05:00'],"['2004/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/04 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.20055 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2004 May;76(1):44-51. doi: 10.1002/ajh.20055.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LCPUFAs suppress the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (and so also of OX40, since it belongs to the family of TNFR) and the expression of Bcl-2, suggesting that these fatty acids have the ability to prevent/suppress autoimmune diseases. Human breast milk contains substantial amounts of both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. This indicates that LCPUFAs present in human breast milk suppress the levels of OX40 and decrease the expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 on exposure to self-antigens and thus, protects against the development of autoimmune diseases in later life. In view of this, I propose that supplementation of appropriate amounts of LCPUFAs during perinatal period protects against atopy, asthma, auto-immune diseases, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, metabolic syndrome X, lymphomas, leukemias and other cancers, schizophrenia, depression and other adult diseases in which low-grade systemic inflammation plays a significant role. It is also likely that perinatal supplementation of LCPUFAs in adequate amounts modulates the expression of genes concerned with immune response, angiogenesis, central osmo/sodium and glucose sensors etc. This renders various tissues and organs including T cells and macrophages, endothelial cells, hypothalamic neurons, and various cardiovascular tissues to be able to counteract the pathological mechanisms that tend to induce various adult diseases by blunting the inflammatory responses in those who received adequate amounts of LCPUFAs during the perinatal period compared to those who did not.",,"['Das, Undurti N']",['Das UN'],"['UND Life Sciences, Walpole, MA 02081, USA. undurti@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-6)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Asthma/metabolism', 'Bipolar Disorder/immunology', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cell Division', '*Dietary Supplements', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-6/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immune System', 'Inflammation', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Metabolic Syndrome/immunology', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Schizophrenia/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2004/04/29 05:00,2004/07/03 05:00,['2004/04/29 05:00'],"['2004/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['4727 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2004 May;10(5):HY19-25.

The present study evaluated the estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects of BSS, BSSG, and MC (0.001 to 150 micromol/L) on the proliferation of Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 (MCF-7) cells in vitro.

However, dietary BSS, BSSG, and MC reduced E(2)-induced MCF-7 tumor growth by 38.9% (P < 0.05), 31.6% (P = 0.08), and 42.13% (P < 0.05), respectively. The dietary phytosterols lowered serum E(2) levels by 35.1, 30.2, and 36.5% in the E(2) + BSS, E(2) + BSSG, and E(2) + MC groups, respectively (P < 0.05), compared to that of the E(2) treatment group. Estrogen-responsive pS2 mRNA expression in tumors did not differ among groups, but expression of the antiapoptotic marker B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2) in tumors from the E(2) + MC group was downregulated, compared to that of the E(2) treatment group. In summary, BSS and MC stimulated MCF-7 cell growth in vitro. Although BSSG comprises only 1% of MC, BSSG made MC less estrogenic than BSS alone in vitro. However, dietary BSS and MC protected against E(2)-stimulated MCF-7 tumor growth and lowered circulating E(2) levels.",,"['Ju, Young H', 'Clausen, Laura M', 'Allred, Kimberly F', 'Almada, Anthony L', 'Helferich, William G']","['Ju YH', 'Clausen LM', 'Allred KF', 'Almada AL', 'Helferich WG']","['Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801, USA. yhju@uiuc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Drug Implants)', '0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PSEN2 protein, human)', '0 (Phytosterols)', '0 (Presenilin-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sitosterols)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '5LI01C78DD (gamma-sitosterol)', 'U45VN859W3 (lyoniside)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Implants', 'Estradiol/administration & dosage/blood', 'Estrogen Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Organ Size/drug effects', '*Ovariectomy', 'Phytosterols/pharmacology', 'Presenilin-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Sitosterols/*pharmacology', 'Uterus/pathology']",,2004/04/29 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/04/29 05:00'],"['2004/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jn/134.5.1145 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr. 2004 May;134(5):1145-51. doi: 10.1093/jn/134.5.1145.,,,"['CA773511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES07326/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. Voronin and V. K. Pathak, Virology 312:281-294, 2003). To determine whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vectors also have the capacity to initiate reverse transcription twice, we constructed an HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-based vector containing the HIV-1 PBS, a green fluorescent protein reporter gene (GFP), and a second PBS derived from HIV-2 3' of GFP. Simultaneous initiation of reverse transcription at both the 5' HIV-1 PBS and 3' HIV-2 PBS was predicted to result in deletion of GFP. As in the MLV-based vectors, GFP was deleted in approximately 25% of all proviruses, indicating frequent dual initiation in HIV-based vectors containing two PBSs. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of early reverse transcription products indicated that HIV-1 reverse transcriptase efficiently used the HIV-2 PBS. To investigate tRNA primer-RNA template interactions in vivo, we introduced several mutations in the HIV-2 U5 region. The effects of these mutations on the efficiency of reverse transcription initiation were measured by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of early reverse transcription products, with initiation at the HIV-1 PBS used as an internal control. Disruption of the lower and upper parts of the U5-inverted repeat stem reduced the efficiency of initiation 20- and 6-fold, respectively. In addition, disruption of the proposed interactions between viral RNA and tRNA(Lys3) thymidine-pseudouridine-cytidine and anticodon loops decreased the efficiency of initiation seven- and sixfold, respectively. These results demonstrate the relative influence of various RNA-RNA interactions on the efficiency of initiation in vivo. Furthermore, the two-PBS vector system provides a sensitive and quantitative in vivo assay for analysis of RNA-RNA and protein-RNA interactions that can influence the efficiency of reverse transcription initiation.",,"['Voronin, Yegor A', 'Pathak, Vinay K']","['Voronin YA', 'Pathak VK']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Building 535, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Primers/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2004/04/29 05:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2004/04/29 05:00'],"['2004/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.10.5402-5413.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 May;78(10):5402-13. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.10.5402-5413.2004.,,,,,PMC400373,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve this, we encapsulated a sensitive reporter enzyme, luciferase, directly into fully infectious, intact viral particles. The enzyme is specifically targeted to the viral lumen, as a C-terminal fusion on the viral envelope protein. Only when the incorporated luciferase is released from the viral lumen and gains access to its substrates is light emitted and readily detected. When cells are perfused with luciferin, quantitative measurements of entry can be made in real time on live cells. Uniquely, the amount of cell-bound virus can be determined in the same assay by addition of detergent to expose the luciferase. We demonstrate that virus carrying a mutation in the fusion peptide binds normally to cells but is unable to infect them and gives no entry signal. Using this assay, we show that inhibitors of endosomal acidification inhibit signal from vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotypes but not murine leukemia virus, consistent with a pH-independent mode of entry for the latter virus. Additionally, the fusion kinetics are rapid, with a half-life of 25 min after a delay of 10 to 15 min. The future use of this assay will permit a detailed examination of the entry mechanism of viruses and provide a convenient platform to discover novel entry inhibitors.

During the preleukemic phase of disease, we observed the induction of apoptosis in thymic lymphocytes. A similar induction of apoptosis was observed for cultured mink epithelial cells after MCF13 MLV infection. In this study, the relevance of viral pathogenicity to cell killing was determined by testing the susceptibility of various cell types from different species to lymphomagenic MLVs. We observed that the cytopathic effect of lymphomagenic MLVs was restricted to mink cells. Southern blot analysis of MLV-infected cells revealed an accumulation of the linear form of unintegrated viral DNA, particularly in mink cells after MCF13 MLV infection. Thus, a strong correlation was observed between viral superinfection, which results in the accumulation of high levels of unintegrated viral DNA, and cell killing. Immunoblot analysis for MCF13 MLV-infected mink epithelial cells did not show a significant change in total p53 levels or its phosphorylated form at Ser-15 compared with that in mock-treated cells. Moreover, a time course analysis for mink epithelial cells infected with MCF13 MLV did not reveal mitochondrial depolarization or a significant change in Bax levels.

METHODS: Diagnosis of HGE was confirmed by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), detection of intragranulocytic inclusions, and serology. The infection rates of different myelogenous stages of granulocytic differentiation were determined by microscopy. Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection of the bone marrow was analysed by PCR, culture, and microscopy. In addition, the in vitro growth of A phagocytophilum in the patient's granulocytes and in HL-60 cells (a promyelocytic leukaemia cell line) was compared. RESULTS: Pretreatment blood smears showed that mature granulocytic cells had a higher infection rate with A phagocytophilum than did immature cells. In the original inoculation of the patient's cells into HL-60 cells to isolate A phagocytophilum, the bacterium grew faster in the patient's leukaemic cells than in HL-60 cells. Anaplasma phagocytophilum inclusions were rarely seen in bone marrow granulocytes and PCR was negative. In vitro, two A phagocytophilum isolates grew faster in the patient's granulocytes than in HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The superior growth in CML cells compared with HL-60 cells suggests that A phagocytophilum preferentially infects mature granulocytes. The higher infection rate of the patient's mature versus immature granulocytes before treatment and the minimal level of infection of the patient's bone marrow support this.

We used transmission electron microscopy to demonstrate this entity in different leukemia cells of human origin (patient's blood) and in mouse leukemia cell line. At high resolution, not only close proximity but even fusion of mitochondrial and nuclear membranes can be seen. Based on available data about mRNA transport through the nuclear pore complex and observed contacts of mitochondria with nuclei, we hypothesize that such contacts can provide a gateway for energy delivery to power mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Hence the lumen of the nuclear envelope can serve for transport or even storage of macroergic molecules in a manner similar to sarcoplasmic reticulum in fast-twitch skeletal muscles.",,"['Prachar, J']",['Prachar J'],"['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava 37, Slovakia. jarmil.prachar@savba.sk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (mitochondrial messenger RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/physiology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Energy Transfer/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism/ultrastructure', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Mitochondrial', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/ultrastructure']",,2004/04/29 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/04/29 05:00'],"['2004/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2003 Dec;22(4):525-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous report we demonstrated that both high molecular weight molecules (HA(H)) and HA-derived oligosaccharides were efficient at triggering terminal differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts, in vitro, through CD44 ligation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To explore the possibility of using HA for a differentiation therapy in AML, we investigated whether intravenous injection of tritiated HA(H) and/or HA-derived oligosaccharides (HA10-20) into mice accumulated in bone marrow, the main site of AML cell proliferation. RESULTS: The present work showed that the level of HA in bone marrow: 1) was maximum 5 hours after injection of either HA(H) or HA10-20; 2) was about 40 times higher after HA(H) than after HA10-20 injection. The amount of HA in bone marrow (5.8% ID/g) was two-fold higher than in serum, indicating that it was not due to circulating blood. Finally, using chromatographic analysis, we showed that about 34% of tritiated HA present in bone marrow 5 hours after HA(H) injection displayed a size higher or equal to HA10. CONCLUSION: After a single injection of macromolecular hyaluronan in mouse bone marrow we obtained a concentration of oligosaccharides close to the one shown to trigger AML cell differentiation in vitro. A part of the oligosaccharides had a size higher than or equal to the minimal one required to interact with HA receptors.",,"['Courel, Marie-Noelle', 'Maingonnat, Catherine', 'Bertrand, Philippe', 'Chauzy, Claude', 'Smadja-Joffe, Florence', 'Delpech, Bertrand']","['Courel MN', 'Maingonnat C', 'Bertrand P', 'Chauzy C', 'Smadja-Joffe F', 'Delpech B']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre Henri-Becquerel, rue d'Amiens, 76000 Rouen, France. mncourel@rouen.fnclcc.fr""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Oligosaccharides)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hyaluronic Acid/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligosaccharides/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tritium']",,2004/04/29 05:00,2004/11/09 09:00,['2004/04/29 05:00'],"['2004/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2004 Mar-Apr;18(2):181-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy drugs used for ALL may accelerate catabolism of other amino acids (AA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied ASNase activity and changes of Asn, Gln, serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), histidine (His), proline (Pro) and arginine (Arg) levels and sought relationships in sera from 73 pediatric ALL patients, who received ASNase-containing chemotherapy. RESULTS: Asparaginase activity averaged 0.4+/-0.34 IU/ml (mean+/-SDEV) in all specimens. All AA decreased after treatment, ranging from 18.6%-82.6% of control. Asparaginase activity of 0.7 IU/ml provided 90% Asn and Gl deamination. The data were dichotomized in subsets of low ASNase (range 0.02-0.39 IU/ml, mean=0.17+/-0.09 IU/ml) and high ASNase (range 0.4-1.69 IU/ml and mean=0.72+/-0.32 IU/ml). Asparagine and Gln % deamination values were correlated with ASNase activity (p=0.0002 and p=0.0001). Similarly, decreases of Arg and Ser levels were also correlated, p =0.0009 and p=0.032, respectively. In the high ASNase subset, a 39% decrease of Arg and 26% of Ser was obtained. Low ASNase activity was correlated with lower Asn and Gln % deamination and with moderate decrease of Ser (14.6%) and Arg (19.6%). Threonine, Pro and His also decreased, but no correlations were obtained with ASNase activity. CONCLUSION: Asparagine, Gln and five other AA declined during ASNase treatment. Asparagine and Gln % deamination values are highly correlated with serum ASNase activity. Asparaginase may indirectly cause moderate depletion of serum Arg and Ser levels, providing an enhancement in leukemia blasts apoptosis. Toxicity from the ASNase and other drugs could enhance the decrease of AA serum levels. Further studies are needed to verify these findings and their potential clinical importance in the treatment of ALL patients.",,"['Grigoryan, Rita S', 'Panosyan, Eduard H', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Avramis, Ioannis A', 'Avramis, Vassilios I']","['Grigoryan RS', 'Panosyan EH', 'Seibel NL', 'Gaynon PS', 'Avramis IA', 'Avramis VI']","['Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Child', 'Citric Acid Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/*enzymology']",,2004/04/29 05:00,2004/11/09 09:00,['2004/04/29 05:00'],"['2004/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2004 Mar-Apr;18(2):107-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antitumor roles of SET and CAT were analyzed in murine L615 T lymphocytic leukemia. Both CAT and SET were CD4(+)-predominant phenotypically and didn't show any significant cytotoxicity against a variety of syngeneic and allogeneic target cell lines using 51Cr release assay. When injected in vivo in combination with CY, CAT can cure a large proportion of leukemia mice. The cured mice couldn't establish specific antitumor immunity. However, in contrast to the roles of CAT, SET show far superior antitumor efficacy on a per cell basis compared with CAT. Moreover, the SET cured mice developed tumor specific long term memory immunity which was sufficient to reject a subsequent otherwise lethal tumor cells rechallenge and was transferable to naive immunocompetent mice.

However, the spectrum of malignancies associated with common genetic etiology and the effects of gender and age on familial risk have not been established. METHODS: Diagnoses of lymphoproliferative malignancies were compared in 15,799 first-degree relatives of 5047 patients with HL versus 32,117 first-degree relatives of 10,078 control probands from Sweden and in 7185 first-degree relatives of 2429 patients with HL versus 27,434 first-degree relatives of 8,495 control probands from Denmark using marginal survival models. RESULTS: The risk of HL in relatives of patients with HL was increased significantly in both populations, with relative risks of 3.47 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.77-6.80) in Sweden and 2.55 (95% CI, 1.01-6.45) in Denmark and a pooled estimate of 3.11 (95%CI, 1.82-5.29). In Sweden, risks for relatives of patients also were increased significantly for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (in males). Relative risks were higher in males compared with females and in siblings of patients compared with parents and offspring of patients. Relatives of patients with earlier-onset disease were at higher risk for HL. CONCLUSIONS: HL has an important familial component, which is stronger in families of affected individuals age < 40 years, in males, and in siblings, and it is shared with some (but not other) lymphoproliferative malignancies.

In older patients, diseases requiring cytotoxic treatment are more difficult and less successful to manage because comorbid conditions and poor performance status are more prevalent, decreasing the tolerance to therapy and increasing the frequency of side effects. This age effect is highlighted by the dramatically less favorable outcome in older than younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia with similar ""favorable"" cytogenetic changes. In addition, in acute and subacute myeloid leukemia in older patients, the disease is intrinsically more resistant to therapy. Overexpression of drug resistance genes and unfavorable genetic mutations are more prevalent in older patients and provide evidence that acute myeloid leukemia is often qualitatively different in these patients. The gradient of age effects is continuous; the frequency of poor outcome increasing by decade (or less). The decline in survival becomes especially steep as quinquagenarians (50-year-olds) age to nonagenarians (90-year-olds). Although improved drug schedules have led to significant improvements in event-free survival in younger patients, these improvements have been far less evident in older patients. New approaches, especially the development of drugs aimed at new targets, will be required to obtain a high frequency of long-term remissions in older patients.

We reviewed organ stages and overall grades of GVHD for 2220 patients who received a first marrow or peripheral blood cell transplant from an HLA-identical sibling or an HLA-allele-matched unrelated donor with the use of a posttransplantation immunosuppressive regimen that included both methotrexate and cyclosporine between 1985 and 2001. The most striking change was an increased incidence of stage 1 gut involvement from 10% to 20% before 1992 to 50% to 60% since 1992, both with related and unrelated donors.

The detection of abnormalities in ALL is difficult because low mitotic index and poor-quality metaphases are obtained. Flow cytometry (FC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can be used to detect aneuploidy in any phase of the cell cycle, increasing the number of analyzable cells. The aim of this study was to develop a strategy combining these methods to improve the frequency of chromosome abnormality detection. One hundred children with newly diagnosed ALL were included. CC and DNA content analysis by FC were performed in all patients. The numerical abnormalities identified by both methods were compared and patients were classified as concordant or discordant. FISH was used to support aneuploidy results in discrepant cases using centromeric probes for the chromosomes most frequently involved in aneuploidy. CC and FC showed high concordance (86%). Fourteen cases were discrepant: nine showed hypodiploidy and low hyperdiploidy by cytogenetics and five showed high hyperdiploidy by FC. FISH confirmed aneuploidy in 12 cases in which it could be performed. High hyperdiploidy was the most common abnormality; the 31 cases showing this aneuploidy were identified by FC. The search for abnormalities must begin by measuring DNA content to detect this aneuploidy, which is useful to evaluate the patient's risk. However, it is important to screen for structural abnormalities by CC or molecular techniques. This strategy may detect chromosomal abnormalities, optimizing resources in laboratories where not all the screening methods are available.",,"['Perez-Vera, Patricia', 'Frias, Sara', 'Carnevale, Alessandra', 'Betancourt, Miguel', 'Mujica, Marisa', 'Rivera-Luna, Roberto', 'Ortiz, Rocio']","['Perez-Vera P', 'Frias S', 'Carnevale A', 'Betancourt M', 'Mujica M', 'Rivera-Luna R', 'Ortiz R']","['Departamento de Investigacion en Genetica Humana, Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico. ppverezvera@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Methods', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",,2004/04/28 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/04/28 05:00'],"['2004/04/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-200405000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/00043426-200405000-00007 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2004 May;26(5):294-300. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200405000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify roles during squamous differentiation (SqD) of endometrial carcinoma (Em Ca) cells, we investigated expression of beta-catenin, as well as cyclin D1, p53, p21WAF1, and PML (promyelocytic leukemia) in 80 cases of Em Ca with SqD areas, in comparison with cell proliferation determined with reference to Ki-67 antigen positivity. The impact of beta-catenin-T-cell factor (TCF)-mediated transcription was also examined using Em Ca cells. In clinical cases, nuclear beta-catenin accumulation was more frequent in SqD areas, being positively linked with expression of cyclin D1, p53, and p21WAF1, and inversely with Ki-67 and PML immunoreactivity. Significant correlations of nuclear beta-catenin, cyclin D1, p53, and p21WAF1 were noted between SqD and the surrounding carcinoma lesions. The Ishikawa cell line, with stable or tetracycline-regulated expression of mutant beta-catenin, showed an increase in expression levels of cyclin D1, p14ARF, p53, and p21WAF1 but not PML, and activation of beta-catenin-TCF4-mediated transcription determined with TOP/FOP constructs. The cell morphology was senescence-like rather than squamoid in appearance. Moreover, overexpressed beta-catenin could activate transcription from p14ARF and cyclin D1 promoters, in a TCF4-dependent manner. These findings indicate that in Em Cas, nuclear beta-catenin can simultaneously induce activation of the p53-p21WAF1 pathway and overexpression of cyclin D1, leading to suppression of cell proliferation or induction of cell senescence. However, overexpression of beta-catenin alone is not sufficient for development of a squamoid phenotype in Em Ca cells, suggesting that nuclear accumulation is an initial signal for trans-differentiation.",,"['Saegusa, Makoto', 'Hashimura, Miki', 'Kuwata, Takeshi', 'Hamano, Mieko', 'Okayasu, Isao']","['Saegusa M', 'Hashimura M', 'Kuwata T', 'Hamano M', 'Okayasu I']","['Department of Pathology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. msaegusa@med.kitasato-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis', 'Up-Regulation', 'beta Catenin', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",,2004/04/28 05:00,2004/06/05 05:00,['2004/04/28 05:00'],"['2004/04/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)63732-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63732-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2004 May;164(5):1739-49. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)63732-7.,,,,,PMC1615666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomeres contain terminal DNA sequence repeats that maintain chromosomal stability. Telomeres shorten with cell division and may become dysfunctional leading to chromosomal instability. Using a fluorescence in situ hybridization/immunofluorescence method to assess telomere lengths in archival tissues we analyzed these two types of sarcomas using paraffin-embedded primary tumor specimens. Tissues from nine sarcomas with characteristic translocations (two synovial sarcomas, two alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, two desmoplastic round cell tumors, and one each of infantile fibrosarcoma, myxoid liposarcoma, cellular congenital mesoblastic nephroma) and nine without (four malignant fibrous histiocytomas, two leiomyosarcomas, one pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, one dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma, and one malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor) were analyzed. In all (nine of nine) cases with specific translocations, which generally have few karyotypic abnormalities, telomere lengths were similar to or reduced compared to surrounding nonneoplastic tissues. In contrast, telomeres in cases lacking specific translocations, which generally contain complex karyotypes, were often found to be dramatically lengthened and heterogeneous. In addition to markedly elongated telomeres, seven of nine (78%) complex cases exhibited large brightly stained regions corresponding to a specific type of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body found in immortalized cells that maintain telomeres in a telomerase-independent manner [alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway]. This phenotype is unlike that of epithelial neoplasms that typically display complex karyotypes with abnormally short telomeres maintained by the enzyme telomerase. The discovery of heterogeneous telomere lengths and evidence of the ALT pathway in the majority of sarcomas with complex karyotypes supports the existence of a telomere maintenance pathway incapable of full karyotypic stabilization in pleomorphic sarcomas. These findings provide additional molecular-genetic evidence supporting the dichotomous grouping of sarcomas into those with characteristic signature translocations without extensive additional karyotypic abnormalities, and those without such signature translocations that typically display very complex karyotypes, and point to telomere dysfunction as a plausible contributor to the chromosomal aberrations found in complex sarcomas.",,"['Montgomery, Elizabeth', 'Argani, Pedram', 'Hicks, Jessica L', 'DeMarzo, Angelo M', 'Meeker, Alan K']","['Montgomery E', 'Argani P', 'Hicks JL', 'DeMarzo AM', 'Meeker AK']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leiomyosarcoma/pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Sarcoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Synovial/pathology', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2004/04/28 05:00,2004/06/05 05:00,['2004/04/28 05:00'],"['2004/04/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)63710-8 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63710-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2004 May;164(5):1523-9. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63710-8.,,,"['P50 CA088843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA058236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32DK07552/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88843/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007552/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1615673,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis by primer extension and RNase protection revealed that the 5'-heterogeneity was generated by transcription initiation at multiple sites in exon 1 and intron 1 and by alternative splicing. These transcripts, both coding and non-coding, exhibited distinct expression patterns in various adult tissues and were developmentally regulated.

In this study, we examined the possibility of another cytotoxicity mechanism of the amino- and hydroxylamino metabolites of TNT, their flavoenzyme-catalyzed redox cycling. The above compounds acted as redox-cycling substrates for single-electron transferring NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase (P-450R) and ferredoxin:NADP(+) reductase (FNR), as well as substrates for the two-electron transferring flavoenzymes rat liver NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and Enterobacter cloacae NAD(P)H:nitroreductase (NR). Their reactivity in P-450R-, FNR-, and NR-catalyzed reactions increased with an increase in their single-electron reduction potential (E(1)(7)) or the decrease in the enthalpy of free radical formation. The cytotoxicity of the amino- and hydroxylamino metabolites of TNT towards bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) was partly prevented by the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine and desferrioxamine, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, thus pointing to the involvement of oxidative stress. In general, their cytotoxicity increased with an increase in their electron accepting properties, or their reactivity towards the single-electron transferring FNR and P-450R.

Accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in bone, cartilage, and synovium likely contributes to reduced mobility in untreated MPS VII individuals. We previously reported that neonatal intravenous injection of a retroviral vector (RV) expressing canine GUSB resulted in hepatocyte transduction in mice and dogs, and secreted GUSB was taken up from blood by other organs. Here we report the effect of this therapy on bone, cartilage, and joint disease. Osteocytes and bone-lining cells from RV-treated MPS VII mice had GUSB activity, resulting in a marked reduction, as compared with untreated MPS VII mice, in lysosomal storage in bone and at the bone:growth plate interface where bone elongation occurs. Although chondrocytes did not have detectable GUSB activity and had little reduction in lysosomal storage, the thickness of the growth plate was reduced toward normal. These pathological changes were likely responsible for improvements in facial morphology and long bone lengths. The synovium had reduced hyperplasia and lysosomal storage, and the thickness of the articular cartilage was reduced. Similarly, RV-treated MPS VII dogs had improved facial morphology and reduced lysosomal storage in osteocytes and synovium, but not chondrocytes. Nevertheless, the internal area of the trachea was increased, and erosions of the femoral head were reduced. We conclude that neonatal gene therapy can improve bone and joint disease in MPS VII mice and dogs. However, better delivery of GUSB to chondrocytes will be necessary to achieve more profound effects in cartilage.",,"['Mango, Robert L', 'Xu, Lingfei', 'Sands, Mark S', 'Vogler, Carole', 'Seiler, Gabriela', 'Schwarz, Tobias', 'Haskins, Mark E', 'Ponder, Katherine Parker']","['Mango RL', 'Xu L', 'Sands MS', 'Vogler C', 'Seiler G', 'Schwarz T', 'Haskins ME', 'Ponder KP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 South Euclid Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Genet Metab,Molecular genetics and metabolism,9805456,['EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bone Diseases/therapy', 'Bone and Bones/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Cartilage Diseases/therapy', 'Dogs', 'Face/abnormalities', 'Female', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glucuronidase/*genetics', 'Hepatocytes/virology', 'Joint Diseases/therapy', 'Joints/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mucopolysaccharidosis VII/pathology/*therapy', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases/pathology/*therapy', 'Radiography', 'Trachea/pathology']",,2004/04/28 05:00,2004/12/16 09:00,['2004/04/28 05:00'],"['2003/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2004/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/16 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ymgme.2004.01.015 [doi]', 'S1096719204000484 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Genet Metab. 2004 May;82(1):4-19. doi: 10.1016/j.ymgme.2004.01.015.,,,"['DK54481/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK57586/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 DK0275/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK52574/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK54061/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR02512/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds mediate their actions through the retinoid and rexinoid receptors, respectively, which exist in multiple isoforms and form a plethora of distinct heterodimers. Despite their apparent anticancer potential, with one exception the molecular basis of this activity has remained largely elusive. The exception concerns acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the prototype of retinoic acid-dependent differentiation therapy, for which both the molecular nature of the disease and the mechanism of action of retinoids are well understood. However, retinoids and rexinoids are active beyond the borderlines of the well-defined chromosomal translocation that gives rise to curable APL. In this context, particularly interesting is that retinoic acid induces a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) or Apo2L. This ligand is exceptional in that it is capable of inducing apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells. It is possible that this connection to the TRAIL signaling pathway contributes to the anti-tumor activity of retinoids and rexinoids.

We found that two domains of human N-CoR, amino acid residues 988-1126 and 1551-1803, were necessary for interaction with ETO. Previously, we and other investigators had reported that two unusual zinc finger motifs at the C-terminus of ETO mediated binding to N-CoR.

We noted that all lymphocytic leukemia cell lines expressed PPARgamma and no PPARgamma mutations were found in these cell lines as indicated by SSCP analysis. Effect of the PPARgamma ligands on the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of B type ALL cells was further examined. Treatment of these cells with the PPARgamma ligands Pioglitazone (PGZ) and 15-deoxy-delta (12,14)-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) resulted in growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner which was associated with a G1 to S cell cycle arrest. However, this effect appeared to be PPARgamma-independent since several PPARgamma antagonists could not reverse this effect. No differentiation was induced by this treatment. Four out of five cell lines underwent apoptosis after culture with the PPARgamma ligands. This effect was partially caspase-dependent because a pan-caspase inhibitor partially reversed this effect.

In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the high sensitivity to anthracyclines appears to be attributable to the low frequency of MDR proteins overexpression at onset even if 30% of patients still relapse and become resistant to therapy. In attempt to explain different blast cell sensitivity, we studied the expression of PGP, MRP1, MRP2, and LRP in 45 cases of APL, comparing onset of disease with relapse. METHODS: PGP, LRP, and MRP on bone marrow or peripheral blood blast cells were evaluated by flow cytometry using the MRK-16, LRP-56, MRP-m6, and MRP2 antibodies and results expressed by the mean fluorescence index (MFI). The antibody binding capacity (ABC) for each MDR protein was also calculated. RESULTS: At diagnosis, only 2 of 45 patients overexpressed PGP and 1 overexpressed LRP. PGP and LRP overexpressing cases significantly grew up during disease progression and at second relapse mean PGP MFI and mean LRP MFI were significantly higher than at onset (P = 0.001 and P = 0.008, respectively). By analyzing ABC, the same trend was more evident because a significant increment of PGP and LRP was observed at second (P = 0.002 and P = 0.002, respectively), but even at first relapse (P = 0.018 and P = 0.002, respectively). No changes were demonstrated in MRP1 and MRP2 expression in any phase of disease considered. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm the low expression at diagnosis of proteins related to development of drug resistance in APL. The evidence of a relative easy induction of PGP and LRP, but not of MRP, can be useful in choosing drugs to employ for consolidation or rescue therapy.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Damiani, Daniela', 'Michieli, Mariagrazia', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Stocchi, Raffaella', 'Masolini, Paola', 'Geromin, Antonella', 'Michelutti, Teresa', 'Raspadori, Donatella', 'Ippoliti, Micaela', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Damiani D', 'Michieli M', 'Michelutti A', 'Candoni A', 'Stocchi R', 'Masolini P', 'Geromin A', 'Michelutti T', 'Raspadori D', 'Ippoliti M', 'Lauria F', 'Fanin R']","['Department of Medical and Morphological Research, Division of Hematology, University Hospital, Udine, Italy. daniela.damiani@drmm.uniud.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Immunophenotypic characteristics heretofore proclaimed as reliably characterizing APL (HLA-DR(low), CD34(low), P-glycoprotein(low) myeloid phenotype) do not differentiate from APL-like immune profiles unassociated with the PML/RAR alpha fusion transcript. METHODS: To establish a surrogate marker profile for APL, we explored 19 potentially predictive markers compared with differentiated acute myeloid leukemia using the classification tree approach with recursive partitioning. RESULTS: In a test group of 58 APL patients, the most predictive immune profile was HLA-DR(low), CD11a(low) (alpha(L) subunit of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1), CD18(low) (beta(2) subunit of LFA-1). APL cells always expressed CD117 (c-kit) but lacked the progenitor antigen CD133 and the more mature myeloid antigen, CD11b (alpha(M) leukocyte integrin). This antigen pattern was validated in 90 additional APL patients. M3v APLs (n = 30) had more leukemic promyelocytes expressing the T-cell antigen, CD2 (P < 0.0001) or the stem cell marker, CD34 (P = 0.0003) and demonstrated higher fluorescence intensity for the binding of antibody to the common leukocyte antigen, CD45 (P = 0.0008) than M3 (n = 102). S-form APL (n = 45) had a higher percent of cells expressing CD2 or CD34 (P < 0.0001 for both) or the neural cell adhesion molecule CD56 (P = 0.001) than L-form APL (n = 66). CONCLUSIONS: PML/RAR alpha(pos) APL cells typically lack leukocyte integrins. HLA-DR(low), CD11a(low), CD18(low) is a reliable surrogate antigen expression profile for PML/RAR alpha(pos) APL, irrespective of morphology and transcript isoform.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Paietta, E', 'Goloubeva, O', 'Neuberg, D', 'Bennett, J M', 'Gallagher, R', 'Racevskis, J', 'Dewald, G', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Tallman, M S']","['Paietta E', 'Goloubeva O', 'Neuberg D', 'Bennett JM', 'Gallagher R', 'Racevskis J', 'Dewald G', 'Wiernik PH', 'Tallman MS']","['Immunology Laboratory, Our Lady of Mercy Cancer Center, New York Medical College, Bronx, New York 10466, USA. epaietta@earthlink.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Although the viral E6 protein is known to be essential for driving malignant progression of HPV-infected cells, there are still many uncertainties about its mode of action. In this study, we have analysed the intracellular distribution of the E6 oncoproteins from the high-risk HPV-18 and the low-risk HPV-11. We show that both E6 proteins localize within the nucleus in nuclear bodies that are confocal with the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein. Using a panel of different PML isoforms, we demonstrate specific co-localization between the E6 proteins and PML isoforms I-IV, but not with PML isoforms V and VI. We also demonstrate the interaction between E6 and a subset of PML isoforms in vivo.

A recent study found Sil to be one of 17 genes whose overexpression in primary adenocarcinomas predicts metastatic spread. We hypothesized that Sil might have a role in carcinogenesis. To address this question, we utilized several approaches. Using a multitumor tissue array, we found that Sil protein expression was increased mostly in lung cancer, but also at lower levels, in a subset of other tumors. Microarray gene expression analysis and immunohistochemistry of lung cancer samples verified these observations.

However, several studies have suggested the existence of a p21(WAF1/Cip1)-independent molecular pathway. We report here that HDAC inhibitors activate a member of the INK4 family, the INK4d gene, causing G1 phase arrest, in the human T cell leukemia cell line, Jurkat. One of the major Trichostatin A (TSA)-responsive elements is a specific Sp1 binding site in the INK4d promoter. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay revealed that Sp1 and Sp3 can specifically interact with this Sp1 binding site. Furthermore, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that HDAC2 was present in the INK4d proximal promoter region in the absence, but not the presence, of TSA. Taken together, these results suggest that treatment with TSA transcriptionally activates INK4d by releasing HDAC2 from the histone-DNA complex at the INK4d promoter. Using a p21(WAF1/Cip1)-deleted human colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCT116 p21 (-/-), we show that upregulation of p19(INK4d) by TSA is associated with inhibition of cell proliferation. Moreover, mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking Ink4d were resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of TSA as compared to their wild-type counterpart.

Topors contains a highly conserved RING domain and localizes in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Relatively little is known regarding topors expression patterns or function. We now demonstrate that topors mRNA and protein are widely expressed in normal human tissues. By contrast, topors mRNA and protein levels are decreased or undetectable in colon adenocarcinomas relative to normal colon tissue, and expression of the topors protein is not detectable in several colon cancer cell lines. The human TOPORS gene is located on chromosome 9p21, with loss of heterozygosity in this region frequently observed in several different malignancies. While we were unable to detect loss of heterozygosity of the TOPORS gene in 16 sporadic colon cancer cases, increased methylation of a CpG island in the TOPORS promoter was evident in colon adenocarcinoma specimens relative to matched normal tissues. Additional studies indicate that forced expression of topors inhibits cellular proliferation and is associated with an accumulation of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase of the cell cycle. This effect is independent of the topors RING domain and maps to a C-terminal region of the protein.

Depleted uranium used during these conflicts was considered as a possible cause. Its radiotoxicity is close to that of natural uranium. This paper reviews the epidemiological knowledge of uranium, the means of exposure and the associated risk of cancer. METHODS: The only available epidemiological data concerns nuclear workers exposed to uranium. A review of the international literature is proposed by distinguishing between uranium miners and other workers of the nuclear industry. French studies are described in details. RESULTS: In ionizing radiation epidemiology, contamination by uranium is often cited as a risk factor, but the dose-effect relationship is rarely studied. Retrospective assessment of individual exposure is generally insufficient. Moreover, it is difficult to distinguish between uranium radiotoxicity, its chemical toxicity and the radiotoxicity of its progeny. A causal relation between lung cancer and radon exposure, a gas derived from the decay of uranium, has been demonstrated in epidemiological studies of miners. Among other nuclear workers exposed to uranium, there is a mortality deficit from all causes (healthy worker effect). No cancer site appears systematically in excess compared to the national population; very few studies describe a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSION: Only studies with a precise reconstruction of doses and sufficient numbers of workers will allow a better assessment of risks associated with uranium exposure at levels encountered in industry or during conflicts using depleted uranium weapons.",,"['Tirmarche, M', 'Baysson, H', 'Telle-Lamberton, M']","['Tirmarche M', 'Baysson H', 'Telle-Lamberton M']","[""Service de Radiobiologie et d'Epidemiologie, Direction de la Radioprotection de l'Homme, Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire (IRSN), Fontenay-aux-Roses. margot.tirmarche@irsn.fr""]",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,7608039,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '4OC371KSTK (Uranium)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants, Occupational/*adverse effects', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'France', 'Healthy Worker Effect', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Male', '*Metallurgy', '*Mining', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Uranium/*adverse effects']",31,2004/04/27 05:00,2004/05/15 05:00,['2004/04/27 05:00'],"['2004/04/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['s0398-7620(04)99024-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0398-7620(04)99024-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 2004 Feb;52(1):81-90. doi: 10.1016/s0398-7620(04)99024-4.,,,,,,,,,Exposition a l'uranium et risque de cancer: une revue des etudes epidemiologiques.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain are emerging as the most frequent mechanism for reactivation of kinase activity within the leukemic clone. METHODS: We developed a denaturing-HPLC (D-HPLC)-based assay for screening for ABL point mutations. For each sample, two partially overlapping fragments of 393 and 482 bp corresponding to the kinase domain were amplified by nested reverse transcription-PCR and analyzed under selected temperature and acetonitrile gradient conditions. Fifty-one bone marrow and/or peripheral blood specimens from 27 CML patients who showed cytogenetic resistance to Imatinib were screened in parallel by D-HPLC and by direct sequencing. RESULTS: In 12 of 27 (44%) patients, D-HPLC showed an abnormal elution profile suggesting the presence of a nucleotide change. Direct sequencing confirmed the presence of a point mutation in all cases. Conversely, all samples scored as wild type by D-HPLC showed no evidence of mutations by direct sequencing. In two cases, novel amino acid substitutions at codons already known for being hot-spots of mutation were identified (F311I and E355D). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed D-HPLC-based assay is highly specific and at least as sensitive as sequencing; with respect to the latter, it provides a much faster and less expensive semiautomated system for mutational screening. It may therefore potentially be a valuable tool for regular, large-scale testing of patients undergoing Imatinib treatment.",,"['Soverini, Simona', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Poerio, Angela', 'Bianchini, Michele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Soverini S', 'Martinelli G', 'Amabile M', 'Poerio A', 'Bianchini M', 'Rosti G', 'Pane F', 'Saglio G', 'Baccarani M']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2004/04/27 05:00,2004/07/30 05:00,['2004/04/27 05:00'],"['2004/04/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1373/clinchem.2004.031112 [doi]', 'clinchem.2004.031112 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2004 Jul;50(7):1205-13. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2004.031112.

METHODS: Burkitt's lymphoma cells (Raji and Daudi) were treated with the PK-C inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide (BIM), or the CaM inhibitor, trifluoperazine (TFPZ), in a dose-dependent manner and in a time-dependent manner. The activities of PK-C isoenzymes were analyzed fluorimetrically using POLARIS assay kits. CaM-kinase II activity was analyzed radiographically, using CaMK-II immunoprecipitation kinase assay kits. Telomerase activity was detected by a conventional telomeric repeat amplification protocol and Stretch PCR. The level of catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) in drug-treated and nontreated cells was analyzed by flow cytometry using anti-hTERT antibody labeled with ZenonAlexa Fluor-488 IgG. Apoptosis was estimated in terms of phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface and DNA fragmentation. RESULTS: It was found that BIM inhibited telomerase activity and this process preceded apoptosis. The subsequent addition of exogenous PK-C (mixture of isoenzymes) to the cell lysates restored telomerase activity if incubation of cells with BIM was up to 24 h. Using PK-C isoenzymes, it was established that atypical PK-Czeta, but not conventional Ca2+ -dependent PK-Calpha, PK-Cbeta or PK-Cgamma, is responsible for the reactivation of telomerase in BIM-treated cells. BIM also showed a well-expressed cytotoxicity against intact leukemia cells. In contrast, the CaM inhibitor TFPZ showed the same cytotoxic effect without any influence on telomerase activity during incubation for 24 h with leukemia cells. After incubation for 48 h, TFPZ markedly suppressed telomerase activity. However, the effect followed apoptosis and appeared to be a result of cell death. The addition of exogenous CaMK-II to the cell lysates obtained from TFPZ-treated cells did not reactivate telomerase. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed the participation of atypical PK-Czeta, but not conventional Ca2+ -dependent PK-C isoenzymes (alpha, beta, gamma) nor the Ca2+/CaM-dependent pathway, in the regulation of telomerase activity in Burkitt's lymphoma cells.",,"['Bakalova, Rumiana', 'Ohba, Hideki', 'Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Kubo, Takanori', 'Fujii, Masayuki', 'Ishikawa, Mitsuru', 'Shinohara, Yasuo', 'Baba, Yoshinobu']","['Bakalova R', 'Ohba H', 'Zhelev Z', 'Kubo T', 'Fujii M', 'Ishikawa M', 'Shinohara Y', 'Baba Y']","['Single-Molecule Bioanalysis Laboratory, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology-Shikoku, 2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Kagawa-ken, Takamatsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Dopamine Antagonists)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (calcium-dependent protein kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (protein kinase C zeta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'MBK3OO5K8T (bisindolylmaleimide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Calmodulin/*pharmacology', 'Dopamine Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Kinase C/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Telomerase/*pharmacology', 'Trifluoperazine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/04/24 05:00,2004/08/25 05:00,['2004/04/24 05:00'],"['2003/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-004-0789-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2004 Aug;54(2):161-72. doi: 10.1007/s00280-004-0789-y.

Deficiencies in the apoptotic pathways may lead to chemoresistance. Here we report that glutathione (GSH) plays a critical role in activation of apoptosis pathways by CD95 (APO-1/Fas) or anticancer drugs. Upon treatment with anticancer drugs or CD95 triggering, CD95-resistant or Bcl-x(L) overexpressing CEM cells were deficient in activation of apoptosis pathways. CD95-resistant and Bcl-x(L) overexpressing CEM cells exhibited higher intracellular GSH levels in comparison to parental cells. Downregulation of GSH by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoxime (BSO), a specific inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, reversed deficiencies in activation of apoptosis pathways by anticancer drugs or CD95. Interestingly, downregulation of GSH by BSO increased CD95 DISC formation in type I cells. In hybrids of CD95-resistant cells with sensitive cells and hybrids of overexpressing Bcl-x(L) cells with sensitive cells, the phenotype of apoptosis resistance was dominant. Also, in these hybrids, downregulation of GSH reversed CD95- and chemoresistance. We conclude that dominant apoptosis resistance depends, at least in part, on intracellular GSH levels, which may affect apoptosis signaling at different compartments, for example, the death receptor or mitochondria.",,"['Friesen, C', 'Kiess, Y', 'Debatin, K-M']","['Friesen C', 'Kiess Y', 'Debatin KM']","[""University Children's Hospital, Prittwitzstr.43, D-89075 Ulm, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/analysis/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/immunology/physiology']",,2004/04/24 05:00,2005/04/26 09:00,['2004/04/24 05:00'],"['2004/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.cdd.4401431 [doi]', '4401431 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2004 Jul;11 Suppl 1:S73-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.cdd.4401431.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In view of the possible use of imatinib as experimental therapy for patients with c-kit-positive tumors, we assessed c-kit expression in CD30+ cell lines and lymphomas. The cell lines were assessed using multiple methods (RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and Western blot). c-Kit expression was also immunohistochemically assessed in 168 CD30+ lymphomas including 87 classical Hodgkin's disease, 63 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and 15 cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. We also studied 18 cases of lymphomatoid papulosis, a CD30+ lesion closely related to cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Neither c-kit mRNA nor protein was detected in any of the cell lines assessed. Furthermore, treatment with imatinib did not inhibit proliferation of cell lines in vitro. Using immunohistochemistry, only one of 183 (0.5%) lesions was positive for c-kit, the positive case being an ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

Only a limited number of HL variants have been subject to informative analysis regarding their clonal relationship to the CLL, with evidence of a same clonal origin in some cases and of clonally unrelated neoplasms in other cases. In this paper, we performed a detailed pathologic, virologic, and molecular analysis of two cases of Richter's syndrome with HL features. The first case occurred in a 65-year-old man with a 5-year history of CLL as a mediastinal and supraclavicular mass histologically diagnosed as lymphocyte depleted HL with no background CLL. The second case occurred in a 78-year-old woman with a 4-year history of CLL as an inguinal mass with a composite histologic appearance comprising areas of CLL, areas of CLL with Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells, and areas of HL. Both patients had received fludarabine therapy. The HRS cells were CD20-/CD30+/CD15-/J-chain- in case no. 1 and CD20+/-/CD30+/CD15-/J-chain- in case no. 2. In both cases, the Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS) were positive for type A EBV, and a 30-bp deletion of the LMP-1 gene was detected in case no. 2.

Here we report a series of 9 additional cases of such association. The patients were predominantly adult (median, 62 years), males (male/female ratio, 7:2), who presented with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (4 cases), acute myeloid leukemia (1), acute monocytic leukemia (2), unclassifiable chronic myeloproliferative (1), or myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disease (1). The prognosis was poor (median survival, 24 months) and related to progression of the underlying myeloid neoplasm. We found that in addition to lymph nodes, PMs/IPCs accumulated to bone marrow (8 cases) and skin (4 cases). Immunohistochemical markers typically expressed by PMs/IPCs (CD68, CLA/HECA452, CD123) were found in all cases and shown useful to identify cells with variations from classic morphology. In addition, PMs/IPCs expressed the interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) inducible protein MxA, the B-cell oncogene TCL1, and granzyme B. The biologic and clinical significance of the association between PMs/IPCs and myeloid disorders remains not clarified. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis in a case known to harbor monosomy 7 in the myeloid leukemia, we demonstrated that PMs/IPCs share the same chromosomal abnormality, thus indicating that they are clonal, neoplastic in nature, and closely related to the associated myeloid tumor. Recently, a novel CD56+ hematologic neoplasm has been reported and retained to stem from PMs/IPCs.

In the present work, we report that Lys-802 (K-802) of IE1 from HHV-6 variant B is the only target residue capable of conjugation to SUMO-1/SMT3C/Sentrin-1, SUMO-2/SMT3A/Sentrin-3 or SUMO-3/SMT3B/Sentrin-2 as determined by transfection and in vitro SUMOylation experiments. PolySUMOylated forms of IE1 were also observed, suggesting that SUMO branching occurs at the K-802 residue. Overexpression of SUMO-1, -2 and -3 led to an overall increase in IE1 levels, irrespective of K-802. The SUMO residues could be efficiently removed by incubating SUMOylated IE1 with SENP1, a recently identified SUMO peptidase. SUMOylation-deficient mutants of IE1 co-localized with nuclear promyelocytic leukaemia protein (PML) oncogenic domains (PODs) as efficiently as WT IE1, indicating that POD targeting is independent of IE1 SUMOylation status. However, in contrast to infection, PODs did not aggregate in IE1B-transfected cells, suggesting that other viral proteins are involved in the process. Transactivation studies indicated that IE1, in combination with IE2, could efficiently transactivate diverse promoters, independent of its SUMOylation status. Overall, the results presented provide a detailed biochemical characterization of post-translational modifications of the HHV-6 IE1 protein by SUMO peptides, contributing to our understanding of the complex interactions between herpesviruses and the SUMO-conjugation pathway.",,"['Gravel, Annie', 'Dion, Valerie', 'Cloutier, Nathalie', 'Gosselin, Jean', 'Flamand, Louis']","['Gravel A', 'Dion V', 'Cloutier N', 'Gosselin J', 'Flamand L']","['Laboratory of Virology, Rheumatology and Immunology Research Center, Room T1-49, CHUL Research Center and Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, 2705 Laurier Blvd, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada G1V 4G2.', 'Laboratory of Virology, Rheumatology and Immunology Research Center, Room T1-49, CHUL Research Center and Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, 2705 Laurier Blvd, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada G1V 4G2.', 'Laboratory of Virology, Rheumatology and Immunology Research Center, Room T1-49, CHUL Research Center and Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, 2705 Laurier Blvd, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada G1V 4G2.', 'Laboratory of Viral Immunology, Rheumatology and Immunology Research Center, Room T1-49, CHUL Research Center and Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, 2705 Laurier Blvd, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada G1V 4G2.', 'Laboratory of Virology, Rheumatology and Immunology Research Center, Room T1-49, CHUL Research Center and Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, 2705 Laurier Blvd, Sainte-Foy, Quebec, Canada G1V 4G2.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (immediate-early 1 protein, human herpesvirus 6)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*metabolism', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysine', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism']",,2004/04/24 05:00,2004/06/15 05:00,['2004/04/24 05:00'],"['2004/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.19610-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2004 May;85(Pt 5):1319-1328. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.19610-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.19610-0 [doi],,,,

Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations in the kinase domain of FLT3 are found in approximately 37% of AML patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. We report here the development and characterization of a fully human anti-FLT3 neutralizing antibody (IMC-EB10) isolated from a human Fab phage display library. IMCEB10 (immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1], kappa) binds with high affinity (KD=158 pM) to soluble FLT3 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and to FLT3 receptor expressed on the surfaces of human leukemia cell lines. IMC-EB10 blocks the binding of FLT3 ligand (FL) to soluble FLT3 in ELISA and competes with FL for binding to cell-surface FLT3 receptor. IMC-EB10 treatment inhibits FL-induced phosphorylation of FLT3 in EOL-1 and EM3 leukemia cells and FL-independent constitutive activation of ITD-mutant FLT3 in BaF3-ITD and MV4;11 cells. Activation of the downstream signaling proteins mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT is also inhibited in these cell lines by antibody treatment. The antibody inhibits FL-stimulated proliferation of EOL-1 cells and ligand-independent proliferation of BaF3-ITD cells. In both EOL-1 xenograft and BaF3-ITD leukemia models, treatment with IMC-EB10 significantly prolongs the survival of leukemia-bearing mice. No overt toxicity is observed with IMC-EB10 treatment.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The role of underlying disease was analyzed in 17 of 73 (23%) patients with PBPC mobilization failure, and secondary mobilization with high-dose filgrastim was attempted. RESULTS: Of 16 patients with acute leukemia, 13 (81%) mobilized poorly. In contrast, of 57 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and solid tumor, 53 (93%, p < 0.001) showed good PBPC mobilization. Relapsed disease did not predispose to poor mobilization. As secondary mobilization attempt, 7 patients received 25 micro g per kg per day filgrastim without chemotherapy leading to a 3.7 +/- 2.8-fold (SD) increase in the maximum number of circulating CD34+ cells (p = 0.104). PBPC apheresis yielded 3.3 (+/-0.5) x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg of body weight in 5 patients. Four poor mobilizers received 50 micro g per kg per day filgrastim as second or third mobilization attempt. Circulating CD34+ cells in these patients increased by 1.5 (+/-0.7) compared with the primary G-CSF application. CONCLUSION: Selective PBPC mobilization failure was seen in patients with acute leukemia whereas remarkably good mobilization was seen in other malignancies. Increasing the filgrastim dose to 25 micro g per kg per day may allow PBPC collection in patients failing PBPC mobilization.",,"['Koenigsmann, Michael', 'Jentsch-Ullrich, Kathleen', 'Mohren, Martin', 'Becker, Elke', 'Heim, Marcell', 'Franke, Astrid']","['Koenigsmann M', 'Jentsch-Ullrich K', 'Mohren M', 'Becker E', 'Heim M', 'Franke A']","['Clinic of Hematology/Oncology, Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany. michael.koenigsmann@medizin.uni-magdeburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins']",,2004/04/24 05:00,2004/06/03 05:00,['2004/04/24 05:00'],"['2004/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.0041-1132.2004.03321.x [doi]', 'TRF03321 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2004 May;44(5):777-84. doi: 10.1111/j.0041-1132.2004.03321.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that when chloride is replaced by the pseudohalide thiocyanate, there is little or no H2O2-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, thiocyanate inhibits H2O2-induced apoptosis when chloride is present at physiological concentrations, and this occurs at thiocyanate concentrations that are present in human serum and saliva. In contrast, bromide can substitute for chloride in H2O2-induced apoptosis, but results in a lower percent of the cells induced into apoptosis. Hypobromous acid is likely a short-lived intermediate in this H2O2/MPO/bromide apoptosis, and reagent hypobromous acid and bromamines induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells. We conclude that the physiologic concentrations of thiocyanate found in human plasma could modulate the cytototoxicity of H2O2 and its resulting highly toxic MPO-generated hypochlorous acid by competing with chloride for MPO. Furthermore, the oxidative products of the reaction of thiocyanate with MPO are relatively innocuous for human leukemic cells in culture. In contrast, bromide can support H2O2/MPO/halide apoptosis, but is less potent than chloride and it has no effect in the presence of physiological levels of chloride.",,"['Wagner, Brett A', 'Reszka, Krzysztof J', 'McCormick, Michael L', 'Britigan, Bradley E', 'Evig, Crystal B', 'Burns, C Patrick']","['Wagner BA', 'Reszka KJ', 'McCormick ML', 'Britigan BE', 'Evig CB', 'Burns CP']","['Department of Medicine, Free Radical and Radiation Biology Graduate Program, University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A.

METHODS: B-CLL cells were incubated in vitro in the presence of Rituximab, Campath-1H, and Fluda. The viability of the cells was measured by MTT test (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dyphenyltetrazolium bromide). Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were used to determine the effect of these agents on the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins in vitro. RESULTS: Both monoclonal antibodies, Rituximab and Campath-1H, were less toxic than Fluda to B-CLL cells. Combination of Campath-1H or Rituximab with Fluda did not have a stronger effect on the cells than Fluda alone. Both antibodies decreased the expression of p27 protein and increased the expression of p23; Fluda had a similar effect. The extent of cyclin D3 and cyclin E expression did not change significantly. The expression of cyclin D2 was slightly increased in the presence of Campath-1H, but in the presence of Rituximab it either decreased slightly or remained the same. Treatment of B-CLL cells with Fluda alone induced significant decrease in cyclin D2 expression. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies Campath-1H and Rituximab antibodies, as well as a cytotoxic drug fludarabine, had cytotoxic effects on B-CLL cells.

To date, several clinical trials have been conducted, and some are still ongoing, to evaluate their anti-tumor efficacy. In this view, we chemically constructed an anti-CD20 immunotoxin with the mAb Rituximab and the type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) saporin-S6, designed for B cells non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) therapy. This immunotoxin showed a specific cytotoxicity for the CD20+ cell lines Raji and D430B, evidenced by inhibition of protein synthesis, evaluation of apoptosis and clonogenic assay. Upon conjugation, saporin-S6 increased its toxicity on target cells by at least 2 logs, with IC(50) values of 0.1-0.3 nM. The percentage of AnnexinV+ cells was over 95% in both cell lines treated with 10 nM immunotoxin. A complete elimination of Raji clones was reached with the 10 nM immunotoxin, whereas a mixture of free RIP and mAb gave about 90% of clonogenic growth. Rituximab/saporin-S6, at 10 nM concentration, also induced apoptosis in 80% of lymphoma cells from NHL patients.

One of the most frequently involved genes in experimental studies is Meis 1. In contrast to other genes in murine models, Meis 1 has not been affected by recurrent chromosomal translocations or point mutations in human leukemias. We found a constant downregulation of the Meis 1 gene mRNA in AML1-ETO acute myeloid leukemias and in those cases harboring in frame mutations in the bZIP domain of CEBPalpha. The absence of the Meis 1 mRNA was not caused by inactivating point mutations in the coding sequence. Promoter hypermethylation was present in more than half of the cases (9/14), including samples obtained from the widely employed Kasumi-1 cell line. Double treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A of the Kasumi-1 cell line partially reverses Meis 1 inhibition. HoxA9 levels were also low. In a cell line model (U937 Tet AML1-ETO), AML1-ETO expression was not associated with Meis 1 suppression at 72 h. Nevertheless, Meis 1 repression is dependent on the AML1-ETO transcript levels in treated leukemic patients. Chimeric products that arise from chromosomal translocations may be associated with locus-specific epigenetic inactivation.

To compare the specificity of HTLV-1 protease with that of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) protease, oligopeptides representing naturally occurring cleavage sites in various retroviruses were tested. The number of hydrolyzed peptides as well as the specificity constants suggested a substantially broader specificity of the HIV protease. Amino acid residues of HTLV-1 protease substrate-binding sites were replaced by equivalent ones of HIV-1 protease. Most of the single and multiple mutants had altered specificity and a dramatically reduced folding and catalytic capability, suggesting that mutations are not well tolerated in HTLV-1 protease. The catalytically most efficient mutant was that with the flap residues of HIV-1 protease. The inhibition profile of the mutants was also determined for five inhibitors used in clinical practice and inhibitor analogs of HTLV-1 cleavage sites. Except for indinavir, the HIV-1 protease inhibitors did not inhibit wild type and most of the mutant HTLV-1 proteases. The wild type HTLV-1 protease was inhibited by the reduced peptide bond-containing substrate analogs, whereas the mutants showed various degrees of weakened binding capability.

We asked whether MDR1 USP-derived transcripts were also present in breast carcinoma and assessed their potential as a biomarker. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a sensitive method for detecting transcripts derived from the MDR1 USP and used it to identify MDR1 USP-derived transcripts in cell model systems, in 61 breast carcinoma biopsies of the primary tumor, and in isolated malignant epithelial cells both from the primary tumor and from the associated invaded lymph nodes. RESULTS: The MDR1 USP was not active in several independent leukemic and breast cancer cell lines or nucleated peripheral blood cells (n = 9). However, transcripts derived from the MDR1 USP were detected in some drug-resistant cell lines and a high proportion of primary breast tumors (71.6%; n = 61), whereas they were present at low frequency in normal breast tissue (10%; n = 10). Activation of MDR1 USP was not due to chromosomal amplifications or rearrangements at the MDR1 locus. Transcription from the MDR1 USP correlated with metastatic node invasion [N = 0-3 versus N > 3 (N = number of lymph nodes invaded); Fisher's exact test, P = 0.011] and was detected in malignant epithelial cells from the primary tumor and those that metastasized to the lymph nodes.

RAD51 and XRCC3 are involved in the repair of DNA by this pathway, and polymorphisms have been identified in both the RAD51 (RAD51-G135C) and XRCC3 (XRCC3-Thr241Met) genes. The object of this study was to examine whether these polymorphisms may modulate susceptibility to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disease that is characterized by genetic instability. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied the distribution of polymorphisms in RAD51 and XRCC3 in 216 cases of de novo AML, 51 cases of therapy-related AML (t-AML), and 186 control subjects using PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion. The polymorphic deletion of the detoxification gene glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) was also examined by PCR. RESULTS: The risk of the development of AML was found to be significantly increased when both variant RAD51-135C and XRCC3-241Met alleles are present [odds ratio (OR), 3.77; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.39-10.24], whereas the risk of t-AML development is even higher (OR, 8.11; 95% CI, 2.22-29.68), presumably because of the large genotoxic insult these patients receive after their exposure to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. If we further divide the AML group into patients in which the burden of DNA damage is increased, because of the deletion of the GSTM1 gene, the risk of development of AML is further increased (OR, 15.26; 95% CI, 1.83-127.27). CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly suggest that DNA double-strand breaks and their repair are important in the pathogenesis of both de novo and t-AML.",,"['Seedhouse, Claire', 'Faulkner, Rowena', 'Ashraf, Nadia', 'Das-Gupta, Emma', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Seedhouse C', 'Faulkner R', 'Ashraf N', 'Das-Gupta E', 'Russell N']","['Division of Haematology, School of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Nottingham, and Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, United Kingdom.

Evodiamine, a characteristic alkaloid extracted from Evodia fruits, has been reported to exhibit inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and migration in several types of cancer cells. However, there is no report elucidating the action target and anti-cancer mechanism of this potential natural compound. In this study, we have defined the anti-proliferative and apoptotic mechanisms of evodiamine in human acute leukemia CCRF-CEM cells. According to the MTT assay, the cell viability was inhibited by evodiamine in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.57 +/- 0.05 microM. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the apoptotic cell death proceeded by evodiamine was accompanied with a cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Using Wright-Giemsa staining, we observed that evodiamine caused the cells to arrest in mitosis. It also profoundly caused an increase in polymerized tubulin levels and Bcl-2 phosphorylation on serine 70 in these cells. These data imply that the microtubular cytoskeleton appears to be one of the cellular targets in response to evodiamine. Moreover, treatment of CCRF-CEM cells with evodiamine was associated with increased levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax, activation of caspase-3, and proteolytic cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, an endogenous caspase-3 substrate. Taken together, we demonstrate that evodiamine causes the mitotic arrest and a consequent apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells through the enhancement of polymerized tubulin levels. Furthermore, several biological events including the Bcl-2 phosphorylation, Bax up-regulation and increase of caspase-3 activity could explain evodiamine-induced cell apoptosis.",,"['Huang, Yu-Chun', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa', 'Teng, Che-Ming']","['Huang YC', 'Guh JH', 'Teng CM']","['Pharmacological Institute, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Jen-Ai Road, Sec. 1, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'C01825BVNL (evodiamine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2004/04/23 05:00,2004/05/21 05:00,['2004/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2003/11/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.lfs.2003.11.025 [doi]', 'S0024320504002152 [pii]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2004 May 21;75(1):35-49. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2003.11.025.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tax-nonproducing clones S1T and Su9T01, Tax-producing clones K3T and F6T, and Tax cDNA stably transfected S1TcTax clones S1TcTax04 and S1TcTax05 were examined for PDTC inhibition of thymidine incorporation and apoptosis induction by ISEL method. In addition, S1TcTax clones were analyzed by DNA histography and DNA fragmentation and also examined for p53, p21, or Bax protein expression by Western blot. RESULTS: PDTC inhibited thymidine incorporation of all four HTLV-1-infected T cells in a similar dose-dependent manner, but K3T and F6T were more resistant than S1T and Su9T01 in apoptosis induction. S1TcTax clones also showed resistance to PDTC-induced apoptosis as compared to Tax-nonproducing S1T and S1Tneo. DNA histography demonstrated that PDTC induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in S1T and S1Tneo, and that S1TcTax clones are also sensitive to PDTC in G1 arrest but resistant in apoptosis induction. DNA fragmentation also demonstrated ladder formation only in S1Tneo but not in S1TcTax04. Western blots demonstrated higher expression of p53 and p21 proteins in S1Tneo than in S1TcTax04 during whole phase after PDTC stimulation with moderate enhancement in S1Tneo but small in S1TcTax04. Bax protein expression was detected only at early phase in S1Tneo but was not detected in S1TcTax04. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that PDTC-induced apoptosis is related with Bax, and that G1 arrest is possibly related with p21.

Targeted toxins consisting of a targeting and activating cytokine (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) and diphtheria toxin (DT) can be used to overcome this kind of resistance of leukemic cells. In this study we manipulated the cell cycle and proliferative status of leukemic cells, explored the effect on sensitivity to DT, and determined the ability of DT388GMCSF fusion proteins to activate and subsequently kill leukemic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the GM-CSF-dependent myeloid leukemic cell line AML-193 as a model. GM-CSF or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used to manipulate the cell cycle and proliferative state of AML-193 cells. Cell death was quantified by 51Cr release assays. The results obtained in the AML-193 cell line model were confirmed using primary leukemic blasts. RESULTS: Similar to treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, leukemic cells in resting G0 phase were relatively resistant to DT-induced cell death. Synchronized recruitment of leukemic cells into activated phases of the cell cycle by low concentrations of GM-CSF or G-CSF resulted in significant increased DT sensitivity. DT388GMCSF fusion proteins specifically targeted GM-CSF receptor-expressing cells, resulting in recruitment of leukemic cells from G0 phase of the cell cycle and subsequent kill of these cells.

Recently it was reported that triptolide, a purified compound from Tripterygium, possessed antitumor properties and induced apoptosis in a variety of malignant cell lines. K562 cells are usually resistant to apoptosis induction, probably because of the expression of bcr-abl, the hybrid gene characteristic of the Philadelphia chromosome t (9;22). Present studies demonstrate that triptolide inhibited K562 cells proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose and time-dependent manner. The growth-inhibitory IC50 value for triptolide treatment was 40 ng/ml. Characteristic apoptotic features were confirmed by morphology, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and Annexin V Staining. Significantly, triptolide-induced apoptosis of K562 cells was associated with a decline in bcr-abl expression levels, at the concentrations of 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml, triptolide was able to decrease the expression of bcr-abl down to 50%, 30% and 20% respectively of the basal value after 72 h.

All patients tested positive for CD52 on B-lymphocytes before entering the trial. Thirteen patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 1 prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), 1 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and 1 leukemic immunocytoma (IC) transformed into a high-grade NHL were included. Median age was 62 years (range 40-73), and pretreatment consisted of median 3 prior regimens (range 1-11). All patients received 3, 10 and 30 mg of Campath-1H on sequential days, and then were subsequently scheduled for 30 mg 3 times weekly. Nine out of 16 patients responded. One patient attained complete remission (CR), 8 patients achieved partial remission (PR), while 4 patients had stable disease (SD). Three patients had progressive disease (PD). Beginning with initiation of treatment recurrent profound leukopenia became evident in 13 out of 16 patients leading to treatment discontinuation. Severe nonhematological toxicity (WHO grade IV bronchospasm) occurred in the first patient of this series, who initially had no concomitant steroids. Therefore, we developed a steroid co-medication regimen for the first 4 Campath-1H applications with quick tapering thereafter. Following this regimen, no infusion associated side effects WHO grade > II were observed. Infectious complications leading to treatment discontinuation consisted of pulmonary aspergillosis in one and bacterial pneumonia in another case. One patient with refractory B-CLL and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia plus CMV reactivation died. In summary, Campath-1H appears to be effective against leukemic low-grade B-NHL, also in advanced stage. In our series, application 3 times weekly was not possible due to hematotoxicity.

In general, it is well tolerated and can be used in an outpatient setting. The optimum dose of chlorambucil has not been defined and there are numerous different dosing schedules available. Pharmacokinetic studies suggest decreased bioavailability with successive cycles, probably due to accelerated metabolism. There is good evidence that regimens which use higher doses of chlorambucil have a better outcome than standard dose therapy. Most of the trials which have compared chlorambucil with fludarabine have not used a higher dose regimen of chlorambucil and cannot truly be described as comparative. There is an increase in the incidence of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and also of sepsis with fludarabine treatment, compared to chlorambucil. Fludarabine produces a higher initial response rate in CLL but no statistical difference has been shown in long term survival between fludarabine and high dose chlorambucil. In the treatment of lymphoma, single agent chlorambucil does not confer a durable remission. There have been good results with combination chemotherapy regimens such as CID and PECC. The oral route of administration of these combinations makes them particularly useful as part of palliative chemotherapy. A further point to consider is that chlorambucil is very much cheaper than fludarabine and other newer agents. Chlorambucil should not automatically be overlooked in favor of more recently developed drugs such as fludarabine.

For instance, the V(H)1-69 and V(H)4-34 genes were early found to be overexpressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other B-cell lymphomas. The implications of biased V(H) gene usage have been speculated to be a result of stimulation of unknown antigens, which gives increased proliferation of B-cells with certain V(H) gene configuration and consequently higher probability to undergo transformation. Thus, V(H) gene usage may play a role in development of leukemias and lymphomas. Recently, we could confirm the over usage of the V(H)1-69 and V(H)4-34 genes in CLL, but a novel finding was that the V(H)3-21 gene was preferentially utilized in CLL patients with mutated V(H) genes. These V(H)3-21+ Ig rearrangements showed molecular peculiarities such as shorter lengths of the third complementarity determining region (CDR) and had similar amino acid composition of their CDR3s, implicating recognition of the same antigen in individual tumors. Most of the V(H)3-21+ patients also showed a predominance of lambda chain expression and biased usage of 1 specific V(lambda) gene, V2-14. Furthermore, overall survival appeared to correlate with V(H)3-21 usage and, regardless of V(H) gene mutation status, V(H)3-21+ patients had a poor outcome.

The regression of lymphoid infiltration from other sites is less clear. ALT is also highly active in patients with CLL in progression, even refractory to fludarabine (FA). Hematological toxicity, especially long-lasting lymphocytopenia, was noted in the majority of patients. The most important clinical side effects of ALT treatment were infections, mainly herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus reactivation. RIT is also active in CLL in conventional doses. However some studies suggest that higher doses are more effective than standard doses, used routinely in other lymphoid malignancies. The activity of ALT and RIT in CLL patients resistant to FA and their synergistic interactions with cytotoxic drugs suggests that a combination of these agents may lead to further progress in the treatment of this disease. The T-cell variant of PLL has demonstrated impressive responses to ALT in several trials even if the patients were refractory to deoxycoformycin (DCF) and other agents. However, this MoAb is not curative, because all patients eventually relapsed. Consequently, treatment with ALT may need to be associated with stem cell transplantation to consolidate and maintain long-term remissions. Recently anti-CD22 and anti-CD25 immunotoxins have been investigated in purine analogues refractory or relapsed HCL. The presented results indicate that these agents are highly active and well tolerated even if the patients were resistant to 2-CdA or DCF.",,"['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, 93-513 Lodz, ul.

The discussed series of compounds is of essential value since acridines belong to the group of natural compounds with the pronounced antibacterial and anti-tumor activity. Improved chemical-synthesis techniques made it possible to synthesize both simple and complex compounds of the acridine series; they displayed a clear pharmacological activity as anti-proliferative, anti-tumor and antiparasitic preparations. The ability to induce interferons (INF), type 1, is an expected property of simple acridine derivatives. A variety of INF inducers, now used clinically, have been designed recently on the basis of the above compounds. The most well-known acridine derivatives, their pharmacological properties, action mechanisms and outlooks for practical application are described in the paper. The unique qualities of acridines are primarily attractive due to the possibility of using them for the purpose-oriented designing of drugs. Thus, acridines were used as a basis to create the specific regulatory HIV-1 elements, proliferation inhibitors of leukemia cells and new anti-tumor drugs. The elaboration of complexes of acridines derivatives combined with peptides intercalating specifically into the DNA big or small grooves is the most outstanding trend of acridines' research--it opens up prospects for using them in the synthesis of compounds regulating the gene expression.",,"['Deeva, E G', 'Pavlovskaia, Ia V', 'Kiselev, O I', 'Kiselev, V I', 'Piotrovskii, L B', 'Ershov, F I']","['Deeva EG', 'Pavlovskaia IaV', 'Kiselev OI', 'Kiselev VI', 'Piotrovskii LB', 'Ershov FI']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Russia (Federation),Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk,Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk,9215641,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acridines/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Infective Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",32,2004/04/23 05:00,2004/07/16 05:00,['2004/04/23 05:00'],"['2004/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk. 2004;(2):29-34.,,,,,,,,,Strukturno-funktsional'nyi analiz biologicheskoi aktivnosti proizvodnykh akridina.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RT-PCR amplification of MOZ/CBP (MYST3/CREBBP) chimera has proved difficult, with four different transcripts found in four reported cases. We studied 7 AML-t(8;16) patients, 5 with cytogenetically demonstrated t(8;16) and 2 with similar morphocytochemical and immunophenotypical characteristics. Clinically, 3 cases presented as therapy-related leukemia. Extramedullar involvement was observed at presentation in 2 patients and coagulopathy in 4. The clinicobiological findings confirmed the distinctiveness of this entity. Of note is the erythrophagocytosis in 5 of 7 cases and the immunological negativity for CD34 and CD117 and positivity for CD56. Using a new RT-PCR strategy, we were able to amplify a specific band of 212 bp in six cases in which sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the previously described MOZ/CBP fusion transcript type I. This is the largest molecularly studied AML-t(8;16) series, which demonstrates that MOZ/CBP breakpoints are usually clustered in intron 16 of MOZ and intron 2 of CBP.

Many primary immunodeficiencies are caused by defects in single genes expressed in blood cells; thus addition of a correct copy of the gene to hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can generate immune cells with restored function. HSCs can be removed from a patient, treated outside the body, and reinfused. In the last decade, significant improvements have been made in transferring genes by means of retroviruses to HSCs in vitro, and gene therapy trials for patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) and adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency have restored immune competence. Gene therapy is actively being pursued in other immunodeficiency disorders, including chronic granulomatous disease and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. However, enthusiasm for the correction of XSCID by means of gene therapy has been tempered by the occurrence of 2 cases of leukemia in gene therapy recipients caused by insertion of the retroviral vector in or near the oncogene LMO2. The likelihood of retroviral insertional mutagenesis was estimated to be very low in the past on the basis of theoretic calculations and the absence of observed malignancies in animal studies and early clinical trials. Emerging new findings on retroviral integration both in the patients with XSCID and experimental animals now indicate that the insertion of retroviral sequences into the genome carries significant risk.

DISCUSSION: The emergence of VRE infections presents a treatment challenge in immunocompromised patients. When treating VRE infections in this patient population, the effectiveness of linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin is limited by their bacteriostatic activity when used as monotherapy. Recent in vitro data suggest synergistic activity with quinupristin/dalfopristin when used in combination with other antimicrobials in selected isolates of VRE. CONCLUSIONS: Persistent VRE bacteremia was successfully treated in this neutropenic patient using the combination of high-dose ampicillin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Case reports and in vitro data suggest that concomitant therapy with high-dose ampicillin may be an effective treatment alternative for VRE infections not responding to standard therapy.",,"['Bethea, J Audis', 'Walko, Christine M', 'Targos, Patricia A']","['Bethea JA', 'Walko CM', 'Targos PA']","['Critical Care, Department of Pharmacy Practice, St. Louis College of Pharmacy, St. Louis, MO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '11006-76-1 (Virginiamycin)', '126602-89-9 (quinupristin-dalfopristin)', '7C782967RD (Ampicillin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Ampicillin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/complications/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', '*Enterococcus faecium', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Staphylococcal Infections/complications/drug therapy', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Virginiamycin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,2004/04/22 05:00,2004/08/27 05:00,['2004/04/22 05:00'],"['2004/04/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/27 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1345/aph.1D377 [doi]', 'aph.1D377 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2004 Jun;38(6):989-91. doi: 10.1345/aph.1D377.

Fifteen different fusion partner genes have been identified for NUP98, and more than one half of these are homeobox transcription factors. By contrast, the NUP98 fusion partner in t(11;20) is Topoisomerase I (TOP1), a catalytic enzyme recognized for its key role in relaxing supercoiled DNA. We now show that retrovirally engineered expression of NUP98-TOP1 in murine bone marrow confers a potent in vitro growth advantage and a block in differentiation in hematopoietic precursors, evidenced by a competitive growth advantage in liquid culture, increased replating efficient of colony-forming cells (CFCs), and a marked increase in spleen colony-forming cell output. Moreover, in a murine bone marrow transplantation model, NUP98-TOP1 expression led to a lethal, transplantable leukemia characterized by extremely high white cell counts, splenomegaly, and mild anemia. Strikingly, a mutation to a TOP1 site to inactivate the isomerase activity essentially left unaltered the growth-promoting and leukemogenic effects of NUP98-TOP1.

When GVHD is controlled by T-cell-depleted grafts or immunosuppressants, BM transplant recipients often suffer from an increased rate of leukemic relapse and impaired reconstitution of immunity. Using a mouse BMT model, we investigated the effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) gene transfection on the severity of GVHD, the graft-versus-leukemia effect, and the reconstitution of T cells after BMT. After HGF gene transfer, acute GVHD was reduced, while mature donor T-cell responses to host antigens were preserved, resulting in a significant improvement of leukemia-free survival. HGF gene transfer promoted regeneration of bone marrow-derived T cells and the responsiveness of these cells to alloantigens. Furthermore, HGF preserved the thymocyte phenotype and thymic stromal architecture in mice with GVHD. This suggested that HGF exerts a potent protective effect on the thymus, which in turn promotes reconstitution of bone marrow-derived T cells after allogeneic BMT. These results indicate that HGF gene transfection can reduce acute GVHD preserving the graft-versus-leukemia effect, while promoting thymic-dependent T-cell reconstitution after allogeneic BMT.",,"['Imado, Takehito', 'Iwasaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Kataoka, Yasuro', 'Kuroiwa, Takanori', 'Hara, Hiroshi', 'Fujimoto, Jiro', 'Sano, Hajime']","['Imado T', 'Iwasaki T', 'Kataoka Y', 'Kuroiwa T', 'Hara H', 'Fujimoto J', 'Sano H']","['Division of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, 1-1 Mukogawa-cho, Nishinomiya 663-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*drug effects/immunology', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2004/04/22 05:00,2004/10/05 09:00,['2004/04/22 05:00'],"['2004/04/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4309 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43500-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Sep 1;104(5):1542-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4309.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 20 consecutive patients who developed respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia after bone marrow transplantation and who had high-resolution CT of the chest performed within 24 hr after the onset of symptoms. The CT scans were reviewed by two chest radiologists who assessed the pattern and distribution of findings. RESULTS: Bone marrow transplantation was performed on 12 male and eight female patients ranging from 3 to 48 years old (mean age, 25 years) for treatment of various forms of leukemia (n = 12), severe aplastic anemia (n = 6), Fanconi's syndrome (n = 1), and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (n = 1). Sixteen patients (80%) had abnormal CT findings. The predominant patterns of abnormality on high-resolution CT scans were small centrilobular nodules (10/20, 50%), air-space consolidation (7/20, 35%), ground-glass opacities (6/20, 30%), and bronchial wall thickening (6/20, 30%). The abnormalities were distributed in the central and peripheral areas of the lungs in nine cases, only in the periphery in five cases, and only in the central regions in two cases. The abnormalities were bilateral and asymmetric in distribution in 13 patients, bilateral and symmetric in two patients, and unilateral in one patient. CONCLUSION: The most common high-resolution CT findings in patients with respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia after bone marrow transplantation consist of small centrilobular nodules and multifocal areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in a bilateral asymmetric distribution.",,"['Gasparetto, Emerson L', 'Escuissato, Dante L', 'Marchiori, Edson', 'Ono, Sergio', 'Frare e Silva, Rodney L', 'Muller, Nestor L']","['Gasparetto EL', 'Escuissato DL', 'Marchiori E', 'Ono S', 'Frare e Silva RL', 'Muller NL']","['Department of Radiology, University of Parana, Parana, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

Here, two ubiquitous compartments, nucleoli, and PML bodies, are shown to disassemble when K562 cell nuclei expand in medium of low monovalent cation concentration; their major proteins dispersed as seen by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, and nucleolar transcript elongation fell by approximately 85%. These compartments reassembled and nucleolar transcription recovered in the same medium after adding inert, penetrating macromolecules (8 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG), or 10.5 kDa dextran) to 12% w/v, showing that disassembly was not caused by the low cation concentration. These responses satisfy the criteria for crowding or volume exclusion effects which occur in concentrated mixtures of macromolecules; upon expansion the macromolecular concentration within the nucleus falls, and can be restored by PEG or dextran. These observations, together with evidence of a high concentration of macromolecules in the nucleus (in the range of 100mg/ml) which must cause strong crowding forces, suggest strongly that these forces play an essential role in driving the formation, and maintaining the function of nuclear compartments.

However, the term 'mature' has also been used to describe other rare cases of B-ALL with light-chain surface immunoglobulin expression. In contrast, infantile B-cell ALL is generally characterized by rearrangement of the MLL gene, an immature pro-B-cell phenotype, and CD10 negativity. We describe two unusual cases of infantile B-ALL with non-L3 morphology, expressing a mature B-cell phenotype (lambda sIg+, CD19+, CD10-, TdT-, and CD34-), and showing MLL rearrangement without MYC rearrangement at presentation. Both infants relapsed after months of morphologic and genetic remission. At relapse, the t(9;11) translocation was detected in both cases by spectral karyotyping. After the initial relapse, both cases followed a rapid and aggressive course. Literature search identified few similar cases, all expressed lambda surface immunoglobulin and showed MLL rearrangement (majority with the t(9;11) translocation). These cases show that B-ALL with MLL rearrangement, especially the t(9;11) translocation, can express a 'mature' B-cell phenotype and may represent a distinct subset.

We investigated the risk of childhood leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in relation to paternal occupational contact with other individuals, a surrogate for potential exposure to infection. METHODS: We carried out a case-control study using 792 cases from the Northern Region Young Persons' Malignant Disease Registry, United Kingdom, 1968-1997, and 2 large population-based control groups. Paternal occupations at birth were classified as having standard, high, or very high levels of contact. Conditional logistic regression was used in the analysis. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of childhood leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in those children whose fathers' occupational contacts were high or very high compared with standard (odds ratio = 1.3; 95% confidence interval = 1.0-1.5). The excess risk in the very high group was most pronounced for 245 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia aged 2 to 5 years at diagnosis (1.5; 1.1-2.1). The risk with paternal occupational contacts was greater in rural areas, although it was also present in urban areas.

The diagnosis of MCL can be problematic, and existing CCND1 expression assays show a lack of specificity, with elevated expression also detected in other lymphoproliferative disorders. We postulated that evaluating CCND1 expression relative to CCND3 expression by quantitative PCR could offer an improved specificity over an evaluation of CCND1 alone. This method quantitates both CCND1 and CCND3, each normalized to a housekeeping gene (GADPH), using the 5'-exonuclease technique. We analyzed 107 clinical specimens: MCL (17), chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) (10), other non-MCL hematolymphoid disorders (41), non-malignant tissues with an epithelial component (7) and other normal samples (32). This method correctly identified 16 of 17 MCLs, and there were no false positives among any of the other diagnostic groups tested including CLL. CLL presents the major diagnostic dilemma at this institution when diagnosing MCL. Sensitivity studies showed that this method could detect an elevated CCND1/CCND3 ratio when the tumor infiltrate is at least 10% of the cells. We compared the specificity of CCND1 expression alone against the CCND1/CCND3 ratio to demonstrate the increased specificity for the latter.

We here report a novel method for highly efficient isolation of intact poly(A)+ RNA using an LNA-substituted oligo(dT) affinity ligand, based on the increased affinity of LNA-T for complementary poly(A) tracts. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated directly from 4 M guanidine thiocyanate-lysed Caenorhabditis elegans worm extracts as well as from lysed human K562 and vincristine-resistant K562/VCR leukemia cells using LNA_2.T oligonucleotide as an affinity probe, in which every second thymidine was substituted by LNA thymidine. In accordance with the significantly increased stability of the LNA_2.T-A duplexes in 4 M GuSCN, we obtained a 30- to 50-fold mRNA yield increase using the LNA-substituted oligo(T) affinity probe compared with DNA-oligo(dT)-selected mRNA samples. The LNA_2.T affinity probe was, furthermore, highly efficient in isolation of poly(A)+ RNA in a low salt concentration range of 50-100 mM NaCl in poly(A) binding buffer, as validated by selecting the mRNA pools from total RNA samples extracted from different Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, followed by northern blot analysis. Finally, we demonstrated the utility of the LNA-oligo(T)-selected mRNA in quantitative real-time PCR by analysing the relative expression levels of the human mdr1 multidrug resistance gene in the two K562 cell lines employing pre-validated Taqman assays. Successful use of the NH2-modified LNA_2.T probe in isolation of human mRNA implies that the LNA-oligo(T) method could be automated for streamlined, high throughput expression profiling by real-time PCR by covalently coupling the LNA affinity probe to solid, pre-activated surfaces, such as microtiter plate wells or magnetic particles.",,"['Jacobsen, Nana', 'Nielsen, Peter Stein', 'Jeffares, Daniel Charlton', 'Eriksen, Jens', 'Ohlsson, Helle', 'Arctander, Peter', 'Kauppinen, Sakari']","['Jacobsen N', 'Nielsen PS', 'Jeffares DC', 'Eriksen J', 'Ohlsson H', 'Arctander P', 'Kauppinen S']","['Department of Functional Genomics, Exiqon, Bygstubben 9, DK-2950 Vedbaek, Denmark. jacobsen@exiqon.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '593-84-0 (guanidine thiocyanate)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics', 'Cell Extracts/*genetics', 'Chromatography, Affinity/*methods', 'DNA Probes/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, Fungal/genetics', 'Genes, MDR/genetics', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Ligands', 'Magnetics', 'Microspheres', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Poly A/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/genetics/*isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/classification/genetics', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Thiocyanates/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,2004/04/21 05:00,2004/05/25 05:00,['2004/04/21 05:00'],"['2004/04/21 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/25 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/21 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/nar/gnh056 [doi]', '32/7/e64 [pii]']",epublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2004 Apr 19;32(7):e64. doi: 10.1093/nar/gnh056.,,20040419,,,PMC407836,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined the nature of the PML-RARA protein complex and of its DNA targets in APL cells. Using a selection/amplification approach, we demonstrate that PML-RARA targets consist of two AGGTCA elements in an astonishing variety of orientations and spacings, pointing to highly relaxed structural constrains for DNA binding and identifying a major gain of function of this oncogene. PML-RARA-specific response elements were identified, which all conveyed a major transcriptional response to RA only in APL cells. In these cells, we demonstrate that PML-RARA oligomers are complexed to RXR. Directly probing PML-RARA function in APL cells, we found that the differentiation enhancer cyclic AMP (cAMP) boosted transcriptional activation by RA. cAMP also reversed the normal silencing (subordination) of the transactivating function of RXR when bound to RARA or PML-RARA, demonstrating that the alternate rexinoid/cAMP-triggered APL differentiation pathway also activates PML-RARA targets. Finally, cAMP restored both RA-triggered differentiation and PML-RARA transcriptional activation in mutant RA-resistant APL cells.

In this report, we demonstrate that PBX1a, PBX1b, PBX2, and PBX3 mRNAs and PBX1/2/3 proteins are induced during endodermal and neuronal differentiation of P19 cells in a RAR-dependent subtype-unspecific manner following RA treatment. The increases in both PBX1 mRNA and PBX3 mRNA levels are secondary responses to RA treatment requiring new proteins synthesis while the increase in PBX2 mRNA is a primary response. The RA-dependent increases in PBX1 mRNA, PBX2 mRNA, and PBX3 mRNA levels are likely to be transcriptionally regulated since the stability of these mRNAs does not change. In addition, the half-lives of PBX1/2/3 proteins are significantly extended by RA treatment. Two possible mechanisms could contribute to the stabilization of PBX proteins: PBX proteins associate with RA-dependent increased levels of MEIS proteins, and RA may decrease the proteasome dependent degradation of PBX proteins.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Qin, Pu', 'Haberbusch, Juliet M', 'Soprano, Kenneth J', 'Soprano, Dianne Robert']","['Qin P', 'Haberbusch JM', 'Soprano KJ', 'Soprano DR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Stability', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",,2004/04/20 05:00,2004/12/17 09:00,['2004/04/20 05:00'],"['2004/04/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.20057 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2004 May 1;92(1):147-63. doi: 10.1002/jcb.20057.,,,"['CA82770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44517/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that downregulation of Notch-1 expression has significant anti-neoplastic activity in pre-clinical models. However, the mechanisms through which Notch modulation may affect cell fate in cancer remain poorly understood. We had previously shown that Notch-1 prevents apoptosis and is necessary for pharmacologically induced differentiation in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. We investigated the mechanisms of these effects using three experimental strategies: (1) MEL cells stably transfected with antisense Notch-1 or constitutively active Notch-1, (2) activation of Notch-1 by a cell-associated ligand, and (d3) activation of Notch-1 by a soluble peptide ligand. We show that: (1) downregulation of Notch-1 sensitizes MEL cells to apoptosis induced by a Ca(2+) influx or anti-neoplastic drugs; (2) Notch-1 downregulation induces phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) while constitutive activation of Notch-1 or prolonged exposure to a soluble Notch ligand abolishes it; (3) Notch-1 has dose- and time-dependent effects on the levels of apoptotic inhibitor Bcl-x(L) and cell cycle regulators p21(cip1/waf1), p27(kip1), and Rb; and (4) Notch-1 activation by a cell-associated ligand is accompanied by rapid and transient induction of NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. The relative effects of Notch-1 signaling on these pathways depend on the levels of Notch-1 expression, the mechanism of activation, and the timing of activation. The relevance of these findings to the role of Notch signaling in differentiation and cancer are discussed.","['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Jang, Mei-Shiang', 'Miao, Haixi', 'Carlesso, Nadia', 'Shelly, Leslie', 'Zlobin, Andrei', 'Darack, Nicole', 'Qin, Jian-Zhong', 'Nickoloff, Brian J', 'Miele, Lucio']","['Jang MS', 'Miao H', 'Carlesso N', 'Shelly L', 'Zlobin A', 'Darack N', 'Qin JZ', 'Nickoloff BJ', 'Miele L']","['Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2004/04/20 05:00,2004/06/18 05:00,['2004/04/20 05:00'],"['2004/04/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10467 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2004 Jun;199(3):418-33. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10467.,,,['1R01 CA84065-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although considered to be important in neural development, recent studies in Drosophila also highlight a role for ALK in gut muscle differentiation. Indeed, the Drosophila model offers a future arena for the study of ALK, its ligands and signalling cascades. The discovery of activated fusion forms of the ALK tyrosine kinase in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) has dramatically improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of these lymphomas and enhanced the pathological diagnosis of this subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Likewise, the realisation that a high percentage of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumours express activated-ALK fusion proteins has clarified the causation of these mesenchymal neoplasms and provided for their easier discrimination from other mesenchymal-derived inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT) mimics. Recent reports of ALK expression in a range of carcinoma-derived cell lines together with its apparent role as a receptor for PTN and MK, both of which have been implicated in tumourigenesis, raise the possibility that ALK-mediated signalling could play a role in the development and/or progression of a number of common solid tumours.

Cytotoxic mediators present in ts1-induced spongiform lesions may generate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated whether ER stress signaling is involved in ts1-mediated neuronal loss in the brain of infected mice. ts1-infected brainstems were found to show significant increases in phosphorylation of the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha. In addition, increased expression of growth arrest DNA damage 153 (GADD153), glucose-regulated protein 78, and caspase-12 were accompanied by increases in processing of caspase-12 and its downstream target, caspase-3. All of these events are markers of ER stress. We observed that GADD153 and cleaved caspase-3 were present in degenerative neurons in the lesions of infected mice, but not in uninfected controls. Phosphorylated calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-alpha was significantly increased, and was coexpressed with GADD153 in a large proportion of neurons undergoing early and advanced degenerative changes. Finally, neuronal degeneration in spongiform lesions was associated with increase in calcium (Ca(2+)) accumulation in mitochondria. Together, these results suggest that ts1 infection-mediated neuronal degeneration in mice may result from activation of ER stress signaling pathways, presumably initiated by perturbation of Ca(2+) homeostasis.

We identified five alternatively spliced TEL isoforms generated possibly through exon skipping mechanisms, by using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis.

This isoform abrogated specific DNA-binding capacity to and trans-repressional ability through the ETS-binding site. Regardless, it showed dominant-negative effects over wild-type-TEL (TEL-a)-mediated transcriptional repression partly through sequestration of TEL-a from nucleus to cytoplasm. Moreover, TEL-f dominantly interfered with TEL-a-mediated erythroid differentiation in MEL cells and growth suppression in NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, TEL isoforms without the entire (Delta exons 6+7-TEL) or a part (Delta exon 7-TEL) of ETS domain were expressed more frequently in myelodysplastic syndrome-derived leukemia than in myelodysplastic syndrome before transformation.

At that time, based on available data, resistance associated with overexpression of the cell-surface transmembrane ATPase P-glycoprotein (P-170, P-gp, the product of the MDR1 gene) was described as ""the"" cause of multidrug resistance in cancer cells. However, during the 1980s and later on other mechanisms were described as candidate causes of multidrug resistance in human leukemia. Moreover, research of the past decade has provided us with an enormous increase in the amount of data and knowledge on the cell-biological and--to an even higher extent--the molecular-genetic processes governing cell survival and death in cancer cells. This, in turn, has improved the possibilities of designing and developing better drugs and drug combinations in leukemia. Along this line, based on rational drug design, imatinib, a 2-phenylaminopyrimidine derivative, has very recently been introduced and found to be an efficient inhibitor of the altered tyrosine kinase, which arises as a product of the BCR-ABL fusion transcript in Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) cases of CML. This new compound appears to be the first of a (hopefully) large family of small organic molecules with a more specific inhibiting activity against the pathogenetic defects in leukemia as well as cancer. With this novel compound, as with all other known individual drugs and classes of chemotherapeutic drugs, drug resistance is seen. To what extent drug resistance towards this novel compound (and its successors) will follow patterns of drug resistance that are already known or entirely new mechanisms of drug resistance is yet to be seen.",,"['Norgaard, Jan Maxwell', 'Olesen, Lene Hyldahl', 'Hokland, Peter']","['Norgaard JM', 'Olesen LH', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark. janmaxgaard@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy']",164,2004/04/20 05:00,2005/01/05 09:00,['2004/04/20 05:00'],"['2003/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/S1040-8428(03)00173-2 [doi]', 'S1040842803001732 [pii]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2004 Apr;50(1):39-49. doi: 10.1016/S1040-8428(03)00173-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of Jurkat or U937 cells with Bortezomib resulted in activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), inactivation of extracellular signal-regulating kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), cytochrome c release, caspase-9, -3, and -8 activation, and apoptosis. Bortezomib-mediated cytochrome c release and caspase activation were blocked by the pharmacologic JNK inhibitor SP600125, but lethality was not diminished by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Inducible expression of a constitutively active MEK1 construct blocked Bortezomib-mediated ERK1/2 inactivation, significantly attenuated Bortezomib lethality, and unexpectedly prevented JNK activation. Conversely, pharmacologic MEK/ERK1/2 inhibition promoted Bortezomib-mediated JNK activation and apoptosis. Lastly, the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (LNAC) attenuated Bortezomib-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, ERK inactivation, JNK activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis. In contrast, enforced MEK1 and ERK1/2 activation or JNK inhibition did not modify Bortezomib-induced ROS production. Together, these findings suggest that in human leukemia cells, Bortezomib-induced oxidative injury operates at a proximal point in the cell death cascade to antagonize cytoprotective ERK1/2 signaling, promote activation of the stress-related JNK pathway, and to trigger mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, and apoptosis.

Through the use of particle nanotracking, we detect and quantify the micro-organization as well as the viscoelastic properties of the intranuclear region in single, live, interphase somatic cells. We find that the intranuclear region is much stiffer than the cytoplasm; it is also more elastic than viscous, which reveals that the intranuclear region displays an unexpectedly strong solid-like behavior. The mean shear viscosity and elasticity of the intranuclear region of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts are 520 Poise (P) and 180 dyn/cm(2), respectively. These measurements determine a lower bound of the propulsive forces (3-15 picoNewton) required for nuclear organelles such as promyelocytic-leukemia bodies to undergo processive transport within the nucleus by overcoming friction forces set by the intranuclear viscosity. Dynamic analysis of the spontaneous movements of nanospheres embedded in the nucleus reveals the presence of putative transient nuclear microdomains of mean size 290+/-50 nm, which are mostly absent in the cytoplasm. The strong elastic character and micro-organization of the intranuclear region revealed by particle nanotracking analysis may help the nucleus to preserve its structural coherence.

In the present study, we investigated the antitumor mechanism of EGCG by using human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Jurkat cells. We focused on the involvement of reactive oxygen species, as we found previously that EGCG caused apoptotic cell death in osteoclastic cells due mainly to promotion of the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) to trigger Fenton reaction, which affords hydroxyl radical from hydrogen peroxide [H(2)O(2) + Fe(II) --> (*)OH + OH(-) + Fe(III)]. EGCG (12.5-50 micro M) decreased the viability of Jurkat cells and caused concomitant increase in cellular caspase-3 activity. Catalase and the Fe(II)-chelating reagent o-phenanthroline suppressed the EGCG effects, indicating involvements of both H(2)O(2) and Fe(II) in the mechanism. Unexpectedly, epicatechin gallate (ECG), which has Fe(III)-reducing potency comparable with EGCG, failed to decrease the viability of Jurkat cells, while epigallocatechin (EGC), which has low capacity to reduce Fe(III), showed cytotoxic effects similar to EGCG. These results suggest that, unlike in osteoclastic cells, a mechanism other than Fe(III) reduction plays a role in catechin-mediated Jurkat cell death. We found that EGCG causes an elevation of H(2)O(2) levels in Jurkat cell culture, in cell-free culture medium and sodium phosphate buffer. Catechins with a higher ability to produce H(2)O(2) were more cytotoxic to Jurkat cells. Hydrogen peroxide itself exerted Fe(II)-dependent cytotoxicity. Amongst tumor and normal cell lines tested, cells exhibiting lower H(2)O(2)-eliminating activity were more sensitive to EGCG. From these findings, we propose the mechanism that make catechins cytotoxic in certain tumor cells is due to their ability to produce H(2)O(2) and that the resulting increase in H(2)O(2) levels triggers Fe(II)-dependent formation of highly toxic hydroxyl radical, which in turn induces apoptotic cell death.",,"['Nakagawa, Hiroshi', 'Hasumi, Keiji', 'Woo, Je-Tae', 'Nagai, Kazuo', 'Wachi, Masaaki']","['Nakagawa H', 'Hasumi K', 'Woo JT', 'Nagai K', 'Wachi M']","['Department of Bioengineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, 4259 Nagatsuta-cho, Midori-ku, Yokohama 226-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'W4X6ZO7939 (1,10-phenanthroline)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidants/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2004/04/20 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/04/20 05:00'],"['2004/04/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/carcin/bgh168 [doi]', 'bgh168 [pii]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2004 Sep;25(9):1567-74. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgh168.

We examined whether there was also an excess of leukemia in patients after transplantation and whether this might be related to a particular immunosuppressive treatment. Data from more than 170 000 patients indicated that organ transplantation is associated with a significantly increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML was more frequent after heart transplantation and lung transplantation than after kidney transplantation and was associated with immunosuppression by azathioprine, a thiopurine prodrug. Cellular resistance to thiopurines is associated with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. We demonstrate that thiopurine treatment of human cells in vitro selects variants with defective MMR. Consistent with a similar selection in patient bone marrow, in 7 of 7 patients, transplant-related AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) exhibited the microsatellite instability (MSI) that is diagnostic for defective MMR. Because MSI occurs infrequently in de novo AML, we conclude that the selective proliferation of MMR-defective, azathioprine-resistant myeloid cells may contribute significantly to the development of AML/MDS in patients who have received organ transplants. Identifying azathioprine as a risk factor for AML/MDS suggests that discontinuing the use of azathioprine as an immunosuppressant might reduce the incidence of posttransplantation AML/MDS.",,"['Offman, Judith', 'Opelz, Gerhard', 'Doehler, Bernd', 'Cummins, David', 'Halil, Ozay', 'Banner, Nicholas R', 'Burke, Margaret M', 'Sullivan, Dianne', 'Macpherson, Peter', 'Karran, Peter']","['Offman J', 'Opelz G', 'Doehler B', 'Cummins D', 'Halil O', 'Banner NR', 'Burke MM', 'Sullivan D', 'Macpherson P', 'Karran P']","['Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Azathioprine/adverse effects', 'Base Pair Mismatch/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart Transplantation/*adverse effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Lung Transplantation/*adverse effects/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2004/04/20 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/04/20 05:00'],"['2004/04/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-11-3938 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43614-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Aug 1;104(3):822-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-11-3938.

The activation of NF-kappaB is controlled by proteasome-mediated degradation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha). We investigated the effects of PS-341, a peptide boronate inhibitor of the proteasome in HTLV-1 Tax transgenic tumors in vitro and in vivo. In Tax transgenic mice, PS-341 administered thrice weekly inhibited tumor-associated NF-kappaB activity. Quantitation of proliferation, apoptosis, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-10 secretion by tumor cells in culture revealed that the effects of PS-341 on cell growth largely correlated with inhibition of pathways mediated by NF-kappaB. However, the effect of PS-341 on the growth of tumors in Tax transgenic mice revealed heterogeneity in drug responsiveness. The tumor tissues treated with PS-341 show no consistent inhibition of NFkappaB activation in vivo. Annexin V staining indicated that PS-341 response in vivo correlated with sensitivity to apoptosis induced by gamma irradiation. On the other hand, transplanted Tax tumors in Rag-1 mice showed consistent inhibition of tumor growth and prolonged survival in response to the same drug regimen.

The finding that 75% of the recipients of fresh-frozen bone from the same donor contracted human immunodeficiency virus has led to speculation that freeze-drying may render retroviral-infected musculoskeletal allografts noninfectious. HYPOTHESIS: Lyophilization does not inactivate retrovirus in systemically infected bone and tendon. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Tendons and cortical bone segments from cats systemically infected with feline leukemia virus were used in this study. Feline embryonic fibroblast cells were cultured in the presence of fresh-frozen or freeze-dried cortical bone or tendon segments. At each passage, feline leukemia virus p27 antigen was measured in media by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and feline leukemia virus (pro)viral nucleic acids were quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the DNA extracted from cells. RESULTS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results and quantitative polymerase chain reaction results demonstrated retroviral antigen and proviral DNA in all cultured cell replicates after exposure to fresh-frozen or freeze-dried bones or tendons.

METHODS: Data from three studies, a single and a repeat dose Phase I study in postmenopausal women as well as a proof of concept study in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer were combined and analyzed. The structural pharmacokinetic model was developed using the rich data from the Phase I studies and the full pharmacostatistical model was then derived using all the data. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of r-hLIF after repeated subcutaneous administration were described by a one-compartment disposition model with a zero order input. The duration of the absorption phase was short (0.8 h) and invariant. The apparent clearance in postmenopausal women was 57 l h(-1) (CV = 17%). In in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer patients, the apparent clearance was decreased by 35% compared with postmenopausal women. The apparent volume of distribution was 235 l (interindividual CV = 28%) and exhibited an interoccasion variability of 23%. It increased (for weight above 62 kg) or decreased (for weight below 62 kg) by 29% for every 10 kg body weight. The median posthoc estimates of apparent clearance and volume of distribution and their variability were consistent with the population estimates. In postmenopausal women, the results were consistent with those obtained by noncompartmental analysis. The residual variability on r-hLIF serum concentrations was 20%. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetics of r-hLIF after repeated SC administration were described by a one compartment disposition model, with zero order input, in postmenopausal women and those undergoing IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection and embryo transfer.

Rejection of blood transfusions by individuals of this faith is usually blamed to justify this attitude, thus leading to severe personal, medical and psychological distress related to the lack of care. We therefore intended to verify whether a standard (tailored) chemotherapy, without the use of prophylactic blood product transfusions, could be applied during treatment of acute leukaemia under such circumstances. Eleven consecutive JW adult patients with acute leukaemia, all of whom had been denied care in other institutions, were treated at the European Institute of Oncology (EIO) in Milan, Italy. Five had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (one bcr/abl positive), six had acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with immunophenotype and/or cytogenetic intermediate-high risk features, except one patient with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML). Standard induction chemotherapy [cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) and daunorubicin (DNR) for AML, vincristine (VCR), DNR and prednisone (PDN) for ALL, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and DNR for APML] with the antracycline dose of at least 30 mg/sqm were used. All patients experienced severe anaemia after induction chemotherapy despite erythropoietin. Median haemoglobin nadir for patients with ALL and AML was 4.5 g/dL (range 1.3-6.9) and 5.1 g/dL (range 2.6-6.8), respectively. Median platelet nadir counts for all patients was 14.5 x 10(9))/L (range 1-24). One patient died during induction probably due to haemorrhage. Four of five patients with ALL achieved a complete remission (CR) (including the bcr/abl case) while among patients with AML only the one with APML achieved CR. Three patients (APML = 1 and ALL = 2) are still alive and disease-free.

This study was aimed at defining the status of activated STAT5 and BCL-X(L) expression and their relation to BCR-ABL rearrangement in CML cells derived from patients at different clinical stages. Twenty-seven consecutive patients with CML were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blotting to analyse phosphorylated STAT5. The p210 BCR-ABL rearrangements were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and BCL-X(L) expression by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. We found that increased transcription of BCL-X(L) gene was associated with phosphorylated STAT5 in the majority of blast crisis patients and in a few accelerated and chronic phase patients. Moreover, BCL-X(L) expression levels were found to be decreased in chronic phase, contrary to a marked increase in blast crisis. We found no difference in expression of BCL-X(L) and phosphorylated STAT5 when related with b3a2 and b2a2 BCR-ABL rearrangements.

Its presumed mechanism of action in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is via immunomodulatory mechanisms, although these remain to be fully elucidated. Intravenous mitoxantrone treatment improved neurological disability and delayed progression of MS in patients with worsening relapsing-remitting (RR) [also termed progressive-relapsing (PR) MS] or secondary-progressive (SP) disease. In a pivotal randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial, mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) administered once every 3 months for 2 years provided significant improvements in neurological disability ratings, including Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Ambulatory Index (AI) and Standardised Neurological Status (SNS) scores, compared with placebo. The drug also significantly reduced the mean number of corticosteroid-treated relapses and prolonged the time to the first treated relapse, with the beneficial effects on disease progression supported by magnetic resonance imaging. Post hoc analyses suggest that the benefits associated with mitoxantrone treatment may be sustained for at least 12 months after cessation of treatment, mean changes from baseline at 36 months in EDSS, AI and SNS scores of 0.10, 0.61 and 0.19, respectively, in the mitoxantrone group versus 0.46, 1.13 and 3.38 with placebo. Concomitant intravenous mitoxantrone 20mg plus intravenous methylprednisolone 1g once every month for 6 months was more effective than intravenous methylprednisolone monotherapy in preventing the development of new gadolinium-enhanced lesions in patients with very active RRMS or SPMS. The drug was generally well tolerated in patients with MS. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and usually resolved upon discontinuation of treatment or with appropriate pharmacotherapy. At the recommended dosage, mitoxantrone appears to have a low potential to cause cardiotoxicity. In conclusion, intravenous mitoxantrone reduces the relapse rate and slows progression of the disease in patients with worsening RRMS, PRMS or SPMS; thus providing a new option for the management of these patients. The drug was generally well tolerated at the recommended dosage, although potential cardiotoxicity limits the total cumulative dose to 140 mg/m(2). Further studies are warranted to determine which patients with worsening RRMS, PRMS or SPMS are most likely to benefit from mitoxantrone treatment and to more fully define the long-term safety and tolerability of mitoxantrone, including the use of concomitant cardioprotectants to extend the therapeutic lifespan of the drug. Pharmacodynamic Profile. Mitoxantrone, a synthetic anthracenedione derivative, is an established cytotoxic, antineoplastic agent. Its presumed mechanism of action in multiple sclerosis (MS) is immunosuppression. In antineoplastic studies, the drug showed several immunomodulatory effects, inducing macrophage-mediated suppression of B-cell, T-helper and T-cytotoxic lymphocyte function. Currently, the pharmacodynamic properties of mitoxantrone have not been investigated to any extent in patients with MS. In one study, 6 months' treatment with intravenous mitoxantrone generally had no effect on the distribution of cytokine-positive peripheral blood monocyte cells in patients with MS. In an animal model of the disease, mitoxantrone suppressed the development and progression of both actively and passively induced acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). It appeared to be 10-20 times more effective than cyclophosphamide in the suppression of EAE. Moreover, mitoxantrone approximately doubled the mean time to onset of EAE versus control animals (279 vs 148 days after immunisation; p < 0.00005). In vitro, mitoxantrone 10 and 100 micro g/L inhibited myelin degradation by leucocytes and peritoneal macrophages derived from mice with acute EAE by approximately 60% and 100%. Pharmacokinetic Profile. Currently, there are no published pharmacokinetic data for intravenous mitoxantrone in pitoxantrone in patients with MS, paediatric patients or in those with renal impairment. All studies, to date, have been in patients with cancer receiving a single, approximately 30-minute intravenous infusion of mitoxantrone 5-14 mg/m(2). The drug exhibits triexponential pharmacokinetics, with a rapid initial distribution (alpha) phase, an intermediate distribution (beta) phase and a much slower elimination (gamma) phase. The mean half-life of the alpha phase appears to be 6-12 minutes and that of the beta phase 1.1-3.1 hours. Mitoxantrone has a high affinity for tissue, with a volume of distribution of up to 2248 L/m(2). Mitoxantrone persists for prolonged periods in tissues and was detectable in autopsy tissue from patients who last received the drug up to 272 days before death. At concentrations of 10-10000 ng/mL, the drug was 70-80 % bound to plasma proteins in dogs. Elimination of mitoxantrone occurs predominantly through biliary excretion and may be impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction or third space abnormalities (e.g. ascites). The mean terminal elimination half-life of mitoxantrone ranged from 23 hours to 215 hours. Renal clearance accounts for 10 % of the total clearance of the drug. Total clearance of mitoxantrone ranged from 13 to 34.2 L/h/m(2) and renal clearance from 0.9 to 2.7 L/h/m(2). The drug appears to have a low potential for interaction with other concomitantly administered agents. Therapeutic Efficacy. Intravenous mitoxantrone (infusion of > or = 5 minutes), either as monotherapy or in combination with intravenous methylprednisolone, delayed the progression of the disease in patients with secondary-progressive (SP) or worsening relapsing-remitting (RR) MS (the latter is also termed progressive-relapsing MS) in comparative, randomised, multicentre trials. In a double-blind, monotherapy trial (Mitoxantrone In Multiple Sclerosis [MIMS] trial), mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) (n = 60) once every 3 months for 2 years significantly improved neurological disability relative to placebo (n = 64), as assessed by changes in mean Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, mean Ambulatory Index (AI) score and mean Standardised Neurological Status (SNS) score. The drug also significantly reduced the mean number of corticosteroid-treated relapses per patient and prolonged the time to the first treated relapse. A Wei-Lachin multivariate analysis of these five efficacy variables indicated that the global difference between the two treatment groups was 0.30 (p < 0.0001). Mitroxantrone was also more effective than placebo according to secondary endpoints in this study, with fewer mitoxantrone recipients experiencing a relapse, a deterioration of > or =1 EDSS point or a confirmed deterioration in EDSS score over a 3-month period. Mitoxantrone recipients also showed less deterioration in quality-of-life ratings and had fewer hospital admissions, whereas more placebo recipients had new gadolinium-enhanced lesions at study end (the latter parameter was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] in a subgroup of 110 patients, including 40 patients who received an exploratory 5 mg/m(2) dose). Furthermore, post hoc analyses indicated that the beneficial effects of mitoxantrone treatment on EDSS, SNS and AI scores were sustained for at least 12 months after cessation of treatment, with mean changes from baseline at 36 months in EDSS, AI and SNS scores of 0.10, 0.61 and 0.19, respectively, in the mitoxantrone group versus 0.46, 1.13 and 3.38 with placebo. Preliminary data from a cost-minimisation analysis based on results from the MIMS trial indicated that approximately half of the cost of mitoxantrone was offset by cost savings in other areas associated with the treatment of MS (direct and indirect major costs), with a total annual incremental cost for mitoxantrone of dollar 1661 per patient. Combination therapy once-monthly with intravenous mitoxantrone 20mg plus intravenous methylprednisolone 1g was more effective than intravenous methylprednisolone 1g once every month in preventing the development of gadolinium-enhanced lesions in patients with very active RRMS or SPMS (double-blind assessment using MRI scans). After 6 months, significantly more combination therapy recipients had no new gadolinium-enhanced lesions (90.5% vs 31.3% with monotherapy; p < 0.001) [primary endpoint]. There were also significant reductions in both the mean number of new enhancing lesions and the total number of gadolinium-enhanced lesions in patients receiving combination therapy versus methylprednisolone monotherapy.Tolerability. Mitoxantrone was generally well tolerated in patients with MS. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurring significantly more frequently with mitoxantrone (12 mg/m(2) once every 3 months for 2 years) than placebo were nausea, alopecia, menstrual disorders, urinary tract infection, amenorrhoea, leucopenia and elevated gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase levels. Adverse events were usually mild to moderate in severity and generally resolved with discontinuation of treatment or when treated with appropriate pharmacotherapy. Eight percent of patients discontinued treatment in the mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) group due to an adverse event versus 3% of placebo recipients. The incidence of drug-related acute myelogenous leukaemia was very low (0.12%) in a cohort of 802 patients with MS receiving mitoxantrone. Evidence suggests that the risk of cardiotoxicity is low in patients with MS. After 1 year of monotherapy, 3.4% of mitoxantrone recipients had a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to < or =50% compared with 0% of placebo recipients; at the end of the second year, respective incidences were 1.9% and 2.9% (total cumulative dose of mitoxantrone per patient was 96 mg/m(2) after 2 years' treatment).

Microarrays provide a powerful tool for studying these complex phenomena. Verification of differentially expressed genes and correlation with biological function, which is usually done by northern blot analysis, RNase protection assay or RT-PCR, is the bottleneck in all these protocols. We developed a new type of cDNA array for high-throughput expression profiling of multiple tissues and blood samples (i) for confirmation analysis of statistically significant number of clinical samples (ii) from limited amount of starting material, and (iii) with detailed clinical data from each individual. In contrast to traditional cDNA arrays, these arrays are spotted with a complex cDNA representing the entire mRNA message expressed in a given tissue or blood sample. cDNAs for these arrays were generated using SMART technology and accurately represent the original mRNA population, producing specific and quantitative signals during hybridization. cDNAs on Disease Profiling Arrays were derived from total RNAs of diseased and normal tissues or different blood fractions of patients. These cDNAs were spotted onto nylon membranes along with positive and negative controls. The arrays were then hybridized with gene-specific probes. Hybridization results revealed disease-related as well as patient-specific gene expression patterns between different disease types for these genes. These studies demonstrate that Disease Profiling Arrays are suitable for high-throughput studies comparing the relative abundance of a target gene, for simultaneously detecting differentially expressed genes in a wide variety of tissues and blood samples, and can be used down-stream from cDNA microarrays for confirmation analysis.",,"['Zhumabayeva, B', 'Chenchik, A', 'Siebert, P D', 'Herrler, M']","['Zhumabayeva B', 'Chenchik A', 'Siebert PD', 'Herrler M']","['BD Biosciences-Clontech, 1020 East Meadow Circle, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA. bdzhumabayeva@clontech.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol,Advances in biochemical engineering/biotechnology,8307733,,IM,"['Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/instrumentation/*methods/trends', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genetic Testing/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/instrumentation/*methods/trends', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/instrumentation/*methods/trends']",37,2004/04/20 05:00,2004/05/22 05:00,['2004/04/20 05:00'],"['2004/04/20 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/22 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/20 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/b12443 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol. 2004;86:191-213. doi: 10.1007/b12443.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hundred ninety of 1,001 patients (39%) had no elevation of Ab among multiple evaluations-that is, were Ab-negative (<1.1 over negative control)-and 611 patients (61%) had an elevated Ab titer (>1.1). Among these 611 patients, 447 had no measurable asparaginase activity during therapy. Patients who were Ab-positive but had no clinical allergies continued to receive E. coli asparaginase, the activity of which declined precipitately. No detectable asparaginase activity was found in 81 of 88 Ab-positive patients shortly after asparaginase injections (94% neutralizing Ab). The Ab-positive patients with clinical allergies subsequently were given Erwinase and achieved substantial activity (0.1-0.4 IU/ml). An interim analysis of 280 patients who were followed for 30 months from induction demonstrated that the Ab-positive titers during interim maintenance-1 and in delayed intensification-1 were associated with an increased rate of events.

Human and mouse ovastacins exhibit the same domain organization as other astacins, including signal sequence, propeptide, and metalloproteinase domain. However, ovastacins show an additional C-terminal domain of about 150 amino acids with no similarity to other ancillary domains present in the equivalent region of most astacins. Northern blot analysis of human tissues and cell lines revealed that ovastacin is only detected at significant levels in leukemia and lymphoma cells of different origin. In addition, RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that ovastacin is expressed in human and mouse ovary, in unfertilized mouse oocytes, and in 1.5-day-postcoitum preimplantation embryos. Further studies showed that superovulation caused a dramatic increase in the expression of mouse ovastacin, indicating that the production of this enzyme is under hormonal regulation. Human ovastacin was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant protein hydrolyzed synthetic substrates used for assaying metalloproteinases. These activities were abolished by inhibitors of metalloproteinases, but not by inhibitors of other classes of proteases.

However, the role of SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions in the control of human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cell trafficking and disease progression is poorly understood. In this study, we report that although some AML cells do not express surface CXCR4, all AML cells tested express internal CXCR4 and SDF-1. Culture of AML cells with SDF-1 promoted their survival, whereas addition of neutralizing CXCR4 antibodies, SDF-1 antibodies, or AMD3100 significantly decreased it. Pretreatment of primary human AML cells with neutralizing CXCR4 antibodies blocked their homing into the BM and spleen of transplanted NOD/SCID/B2m(null) mice. Furthermore, weekly administrations of antihuman CXCR4 to mice previously engrafted with primary AML cells led to a dramatic decrease in the levels of human AML cells in the BM, blood, and spleen in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, the same treatment did not affect significantly the levels of normal human progenitors engrafted into NOD/SCID mice.

The recent development of microarray technologies has enabled biologists to quantify gene expression of tens of thousands of genes in a single experiment. Biologists have begun collecting gene expression for a large number of samples. One of the urgent issues in the use of microarray data is to develop methods for characterizing samples based on their gene expression. The most basic step in the research direction is binary sample classification, which has been studied extensively over the past few years. This paper investigates the next step-multiclass classification of samples based on gene expression. The characteristics of expression data (e.g. large number of genes with small sample size) makes the classification problem more challenging. The process of building multiclass classifiers is divided into two components: (i) selection of the features (i.e. genes) to be used for training and testing and (ii) selection of the classification method. This paper compares various feature selection methods as well as various state-of-the-art classification methods on various multiclass gene expression datasets. Our study indicates that multiclass classification problem is much more difficult than the binary one for the gene expression datasets. The difficulty lies in the fact that the data are of high dimensionality and that the sample size is small. The classification accuracy appears to degrade very rapidly as the number of classes increases. In particular, the accuracy was very low regardless of the choices of the methods for large-class datasets (e.g. NCI60 and GCM). While increasing the number of samples is a plausible solution to the problem of accuracy degradation, it is important to develop algorithms that are able to analyze effectively multiple-class expression data for these special datasets.",,"['Li, Tao', 'Zhang, Chengliang', 'Ogihara, Mitsunori']","['Li T', 'Zhang C', 'Ogihara M']","['Computer Science Department, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627-0226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",,2004/04/17 05:00,2005/02/11 09:00,['2004/04/17 05:00'],"['2004/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/02/11 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/bioinformatics/bth267 [doi]', 'bth267 [pii]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2004 Oct 12;20(15):2429-37. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bth267.

In ALL, the cell surface over expression of 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans (9-OAcSGs) on lymphoblasts and concomitant high antibody titers in patients' sera was reported. OBJECTIVES: The present study was aimed to evaluate whether anti-9-OAcSG titers can be harnessed to monitor the clinical outcome of ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Anti-9-OAcSGs were analyzed by ELISA in children receiving either UK ALL X (n = 69, Group I) in India or UK ALL 97 (n = 47, Group II) in UK along with age-matched normal healthy controls at different time points over a period of >2 years. An attempt was also made to investigate subclass distribution of disease-specific IgG. Moreover, 17 patients having a higher sample size were longitudinally monitored. RESULTS: Antibody levels were raised at disease presentation, decreased with remission induction, and importantly, reappeared with clinical relapse. Sera from patients with other hematological disorders and normal controls showed negligible levels of circulating anti-9-OAcSGs. In patients of both Groups I and II, the assay showed high sensitivity (98.92% and 96.77%) and specificity (92.1% and 95.91%), respectively. IgG subclass analyses during different phases of treatment revealed that 9-OAcSG-specific IgG(1) could serve as a better prognostic marker in ALL. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential of this disease-specific antibody as an alternate marker in diagnosis and long-term assessment of ALL patients, suggesting its application in detection and prediction of impending relapse. Therefore, the expression of anti-9-OAcSGs, irrespective of their treatment protocol, may serve as an economical yet effective index for monitoring of childhood ALL.",,"['Pal, Santanu', 'Bandyopadhyay, Suman', 'Chatterjee, Mitali', 'Bhattacharya, Dilip K', 'Minto, Lynne', 'Hall, Andrew G', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Pal S', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Chatterjee M', 'Bhattacharya DK', 'Minto L', 'Hall AG', 'Mandal C']","['Immunobiology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Jadavpur-700 032, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Autoantibodies/*blood/isolation & purification', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/economics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/economics', 'India/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Polysaccharides/blood/chemistry/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/blood/economics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sialic Acids/*chemistry', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2004/04/17 05:00,2004/12/31 09:00,['2004/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2003/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2004.01.001 [doi]', 'S0009912004000025 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 2004 May;37(5):395-403. doi: 10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2004.01.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to determine the expression of PBX and PREP-1 gene products in the mouse ovary and their localization to particular ovarian compartment, specifically the oocyte-containing ovarian follicle. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that PREP-1 was present in both granulosa cells and oocytes. PREP-1 was found in the nucleus in primary oocytes, but in the cytoplasm of fully-grown oocytes; in granulosa cells, however, PREP-1 was always localized to the nuclei. No PREP-1 immunoreactivity was found in corpus luteum, theca or stroma. PBX-1 was found in the cytosol of the oocyte, while PBX-2 expression was mostly restricted to the nuclei of granulosa cells. In addition, PBX-2 was also found in the nucleus of primary oocytes. Since PREP-PBX complexes act in vivo in conjunction with HOX transcription factors, we have used RT-PCR to identify HOX genes expressed in the ovary. This analysis identified transcripts for six HOX genes (A5, A9, B6, B7, C6 and C8) and two more TALE cofactors (PREP2 and Meis2). Thus, a number of HOX and HOX cofactor genes are expressed in the mammalian ovary. The restricted expression pattern for PBX-1 and PBX-2 and the changes in expression and localization of PREP-1 in the oocyte and granulosa cells suggest a previously unsuspected involvement of these transcription factors in oocyte maturation and development, as well as in granulosa cell differentiation.",,"['Villaescusa, J Carlos', 'Verrotti, Arturo C', 'Ferretti, Elisabetta', 'Farookhi, Riaz', 'Blasi, Francesco']","['Villaescusa JC', 'Verrotti AC', 'Ferretti E', 'Farookhi R', 'Blasi F']","['Department of Cell Biology and Functional Genomics, DIBIT, H.

Response rate of single agent for chemotherapy-naive patients ranged from 40%to 87% with 14-60% complete remission (CR) rate has been reported abroad while the response rate of 30%-70% and the CR rate of 10%-38% for pre- treated patients. Significantly higher response rate can be yielded by combined regimen such as FN, FMD, and FC, etc. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of fludarabine-based regimen for patients with lymphoma in China. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients with lymphoma were enrolled into this study from April 2001 to December 2003. There were 18 male and 11 female patients with median age of 53 years old (ranged from 27 to 79). Twenty-two patients were low-grade lymphoma and 7 were intermediate-grade lymphoma. Nineteen patients had been treated by FMD(Fludarabine 25 mg/m(2) d1-3,Mitoxantrone 8 mg/m(2) d1 and Dexamethasone 20 mg d1-4) while 3 by R-FMD (Rituximab+FMD) and 7 by other fludarabine- containing regimens. The median therapeutic cycles were 3 (1-6). RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were available for objective evaluation in 29 enrolled patients. The response rate and the CR rate for indolent group were 86% (18/21) and 38% (8/21). No response was obtained in 4 cases of intermediate grade lymphoma. Myelosuppression and mild GI toxicity were major side effects. The rates of leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were 61% (III+IV, 8%), 18% (III+IV, 4%), and 26%, respectively. G-CSF was necessary only in 5% of cycles without red cell or platelet transfusion. Mild nausea and vomiting account for 20%. Five cases of febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy were controlled by intravenous antibiotics and supportive care.

Arsenic trioxide exerts its action by accelerating cell apoptosis, while all-trans retinoic acid by inducing cell differentiation. However, both drugs can inhibit the transcription of tissue factor (TF) mRNA in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and decrease TF level and coagulative activity to normalize coagulopathy. The objective of the study was to observe whether combination of the two drugs could improve efficacy or in contrary accentuate adverse reactions. METHODS: Two groups of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were included. Twenty-two patients (17 untreated cases and 5 relapsed cases) from January 2000 to October 2001 in group I were treated only with oral retinoic acid [25 mg/(m(2)x d) in two divided doses] for less than 50 days. Nineteen cases (15 untreated cases and 4 relapsed cases) from November 2001 to June 2003) in Group II were treated with combination of arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid. 0.1% AS2O3 10 ml in 500 ml 5% glucose solution was given intravenously for 4 to 6 hours per day for 28 days. The dosage of retinoic acid in group II was the same as that in group I. RESULTS: Nineteen of 22 cases in retinoic acid-treated group (group I)(16 untreated cases and 3 relapsed cases) achieved complete remission (CR). The CR rate was 86.4%. Seventeen of 19 cases in combination therapy group (group II)(15 untreated cases and 2 relapsed cases) achieved CR. The CR rate was 89.5%. The death rates were 13.6% (3/22, 1 untreated case, 2 relapsed cases) in group I and 10.5% (2/19, 2 relapsed cases) in group II, respectively. The median time to CR was 23 days in group I and 26 days in group II, and the median time to normalization of coagulopathy was 7 days in group I and 4 days in group II. Significant differences were found between the two groups. No significant adverse reaction was observed in both groups. CONCLUSION: The CR rate and death rate were not different between the two groups.

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of HSCT on the patients with CML. METHODS: Forty-four patients with CML were treated by HSCT, including 8 cases treated with purging autologous transplantation, 30 cases with related donor allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), and 6 cases with unrelated donor allo-HSCT. The conditioning regimen was TBI (total-body irradiation)+CY (CTX) protocol in 31 patients and modified BuCY (hydroxyurea, busulfan, Ara-C, CTX) protocal in 12 patients, and MACC (Melphalan, Ara-C, CTX and CCNU) protocol in one patient. CsA (cyclosporine) and MTX were used in the patients with related donor allo-HSCT, and CsA and MTX added to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) were used in the patients with unrelated donor all-HSCT for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Otherwise, CsA was only used in the patients with accelerated phase(AP) and blast crisis(BC) for GVHD prophylaxis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis model was used to estimate the overall survival (OS) and the disease-free survival (DSF) at 5 years after transplantation. RESULTS: Eight patients with autologous transplantation, except one case died of transplantation-related-complication, obtained part or complete cytogenetic remission within 3 months after transplantation. One patient, who was BC and obtained complete remission (CR) in hematology before transplantation,obtained complete molecular remission for 81 months after autologous transplantation. All patients obtained CR, except one patient died of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and one case did not obtained CR, in 36 patients with allo-HSCT after transplantation. The incidence of infection and VOD during transplantation were 38.6% and 9.1%, respectively. The incidences of hemorrhagic cystitis (HC) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia after transplantation were 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. VOD, HC, and CMV pneumonia did not occur in the patients with autologous transplantation. The incidence of acute GVHD in the patients with related and unrelated donor transplantation were 40.0% and 33.3%, respectively. The incidence of chronic GVHD was 43.4% in the patients with related donor transplantation. The rates of transplant-related mortality (TRM) in the patients with autologous and allogeneic transplantation were 12.5% and 16.7%, respectively. The rates of relapse in patients with autologous and related donor transplantation were 37.5% and 13.3%, respectively. The DFSs at 5 years in patients with autologous and related donor transplantation after transplantation were 18.7% and 53.7%, respectively. The DFS at 5 years in patients with CP (chronic phase) or AP and BC before transplantation were 66.4% and 26.7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: all-HSCT shows higher clinical cure rate to CML patients with CP. CsA+MTX+MMF+ATG protocol is more effective for acute GVHD prophylaxis and can decrease the incidence and severity of acute GVHD in patients with unrelated donor transplantation. Autologous transplantation with bone marrow purged can prolong the survival time and a few patients may be cured with autologous transplantation in CML.",,"['Liu, Qi-Fa', 'Sun, Jing', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Liu, Xiao-Li', 'Xu, Dan', 'Xu, Bing', 'Feng, Ru', 'Meng, Fan-Yi', 'Zhou, Shu-Yun']","['Liu QF', 'Sun J', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu XL', 'Xu D', 'Xu B', 'Feng R', 'Meng FY', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, First Military Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, PR China. liuqifa@fimmun.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",,2004/04/17 05:00,2004/08/20 05:00,['2004/04/17 05:00'],"['2004/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2004040426 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2004 Apr;23(4):426-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though STI571 can inhibit specifically the PTK activity of P210(Bcr-Abl) and greatly improve the clinic curative effect on CML in chronic phase, its effect on CML in accelerated phase and blast crisis is not clear. In this article, we attempted to analyze the clinic efficacy and side effect of STI571 treatment on CML patients in different phase. In addition, we analyzed the potential mechanism of STI571 resistance in accelerated/blast crisis CML with genetic methods. METHODS: A total of 22 cases of CML, 14 cases male and 8 female, 6 cases in chronic phase and 16 cases in accelerated/blast crisis phase, were treated with STI571. According to the efficacy standard, the hematological and cytogenetic response of 22 cases CML were analyzed, by determining the positive rate of Ph chromosome in bone marrow from the patients treated with STI571 for 3 months. Furthermore, the karyotype evolution of those patients showing STI571 resistance was analyzed. At the same time, the side effects and adverse events of STI571 treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: 6/6(100%) cases of CML patients in chronic phase acquired hematological CR and cytogenetic response. 4/16(25%) cases in accelerated phase or blast crisis acquired hematological CR and 8/16(50%) cases acquired cytogenetic response. 3 CML patients in blast crisis showed secondary STI571 resistance. The karyotype analysis shows 2 with 2 Ph chromosome and other additional abnormality. I/II grade non-hematological toxicity was observed in all the patients, including edema (77.3%), side effects of digestive system (36.4%) and myalgia (22.7%) et al. Severe hematological toxicities includes:(1)III/IV grade neutropenia (9 cases):1/6 cases of CML patients in chronic phase, 8/16 cases in accelerated phase or blast crisis; (2)III/IV grade thrombocytopenia (6 cases): 6/16 cases in accelerated phase or blast crisis. The percentage of III/IV grade neutropenia/thrombocytopenia in chronic phase and accelerated/blast crisis phase was compared and no significant statistical difference was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hematological and cytogenetic responses of different degrees can be acquired in CML-CP and CML-AP/BC patients treated with STI571 and showing statistic difference. STI571 improves the clinic curative effect greatly on CML in chronic phase. CML patients in blast crisis have secondary STI571 resistance with novel 2 Ph chromosome and other additional abnormality, it furnishes the evidence of the gene changes. The slightness of non-hematological toxicity of STI571 in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia suggests this drug is relatively safe.

Recently, it has been suggested that angiogenesis plays a certain role in the development of hematopoietic malignancies, including leukemia and multiple myeloma. We evaluated tumor angiogenesis in the bone marrow (BM) of multiple myeloma (MM) patients by calculating microvessel density (MVD) in needle-biopsy specimens obtained from 51 cases of untreated MM or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The MVD in the BM of donors for transplantation and patients with non-hematological diseases was calculated as a control. There was an obvious increase in MVD in the BM of MM patients, and the MVD correlated with the grade of myeloma cell invasion of the BM in the untreated MM cases. It was recently reported that thalidomide might be effective for the treatment of MM. We assessed the effect of thalidomide on angiogenesis in BM treatment of 11 patients with refractory MM. The concentration of M-protein in the serum or urine of seven of the 11 patients was reduced by at least 30% after thalidomide treatment, and MVD in the BM decreased in three of these seven cases in response to thalidomide. Increased plasma concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed in all 11 cases before thalidomide administration and both levels were reduced after treatment with thalidomide. Augmented angiogenesis in the bone marrow of MM patients was confirmed in the present study.

Recently, we have analyzed global gene expression during human nephrogenesis and observed up-regulation of stem cell leukemia (SCL), a transcription factor critical for hematopoietic and endothelial lineage specification. Here we characterize the expression of SCL along with its distinct 3' hematopoietic and endothelial enhancer (SCL 3'En) during kidney development. METHODS: mRNA and protein expression of SCL were examined in developing murine and human kidneys by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. The activity of SCL 3'En was examined by X-galactosidase (X-gal) staining of embryonic kidneys obtained from SCL +6E5/lacZ/3'En transgenic mice and by reporter lacZ assay in various renal cell lines. RESULTS: We found developmental regulation of SCL mRNA with highest levels of expression in embryonic day 17 (E17) mouse kidneys and lowest in postnatal and adult kidneys. Immunostaining of human fetal kidneys demonstrated the protein predominantly in the nephrogenic cortex and particularly in mesenchymal cells and developing glomeruli. Similarly, SCL +6E5/lacZ/3'En transgenic kidneys showed prominent lacZ staining in cells resembling undifferentiated mesoderm cells in close proximity to S and comma-shaped primitive nephrons and in peritubular and glomerular vessel endothelium. The SCL 3'En was activated in the human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293), but not in cell lines derived from adult kidney. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest a possible role for SCL in renal vasculogenesis.

In both Mono-Mac-6 and RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cells, TGF-beta abrogated lipopolysaccharide-induced increases in the enzymic activity and mRNA level of MMP-9. A fragment of the human MMP-9 promoter was used to characterize its regulation by TGF-beta signalling. In RAW264.7 cells, TGF-beta or its downstream signalling protein, Smad3 (Sma- and Mad-related protein 3), inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated promoter activity. The suppressive activity of TGF-beta on the MMP-9 promoter was abrogated by an inhibitory Smad, Smad7. The MMP-9 promoter contains a putative TIE (TGF-beta inhibitory element). However, neither mutation nor deletion of the TIE had any effect on the inhibitory activity of TGF-beta on MMP-9 transcription, indicating that the consensus TIE is not required for this effect of TGF-beta. Analysis using a series of deletion mutants of the MMP-9 promoter revealed that a region containing a consensus NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) site is required for the basal activity and TGF-beta-mediated suppression of the promoter. Mutation of the putative NF-kappaB site not only markedly reduced the basal transcriptional activity of the promoter, but also abrogated the responsiveness of the promoter to TGF-beta. In addition, a minimal promoter containing one copy of the NF-kappaB sequence was responsive to TGF-beta treatment. Furthermore, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed with the nuclear extracts from RAW264.7 cells, and it was found that TGF-beta treatment did not disrupt the binding of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 proteins to the NF-kappaB sequence. Taken together, these studies indicate that the NF-kappaB site is indispensable for the suppressive activity of TGF-beta in the regulation of MMP-9 transcription.",,"['Ogawa, Kenji', 'Chen, Feifei', 'Kuang, Chenzhong', 'Chen, Yan']","['Ogawa K', 'Chen F', 'Kuang C', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine and the Walther Cancer Institute, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/chemistry/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/chemistry/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism/*physiology']",,2004/04/17 05:00,2004/12/21 09:00,['2004/04/17 05:00'],"['2004/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2004/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20040058 [doi]', 'BJ20040058 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2004 Jul 15;381(Pt 2):413-22. doi: 10.1042/BJ20040058.,,,"['R01 DK055991/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK55991/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC1133847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective observational pharmacokinetic study. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (n = 33) with normal renal function previously treated with antineoplastic chemotherapy because of acute lymphocytic or acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia, and subsequently developing febrile neutropenia treated with empirical antimicrobial therapy. DESIGN: First, the standard dosage group (n = 11) was administered standard loading and maintenance doses of teicoplanin (400 mg every 12 hours for three doses followed by 400 mg once daily). Blood samples were collected at defined times as part of routine monitoring and assessed for teicoplanin plasma concentration by fluorescence polarisation immunoassay. Secondly, the high dosage group (n = 22) received a high loading regimen (800 + 400 mg 12 hours apart on day 1, 600 + 400mg 12 hours apart on day 2) followed by a high maintenance regimen (400 mg every 12 hours) from day 3 on. RESULTS: In the standard dosage group, no patient had the recommended teicoplanin C(min) of >or=10 mg/L within the first 72 hours, and only five of the 11 patients (45%) had a C(min) of >or=10 mg/L after 120 hours. No patient had a C(min) of >or=20 mg/L. In the high dosage group, teicoplanin C(min) averaged >or=10 mg/L within 24 hours, and this value was achieved within 48 hours in all but one patient. Of note, C(min) at 72 hours exceeded 20 mg/L in ten of the 22 patients (45%). No patient experienced significant impairment of renal function. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient group, therapeutically relevant C(min) may be achieved very early in the treatment period with loading doses of 12 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg 12 hours apart on day 1, and 9 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg 12 hours apart on day 2, regardless of renal function.

Precursor B-cell LBL is uncommon and may present with cutaneous or, less likely, bone lesions. This case represents the first reported presentation of LBL as a sacral lesion and was only the second fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of LBL presenting as a bony mass. CASE: A 50-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of a 7 x 5 x 4-cm mass in the sacral region. The mass was radiologically described as an expansile one with lytic bone destruction. Diagnosis of a chordoma was radiologically favored. Computed tomography (CT)-guided FNAB, with flow cytometry and cytochemical staining, was used to make the diagnosis of precursor B-cell LBL.

Two age groups account for approximately 70% of TEs in childhood: infants and teenagers. There are several predisposing risk factors for newborns such as small vessels, high hematocrit, and a unique neonatal hemostatic system. Central venous lines contribute to 80% of deep vein thrombosis in newborns. Other risk factors for all children are shock syndromes, trauma, surgery, heart and kidney disease, and acquired or hereditary thrombophilias. The best prophylaxis is to recognize, avoid, and remove risk factors if possible. This is particularly relevant in childhood, where risk factors can be found in the majority of TEs. The serious sequelae of TEs (mortality, and short- and long-term morbidity) require therapeutic intervention. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has the following disadvantages: age-dependent unpredictable pharmacokinetics, the need for intravenous access for therapy and monitoring, delays in achieving therapeutic ranges, bleeding risk, the risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and osteoporosis with long-term use. Oral anticoagulants, in addition to some of these disadvantages, show considerable variation by diet (especially if there is a change from breast to bottle feeding), medication, and intercurrent illness. Review of case reports and cohort studies on 728 children treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) indicate the following advantages over UFH: minimal monitoring, ease of administration (subcutaneous), and possibly equivalent efficacy and safety. Dose recommendations for pediatric patients cannot be directly extrapolated from those for adult patients. If dosages are calculated according to body weight, infants < 3 months (or < 5 kg) need approximately 50% more LMWH than older children or adults to reach prophylactic or therapeutic anti-factor Xa levels. Further studies are necessary to address the following: the importance of risk factors, the necessity of screening for hereditary thrombophilia, the efficacy and safety of treatment, and side effects and duration of treatment. Thromboembolic events (TEs) are considered to be rare in children. However, recent surveys reveal that TEs in children occur more often than suspected. The incidence is greatly underestimated because TEs are usually overlooked. Retrospective surveys in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia with corticosteroids and asparaginase revealed clinically symptomatic TE in only 2 to 12% of patients. However, in prospective studies with routine imaging, the incidence was more than 20%. The objectives of this article are to update the present knowledge on TEs in children, including incidence, predominant age groups, risk factors, diagnosis, and indications for prophylaxis and therapy; and to discuss the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in children.",,"['Sutor, Anton Heinz', 'Chan, Anthony K C', 'Massicotte, Patricia']","['Sutor AH', 'Chan AK', 'Massicotte P']","['Universitats-Kinderklinik Freiburg, Germany. sutor@kikli.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight)']",IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Pregnancy', 'Thromboembolism/complications/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",56,2004/04/16 05:00,2005/04/01 09:00,['2004/04/16 05:00'],"['2004/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2004-823001 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2004 Feb;30 Suppl 1:31-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2004-823001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chromosomal translocations involving the short arm of chromosome 2 (p15-p23) and the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 3 (q26-q27) are a rare but recurrent finding in patients with myeloid malignancies, and are assumed to be part of this spectrum of disorders.

Detection of the chimeric RNA fusions has proven difficult; only three studies have described successful amplification of the chimeric MOZ-CBP and CBP-MOZ fusions by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We analyzed four cases of AML M4/5 with t(8;16)(p11;p13) by RT-PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and characterized the reciprocal RNA fusions from three cases. We cloned both genomic translocation breakpoints from one case by long-range PCR and successfully applied RT-PCR to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) between clinical complete remission and relapse. In three cases, the genomic breakpoints occurred in MOZ intron 16 and CBP intron 2. In one case, no fusion transcript was detected.

We have now analyzed HOX expression in 50 independent adult AML patients (median age=62 years), together with FLT3 and FLT3-ligand mRNA levels, and FLT3 mutation determination. By cluster analysis, we could divide AMLs into cases with low, intermediate and high HOX expression. Cases with high expression were uniquely restricted to a subset of AMLs with intermediate cytogenetics (P=0.0174). This subset has significantly higher levels of FLT3 expression and appears to have an increase of FLT3 mutations (44%), while CEBPalpha mutations were infrequent (6%). FLT3 mRNA levels were correlated with the expression of multiple HOX genes, whereas FLT3 mutations were correlated with HOXB3. In some cases, FLT3 was expressed at levels equivalent to GAPDH in the absence of genomic amplification. We propose that high HOX expression may be characteristically associated with a distinct biologic subset of AML.

Here we present a preliminary observation in which FISH analysis disclosed in a small group of MDS/AML patients with normal karyotype the monoallelic deletion of the PI-PLCbeta1 gene. On the contrary, PI-PLC beta4, another gene coding for a signaling molecule, located on 20p12.3 at a distance as far as less than 1Mb from PI-PLCbeta1, is unaffected in MDS patients with the deletion of PI-PLC beta1 gene, hinting at an interstitial deletion.

TPO by itself dose-dependently induced the aggregation of platelets from patients with CML-CP but not from those with other MPDs or with CML-CP in cytogenetical complete remission. The expression of CD63 in CML-CP platelets was induced by TPO treatment. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) was constitutively activated in CML-CP platelets. Pretreatment with PI3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) dose-dependently inhibited TPO-induced aggregation of CML-CP platelets.

However, this combined approach provides correct therapeutic and prognostic information in only 50 percent of cases. METHODS: We determined the gene-expression profiles in samples of peripheral blood or bone marrow from 285 patients with AML using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips containing approximately 13,000 unique genes or expression-signature tags. Data analyses were carried out with Omniviz, significance analysis of microarrays, and prediction analysis of microarrays software. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the prognostic significance of cases of AML with specific molecular signatures. RESULTS: Unsupervised cluster analyses identified 16 groups of patients with AML on the basis of molecular signatures. We identified the genes that defined these clusters and determined the minimal numbers of genes needed to identify prognostically important clusters with a high degree of accuracy. The clustering was driven by the presence of chromosomal lesions (e.g., t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16)), particular genetic mutations (CEBPA), and abnormal oncogene expression (EVI1). We identified several novel clusters, some consisting of specimens with normal karyotypes. A unique cluster with a distinctive gene-expression signature included cases of AML with a poor treatment outcome.

However, the current classification system does not fully reflect the molecular heterogeneity of the disease, and treatment stratification is difficult, especially for patients with intermediate-risk AML with a normal karyotype. METHODS: We used complementary-DNA microarrays to determine the levels of gene expression in peripheral-blood samples or bone marrow samples from 116 adults with AML (including 45 with a normal karyotype). We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis to identify molecular subgroups with distinct gene-expression signatures. Using a training set of samples from 59 patients, we applied a novel supervised learning algorithm to devise a gene-expression-based clinical-outcome predictor, which we then tested using an independent validation group comprising the 57 remaining patients. RESULTS: Unsupervised analysis identified new molecular subtypes of AML, including two prognostically relevant subgroups in AML with a normal karyotype. Using the supervised learning algorithm, we constructed an optimal 133-gene clinical-outcome predictor, which accurately predicted overall survival among patients in the independent validation group (P=0.006), including the subgroup of patients with AML with a normal karyotype (P=0.046). In multivariate analysis, the gene-expression predictor was a strong independent prognostic factor (odds ratio, 8.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.6 to 29.3; P<0.001).

PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: A polymerase chain reaction- (PCR-)based strategy was used to evaluate the presence of residual tumor cells in a panel of 70 indolent lymphoma patients: 40 with follicular (FCL), 14 with small lymphocytic (SLL), and 16 with mantle-cell (MCL) lymphomas. They were treated either with first-line (n = 61) or second-line (n = 9) therapy with an intensified high-dose chemotherapy program followed by peripheral-blood progenitor cells autografting. The Bcl-1, Bcl-2, and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements were used as lymphoma-specific markers. Overall, a molecular marker was obtained from the diagnostic tissue in 60 of 70 patients (86%). Results The collection of PCR-negative cells and the achievement of posttransplantation molecular remission (MR) were common in patients with FCL subtype (54% and 70%, respectively), whereas they were not frequent among SLL and MCL (25% and 12.5%, respectively) patients. With a median molecular follow-up of 75 months, an 88% incidence of relapse was observed among patients never attaining MR. In contrast, relapse incidence was only 8% among patients attaining a durable MR (P <.005). At present, 26 patients (20 with FCL and six with non-FCL) are long-term survivors in absence of clinical and molecular disease. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that among indolent lymphomas, FCL and non-FCL subtypes show a significantly different behavior in terms of MR achievement, and MR after intensive chemotherapy and autografting is predictive for a prolonged disease-free survival, whereas persistent PCR positivity is associated with a high risk of relapse.",,"['Corradini, Paolo', 'Ladetto, Marco', 'Zallio, Francesco', 'Astolfi, Monica', 'Rizzo, Elena', 'Sametti, Selina', 'Cuttica, Alessandra', 'Rosato, Rosalba', 'Farina, Lucia', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Benedetti, Fabio', 'Pileri, Alessandro', 'Tarella, Corrado']","['Corradini P', 'Ladetto M', 'Zallio F', 'Astolfi M', 'Rizzo E', 'Sametti S', 'Cuttica A', 'Rosato R', 'Farina L', 'Boccadoro M', 'Benedetti F', 'Pileri A', 'Tarella C']","['U.O.

RESULTS: Of the 576 patients included in APL93 trial, 31 (5%) were children, including 22 girls (71%) and nine boys (29%). Thirty of the children (97%) obtained complete remission (CR). ATRA syndrome occurred in four children (13%), who all achieved CR, and headaches occurred in 12 children (39%), with signs of pseudotumor cerebri in five children (16%). Seven patients (23%) relapsed. None of the eight patients who received both ATRA and CT for maintenance relapsed. All relapsing patients achieved a second CR.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 15, 2000 and August 31, 2001, 27 patients with mesothelioma were enrolled in this study. Capecitabine was administered at 2500 mg/m(2) per day divided in two doses for 14 days followed by a seven-day break. Cycles were repeated every 21 days with restaging performed every two cycles and therapy continuing for up to six cycles. One patient withdrew from the study prior to receiving therapy and is removed from further analysis. Eligibility criteria included no prior treatment, PS 0-1 by CALGB criteria and histologically documented mesothelioma. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: gender; male 19 (73%), female seven; median age 70 (range 40-81); histology: epithelial 15 (58%), mixed eight (31%), unclassified three; site of origin pleura, 25 (96%); weight loss in previous six months of more than 10% in seven (27%), symptoms longer than six months in five (19%). RESULTS: One patient (4%) had a confirmed PR while 10 (38%) achieved SD for 2-6 cycles. Ten patients (38%) had PD as their best response. There were three patients unevaluable for response and two early deaths. Median survival and failure free survival were 4.9 (95% CI 4-10.8) and 2.4 (95% CI 1.5-4.2) months respectively with a one-year survival of 23% (95% CI 11-49%). Grade three or greater toxicities encountered by at least 10% of patients included lymphopenia (12%), fatigue (12%), dehydration (12%) and diarrhea (15%). Three patients (12%) had grade three skin toxicity or hand-foot syndrome. One patient died of treatment related toxicity during cycle one.

A 79-year-old patient with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and aortic valve replacement presented with acute left upper quadrant, chest pain and impaired vision (patient 2). INVESTIGATIONS: An abdominal ultrasound revealed nonhomogeneous hypoechoic splenic lesions in both patients, which were classified as extended splenic infarctions by echo enhancer studies. The diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography. Transesophageal echocardiography showed extensive mitral valve vegetations in patient 1. Patient 2 had a progression of the CLL without evidence of endocarditis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed infarction of the posterior cerebral artery area. DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT AND COURSE: Patient 1: Mitral valve endocarditis with embolic splenic infarction. Patient 2: Progressive CLL with thrombotic splenic and brain infarction. In patient 1, mitral valve replacement was performed. In patient 2, chemotherapy was initiated and she was started on low molecular weight heparin s. c. and aspirin.

Moreover, HOXA9 overexpression immortalizes murine marrow progenitors that are arrested at a promyelocytic stage of differentiation when cultured and causes leukemia in recipient mice following transplantation of HOXA9 expressing bone marrow. The molecular mechanisms underlying the physiologic functions and transforming properties of HOXA9 are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that HOXA9 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) and casein kinase II and that PKC mediates phosphorylation of purified HOXA9 on S204 as well as on T205, within a highly conserved consensus sequence, in the N-terminal region of the homeodomain. S204 in the endogenous HOXA9 protein was phosphorylated in PLB985 myeloid cells, as well as in HOXA9-immortalized murine marrow cells. This phosphorylation was enhanced by phorbol ester, a known inducer of PKC, and was inhibited by a specific PKC inhibitor. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of S204 decreased HOXA9 DNA binding affinity in vitro and the ability of the endogenous HOXA9 to form cooperative DNA binding complexes with PBX. PKC inhibition significantly reduced the phorbol-ester induced differentiation of the PLB985 hematopoietic cell line as well as HOXA9-immortalized murine bone marrow cells. These data suggest that phorbol ester-induced myeloid differentiation is in part due to PKC-mediated phosphorylation of HOXA9, which decreases the DNA binding of the homeoprotein.",,"['Vijapurkar, Ulka', 'Fischbach, Neal', 'Shen, Weifang', 'Brandts, Christian', 'Stokoe, David', 'Lawrence, H Jeffrey', 'Largman, Corey']","['Vijapurkar U', 'Fischbach N', 'Shen W', 'Brandts C', 'Stokoe D', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Largman C']","['Department of Medicine, University of California VA Medical Center, San Francisco, California 94121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Casein Kinase II', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Phorbol Esters/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism']",,2004/04/15 05:00,2004/06/21 10:00,['2004/04/15 05:00'],"['2004/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/21 10:00 [medline]', '2004/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.24.9.3827-3837.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 May;24(9):3827-37. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.9.3827-3837.2004.,,,"['R01 CA080029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM55814001A2/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA80029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC387750,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dose regimen currently used ignores the size of the tumor burden and the standardization of the dose is generally based on body surface area. In this study we have investigated the effect of cell density on the cytotoxic activity of daunorubicin (DNR) and cytosine arabinoside (AraC) towards HL60 cells and leukemic cells isolated from patients with AML. We demonstrate that drug cytotoxicity decreased with cell density and that apoptosis induction by DNR in isolated leukemic cells was greatly reduced at higher cell density. A marked reduction of the uptake of DNR and AraC in HL60 parental and mitoxantrone resistant cells was observed with increasing cell density. Such a drug depleting effect by cells at high density has been previously described for vincristine, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. By extrapolating the in vitro results to the in vivo situation, one could hypothesize that a high WBC can lower the plasma concentration through high uptake in the tumor burden, leading to a shortage of drug in leukemic blasts.

Recently, by use of the 5'-RNA ligation-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RLM-RACE) technique, we sequenced and cloned the entire open reading frame (ORF) of Pyst2-L. In the present study we determined the effect of exogenous overexpression on Erk1/2 phosphorylation. It was demonstrated that overexpression of this phosphatase in HEK293 cells reduced the basal levels of phospho-Erk1/2 as compared to the same cells transfected with the wild-type vector. This reduction was concomitant with a growth retardation of the Pyst2-L-transfected cells. Treating Pyst2-L transfected cells with known activators of the MAPK signaling cascade such as TPA or stimulating them by serum, it was demonstrated that the up regulation of phospho-Erk1/2, caused by these activators, was only partially suppressed by the over expression of the Pyst2-L phosphatase in these cells. These results together with our previous ones showing that the TPA-induced up regulation of Pyst2-L mRNA was only partially inhibited by the use of a specific Mek1/2 inhibitor, lead us to ask whether the Pyst2-L phosphatase has a monogamous relationship with the Erk2 protein. To answer this question, we employed the pull-down method and showed that in addition to phospho-Erk1/2, recombinant Pyst2-L binds the phospho-JNK protein.

The group was divided into standard risk group (treated with BFM protocol, n = 20) and high risk group (New York protocol, n = 10). We measured: episodes of infection, leukocytosis, immunoglobulin concentrations (G, M, A and E), lymphocytes and their subpopulations (CD19+, CD3+, CD3 + HLA-DR+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4 + CD45RA+, CD4 + CD45RO+, CD8 + CD45RA+, CD8 + CD45RO+, CD16 + CD56+). RESULTS: Immunoglobulin concentrations at the time of diagnosis were normal, and decreased after remission induction only reduction of IgG concentration was statistically significant (p = 0.008). At the time of diagnosis we noted the following differences in examined group compared to control group: higher leukocytosis (p = 0.03), lower lymphocyte count (p = 0.0008), significantly lower lymphocyte subpopulation count (for subpopulations CD19+; CD3+; CD4+; CD8+ and CD16 + 56+). After remission induction comparing to the time of diagnosis we observed: total leukocytosis reduction (p = 0.01), percentage and count CD19+ lymphocytes reduction (adequately p = 0.000007, p = 0.03), increase of lymphocyte CD3+ percentage (p = 0.002) and CD8+ lymphocyte percentage (p = 0.00003).

This paper demonstrates that a new cationic reagent, poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lysine) block copolymer (PEG-PLL), improves gene transduction with retroviral vectors without increasing cell toxicity. METHODS: A retroviral vector derived from the Moloney leukemia virus, containing the lacZ gene, was modified with PEG-PLL prior to transduction into NIH3T3, Lewis lung carcinoma, and primary cultured mouse brain cells. LacZ transduction efficacy was evaluated by counting the number of X-Gal-positive cells. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that PEG-PLL is able to stably modify the viral particle surface due to the affinity of the PEG moiety to the biomembrane, and neutralizes negative charges by the cationic nature of the poly-lysine residue. Thus, PEG-PLL increased the gene transduction efficiency and minimized cell toxicity because free PEG-PLL was removable by centrifugation. We have shown that PEG-PLL increased the viral gene transduction efficiency 3- to 7-fold with NIH3T3 or Lewis lung carcinoma cell lines without increasing cytotoxicity. It improved retroviral gene transduction efficacy even against labile cells, such as primary cultured brain cells. CONCLUSIONS: PEG-PLL is a novel reagent that improves retroviral gene transduction efficacy without increasing cytotoxicity.","['Copyright 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Katakura, Hiromichi', 'Harada, Atsushi', 'Kataoka, Kazunori', 'Furusho, Miki', 'Tanaka, Fumihiro', 'Wada, Hiromi', 'Ikenaka, Kazuhiro']","['Katakura H', 'Harada A', 'Kataoka K', 'Furusho M', 'Tanaka F', 'Wada H', 'Ikenaka K']","['National Institute for Physiological Sciences, Okazaki National Research Institutes, Okazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (poly(ethylene glycol) lysine copolymer)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Lewis Lung/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation', 'Genetic Vectors/*chemistry', 'Lysine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Surface Properties', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/04/14 05:00,2004/12/21 09:00,['2004/04/14 05:00'],"['2004/04/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.519 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2004 Apr;6(4):471-7. doi: 10.1002/jgm.519.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The cytogenetic profiles, clinical manifestations, laboratory data, and transformation in course of disease were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Of 29 MDS patients with del(20q), eleven (37.9%) had normal karyotype in addition to del(20q) aberration. Among them, nine patients were categorized into refractory anemia(RA)/RA with ringed sideroblasts(RAS) group and two into RA with excess Hasts(RAEB)/RAEB in transformation(RAEB-T) group. The breakpoint in 20q11 was commonly seen in patients with RA/RAS(63.2%), while del(20q12) was predominant in patients with RAEB/RAEB-T(accounting for 70% in all RAEB/RAEB-T patients). It was observed that RAEB/RAEB-T patients had higher frequencies of extra chromosomal aberrations(50%) and complex karyotype(30%) than did the RA/RAS patients (26.3%, 5.3% respectively); (2) Almost all patients revealed prominent pancytopenia, dyserythropoiesis and dysgranulopoiesis and 58.6% patients showed dysmegakaryopoiesis; positive periodic acid schiff staining of nucleated erythrocytes or reduction of neutrophils were found in 62.5% of patients; 81.8% of patients expressed lymphoid antigens; (3) Two cases transformed to acute myeloid leukemia.

Despite better appreciation of the molecular foundations and phenotypic characteristics of these cancers, improvements to disease classification and prognosis, and the discovery of more effective cytotoxic and biological agents, these disorders remain largely incurable. The development of a new class of cytotoxic agents in the 1980 s, namely the purine analogs, heralded a period of renewed optimism in the treatment of indolent lymphoid leukemias and lymphomas. More recently, monoclonal antibodies that selectively target cell-surface proteins, and agents that target cell-cycle or apoptotic pathways, have been developed and their use alone or in combination promise to have a major impact on the treatment of these conditions. Of these, the anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab and the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab have demonstrated the most potential for the treatment of CLL. Further, because of their different mode of action in comparison to conventional cytotoxic agents, combination regimens involving fludarabine and these antibodies are showing particular promise in early trials. The encouraging findings with these combination therapies are moving the intent of therapy from palliation towards cure. This paper reviews the therapeutic application of present and future fludarabine-containing approaches. The strategies that are discussed include fludarabine given with alemtuzumab, rituximab, or other monoclonal antibodies, and the potential benefits of combining fludarabine with more experimental agents such as antisense oligonucleotides, immunotoxins, or radioimmunoconjugates. The successful application of fludarabine plus alemtuzumab, or fludarabine in combination with other cytotoxic agents, as preparative regimens for stem cell transplantation techniques is also covered.",,"['Hillmen, Peter']",['Hillmen P'],"['Haematology Malignancy Diagnostic Service (HMDS), Algernon Firth Building, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds, UK.

For many years, alloSCT was based on the concept that a myeloablative dose of chemoradiotherapy was necessary to allow successful donor stem cell engraftment. These high-dose regimens cause considerable toxicity in graft recipients and even the most intensive conditioning regimens do not reliably eliminate all malignant cells. During the last decade, it became clear that the curative potential of alloSCT was not solely due to the conditioning regimen but also to an immune response of donor cells against the malignancy, termed the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. The increasing evidence that the GVL effect is essential for the eradication of host tumor cells has led to the development of a new concept in alloSCT: the use of reduced intensity, nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens that allow exploitation of the GVL effect without the toxicity of myeloablative therapy. The purine analog fludarabine is immunosuppressive and has activity against many hematological malignancies. The introduction of nonmyeloablative fludarabine-based conditioning regimens has facilitated alloSCT, while limiting regimen-related morbidity and mortality in patients with susceptible hematological malignancies. This potentially curative approach extends the use of alloSCT to older patients and to those with comorbidities that preclude high-dose chemoradiotherapy.

The disease is more common in elderly people, who also fare worse than younger patients with AML due to a higher rate of unfavorable prognostic factors, such as poor performance status, multiple comorbidities, reduced tolerance to treatment, 'unfavorable' chromosomal abnormalities and multidrug resistant protein-1 expression. While many patients achieve a complete remission, the rate of relapse is high and prognosis after relapse very poor. Promising results have been published in recent years using fludarabine-containing combination therapy for AML, most commonly fludarabine +cytarabine + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) [FLAG], FLAG + mitoxantrone (FLANG), or FLAG + idarubicin (FLAG-Ida). Such combinations maximize favorable cytotoxic interactions between cytarabine and G-CSF, and between cytarabine and fludarabine. In small studies, such combinations used as second-line therapy have resulted in complete response (CR) rates of 36-59%. Early retrospective analyses suggested higher CR rates in patients with refractory AML than in those with relapsed AML, but this observation has not been confirmed in recent prospective trials. Fludarabine-containing combinations have also been evaluated as first-line therapy in high-risk patients and resulted in CR rates of 34-70%, with median survival from 7 to 16 months. The current large MRC randomized high-risk study will provide further data on the use of fludarabine-containing regimens in patients with poor prognosis AML.

There is now considerable evidence that fludarabine is an effective agent in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in combination therapy for acute myeloid leukemia.

The combination of fludarabine with other chemotherapeutic agents such as cyclophosphamide or mitoxantrone also provides the clinician with additional useful treatment options in this setting. Objective response rates of 70-100% have been reported with fludarabine-containing combination regimens, often exceeding those reported with CVP.

This activity is frequently conjectured to derive from the ability of saframycins to covalently modify duplex DNA. We used a DNA-linked affinity purification technique to identify GAPDH as a protein target of DNA-small molecule adducts of several members of the saframycin class. Nuclear translocation of GAPDH occurs upon treatment of cancer cells with saframycins, and depletion of cellular GAPDH levels by small interfering RNA transfection confers drug resistance. Roeder and coworkers have recently suggested that GAPDH is a key transcriptional coactivator necessary for entry into S phase. Our data suggest that GAPDH is also capable of forming a ternary complex with saframycin-related compounds and DNA that induces a toxic response in cells. These studies implicate a previously unknown molecular mechanism of antiproliferative activity and, given that one member of the saframycin class has shown efficacy in cancer treatment, suggest that GAPDH may be a potential target for chemotherapeutic intervention.",,"['Xing, Chengguo', 'LaPorte, Jacob R', 'Barbay, Joseph K', 'Myers, Andrew G']","['Xing C', 'LaPorte JR', 'Barbay JK', 'Myers AG']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Harvard University, 12 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA 02128, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)', 'MJW34HDB0D (saframycin A)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southwestern', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA Primers', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",,2004/04/14 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/04/14 05:00'],"['2004/04/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0307476101 [doi]', '0307476101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 20;101(16):5862-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0307476101.

Bcl2, activated by chromosomal translocation in human follicular lymphoma, promotes oncogenesis by inhibiting apoptosis. Bim, a distant proapoptotic relative, is emerging as a major physiologic antagonist of Bcl2. Here, we show that loss of Bim is oncogenic. Bim protein levels were elevated in the apoptosis-prone B lymphoid cells of Emicro-Myc-transgenic mice, and Bim-mutant Emicro-Myc mice had increased numbers of IgM-bearing B cells. Emicro-Myc-expressing B lymphoid cells deficient in Bim were refractory to apoptosis induced in vitro by cytokine deprivation or antigen receptor cross-linking. Thus, Bim is induced by Myc in B cells and mediates apoptosis. Remarkably, inactivation of even a single allele of Bim accelerated Myc-induced development of tumors, particularly acute B cell leukemia. None of the primary tumors from Bim(+/-) Emicro-Myc mice displayed loss of the second allele of Bim. These findings indicate that Bim is a tumor suppressor, at least in B lymphocytes, and is haploinsufficient. Whereas the p19Arf/p53 pathway is frequently mutated in tumors arising in Bim(+/+) Emicro-Myc mice, it was unaffected in most Bim-deficient tumors, indicating that Bim reduction is an effective alternative to loss of p53 function.",,"['Egle, Alexander', 'Harris, Alan W', 'Bouillet, Philippe', 'Cory, Suzanne']","['Egle A', 'Harris AW', 'Bouillet P', 'Cory S']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Melbourne, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'DNA Primers', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,2004/04/14 05:00,2004/06/16 05:00,['2004/04/14 05:00'],"['2004/04/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/16 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0401471101 [doi]', '0401471101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Apr 20;101(16):6164-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0401471101.

Also, protease inhibitors inhibited the survival of freshly isolated MM cells from patients. In contrast, these protease inhibitors did not affect survival of normal B cells and colony formation of myeloid committed stem cells (CFU-GM) from healthy volunteers. In addition, we found that all of the protease inhibitors, except for indinavir, blocked interleukin-6 (IL-6)-stimulated phosphorylation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in U266 and RPMI8226 MM cells. Moreover, the protease inhibitors inhibited both the basal and IL-6-stimulated STAT 3/DNA binding activity in U266 cells as measured by an ELISA-based assay.

In the present study, we have examined a new HDAC inhibitor, suberic bishydroxamate (SBHA), for its effect on a panel of human melanoma cell lines. We report that it induces varying degrees of apoptosis in the melanoma lines but not in melanocytes and fibroblasts. Induction of apoptosis was caspase dependent and was associated with induction of changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, which could be inhibited by overexpression of Bcl-2. The changes in mitochondria were independent of caspase activation and were associated with changes in conformation of Bax. SBHA down-regulated several key antiapoptotic proteins including X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis and the Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1. In contrast, it induced up-regulation of the Bcl-2 family proapoptotic proteins, Bim, Bax, and Bak. In addition, SBHA induced relocation of the protein Bim to mitochondria and its association with Bcl-2. De novo protein synthesis was required for initiation of apoptosis in that the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, inhibited SBHA-induced conformational changes in Bax as well as changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability and activation of caspase-3. These results suggest that SBHA induces apoptosis by changing the balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins in melanoma cells.

To assess human exposure to STLVs in western Central Africa, we screened for STLV infection in primates hunted in the rain forests of Cameroon. Blood was obtained from 524 animals representing 18 different species. All the animals were wild caught between 1999 and 2002; 328 animals were sampled as bush meat and 196 were pets. Overall, 59 (11.2%) of the primates had antibodies cross-reacting with HTLV-1 and/or HTLV-2 antigens; HTLV-1 infection was confirmed in 37 animals, HTLV-2 infection was confirmed in 9, dual HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 infection was confirmed in 10, and results for 3 animals were indeterminate. Prevalences of infection were significantly lower in pets than in bush meat, 1.5 versus 17.0%, respectively. Discriminatory PCRs identified STLV-1, STLV-3, and STLV-1 and STLV-3 in HTLV-1-, HTLV-2-, and HTLV-1- and HTLV-2-cross-reactive samples, respectively. We identified for the first time STLV-1 sequences in mustached monkeys (Cercopithecus cephus), talapoins (Miopithecus ogouensis), and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and confirmed STLV-1 infection in mandrills, African green monkeys, agile mangabeys, and crested mona and greater spot-nosed monkeys. STLV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and env sequences revealed that the strains belonged to different PTLV-1 subtypes. A high prevalence of PTLV infection was observed among agile mangabeys (Cercocebus agilis); 89% of bush meat was infected with STLV.

FR901228, FK228, or depsipeptide, is an HDAC inhibitor effective in T-cell lymphomas. Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and remains incurable. We examined whether FR901228 is effective for treatment of ATL by assessing its ability to induce apoptosis of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary leukemic cells from ATL patients. FR901228 induced apoptosis of Tax-expressing and -unexpressing HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and selective apoptosis of primary ATL cells, especially those of patients with acute ATL. FR901228 also efficiently reduced the DNA binding of NF-kappaB and AP-1 in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and primary ATL cells and down-regulated the expression of Bcl-x(L) and cyclin D2, regulated by NF-kappaB. Although the viral protein Tax is an activator of NF-kappaB and AP-1, FR901228-induced apoptosis was not associated with reduced expression of Tax. In vivo use of FR901228 partly inhibited the growth of tumors of HTLV-1-infected T cells transplanted subcutaneously in SCID mice.

Susceptibility to SFFV-induced erythroleukemia is conferred by the Fv-2 gene, which encodes a short form of the receptor tyrosine kinase Stk/Ron (sf-Stk) only in susceptible strains of mice. We recently demonstrated that sf-Stk becomes activated by forming a strong interaction with SFFV gp55. To examine the biological consequences of activated sf-Stk on erythroid cell growth, we prepared retroviral vectors which express sf-Stk, either in conjunction with gp55 or alone in a constitutively activated mutant form, and tested them for their ability to induce Epo-independent erythroid colonies ex vivo and disease in mice. Our data indicate that both gp55-activated sf-Stk and the constitutively activated mutant of sf-Stk induce erythroid cells from Fv-2-susceptible and Fv-2-resistant (sf-Stk null) mice to form Epo-independent colonies. Mutational analysis of sf-Stk indicated that a functional kinase domain and 8 of its 12 tyrosine residues are required for the induction of Epo-independent colonies. Further studies demonstrated that coexpression of SFFV gp55 with sf-Stk significantly extends the half-life of the kinase. When injected into Fv-2-resistant mice, neither the gp55-activated sf-Stk nor the constitutively activated mutant caused erythroleukemia. Surprisingly, both Fv-2-susceptible and -resistant mice injected with the gp55-sf-Stk vector developed clinical signs not previously associated with SFFV-induced disease. We conclude that sf-Stk, activated by either point mutation or interaction with SFFV gp55, is sufficient to induce Epo-independent erythroid colonies from both Fv-2-susceptible and -resistant mice but is unable to cause erythroleukemia in Fv-2-resistant mice.",,"['Rulli, Karen', 'Yugawa, Takashi', 'Hanson, Charlotte', 'Thompson, Delores', 'Ruscetti, Sandra', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Rulli K', 'Yugawa T', 'Hanson C', 'Thompson D', 'Ruscetti S', 'Nishigaki K']","['Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (RON protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Erythroid Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/physiopathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Point Mutation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/physiopathology/virology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Tumor Virus Infections/physiopathology/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",,2004/04/14 05:00,2004/06/02 05:00,['2004/04/14 05:00'],"['2004/04/14 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/14 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.78.9.4573-4581.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2004 May;78(9):4573-81. doi: 10.1128/jvi.78.9.4573-4581.2004.,,,,,PMC387688,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can delay this apoptosis via increases in the cellular levels of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family with a rapid turnover rate. Here we have shown that inhibition of the proteasome (a) decreases the rate of Mcl-1 turnover within neutrophils and (b) significantly delays apoptosis. This led us to determine whether GM-CSF could enhance neutrophil survival by altering the rate of Mcl-1 turnover. Addition of GM-CSF to neutrophils enhanced Mcl-1 stability and delayed apoptosis by signaling pathways requiring PI3K/Akt and p44/42 Erk/Mek, because inhibitors of these pathways completely abrogated the GM-CSF-mediated effect on both Mcl-1 stability and apoptosis delay. Conversely, induction of Mcl-1 hyperphosphorylation by the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, significantly accelerated both Mcl-1 turnover and apoptosis. Neither the calpain inhibitor, carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal, nor the pan caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone, had any effect on Mcl-1 stability under these conditions.

Antiangiogenic effects of chemotherapeutics as well as of novel drugs such as farnesyltransferase inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec might contribute to their therapeutic potential. Thalidomide which has antiangiogenic effects and direct cytotoxic effects was found to be effective in multiple myeloma and is considered as an established treatment modality for patients with refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma. Thalidomide has a significant therapeutic effect in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by improving cytopenia and achieving independence of transfusion therapy in a subset of patients. Preliminary data indicate activity of specific VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors in multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Also, at 4 and 10 wk of age, bursal tissues were examined for avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced preneoplastic lesions with the methyl green-pyronine (MGP) stain. In Experiment 2, chickens harboring or lacking endogenous virus 21 (EV21) were inoculated with strain ADOL-Hcl of ALV-J at hatch.

SAMPLE POPULATION: Metatarsal bones obtained from 5 FeLV-infected cats and cultured with feline fibroblast cells. PROCEDURE: Metatarsal bones were treated with 100% ETO, a 98% solution of glycerol, or left untreated. Twenty-five flasks of feline fibroblast cells were assigned to 5 groups: negative control, positive control, ETO-treated bone, glycerol-treated bone, and untreated bone with 5 replicates/group for 4 passages. Media and cell samples were harvested from every flask at each passage to measure FeLV p27 antigen and the number of copies of provirus per 100 ng of DNA, respectively. RESULTS: All negative control and ETO-treated group replicates were negative for FeLV p27 antigen and provirus throughout the study. All positive control group replicates were positive for FeLV p27 antigen and provirus at passages 1 to 4. Untreated bone group replicates were positive for FeLV p27 antigen at passages 3 and 4 and provirus beginning at passage 2.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of FK506/MMF in preventing aGVHD and sparing the use of methotrexate and methylprednisolone in childhood and adolescent allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) recipients. Thirty-four childhood and adolescent patients (median age, 7 years; range, 0.5-21 years; 24 males and 10 females) undergoing 37 AlloSCTs for malignant (n = 22) and nonmalignant (n = 12) disorders received FK506 (0.03 mg/kg/d by continuous intravenous infusion) and MMF (15 mg/kg per dose orally or intravenously twice daily). Stem cell sources included 22 umbilical cord blood donors (21 unrelated and 1 related), 6 related bone marrow donors, and 9 related peripheral blood donors. Malignant diagnoses included 7 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 3 acute myeloid leukemias, 1 acute promyelocytic leukemia, 2 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 4 Hodgkin diseases, 3 chronic myeloid leukemias, and 2 neuroblastomas; nonmalignant diagnoses included 2 beta-thalassemias, 1 sickle cell disease, 4 aplastic anemias, 1 Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, 1 Hurler syndrome, 2 hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytoses, and 1 myelodysplastic syndrome. The probability of developing grade > or =II aGVHD was 45.4% +/- 9.7% (7 related bone marrow/related peripheral blood; 5 umbilical cord blood), and for chronic GVHD it was 38.1% +/- 19.7%. FK506/MMF was well tolerated. Three patients had grade III to IV neurotoxicity (disorientation and leukoencephalopathy); 4 patients developed grade III to IV nephrotoxicity (all received concomitant nephrotoxins). Patients who achieved target mycophenolic acid levels (1.0-3.5 microg/mL) before day +30 had a significantly reduced incidence of developing grade >/=II aGVHD (16.7% +/- 15.2% versus 100%; P <.02). These results suggest that FK506/MMF is well tolerated and may be a safe and effective methotrexate- and methylprednisolone-sparing alternative GVHD prophylaxis regimen after AlloSCT.

As we previously demonstrated a functional link between overexpression of HOXB7 and melanoma progression, we investigated the lack of PLZF as the possible cause of HOXB7 constitutive activation in these neoplastic cells. Accordingly, we found PLZF expression in melanocytes, but not in melanoma cells, a pattern inversely related to that of HOXB7. PLZF retroviral gene transduction was then performed in a panel of melanoma cell lines, and tumorigenicity was compared with that of empty vector-transduced control cell lines. Evaluation of in vitro migration, invasion and adhesion indicated that PLZF gene transduction induced a less malignant phenotype, as confirmed through in vivo studies performed in athymic nude mice. This reduced tumorigenicity was not coupled with HOXB7 repression. In order to find more about the molecular targets of PLZF, the gene expression profiles of PLZF- and empty vector-transduced A375 melanoma cells were analysed by Atlas Cancer macroarray. Among several genes modulated by PLZF enforced expression, of particular interest were integrin alphavbeta3, osteonectin/SPARC and matrix metalloprotease-9 that were downmodulated, and the tyrosinase-related protein-1 that was upregulated in all the analysed samples. This profile confirms the reduced tumorigenic phenotype with reversion to a more differentiated, melanocyte like, pattern, thus suggesting a suppressor role for PLZF in solid tumors. Moreover, these results indicate that PLZF and HOXB7 are functionally independent and that their coupled deregulation may account for most of the alterations described in melanomas.",,"['Felicetti, Federica', 'Bottero, Lisabianca', 'Felli, Nadia', 'Mattia, Gianfranco', 'Labbaye, Catherine', 'Alvino, Ester', 'Peschle, Cesare', 'Colombo, Mario P', 'Care, Alessandra']","['Felicetti F', 'Bottero L', 'Felli N', 'Mattia G', 'Labbaye C', 'Alvino E', 'Peschle C', 'Colombo MP', 'Care A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB7 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Integrin alphaVbeta3)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Osteonectin)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.14.18.- (TYRP1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.18.- (Tyrp1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.18.- (tyrosinase-related protein-1)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenicity Tests', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaVbeta3/genetics', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/genetics', 'Melanocytes/metabolism', 'Melanoma/genetics/*pathology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Osteonectin/genetics', '*Oxidoreductases', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2004/04/13 05:00,2004/07/10 05:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/10 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1207597 [doi]', '1207597 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2004 Jun 3;23(26):4567-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1207597.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MLL-EEN had oncogenic features, while, as a control, MLLDelta, the truncated form of MLL lacking the EEN moiety, did not show any oncogenic potential. MLL-EEN exerted a dominant-negative effect over wild-type EEN in terms of subcellular localization. Normally, EEN was found in the cytoplasm, but the MLL-EEN fusion protein was located in the nucleus, and EEN could be delocalized by MLL-EEN. This interaction is via a coiled-coil dimerization domain of EEN, which is reserved in the fusion protein. In addition, MLL-EEN might act as a potential transcriptional factor with the MLL part providing the DNA-binding domain and the EEN part providing the transcription activation domain, though EEN seems to have no direct role in transcriptional regulation.

The aim of this work was to improve our understanding of the FA syndrome defining the transcription profile of the FA complementation group C (FANCC)-deficient cells in comparison to their ectopically corrected counterpart using oligonucleotide microarrays. In this way, 49 RNAs have been isolated, which showed a consistent differential pattern of expression among FANCC mutated and corrected cells. The observed specific changes in gene expression suggest that FANCC regulates specifically myeloid differentiation and unmasks a previously unsuspected anti-inflammatory role for the FA proteins. In spite of the DNA damage hypersensitivity of the syndrome, no gene coding for a protein directly involved in DNA repair/damage response was found to be deregulated in our analysis. This observation suggests that FANCC does not directly control genes involved in DNA repair at the transcriptional level, but does not exclude a regulation at the translational or post-translational level, or by protein/protein interactions.

Among these, several are implicated in transcription repression or activation, like the transcriptional repressor Daxx or the transcriptional activator P53. Whether NBs constitute platforms where active sites of enzymatic modifications are carried out, as suggested for P53, sites of intranuclear protein sequestration, as proposed for Daxx or organelles specialized in catabolism, is still debated.

Two main groups were considered according to the CD34+ cells x 10(6)/kg b.w. collected, that is, poor mobilizers (PM), with a collection of <2 x 10(6)/kg and good mobilizers, with a collection of >2 x 10(6)/kg. Of 104 patients, 27 (25.9%) were PM; 20/27 had AML and 7/27 had ALL. At multivariate analysis, a lower CD34+ cells count premobilization chemotherapy (CD34 steady state), the presence of FUO (fever of unknown origin) or infection, and a lower number of CD34+ cells on the first day of collection correlated with poor mobilization. These results may enable early recognition of patients who may have poor mobilization, and aid selection of patients for different mobilization regimens.",['Copyright 2004 Nature Publishing Group'],"['Pastore, D', 'Specchia, G', 'Mestice, A', 'Liso, A', 'Pannunzio, A', 'Carluccio, P', 'Buquicchio, C', 'Greco, G', 'Ciuffreda, L', 'Pietrantuono, G', 'Liso, V']","['Pastore D', 'Specchia G', 'Mestice A', 'Liso A', 'Pannunzio A', 'Carluccio P', 'Buquicchio C', 'Greco G', 'Ciuffreda L', 'Pietrantuono G', 'Liso V']","['Hematology Section, Department DIMIMP, University of Bari, Italy. emadhba@cimedoc.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods/*standards', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis/standards', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Risk Factors']",,2004/04/13 05:00,2005/03/03 09:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2005/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1704437 [doi]', '1704437 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2004 Jun;33(11):1083-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1704437.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, understanding the mechanism by which p53 functions in the execution of cell death pathways is of considerable importance in cancer biology. Recent studies have indicated that p53 has a direct signalling role at mitochondria in the induction of apoptosis, although the mechanisms involved are not completely understood. Here we show that, after cell stress, p53 interacts with the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial membrane protein Bak. Interaction of p53 with Bak causes oligomerization of Bak and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Notably, we show that formation of the p53-Bak complex coincides with loss of an interaction between Bak and the anti-apoptotic Bcl2-family member Mcl1. These results are consistent with a model in which p53 and Mcl1 have opposing effects on mitochondrial apoptosis by interacting with, and modulating the activity of, the death effector Bak.",,"['Leu, J I-Ju', 'Dumont, Patrick', 'Hafey, Michael', 'Murphy, Maureen E', 'George, Donna L']","['Leu JI', 'Dumont P', 'Hafey M', 'Murphy ME', 'George DL']","['Department of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 422 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nat Cell Biol,Nature cell biology,100890575,"['0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein']",,2004/04/13 05:00,2004/06/24 05:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/ncb1123 [doi]', 'ncb1123 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Cell Biol. 2004 May;6(5):443-50. doi: 10.1038/ncb1123.

The goal of this study was to assess CN activity during the first 2 months after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) and to correlate its evolution with the occurrence of acute GVHD. METHODS: Thirty-one allogeneic SCT recipients were enrolled during a 21-month period. All received GVHD prophylaxis with CsA (2 mg/kg/day) and methotrexate (on days 1, 3, and 6). CN activity was measured before transplant, and then once weekly, for at least 2 months. RESULTS: Eighteen patients developed acute grade II or higher GVHD at a median time of 22.5 days and were treated with steroids. CN activity was significantly increased in these 18 patients when compared with 13 patients who did not develop GVHD. Analysis involving the receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that acute grade II or higher GVHD can be predicted with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 54% with the use of a cutoff value of 28 pmol RII/mg proteins/min of CN activity. CONCLUSIONS: CN activity appears to be a promising therapeutic test to predict acute GVHD after allogeneic SCT. This functional assessment of the in vivo efficacy of CsA opens new insights for CsA dose adjustment-in particular, the administration of its most efficient dose instead of its maximal tolerated dose, as is currently performed.",,"['Sanquer, S', 'Schwarzinger, M', 'Maury, S', 'Yakouben, K', 'Rafi, H', 'Pautas, C', 'Kuentz, M', 'Barouki, R', 'Cordonnier, C']","['Sanquer S', 'Schwarzinger M', 'Maury S', 'Yakouben K', 'Rafi H', 'Pautas C', 'Kuentz M', 'Barouki R', 'Cordonnier C']","['Service de Biochimie B, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Paris, France. sylvia.sanquer@hop.egp.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/*blood', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Calcineurin/*blood', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/blood/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2004/04/13 05:00,2004/05/07 05:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['00007890-200403270-00012 [pii]', '10.1097/01.tp.0000114612.55925.22 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2004 Mar 27;77(6):854-8. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000114612.55925.22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donors of lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells have been HLA-identical siblings, HLA-matched unrelated donors, and HLA-different haploidentical family members. A variety of cells have been used for adoptive immunotherapy, including plain lymphocytes, selected T cells, T cell lines, and T cell clones.

Additionally, the review discusses advances in the basic understanding of the mechanisms by which these three different therapies function against chronic myeloid leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Long-term follow-up has found that interferon-alpha was able to produce complete cytogenetic remission in15 to 25% of patients, with some of these patients achieving a molecular remission. Some patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic remission also achieve long-term disease-free survival and possibly cure. Imatinib has produced remarkable hematologic and cytogenetic responses in newly treated and in interferon-alpha-refractory patients, yet there are no long-term survival data at this point. Some laboratory findings imply that imatinib may primarily affect mature chronic myeloid leukemia progenitors and not chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells, leaving doubt that the improved rate of complete cytogenetic remissions will result in increased overall survival. Other clonal cytogenetic abnormalities have also been reported in the Philadelphia chromosome-negative cells present in complete cytogenetic remissions to imatinib. The use of donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) continues to treat relapsed chronic myeloid leukemia effectively after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation whereas the use of nonmyeloablative therapy has effectively reduced transplant-related mortality. SUMMARY: Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia now have several potential treatment options from which to choose. Imatinib mesylate currently provides excellent hematologic and cytogenetic response rates with minimal toxicity. However, long-term data of efficacy is lacking. Emerging evidence that imatinib rarely leads to molecular complete remission and that many patients are still at risk of relapse and other clonal disorders is concerning and suggest the possibility that imatinib's early high response rates may not translate into survival advantage. Interferon-alpha continues to be effective therapy for many patients and, along with blood or marrow transplantation, is proved to prolong survival. The impacts of both are in part limited because of their toxicity profiles. Ongoing laboratory investigations and clinical trials remain paramount to providing the best treatment approach for our patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.",,"['Angstreich, Greg R', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Angstreich GR', 'Smith BD', 'Jones RJ']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins, Bunting-Blaustein Cancer Research Building, 1650 Orleans Street, Room 207, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",32,2004/04/13 05:00,2004/09/01 05:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/01 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['00001622-200403000-00002 [pii]', '10.1097/00001622-200403000-00002 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2004 Mar;16(2):95-9. doi: 10.1097/00001622-200403000-00002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective study. PATIENTS: Records of eight patients who received unrelated umbilical cord blood transplants between 1999 and 2003 were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Engraftment of haematopoietic cells and graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 4.9 years (range, 1.0-9.4 years). Five patients had acute leukaemia, one had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one had X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and one had mucolipidosis.

Thus, the intrinsic and extrinsic caspase pathways are involved in controlling receptor ligation-mediated apoptosis induction in human eosinophils, findings that may aid the development of a more targeted, anti-inflammatory therapy for asthma.",,"['Al-Rabia, Mohammed W', 'Blaylock, Morgan G', 'Sexton, Darren W', 'Walsh, Garry M']","['Al-Rabia MW', 'Blaylock MG', 'Sexton DW', 'Walsh GM']","['Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,2004/04/13 05:00,2004/07/13 05:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/13 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1189/jlb.0803404 [doi]', 'jlb.0803404 [pii]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2004 Jun;75(6):1045-55. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0803404.

Although most cells accomplish this by activating telomerase, a subset of immortalized tumors and cell lines do so in a telomerase-independent manner, a process called alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). DNA recombination has been shown to be involved in ALT, but the precise mechanisms remain unknown. A fraction of cells in a given ALT population contain a unique nuclear structure called APB (ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia (PML) body), which is characterized by the presence of telomeric DNA in the PML body. Here we describe that hRad9, hHus1, and hRad1, which form a DNA clamp complex that is associated with DNA damage, as well as its clamp loader, hRad17, are constitutive components of APB. Phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX), a molecular marker of double-strand breaks (DSBs), also colocalizes with some APBs. The results suggest that telomeric DNAs at APBs are recognized as DSBs. PML staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of mitotic ALT cells revealed that telomeric DNAs present at APBs are of both extrachromosomal and native telomere origins. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DNA synthesis occurs at APBs and is significantly inhibited by caffeine, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases. Taken together, we suggest that telomeric DNAs at APBs are recognized and processed as DSBs, leading to telomeric DNA synthesis and thereby contributing to telomere maintenance in ALT cells.",,"['Nabetani, Akira', 'Yokoyama, Osamu', 'Ishikawa, Fuyuki']","['Nabetani A', 'Yokoyama O', 'Ishikawa F']","['Department of Gene Mechanisms, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kitashirakawa Oiwake-cho, Kyoto 606-8502.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HUS1B protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Rad17 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '139691-42-2 (rad9 protein)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.11.- (Rad1 protein, human)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Caffeine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exonucleases/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', '*Telomere', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2004/04/13 05:00,2004/07/02 05:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M312652200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)66497-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jun 11;279(24):25849-57. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M312652200.

The mechanisms of action of this therapy, referred to as extracorporeal phototherapy, have not been fully elucidated. PUVA is known to induce apoptosis in T lymphocytes collected by apheresis, however scarce information is available concerning the apoptotic pathways activated by PUVA. DESIGN AND METHODS: We used Jurkat human T leukemia cells and normal T lymphocytes to analyze the PUVA-triggered caspase activation pattern by means of immunoblot analysis, in vitro caspase activity assays, and selective caspase inhibitors coupled to flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: PUVA treatment induced activation of apical caspases-9 and -8, and of effector caspases-3 and -7 in Jurkat cells and human T lymphocytes. While activation of caspase-9 occurred as early as 1 h after PUVA treatment of Jurkat cells, procaspase-8 cleavage was delayed and was detected 6 h after the exposure. Also in normal T lymphocytes, cleavage of caspase-8 was subsequent to activation of caspase-9. PUVA-dependent proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8 was blocked by inhibitors selective for either caspase-9 or -3. Moreover, procaspase-8 was cleaved in vitro by activated caspase-3, which gave rise to proteolytic fragments equivalent to those generated in vivo. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Activation of caspase-8 in PUVA-treated Jurkat cells and normal T lymphocytes is secondary to up-regulation of caspase-9. Overall, our results identify caspase-9 as the critical upstream caspase initiating apoptosis by PUVA in Jurkat T-cells and human T lymphocytes.",,"['Martelli, Alberto M', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Billi, Anna Maria', 'Tassi, Cristina', 'Ricci, Francesca', 'Fala, Federica', 'Conte, Roberto']","['Martelli AM', 'Cappellini A', 'Tazzari PL', 'Billi AM', 'Tassi C', 'Ricci F', 'Fala F', 'Conte R']","[""Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell'Apparato Locomotore, Sezione di Anatomia, Cell Signaling Laboratory, Universita di Bologna, via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy. amartell@biocfarm.unibo.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U4VJ29L7BQ (Methoxsalen)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology/therapy', 'Methoxsalen/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Therapy/*methods']",,2004/04/13 05:00,2006/02/28 09:00,['2004/04/13 05:00'],"['2004/04/13 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/13 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2004 Apr;89(4):471-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that up to 50% of blood CD4+ T cells in B-CLL patients have a cytotoxicity-related CD28- CD57+ phenotype and high content of both granzyme B and perforin (PF). In this study we investigate the cytotoxic potential of these cells against autologous B-CLL cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were positively isolated from B-CLL patients and cultured under a range of conditions with autologous purified B-CLL cells and with bispecific [anti-CD3 x anti-CD19] antibodies. Apoptosis of labeled B-CLL cells was assessed using the change of mitochondrial membrane potential with the fluorescent dye DiOC6 and confirmed by annexin V binding. RESULTS: There was time- and dose-dependent killing of B-CLL cells by both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and this ranged from 6.6 - 68.0% for CD4+ cells and 6.4 - 57.8% for CD8+ cells. Almost complete inhibition by concanamycin A suggests that CD4+ T cells like CD8+ T cells induced apoptosis through a perforin-mediated pathway, but not via Fas/FasL (as indicated by lack of blocking with brefeldin A), tumor necrosis factor alpha or TRAIL.

The present study was aimed at investigating clinical features and treatment outcome of children with very late relapse, diagnosed and treated in Italy in the last 20 years. DESIGN AND METHODS: All children diagnosed in Italian centers with a first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia occurring >or= 60 months after attainment of first complete remission were included in this study. These relapses were diagnosed between 1982 and 1997. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients (58 males, 62.4%) had a first very late relapse occurring at a median time of 6.1 years (range 5.8 - 13.7 years) after the initial diagnosis. At a median follow-up time of 9.1 years after relapse, the overall 5-year survival (SE) and event-free-survival (SE) were 55.6% (5.2) and 39.5% (5.1), respectively. In multivariate analysis the site of relapse was the only significant predictor of duration of the second complete remission. Patients with isolated bone marrow relapse fared worse than those with combined or isolated extramedullary relapse [5-year event-free survival (SE) 24.5% (5.9), 51.3% (11.1) and 68.4% (10.7), respectively; (p=0.004)]. All 7 patients who underwent an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from a matched related donor are alive in second complete remission. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In this evaluation patients with a very late relapse isolated to the bone marrow had a poor outcome while re-treatment of extramedullary or combined relapse was associated with better cure rate.

HDAC inhibitors are a class of compounds able to regulate gene expression by modulating chromatin structure. There are two major classes of HDAC inhibitors: the hydroxamic acid derivatives such as trichostatin A (TSA) or SAHA, and the butyrates such as phenyl-butyrate. HDAC inhibitors interfere with differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis in tumor cells. Here, we investigated the activity of a new hydroxamic acid derivative, LAQ824, on lymphoblastic cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Four different pre-B lymphoblastic cell lines: Sup-B15 and TMD-5, both t(9;22) positive, SEM, t(4;11) positive, and NALM-6 cells were exposed to the hydroxamic acid derivatives, LAQ824 and TSA. Histone hyperacetylation, apoptosis, cell cycle and related pathways were assessed by flow cytometry and Western blotting. RESULTS: LAQ824 significantly inhibited the proliferation of leukemic lymphoblastic cell lines. The effect of LAQ824 was due to increased apoptosis accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) as well as by down-regulation of Bcl-2 and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Surprisingly, LAQ824-induced apoptosis was at least partially independent of caspase activation as indicated by the fact that LAQ824-induced apoptosis was inhibited only partially in both t(9;22) positive Sup-B15 and TMD-5 cells, whereas no inhibition was observed in t(4;11) positive SEM cells upon exposure to the polycaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Stratification was improved by combining cytogenetics and day 16 bone marrow blasts and by subdividing unfavorable cytogenetics. The new score identifying five prognostically different groups was developed in 321 patients (AMLCG 1992 trial) and subsequently validated in 680 patients (AMLCG 1999 trial). RESULTS: Subgroups defined were: 1) favorable cytogenetics (t(8;21), inv(16)); 2) intermediate cytogenetics (normal karyotype, other abnormalities not rated favorable or unfavorable) and day 16 blasts <10%; 3) intermediate cytogenetics and day 16 blasts >or=10%; 4) unfavorable cytogenetics (-5/5q-, -7/7q-, 3q21q26 aberrations, 11q23 aberrations, 12p-, 17p-) excluding complex aberrations; 5) complex aberrant karyotypes (>or=3 aberrations).

Several chromosomal mechanisms including complex and cryptic changes lead to these recombinations. Our objective was to analyze the molecular composition of chromosomes in complex karyotypes with specific MLL translocations. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed in two acute leukemias (AL), one acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M5a, and one treatment-related-AL (t-AL), to investigate the nature of complex changes accompanying the respective t(9;11)(p22;q23)-MLL/AF9 and t(11;16)(q23;p13.3)-MLL/CBP. RESULTS: In the case with the MLL/AF9 chimeric transcript, duplication of a der(1) originated from an additional unbalanced translocation between the der(9)t(9;11) and a chromosome 1. The 5'AF9/3'MLL chimeric gene was present on both der(1). In the second case, there was a t(11;16)(q23;p13.3) producing one der(11) and two der(16) which derived from both homologs. One der(16) was present in multiple copies all containing the 5'CBP/3'MLL fusion gene. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In both cases the 3' end of MLL was present in multiple copies.

Recent studies have focused on the endothelial cells, but other non-leukemic cells may also be involved. In the present study we investigated how osteoblasts affect native human AML blasts. DESIGN AND METHODS: AML cells were derived from a large group of consecutive patients. The AML blasts and osteoblastic sarcoma cell lines (Cal72, SJSA-1) were incubated together in different chambers separated by a semipermeable membrane. We investigated effects of co-culture on proliferation, apoptosis and cytokine release. RESULTS: The cross-talk between these two cell populations, achieved via release of soluble mediators, resulted in increased AML blast proliferation, including increased proliferation of clonogenic progenitors, but did not affect spontaneous in vitro apoptosis. Both interleukin (IL) 1-b and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were involved in this growth-enhancing cross-talk, and normal osteoblasts could also increase the AML blast proliferation. Furthermore, co-culture of AML blasts with osteoblastic sarcoma cells as well as normal osteoblasts increased the levels of the pro-angiogenic mediator IL8.

Idarubicin, a synthetic daunorubicin analogue, shows an improved spectrum activity and diminishes acute or chronic toxicity when compared with the other anthracyclines. This study has been carried out in our clinic in order to evaluate the efficiency of the acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia protocol which includes idarubicin. Thirty-eight patients admitted to our Department between 1992-1999 and diagnosed as acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) were included in the study. Their median age was 7 years 6 months (range, 8 months to 14 years). Induction therapy consisted of idarubicin plus cytosine arabinoside and etoposide. Consolidation therapy consisted of two courses, followed by maintenance therapy with thioguanine, cytosine arabinoside, vincristine and cyclophoshamide. The complete remission rate was found to be 71%. The overall survival estimate was found to be 40% for one year and 23% for three years. We established that the protocol with idarubicin reached a higher remission ratio when compared with the other protocols with anthracycline. However, the degree of the hematologic toxicity ratios related to the therapy increased the complication ratios, which affected the long-term life analyses directly.

The studies were carried out on the cultures of cells nonstimulated and stimulated with mitogene. A significant increase in IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations were found in all study groups during the course of B-CLL. The values of IL-1 beta R and IL-6R were increased in blood plasma at I and III stage of CLL and decreased in culture supernatants and broken lymphocytes before and after stimulation in comparison to control groups. In all cases studied parameters were higher after stimulation. In conclusion, significant increase of IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations during CLL may advocacy of higher synthesis and excretions of interleukins--stimulatores of cell proliferation by leukaemic lymphocytes. Increased IL-1 beta R and IL-6R concentrations in blood plasma during CLL, seems to be one of the mechanisms restricted access of IL-1 beta and IL-6 to their surface receptors. An increase of IL-1 beta and IL-6 concentrations and decrease of IL-1 beta R and IL-6R volues suggest survival of autoregulation mechanisms defended against autocrine excreted interleukins.

A small proportion of SMNs are soft tissue sarcomas (STS), whose prognosis is generally thought to be poor, though publications on such patients' treatment and outcome is limited. METHODS: The authors analyzed 25 patients who were registered for the Italian Cooperative Group protocols for pediatric STS from 1979 to 2000. The primary tumor was STS in five patients; Hodgkin disease in five patients; leukemia in four patients; retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, and Wilms tumor in two patients each; and other tumor types in five patients. SMNs occurred after a median of 8 years (range, 1.9-15.0 years) and included rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) in 4 patients, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in 4 patients, extraosseous Ewing family tumor (EFT) in 4 patients, leiomyosarcoma in 3 patients, fibrosarcoma in 2 patients, synovial sarcoma in 2 patients, and other tumor types in 6 patients. Treatment generally was administered according to the guidelines for primary STS. RESULTS: Seven non-RMS patients with STS underwent surgery alone, whereas 18 patients received chemotherapy and 8 patients received radiotherapy. Retreatment was feasible with acceptable toxicity. Fifteen patients were alive in complete remission of their SMN at the time of last follow-up. Responses to chemotherapy and survival were satisfactory for patients with tumors such as RMS and EFT. Complete tumor resection was correlated with a favorable prognosis in patients with other types of STS and in patients with postirradiation sarcoma. Two patients developed a third malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: Although prior treatment may hinder the management of these patients, pediatric STS second malignancies can be cured using the same strategies used for de novo pediatric sarcomas. Long-term follow-up is mandatory given the risks of further malignancies and more severe, treatment-related side effects.",['Copyright 2004 American Cancer Society.'],"['Bisogno, Gianni', 'Sotti, Guido', 'Nowicki, Yohann', 'Ferrari, Andrea', 'Garaventa, Alberto', 'Zanetti, Ilaria', 'Favre, Claudio', 'Schiavetti, Amalia', 'Tamaro, Paolo', 'Carli, Modesto']","['Bisogno G', 'Sotti G', 'Nowicki Y', 'Ferrari A', 'Garaventa A', 'Zanetti I', 'Favre C', 'Schiavetti A', 'Tamaro P', 'Carli M']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy. gianni.bisogno@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Prognosis', 'Sarcoma/drug therapy/etiology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/drug therapy/etiology/radiotherapy/*surgery', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2004/04/10 05:00,2004/05/05 05:00,['2004/04/10 05:00'],"['2004/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/05 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.20159 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2004 Apr 15;100(8):1758-65. doi: 10.1002/cncr.20159.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common p50-RelA (p65) dimer known ""specifically"" as NF-kappaB, is relatively abundant, controls the expression of numerous genes, and exists as an inactive cytoplasmic complex bound to inhibitory proteins of the NF-kappaB inhibitor (IkappaB) family. The inactive NF-kappaB-IkappaB complex is activated by a variety of stimuli, including proinflammatory cytokines, mitogens, growth factors, and stress-inducing agents. The release of NF-kappaB facilitates its translocation to the nucleus, where it promotes cell survival by initiating the transcription of genes encoding stress-response enzymes, cell-adhesion molecules, proinflammatory cytokines, and antiapoptotic proteins. Constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in the nucleus is observed in some hematologic disorders.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and two patients (age >15 years) with a diagnosis of acute leukemia during the period July 1992-June 1994 were enrolled. For each patient, 10 controls matched by age and gender were randomly drawn from the source population. Through the individual beneficiary code the information relevant to the drugs received within the National Health Service during the period January 1989-December 1992 was retrieved. The use of drugs was considered etiologically related to leukemia if the prescription occurred before the 12 months preceding the diagnosis. Exposure was categorized as 'any use' (at least one prescription during the etiologic period), 'high use' (duration of use greater than the median in the control group) and, for NSAIDs, 'very high use' (duration of use greater than 180 days). RESULTS: Among drugs suspected to cause leukemia, users of high doses of chloramphenicol presented an OR of 1.8 (95% CI: 0.6-5.3). Among other categories of drugs with an increase in the ORs, though not statistically significant, we found tricyclic antidepressants (OR=1.7; 0.8-3.4) and oral contraceptives (OR=1.8; 0.8-4.0). No excess risk was observed for users of calcium-channel blockers (OR=0.9; 0.5-1.7). Use of very high doses of NSAIDs appeared to decrease the occurrence of acute leukemia (OR=0.4; 0.1-1.5). CONCLUSION: Even with several limitations, this study provides an initial frame of reference for the potential causal role of drugs in acute leukemia.","['Copyright 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Traversa, G', 'Menniti-Ippolito, F', 'Da Cas, R', 'Mele, A', 'Pulsoni, A', 'Mandelli, F']","['Traversa G', 'Menniti-Ippolito F', 'Da Cas R', 'Mele A', 'Pulsoni A', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,9208369,,,,,2004/04/10 05:00,2004/04/10 05:01,['2004/04/10 05:00'],"['2004/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/10 05:01 [medline]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1557(199803/04)7:2<113::AID-PDS329>3.0.CO;2-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf. 1998 Mar;7(2):113-23. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1557(199803/04)7:2<113::AID-PDS329>3.0.CO;2-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases were negative for TIA-1 expression. Based on these findings, TIA-1 expression in neoplastic cells of low-grade B-cell lymphomas may be a good diagnostic marker for hairy cell leukemia.

The biological function of Frat remained elusive until its Xenopus homologue GBP was isolated as a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-binding protein and was shown to be an essential component of the maternal Wnt-signaling pathway. To date two Frat homologues have been described in the mouse, Frat1 and Frat3. The proteins encoded by these two genes are 84% identical. Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a third murine Frat homologue, Frat2, which is the mouse ortholog of human FRAT2. Frat1 and Frat2 are juxtaposed on chromosome 19 in a chromosomal organization conserved between man and mouse. We show that Frat1 and Frat2 are phosphorylated, which is the first evidence that these proteins are subject to posttranslational modification. Like Frat1, Frat2 is able to bind to GSK3beta. However, a side-by-side comparison of the murine Frat proteins for their capacity to induce signaling through beta-catenin/T-cell factor reveals that Frat2 is a less potent activator of the canonical Wnt pathway. Frat2 protein accumulates to higher levels upon transfection into 293T cells than either Frat1 or Frat3. Thus, whereas Frat1 may be a core component of canonical Wnt-signaling, Frat2 might very well be part of a divergent intracellular GSK3beta pathway.",,"['van Amerongen, Renee', 'van der Gulden, Hanneke', 'Bleeker, Fonnet', 'Jonkers, Jos', 'Berns, Anton']","['van Amerongen R', 'van der Gulden H', 'Bleeker F', 'Jonkers J', 'Berns A']","['Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Molecular Genetics and Centre of Biomedical Genetics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FRAT1 protein, human)', '0 (FRAT2 protein, human)', '0 (Frat2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peg12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transfection', 'Wnt Proteins']",,2004/04/10 05:00,2004/08/17 10:00,['2004/04/10 05:00'],"['2004/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/17 10:00 [medline]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M400439200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)85353-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jun 25;279(26):26967-74. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M400439200.

The role of imatinib in the treatment of malignant gliomas and other solid tumors is being evaluated. We used a nonhuman primate model that is highly predictive of the cerebrospinal fluid penetration of drugs in humans to study the pharmacokinetics of imatinib in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after i.v. and p.o. administration. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Imatinib, 15 mg/kg i.v. over 30 min (n = 3) or 30 mg/kg p.o. (n = 3), was administered to nonhuman primates. Imatinib was measured in serial samples of plasma and CSF using high-pressure liquid chromatography with UV absorbance or mass spectroscopic detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using model-independent methods. RESULTS: Peak plasma imatinib concentrations ranged from 6.4 to 9.5 microM after i.v. dosing and 0.8 to 2.8 microM after p.o. dosing. The mean +/-SD area under the plasma concentration versus time curve was 2480 +/-1340 microM.min and 1191 +/-146 microM.min after i.v. and p.o. dosing, respectively. The terminal half-life was 529 +/-167 min after i.v. dosing and 266 +/-88 min after p.o. dosing. After i.v. dosing the steady state volume of distribution was 5.9 +/-2.8 liter/kg, and the total body clearance was 12 +/-5 ml/min/kg. The mean peak CSF concentration was 0.25 +/-0.07 microM after i.v. dosing and 0.07 +/-0.04 microM after p.o. dosing.

We examined genotypes from patients enrolled in the International Randomized Study of IFN-alpha versus STI571 in an attempt to identify factors that associate with cytogenetic response. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sixty-eight polymorphic loci in 26 genes were examined in a subset of 187 patients (imatinib-treated patients, n = 113; IFN + 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-treated patients, n = 74). Correlations between genotype and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) were examined by Fisher's exact tests. Multivariate and survival analyses were also performed. RESULTS: A significant association between MCyR and the rs2290573 polymorphism mapped to 15q22.33 was observed in imatinib-treated patients (P = 0.00037, Bonferroni corrected P = 0.025). Individuals with a CC genotype at this locus had a MCyR rate of 52% compared with individuals with a CT or TT genotype that had a MCyR rate of 89% (odds ratio, 6.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.51-29.91). In a multivariate analysis, the rs2290573 polymorphism was significant, whereas Sokal score was not. Time to progression analysis illustrated a significant difference based on genotype for the rs2290573 polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: A significant association was identified between the genetic polymorphism rs2290573 and MCyR in imatinib-treated patients. This polymorphism is located in the intronic sequence of a putative gene with a tyrosine kinase domain. Multivariate analysis suggests that an individual's genotype for rs2290573 has more predictive value for MCyR than prognostic variables such as Sokal score.

He suffered from alopecia universalis occurring 11 years previously. The alopecia involved all body hair, including eyebrows and eyelashes. Between day 40 and day 55 after transplantation, hair started to grow on the chin, eyelashes, and on the top of his head. Immunosuppression was stopped at 6 months because of cytogenetic relapse and incomplete donor chimerism with some renewed hair loss.

By sharing our collective experience, we have been able to formulate recommendations for current clinical practice, which are included in this report, and have emphasized results that have implications for future practice. Guidelines for the management of acute ""first-dose"" events, prophylaxis for infection, detection and treatment of cytomegalovirus reactivation, and hematologic support are presented, with emphasis on allowing patients to proceed smoothly through therapy while maximizing therapeutic benefit. Management of adverse events is facilitated by the predictable timing of their appearance. In general, hematologic adverse events are transient, manageable, and reversible. Clinicians should be cautious of prematurely terminating treatment at 4-6 weeks in patients whose disease responds to treatment. Although resolution of peripheral blood lymphocytosis occurs early in most patients, bone marrow is unlikely to be clear of disease. In particular, grade 4 neutropenia at this time is common and, because it is manageable, it is not an indication to discontinue treatment. The eradication of minimal residual disease from blood and bone marrow observed with alemtuzumab therapy is a major step forward in the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Combination therapies such as alemtuzumab/fludarabine with the potential to maximize eradication at all disease sites should be systematically investigated. Because high response rates and few complications are observed in previously untreated patients, the use of alemtuzumab earlier in therapy may provide optimum benefit to patients.",,"['Keating, Michael', 'Coutre, Stephen', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Kennedy, Ben', 'Kipps, Tom', 'Bodey, Gerald', 'Byrd, John C', 'Rosen, Steven', 'Dearden, Claire', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Hillmen, Peter']","['Keating M', 'Coutre S', 'Rai K', 'Osterborg A', 'Faderl S', 'Kennedy B', 'Kipps T', 'Bodey G', 'Byrd JC', 'Rosen S', 'Dearden C', 'Dyer MJ', 'Hillmen P']","['M.

However, the mechanism of oncogenesis by HTLV-1 remains to be clarified. It was reported that the incidence curve of ATL versus age was consistent with a multistage carcinogenesis model. Although HTLV-1 is an oncogenic retrovirus, a mechanism of carcinogenesis in ATL by insertional mutagenesis as one step during multistage carcinogenesis has not been considered thus far, because the exact integration sites on the chromosome have not been analyzed. Here we determined the precise HTLV-1 integration sites on the human chromosome, by taking advantage of the recently available human genome database. We isolated 25 integration sites of HTLV-1 from 23 cases of ATL. Interestingly, 13 (52%) of the integration sites were within genes, a rate significantly higher than that expected in the case of random integration (P = 0.043, chi(2) test). These results suggest that preferential integration into genes at the first infection is a characteristic of HTLV-1. However considering that some of the genes are related to the regulation of cell growth, the integration of HTLV-1 into or near growth-related genes might contribute to the clonal selection of HTLV-1-infected cells during multistage carcinogenesis of ATL.",,"['Hanai, Shuji', 'Nitta, Takayuki', 'Shoda, Momoko', 'Tanaka, Masakazu', 'Iso, Naomi', 'Mizoguchi, Izuru', 'Yashiki, Shinji', 'Sonoda, Shunro', 'Hasegawa, Yuichi', 'Nagasawa, Toshiro', 'Miwa, Masanao']","['Hanai S', 'Nitta T', 'Shoda M', 'Tanaka M', 'Iso N', 'Mizoguchi I', 'Yashiki S', 'Sonoda S', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Nagasawa T', 'Miwa M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Oncology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba Science City, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*virology', 'Proviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', '*Virus Integration']",,2004/04/10 05:00,2004/07/14 05:00,['2004/04/10 05:00'],"['2004/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/14 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03207.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2004 Apr;95(4):306-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2004.tb03207.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DC-SIGN expression in vivo is primarily restricted to interstitial dendritic cells (DC) and certain tissue macrophages. We now report that leukemic THP-1 cells, widely used as a model for monocyte-macrophage differentiation, express very low basal levels of DC-SIGN and that DC-SIGN expression in THP-1 cells is regulated during differentiation. Differentiation-inducing agents (phorbol ester, bryostatin) conveyed THP-1 cells with the ability to up-regulate DC-SIGN mRNA levels and cell surface expression in response to interleukin-4 (IL-4) or IL-13. DC-SIGN up-regulation required a functional JAK-STAT signaling pathway, was inhibited in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and conferred THP-1 cells with increased pathogen recognition and T cell stimulatory capabilities. The up-regulation of DC-SIGN on THP-1 cells resembles its inducible expression on monocytes and macrophages, where DC-SIGN expression is also induced by IL-4/IL-13 and negatively regulated by TNF-alpha, LPS, and vitamin D(3). These results point to THP-1 cells as a useful cellular system to characterize the pathogen-binding capabilities of DC-SIGN and to dissect the molecular mechanisms that control its regulated and tissue-specific expression in myeloid dendritic cells, and the results suggest that DC-SIGN constitutes a marker for both DC and alternatively activated macrophages.",,"['Puig-Kroger, Amaya', 'Serrano-Gomez, Diego', 'Caparros, Esther', 'Dominguez-Soto, Angeles', 'Relloso, Miguel', 'Colmenares, Maria', 'Martinez-Munoz, Laura', 'Longo, Natividad', 'Sanchez-Sanchez, Noelia', 'Rincon, Mercedes', 'Rivas, Luis', 'Sanchez-Mateos, Paloma', 'Fernandez-Ruiz, Elena', 'Corbi, Angel L']","['Puig-Kroger A', 'Serrano-Gomez D', 'Caparros E', 'Dominguez-Soto A', 'Relloso M', 'Colmenares M', 'Martinez-Munoz L', 'Longo N', 'Sanchez-Sanchez N', 'Rincon M', 'Rivas L', 'Sanchez-Mateos P', 'Fernandez-Ruiz E', 'Corbi AL']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Ramiro de Maeztu, 9 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DC-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lectins, C-Type/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Up-Regulation']",,2004/04/09 05:00,2004/07/02 05:00,['2004/04/09 05:00'],"['2004/04/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M311516200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)66478-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2004 Jun 11;279(24):25680-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M311516200.

RNA from rat embryonic day 12 and 13 sciatic nerves, a stage when nerves contain Schwann cell precursors, was used to identify several genes not previously described in Schwann cells. One of them, zinc finger protein (ZFP)-57, proved to be the homologue of a mouse gene found in F9 teratocarcinoma cells. Its mRNA expression profile within embryonic and adult normal and transected peripheral nerves, and its distribution in the rest of the nervous system is described. High levels of expression are seen in embryonic nerves and spinal cord. These drop rapidly during the first few weeks after birth, a pattern mirrored in other parts of the nervous system. ZFP-57 localizes to the nucleus of Schwann and other cells. The sequence contains an N-terminal Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain and ZFP-57 constructs containing green fluorescent protein reveal that the protein colocalizes with heterochromatin protein 1alpha to centromeric heterochromatin in a characteristic speckled pattern in NIH3T3 cells. The KRAB domain is required for this localization, because constructs lacking it target the protein to the nucleus but not to the centromeric heterochromatin. When fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain, the KRAB domain of ZFP-57 represses transcription, and full-length ZFP-57 represses Schwann cell transcription from myelin basic protein and P(0) promoters in co-transfection assays.

Epithelial tumour cell lysis can be obtained with cytotoxic T cell retargeting through the bispecific antibody BIS-1, with combined affinity for the T-cell receptor and epithelial glycoprotein-2 (EGP-2). Our aim was to study the concept of tumour cell purging in the setting of a suspension of ovarian tissue. METHODS: Human ovarian tissue was brought into suspension by mechanical and enzymatic treatment. Cells of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line and activated human lymphocytes were co- incubated for 4 h with or without BIS-1 and with or without ovarian suspension. After incubation, MCF-7 cell death and cell growth were evaluated by fluorescent cell detection and MTT assay, respectively. Ovarian tissue morphology was evaluated immunohistochemically. RESULTS: MCF-7 cell death and cell growth inhibition increased with increasing ratios of lymphocytes to MCF-7 cells. BIS-1 addition gave further augmentation, with a maximum depletion of growing MCF-7 cells of 89% (SD 11%) versus without BIS-1, 23% (SD 15%; P < 0.001). Follicles remained morphologically intact. CONCLUSIONS: Purging of added epithelial tumour cells from ovarian tissue with BIS-1 is possible in vitro. Morphologically, follicles remain intact after this procedure.

EGFR is important in development, cellular proliferation, and cancer. GH is a critical growthpromoting and metabolic regulatory hormone that binds the GH receptor, thereby engaging various signaling pathways, including ERKs. Prior studies suggest cross-talk between the GH receptor and EGFR signaling systems. Using the GH- and EGF-responsive 3T3-F442A preadipocyte, we previously observed that GH, in addition to causing EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, also induced EGFR phosphorylation that was detected by PTP101, an antibody reactive with ERK consensus phosphorylation sites. This latter phosphorylation was prevented by pretreatment with MAPK kinase (MEK)1 inhibitors, suggesting ERK pathway dependence. Furthermore, GH cotreatment with EGF markedly slowed EGF-induced EGFR degradation and down-regulation, thereby potentiating EGF-induced EGFR signaling. These effects were also MEK1 dependent and suggested ERK pathway-dependent influence of GH on EGF-induced EGFR postendocytic trafficking and signaling. We now explore the impact of GH on cell surface binding of EGF in 3T3-F442A cells. We found that GH pretreatment caused transient, but substantial, lessening of (125)I-EGF binding. Competitive binding experiments revealed that the decreased binding was primarily due to decreased affinity, rather than a change in the number of EGF binding sites. The effect of GH on EGF binding was concentration dependent and temporally correlated with GH-induced ERK activation and EGFR PTP101-reactive phosphorylation. Blockade of the MEK1/ERK but not the protein kinase C pathway, prevented GH's effects on EGF binding, and our results indicate that the mechanisms of GH- and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetateinduced inhibition of EGF binding differ substantially. Overall, our findings suggest that GH can modulate both EGF binding kinetics and the EGFR's postbinding signaling itinerary in a MEK1/ERK pathway-dependent fashion.",,"['Huang, Yao', 'Chang, Yongchang', 'Wang, Xiangdong', 'Jiang, Jing', 'Frank, Stuart J']","['Huang Y', 'Chang Y', 'Wang X', 'Jiang J', 'Frank SJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1530 3rd Avenue South, BDB 861, Birmingham, Alabama 35294-0012, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Map2k1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Human Growth Hormone/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Ligands', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects']",,2004/04/09 05:00,2004/07/15 05:00,['2004/04/09 05:00'],"['2004/04/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/15 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1210/en.2003-1658 [doi]', 'en.2003-1658 [pii]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2004 Jul;145(7):3297-306. doi: 10.1210/en.2003-1658.

Although toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in cancer cells exposed to arsenic could mediate cancer cell death, how arsenic induces ROS remains undefined. Through the use of gene expression profiling, interference RNA, and genetically engineered cells, we report here that NADPH oxidase, an enzyme complex required for the normal antibacterial function of white blood cells, is the main target of arsenic-induced ROS production. Because NADPH oxidase enzyme activity can also be stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate, a synergism between arsenic and the clinically used phorbol myristate acetate analog, bryostatin 1, through enhanced ROS production can be expected. We show that this synergism exists, and that the use of very low doses of both arsenic and bryostatin 1 can effectively kill leukemic cells. Our findings pinpoint the arsenic target of ROS production and provide a conceptual basis for an anticancer regimen.",,"['Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Jie, Chunfa', 'Kenedy, Andrew A', 'Jones, Richard J', 'Trush, Michael A', 'Dang, Chi V']","['Chou WC', 'Jie C', 'Kenedy AA', 'Jones RJ', 'Trush MA', 'Dang CV']","['Program of Human Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Arsenic/*toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2004/04/09 05:00,2004/07/20 05:00,['2004/04/09 05:00'],"['2004/04/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0306687101 [doi]', '0306687101 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Mar 30;101(13):4578-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0306687101.

To understand the pathogenic roles of Hox genes in MLL leukemias, we assessed the impact of Hoxa7 or Hoxa9 nullizygosity on hematopoietic progenitor compartments and their susceptibility to MLL-induced leukemias. Selective reductions in the absolute numbers of committed progenitors, but not of hematopoietic stem cells, distinguished Hoxa7- and Hoxa9-deficient mice. Megakaryocytic/erythroid progenitor (MEP) reductions in Hoxa7(-/-) mice correlated with reticulocytosis and thrombocytopenia without anemia. Conversely, Hoxa9(-/-) mice displayed marked lymphopenia and substantial reductions of common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and lymphoid precursors, in addition to significant reductions of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMPs). In retroviral transduction/transplantation assays, Hoxa7- and Hoxa9-deficient progenitors remained susceptible to transformation by MLL-GAS7, which activates MLL through a dimerization-dependent mechanism. However, Hoxa7(-/-) or Hoxa9(-/-) progenitors were less efficient in generating transformed blast colony-forming units (CFUs) in vitro and induced leukemias with longer disease latencies, reduced penetrance, and less mature phenotypes.

The breakpoint cluster region/ABL (BCR/ABL) tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (imatinib) is highly effective in inducing remissions in CML. However, the effects of imatinib on intracellular signaling in primary progenitor cells are not well described. We show that imatinib exposure resulted in a significant dose-responsive reduction in BCR/ABL kinase activity in CML CD34+ cells. However, imatinib treatment resulted in an increase in activity of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), an important downstream effector of BCR/ABL. Increased MAPK activity was growth factor dependent. Pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK using MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-1/2 (MEK-1/2) inhibitors significantly reduced CML progenitor proliferation. Combined treatment with a MEK-1/2 inhibitor and imatinib significantly increased suppression of CML progenitors compared with either inhibitor alone. In contrast, imatinib treatment resulted in a small reduction in AKT activity. Combined treatment with a phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase inhibitor and imatinib significantly increased suppression of CML progenitor growth compared with either inhibitor alone. We conclude that inhibition of BCR/ABL kinase activity in CML progenitors by imatinib results in a growth factor-dependent compensatory increase in MAPK activity and in only partial inhibition of PI-3 kinase activity.

Therefore in the present study, taking advantage of a large panel of HLA class I allele-specific human monoclonal antibodies, we have compared HLA class I antigen expression on leukemic cells with that on autologous and allogeneic normal cells. Down-regulation of HLA-A and/or -B allospecificities was present in the majority of the patients studied. However, down-regulation did not affect all HLA class I alleles uniformly, but was almost exclusively restricted to HLA-A allospecificities and to HLA-B allospecificities which belong to the HLA-Bw6 group. The latter allospecificities, at variance from those that belong to the HLA-Bw4 group, do not modulate the interactions of leukemic cells with natural killer (NK) cells. Therefore, our results suggest that the selective down-regulation of HLA-A and HLA-Bw6 allospecificities associated with HLA-Bw4 preservation provides leukemic cells with an escape mechanism not only from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), but also from NK cells. As a result T-cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies for leukemia should utilize HLA-Bw4 alloantigens as restricting elements since a selective HLA-Bw4 allele loss would provide leukemic cells with an escape mechanism from CTLs, but would increase their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis.",,"['Demanet, Christian', 'Mulder, Arend', 'Deneys, Veronique', 'Worsham, Maria J', 'Maes, Piet', 'Claas, Frans H', 'Ferrone, Soldano']","['Demanet C', 'Mulder A', 'Deneys V', 'Worsham MJ', 'Maes P', 'Claas FH', 'Ferrone S']","['HLA Laboratory, Academic Hospital VUB, Brussels, Belgium. christian.demanet@az.vub.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-Bw4 antigen)', '0 (HLA-Bw6 antigen)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Mutation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,2004/04/09 05:00,2004/05/28 05:00,['2004/04/09 05:00'],"['2004/04/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-07-2500 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43811-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Apr 15;103(8):3122-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-07-2500.

PRO3 and HNE share the PR1 peptide sequence that induces HLA-A*0201-restricted cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) with antileukemia reactivity. We studied the entire HNE protein for its ability to induce CTLs. In an 18-hour culture, HNE-loaded monocytes stimulated significant intracellular interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 12 of 20 and 8 of 20 healthy individuals, respectively. Lymphocytes from 2 HNE responders were pulsed weekly for 4 weeks to generate HNE-specific CTLs. One of 2 HLA-A*0201-negative individuals inhibited the colony formation of HLA-identical chronic myelogenous leukemia progenitor cells (73% inhibition at 50:1 effector-target [E/T] ratio), indicating that peptides other than PR1 can induce leukemia-reactive CTLs. Repetitive stimulations with HNE in 2 of 5 HLA-A*0201+ individuals increased PR1 tetramer-positive CD8+ T-cell frequencies from 0.1% to 0.29% and 0.02% to 0.55%, respectively. These CTLs recognized PR1 peptide or killed HNE-loaded targets. These results indicate that exogenously processed HNE is a source of PR1 peptide as well as other peptide sequences capable of inducing leukemia-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.

By mass spectrometry, this protein was identified as EWI-2, a previously described cell-surface partner for tetraspanin proteins CD9 and CD81. Wild-type EWI-2 overexpression had no effect on MOLT-4 cell tethering and adhesion strengthening on the alpha4beta1 ligand, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), in shear flow assays. However, EWI-2 markedly impaired spreading and ruffling on VCAM-1. In contrast, a mutant EWI-2 molecule, with a different cytoplasmic tail, neither impaired cell spreading nor associated with alpha4beta1 and CD81. The endogenous wild-type EWI-2-CD81-alpha4beta1 complex was fully soluble, and highly specific as seen by the absence of other MOLT-4 cell-surface proteins. Also, it was relatively small in size (0.5 x 10(6) Da to 4 x 10(6) Da), as estimated by size exclusion chromatography. Overexpression of EWI-2 in MOLT-4 cells caused reorganization of cell-surface CD81, increased the extent of CD81-CD81, CD81-alpha4beta1, and alpha4beta1-alpha4beta1 associations, and increased the apparent size of CD81-alpha4beta1 complexes.

In this study the migration and in vivo homing to the bone marrow of nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice injected with human precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells in comparison to normal CD34+ progenitors (both cord blood and mobilized peripheral blood) was investigated. Although migration and homing of both cell populations was dependent on stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 interactions, major differences in receptor expression as well as the migratory capacity toward various concentrations of SDF-1 were found. Furthermore, unlike normal CD34+ progenitors, in vivo homing of the leukemic cells was superior when recipient NOD/SCID mice were not irradiated prior to transplantation. In addition, we report differences in the adhesion molecules activated following SDF-1 stimulation, documenting a major role for very late antigen 4 (VLA-4), but not VLA-5 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), in homing of precursor-B ALL cells. Interestingly, Toxin-B and pertussis toxin inhibited the homing of the leukemic cells but not that of normal CD34+ progenitors or normal CD10+/CD19+ precursor-B cells, revealing differences in CXCR4 signaling pathways that are based on changes that acquired by the leukemic cells.

These disorders have eluded a unique molecular explanation, and therapy has primarily been oriented toward palliation of symptoms related to organ involvement. Recent reports indicate that HES and CEL are imatinib-responsive malignancies, with rapid and complete hematologic remissions observed at lower doses than used in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). These BCR-ABL-negative cases lack activating mutations or abnormal fusions involving other known target genes of imatinib, implicating a novel tyrosine kinase in their pathogenesis. A bedside-to-benchtop translational research effort led to the identification of a constitutively activated fusion tyrosine kinase on chromosome 4q12, derived from an interstitial deletion, that fuses the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha gene (PDGFRA) to an uncharacterized human gene FIP1-like-1 (FIP1L1).

Although diagnostic X-rays provide great benefits, that their use involves some small risk of developing cancer is generally accepted. Our aim was to estimate the extent of this risk on the basis of the annual number of diagnostic X-rays undertaken in the UK and in 14 other developed countries. METHODS: We combined data on the frequency of diagnostic X-ray use, estimated radiation doses from X-rays to individual body organs, and risk models, based mainly on the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, with population-based cancer incidence rates and mortality rates for all causes of death, using life table methods. FINDINGS: Our results indicate that in the UK about 0.6% of the cumulative risk of cancer to age 75 years could be attributable to diagnostic X-rays. This percentage is equivalent to about 700 cases of cancer per year. In 13 other developed countries, estimates of the attributable risk ranged from 0.6% to 1.8%, whereas in Japan, which had the highest estimated annual exposure frequency in the world, it was more than 3%. INTERPRETATION: We provide detailed estimates of the cancer risk from diagnostic X-rays. The calculations involved a number of assumptions and so are inevitably subject to considerable uncertainty.

It has been established that patients with HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) show an exaggerated immune response when compared with the immunological response observed in HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers. In this study the immunological responses in HAM/TSP patients and in HTLV-I asymptomatic carriers were compared using several immunological assays to identify immunological markers associated with progression from infection to disease. METHODS: Immunoproliferation assays, cytokine levels of unstimulated cultures, and flow cytometry analysis were used to evaluate the studied groups. Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed ranks) were used to compare the difference between the groups. RESULTS: Although both groups showed great variability, HAM/TSP patients had higher spontaneous lymphoproliferation as well as higher IFN-gamma levels in unstimulated supernatants when compared with asymptomatic carriers. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated a high frequency of inflammatory cytokine (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) producing lymphocytes in HAM/TSP as compared to the asymptomatic group. This difference was accounted for mainly by an increase in CD8 cell production of these cytokines. Moreover, the HAM/TSP patients also expressed an increased frequency of CD28-/CD8+ T cells. Since forty percent of the asymptomatic carriers had spontaneous lymphoproliferation and IFN-gamma production similar to HAM/TSP patients, IFN-gamma levels were measured eight months after the first evaluation in some of these patients to observe if this was a transient or a persistent situation. No significant difference was observed between the means of IFN-gamma levels in the first and second evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that a large proportion of HTLV-I carriers present similar immunological responses to those observed in HAM/TSP, strongly argues for further studies to evaluate these parameters as markers of HAM/TSP progression.",,"['Santos, Silvane Braga', 'Porto, Aurelia Fonseca', 'Muniz, Andre Luiz', 'de Jesus, Amelia Ribeiro', 'Magalhaes, Elza', 'Melo, Ailton', 'Dutra, Walderez O', 'Gollob, Kenneth J', 'Carvalho, Edgar M']","['Santos SB', 'Porto AF', 'Muniz AL', 'de Jesus AR', 'Magalhaes E', 'Melo A', 'Dutra WO', 'Gollob KJ', 'Carvalho EM']","['Servico de Imunologia, Hospital Universitario Professor Edgard Santos, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, Brasil. silvane@ufba.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Carrier State/blood/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/*immunology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2004/04/09 05:00,2004/04/24 05:00,['2004/04/09 05:00'],"['2003/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2004/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1186/1471-2334-4-7 [doi]', '1471-2334-4-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2004 Mar 2;4:7. doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-4-7.,,20040302,,,PMC385233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manual assessment of white blood cell counts and differentials that have been rejected by an automated analyzer is one of the most time-consuming tasks in the routine hematology laboratory. In this study, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis was used for the first time when anomalous distribution and suspect flag alarms appeared in hemograms carried out with the new Beckman Coulter LH 750 analyzer. This article is our second about the LH 750 analyzer published in this journal; we increased the number of cases and describe the novel application of statistical analysis of ROC curves. In processing of specimens from patients with 3% to 6% immature granulocytes (myelocytes + metamyelocytes + bands ), the suspect flag Imm Ne 1 (immature granulocytes) showed 77% diagnostic efficiency with a maximum area under curve (AUC) of 0.71 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.597 to 0.831 without significant differences between the 3 available levels of alarms in the analyzer (L1, L2, L2). In processing of specimens from patients with >6% immature granulocytes, the Imm Ne 1 flag showed superior diagnostic efficiency of 98% with a maximum AUC of 0.80 and a CI of 0.713 to 0.879. The suspect flag Imm Ne 2 in processing of specimens from patients with >6% of immature granulocytes showed diagnostic efficiency of 92% with a maximum AUC of 0.77 and a CI of 0.665 to 0.871, finding a significant positive difference in level L3 regarding sensitivity in comparison with the other 2 levels of the analyzer (L1, L2). For specimens from patients with >2% blasts, the suspect Blasts alarm showed a diagnostic efficiency of 94%, an AUC of 0.91, and a CI of 0.775 to 1.043; positive differences were observed between the levels L2/L3 and L1. In processing of specimens with variant lymphocytes (large, granular, prolymphocytes, cleaved, chronic lymphocytic leukemia type, and so forth) >10% (x = 14%), the suspect alarm Var Lym (variant lymphocytes) showed a low diagnostic sensitivity of 20% with a maximum AUC of 0.59 and a CI of 0.300 to 0.870 without significant differences between the 3 available levels (L1, L2, L3). However, in processing of specimens presenting values >10% reactive or activated lymphocytes (x = 23%), typical for patients with infectious mononucleosis, the Var Lym flag showed a superior sensitivity of 75% with a diagnostic efficiency of 92% and an AUC of 0.84 with a CI of 0.587 to 1.089. Finally, the laboratory can easily program definitive abnormal morphological flags of distribution (granulocytosis, eosinophilia, monocytosis, and so forth) on the basis of its patient population. In this study we were able to carry out comparisons of AUC and to choose the values for the automated counts in percentage, absolute value, or both. Therefore we were able to define the reliability and impact on the alarm routine to optimize the performance of the user-adjustable definitive alarms for anomalous distribution.",,"['Aulesa, C', 'Pastor, I', 'Naranjo, D', 'Galimany, R']","['Aulesa C', 'Pastor I', 'Naranjo D', 'Galimany R']","['Laboratories Unit, Valle de Hebron Hospital Complex, Barcelona, Spain. 27215cam@comb.es']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Lab Hematol,Laboratory hematology : official publication of the International Society for Laboratory Hematology,9615688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/instrumentation', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Hematology/instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count/*instrumentation', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*ROC Curve', 'Reference Values', 'Regression Analysis']",,2004/04/09 05:00,2004/10/08 09:00,['2004/04/09 05:00'],"['2004/04/09 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/09 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1532/lh96.03030 [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Hematol. 2004;10(1):14-23. doi: 10.1532/lh96.03030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to other cytosine nucleoside analogs, troxacitabine is resistant to inactivation by cytidine deaminase (CD). In this study we have investigated the effects of increased intracellular levels of CD on the antineoplastic action of troxacitabine and the related antileukemic drug, cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). Retroviral transduction of the human CD gene in A549 lung carcinoma cells (A549-CD cells) markedly increased the expression of this gene. The A549-CD cells were more resistant to the cytotoxic action of ARA-C than the wild type A549 cells as determined by clonogenic assays. In contrast, the CD-transduced cells were as or more sensitive to the cytotoxic action of troxacitabine than the wild type cells.

However, the development of drug resistance has led to examination of combination therapies. In this study, we investigated the effects of combining imatinib with immunotherapy against a murine bcr-abl(+) leukemia, 12B1. We have previously shown that multiple chaperone proteins may be enriched into a vaccine form from tumor cell lysates by a free-solution isoelectric focusing method. We refer to these vaccines as chaperone-rich cell lysates (CRCLs) and have found that they are potent immunologic agents against a variety of murine tumors, including 12B1. We now demonstrate that the combination of imatinib with dendritic cells loaded with 12B1-derived CRCL yields high activation of anti-12B1-specific T cells and potent antitumor activity, resulting in tumor-free survival in up to 63% of mice with bcr-abl(+) 12B1 tumors.

These phenotypic changes make DCs potent antigen presenting cells with the ability to initiate and modulate immune responses. Recent findings have shown that DCs can mediate direct cytotoxicity toward tumor cells. Here, we investigated the effect of monocyte derived DC (moDC) on hematopoietic tumor cells by assessing the uptake of [methyl-3H]thymidine (3H-TdR), JAM test (radiometric assay for DNA fragmentation) and 51Cr-release assay. We found that moDCs significantly inhibited the growth of 6 tumor cell lines and stimulated another 4 cell lines independently of the expression of Fas protein. MoDCs also inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells in transwell culture, including two cell lines that were driven to proliferate by direct contact with moDCs. Apoptosis, but not cytolysis, was detected in all the cell lines inhibited by moDCs. In contrast, no cytostatic or cytotoxic effect was detected on K562 cells (chronic myeloid leukemia) and BY94 cells (sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma). The inhibitory activity of moDCs on Fas-expressing tumor cells fully persisted after the neutralization of FasL. Accordingly, there was no detection of FasL protein or FasL mRNA expression in moDC.

STUDY DESIGN: Echocardiogram and chart reviews of a series of 158 patients with neuroblastoma and a control group of 192 children with leukemia were performed. The proportion of patients with CCM in each group was compared. RESULTS: Fourteen of the 70 (20%) patients with neuroblastoma and echocardiography had CCM, compared with 7 of the 192 (3.6%) patients with leukemia with echocardiograms (P=.0001). If all of the patients with neuroblastoma without echocardiograms (n=88) are considered to have normal cardiac anatomy, this difference remains significant (14 of 158 patients with neuroblastoma have CCM detected [8.9%] versus 7 of 192 patients with leukemia [3.6%]; P=.045). Neural crest-derived CCM were more common in patients with neuroblastoma, detected in 5 of 70 patients with neuroblastoma versus 2 of 192 patients with leukemia (P=.016). Congenital cardiovascular malformations in patients with neuroblastoma were associated with a cancer diagnosis at age less than 1 year and a lower neuroblastoma stage, but there was no association with tumor MYCN amplification.

While complete loss of heterologous sequences is favored when these are flanked by a direct repeat, deletion mutants with junction sites within the heterologous cassette may also be retrieved, in particular from vectors without flanking repeats. Such deletion mutants were here used to investigate determinants of reverse transcriptase-mediated non-homologous recombination. Based upon previous structural analysis the individual recombination sites within the IRES could be assigned to either base-paired or unpaired regions of RNA. This assignment showed a significant bias (P = 0.000082) towards recombination within unpaired regions of the IRES. We propose that the events observed in this in vivo system result from template switching during first-strand cDNA synthesis and that the choice of acceptor sites for non-homologous recombination are guided by non-paired regions.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is implicated in the pathophysiology of GVHD at several steps in the process. Infliximab is a genetically constructed immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) murine-human chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-alpha, blocking its interaction with receptors and causing lysis of cells that produce TNF-alpha. In this study we retrospectively evaluated 134 patients who had steroid-refractory acute GVHD. Of these, 21 who received infliximab as a single agent were analyzed. The overall response rate was 67% (n = 14), and 13 patients (62%) experienced complete response (CR). Five patients (24%) did not respond, and 2 (10%) had progressive GVHD. None had a toxic reaction to infliximab. Ten patients (48%) had 18 fungal infections, including Aspergillus species in 7 and Candida species in 10.

Mice expressing G-CSF-R truncation mutants (gcsfr-d715) show defective receptor internalization, an increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5)/STAT3 activation ratio, and hyperproliferative responses to G-CSF treatment. We determined whether a lack of negative feedback by suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins contributes to the signaling abnormalities of G-CSF-R-d715. Expression of SOCS3 transcripts in bone marrow cells from G-CSF-treated gcsfr-d715 mice was approximately 60% lower than in wild-type (WT) littermates. SOCS3 efficiently suppressed STAT3 and STAT5 activation by WT G-CSF-R in luciferase reporter assays. In contrast, while SOCS3 still inhibited STAT3 activation by G-CSF-R-d715, STAT5 activation was no longer affected. This was due mainly to loss of the SOCS3 recruitment site Tyr729, with an additional contribution of the internalization defects of G-CSF-R-d715. Because Tyr729 is also a docking site for the Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), which binds to and inactivates STAT5, we suggest a model in which reduced SOCS3 expression, combined with the loss of recruitment of both SOCS3 and SHP-2 to the activated receptor complex, determine the increased STAT5/STAT3 activation ratio and the resulting signaling abnormalities projected by truncated G-CSF-R mutants.",,"['van de Geijn, Gert-Jan M', 'Gits, Judith', 'Aarts, Lambertus H J', 'Heijmans-Antonissen, Claudia', 'Touw, Ivo P']","['van de Geijn GJ', 'Gits J', 'Aarts LH', 'Heijmans-Antonissen C', 'Touw IP']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', '*Milk Proteins', 'Neutropenia/*genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tyrosine', 'src Homology Domains']",,2004/04/08 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/04/08 05:00'],"['2004/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-08-2913 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43593-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Aug 1;104(3):667-74. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-08-2913.

In particular, classical and molecular cytogenetics have benefitted enormously from the availability of LL cell lines with specific chromosomal abnormalities. Such aberrations may be the portal to the discovery of novel oncogene rearrangements for which positive cell lines provide a resource for both discovery and functional studies. The new continuous leukemia cell line MUTZ-11 was established in 1994 from the peripheral blood of a 60-year-old woman with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M4 (following 2 years with myelodysplastic syndromes). DNA fingerprinting confirmed the authenticity and derivation of the cell line. The immunoprofile as determined by flow cytometry was as follows: positive for myelocytic markers (CD13, CD15, CD33, CD65 and CD68), negative for T-cell (except for CD4 and CD7), B-cell and erythroid-megakaryocytic markers. The cell line is constitutively cytokine-dependent and growth depends on externally added cytokines. With regard to cytokine receptor expression, the cell line was found to be positive for GM-CSFRalpha (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor, CD116), Kit (CD117) and IL-3Ralpha (interleukin-3 receptor, CD123). The cytokine response profiles as determined by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation assay were: 2-to-12 fold growth stimulation of MUTZ-11 by GM-CSF, IFN-alpha (interferon), IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, IL-3 and SCF (stem cell factor); growth inhibition by TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor), TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor) and TNF-beta. Cytogenetic analysis showed the following consensus karyotype: 46, XX, der(16)t(16;17)(p13.3;q23)x2. Previous molecular biological analysis documented that MUTZ-11 cells carry both an FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and an MLL partial tandem duplication (PTD). The scientific significance of MUTZ-11 lies (i). in the absolute cytokine-dependency and the proliferative response to various cytokines, (ii). in the unique cytogenetic (disomic t(16;17)) and (iii). molecular biological alterations (FLT3 ITD + MLL PTD). In summary, the new cytokine-dependent AML-derived cell line MUTZ-11 displays unique novel features and emphasizes the need for comprehensive analysis of new LL cell lines which may lead to the discovery of important pathogenetic alterations.",,"['Hu, Zhen-Bo', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Meyer, Corinna', 'Kaufmann, Maren', 'MacLeod, Roderick A F', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Hu ZB', 'Quentmeier H', 'Meyer C', 'Kaufmann M', 'MacLeod RA', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2004/04/08 05:00,2004/06/03 05:00,['2004/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2003.09.013 [doi]', 'S0145212603003333 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 May;28(5):509-15. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2003.09.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we investigated the expression of IAP family proteins in bone marrow samples from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and control cases by quantitative real-time RT-PCR method and an immunohistochemical approach. Overexpression of survivin and cIAP2 mRNA was significant in CLL bone marrow cells (P < 0.05, respectively) compared with control samples. By immunohistochemistry, survivin was detected in a few scattered myeloid cells in all cases of control bone marrow. Concerning the ALL bone marrow, more than half the cases demonstrated positive expression of survivin (8 out of 13), while the majority of CLL cases (20 out of 21) exhibited intense expression of survivin. The differential subcellular localization of survivin was distinct between ALL and CLL cases. ALL cells essentially revealed nuclear localization of survivin as well as cytoplasmic signals in some cases, while CLL cells from the majority of cases predominantly showed cytoplasmic expression. Next, RT-PCR was performed for the expression of survivin and its splicing variant, survivin-2B and survivin-deltaEx3 in ALL and CLL cells, as the distribution of these variants would be regulated by nuclear/cytoplasmic transport system. In both ALL and CLL bone marrow samples, the expression of wild-type survivin was more predominant than that of survivin-2B or survivin-deltaEx3, although the expression of survivin-deltaEx3 was prominent in samples from survivin-expressing ALL cases. Thus, the splicing of survivin mRNA may be differently regulated in ALL and CLL cells, causing distinct manners of nuclear/cytoplasmic transport of survivin protein. In conclusion, our observations indicate a differential regulatory mechanism for the expression of IAP family proteins in ALL and CLL cells, although the functions of IAP families and the mechanisms of nuclear/cytoplasmic transport of survivin should be clarified in future studies.",,"['Nakagawa, Yasunori', 'Yamaguchi, Shuichi', 'Hasegawa, Maki', 'Nemoto, Tetsuo', 'Inoue, Miori', 'Suzuki, Kenshi', 'Hirokawa, Katsuiku', 'Kitagawa, Masanobu']","['Nakagawa Y', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Hasegawa M', 'Nemoto T', 'Inoue M', 'Suzuki K', 'Hirokawa K', 'Kitagawa M']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Aging and Developmental Sciences, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin']",,2004/04/08 05:00,2004/06/03 05:00,['2004/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2003/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2003.10.013 [doi]', 'S0145212603003357 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 May;28(5):487-94. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2003.10.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Topoisomerase II alpha (TopoII) are also reported as responsible for resistance since their main action is to repair DNA breakage. Polyamines are described as having a protective DNA action by stabilizing the double stranded DNA helix. For these reasons we investigated 65 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using an immunocytochemical method to elucidate the potential role of Topoisomerase and polyamines in drug resistance. Most children (60/65) were treated with the French (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL) protocol (FRALLE-93) in which B and C arms include (at least) VP16. Children with cytoplasmic TopoII positivity (18 cases) were more resistant since their overall survival was 34 months compared to more than 110 months for negative cases ( P = 0.0003). Polyamines may be associated with drug resistance since the overall survivals were 51 months and 92 months for positive and negative patients, respectively, but the P-value is only 0.13. We conclude that Topoisomerase and polyamines must be tested at diagnosis as new possible markers for chemo-resistance.

Most somatic human cells lack telomerase activity because they do not express the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene. In contrast, in almost every neoplasia, cancer cells express hTERT and therefore prevent progressive telomere shortening during each cell division. Consecutively, cancer cells obtain the ability to divide without limits and overcome replicative senescence. Gene expression level of the telomerase catalytic subunit hTERT in normal and neoplastic haematopoiesis has not yet been described. Using a quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay, we analysed the level of hTERT expression in various haematologic stem cell disorders and normal bone marrow. We could demonstrate that hTERT is differentially expressed in various haematologic stem cell disorders with significant higher levels in refractory anemia (RA) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) compared to other haematopoietic stem cell disorders and non-neoplastic haematopoiesis which may be used as a prognostic indicator in these entities.",,"['Bock, Oliver', 'Serinsoz, Ebru', 'Schlue, Jerome', 'Kreipe, Hans']","['Bock O', 'Serinsoz E', 'Schlue J', 'Kreipe H']","['Institute of Pathology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Carl-Neuberg-Strasse 1, 30625 Hannover, Germany. bock.oliver@mh-hannover.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Catalytic Domain', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*enzymology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/analysis/*genetics']",,2004/04/08 05:00,2004/06/03 05:00,['2004/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/03 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.leukres.2003.09.006 [doi]', 'S0145212603003175 [pii]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2004 May;28(5):457-60. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2003.09.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MTHFR genetic polymorphisms have been associated with a decrease in the risk of developing the lymphoid but not myeloid form of pediatric and adult leukemias. AIM: In this study we describe the genotyping of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism by melting curve analysis with the LightCycler in a case-controlled study of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and assess the effect of this common polymorphism on the leukemia risk in adult patients in Turkey. METHODS: DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes was used for genotyping in the LightCycler PCR by melting curve analysis. The risk of leukemia associated with the MTHFR polymorphism was evaluated by comparing the genotype frequencies between the control and patient groups. RESULTS: The frequency of the homozygote variant genotype (677TT) was lower than that in healthy individuals in all three leukemia groups. The 677TT genotype did not appear to have a protective effect in patients with ALL (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.78 with a 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-2.59), compared with healthy controls. The difference was higher (4.3-fold) in patients with AML, but still non-significant (OR = 0.23 with a 95% CI = 0.03-1.83). In patients with CML, the frequencies of both heterozygous (677CT) and homozygote variant genotypes were lower (OR = 0.72 and 0.66, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism displays a similar distribution pattern in lymphoid and myeloid leukemias and that the frequency of the homozygote variant genotype (677TT) is lower in all leukemia types.",,"['Deligezer, Ugur', 'Akisik, Ebru', 'Dalay, Nejat']","['Deligezer U', 'Akisik E', 'Dalay N']","['Department of Basic Oncology, Oncology Institute, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Diagn,Molecular diagnosis : a journal devoted to the understanding of human disease through the clinical application of molecular biology,9614965,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",,2004/04/08 05:00,2004/08/26 05:00,['2004/04/08 05:00'],"['2004/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/26 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['737 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03260036 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn. 2003;7(3-4):181-5. doi: 10.1007/BF03260036.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of specific differentiation processes is a major cause for the neuropathological cell features typical for this syndrome. The molecular mechanisms leading to Down Syndrome are likely to be operative from the very earliest time of embryonic/fetal development. We therefore analysed human amniotic fluid cell samples and cytotrophoblastic cells from placental biopsies, both with normal karyotypes and with trisomy 21, for the mRNA expression of stem cell marker genes. Here we describe for the first time that these human primary cell sources contain cells that express telomerase reverse transcriptase, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, and bone morphogenetic protein receptor II. A specific difference between aneuploid and normal cells could not be detected. These data provide evidence that human amniotic fluid and cytotrophoblastic cell cultures might provide a new source for research on primary cell systems expressing these stem cell markers.

After more than 100 years of preclinical and clinical research in the field, the vision of cancer immunotherapy became real and has, with multiple tools, successfully entered clinical standard practice. Non-specific mediators of immune defense, such as BCG for treatment of superficial bladder cancer or interferon-alpha for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, can induce durable remissions. In particular, antigen-specific mediators of immune defense represent promising agents for targeted cancer therapies. Antibody-based treatment of B-cell lymphomas and breast cancer has dramatically improved disease response without major toxicity. A large number of new antibodies targeting different epitopes on a variety of malignant cells are now approaching clinical approval. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation for treatment of leukemia and certain cancers represents the first T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy with large-scale clinical application. Experimental T cell-based immunotherapies with promising clinical perspectives include tumor vaccines, adoptive transfer of autologous tumor-specific effector cells and the genetic transfer of tumor-specific T cell receptors into the patient's lymphocytes.

A retrospective study was performed on 43 children and adult patients, who manifested EBV-associated T/NK-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV-T/NK-LPD) and most of whom had experienced general illness with CAEBV for several months or years. Clinicopathologically, 43 patients were classified into four groups: group A (smoldering state) (n=7), morphological non-neoplastic LPD with chronic clinical course (several years); group B (chronic state) (n=10), non-neoplastic LPD with clonal EBV-infected cells and a chronic course; group C (leukemia/lymphoma state) (n=22), neoplastic LPD with a subacute course (years to months); group D (fulminant state) (n=4), neoplastic LPD with a fulminant course (weeks to days).

Four of 7 patients in group A, 3 of 10 in group B, 12 of 22 in group C, and all 4 in group D have died. Causes of death included hemophagocytic syndrome and/or tumor death. Genotypically and phenotypically, group C was composed of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL), and NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma (NKLL), and group D comprised cases of PTCL. Groups A and B exhibited increased NK- or T-cells (CD8>CD4), and rare B-cells. Serologic titers of EBV were only modestly elevated or not elevated in almost all cases. EBV early RNA-1 (EBER-1)-expressing EBV-infected cells were frequently encountered in each group, but the number of infected cells varied between the cases.

The biological function of the incorporated HIV-1 pol gene product was tested using an infectivity assay of the released virus particles which were pseudotyped with the murine leukemia virus Env. Analysis indicated that Gag-Pol deletion mutants, with a removal of the matrix (MA) and/or nucleocapsid (NC) or of the N-terminal two thirds of the gag coding sequence, could be incorporated efficiently into virus particles and produce significant amounts of infectious virions when assayed in a single-cycle infection assay. In contrast, mutations involving a deletion of the major homology region and the adjacent C-terminal capsid sequence significantly affected Gag-Pol incorporation. However, incorporation into virus particles of a Gag-Pol deletion mutant retaining both the major homology region and the adjacent C-terminal capsid intact was still severely impaired. This suggests that the capsid major homology region and the adjacent C-terminal capsid sequence in Gag-Pol are necessary but not sufficient for the incorporation of HIV-1 Pr160(gag-pol) into virus particles.","['Copyright 2004 National Science Council, ROC and S.

We demonstrate that a single injection of the antimitotic drug vinblastine (Vb) given 14 days postinfection (p.i.) with LP-BM5 can prevent MAIDS progression. Treatment with anti-CD4 mAb at 14 days p.i. is similarly able to prevent MAIDS. Treatment at other time points with Vb or anti-CD4 mAb is ineffective. The effect is based on ablation of a replicating dominantly suppressive CD4(+) T cell population, as indicated by adoptive transfer and in vivo depletion experiments using mAbs against CD4 as well as combinations of mAbs against the known regulatory cell surface markers CD25, GITR, and CTLA-4. Cell surface marker analysis shows a population of CD4(+)CD25(+) cells arising shortly before day 14 p.i. Cytokine analyses show a peak in IL-10 production from day 12 to day 16 p.i. MAIDS-infected mice also have CD4(+) T cells with significantly higher expression levels of CD38 and particularly CD69, which have been demonstrated to be regulator T cell markers in the Friend retroviral model. The immunotherapy appears to prevent disease progression, although no protection against reinfection with LP-BM5 is generated.

After adjusting for age, sex, smoking, BMI, and proxy status, people who consumed greater proportions of their total energy intake from fresh fish had a significantly lower risk of each of the three types of cancer, and there was a significant dose-response for risk of leukemia and NHL. Those in the highest quartile for percentage of fat intake from fish were at lowest risk: leukemia odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.89; multiple myeloma OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.90; NHL OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.60-0.85; and all LH cancers combined OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61-0.81.

Information on the agricultural use of insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides; a family history of cancer; and other risk factors was obtained by interviewing 973 cases and 2,853 controls or, if deceased, their next-of-kin (37% of cases, 43% of controls). The NHL risk was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age, state of residence, type of respondent, and use of hair dye. Compared to men with no family history of cancer, the ORs (95% CIs) of NHL was 1.5 (1.3-1.8) for men with a family history of nonhematopoietic cancer, and 2.7 (1.9-3.7) for those with a history of hematopoietic cancer among first-degree relatives. This positive association was noted for each group of NHL defined according to the Working Formulation, and was most pronounced for small lymphocytic NHL. Among direct respondents, farmers who used pesticides and had a positive family history of cancer or hematopoietic cancer were not at elevated risk of NHL, compared to nonfarmers who had no family cancer history. However, among proxy respondents, ORs were elevated for farmers who had a positive family history of hematopoietic cancer and used animal insecticides (OR = 4.6; 1.9-11.2), crop insecticides (OR = 4.7; 1.6-13.4), or herbicides (OR = 4.9; 1.7-14.2), although the interaction of family history of cancer and agricultural pesticide use was not statistically significant.

Nevertheless, studies of unbalanced translocations showed several breakpoints in markers D7S480-D7S2227, which delineate a commonly altered region.

METHODS: THP-1 cells were incubated with alpha-pinene (1, 10, and 100 mg/L, for 30 min) before being stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/L, 30 min). The location of NF-kappa B p65 subunit (NF-kappa B/p65) in THP-1 cells was detected by immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). The expression of NF-kappa B/p65 in nuclei and that of I kappa B alpha in cytoplasm were measured by Western-blot analysis. RESULTS: The majority of FITC-labelled NF-kappa B/p65 was located in the nuclei being stimulated with LPS. Whereas, no such fluorescence was seen in the nuclei of the groups pretreated with alpha-pinene or control cells. alpha-Pinene pretreatment decreased the NF-kappa B/p65 nuclear translocation in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, and this effect was dose-dependent, but there was no reaction in LPS-unstimulated THP-1 cells. alpha-Pinene pretreatment increased I kappa B alpha protein level in cytoplasm, compared with that in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. CONCLUSION: In a dose-related fashion, alpha-pinene inhibits the nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B induced by LPS in THP-1 cells, and this effect is partly due to the upregulation of I kappa B alpha expression.",,"['Zhou, Jian-ya', 'Tang, Fa-di', 'Mao, Guo-gen', 'Bian, Ru-lian']","['Zhou JY', 'Tang FD', 'Mao GG', 'Bian RL']","['Zhejiang Respiratory Drugs Research Laboratory of State Drugs Administration of China, and Department of Respiratory MEdicine, First Affiliated Hospital, Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310031, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Bicyclic Monoterpenes)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'JPF3YI7O34 (alpha-pinene)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Bicyclic Monoterpenes', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eucalyptus/chemistry', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Monoterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Protein Transport', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",,2004/04/07 05:00,2004/08/11 05:00,['2004/04/07 05:00'],"['2004/04/07 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/11 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/07 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2004 Apr;25(4):480-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies demonstrated that induction of apoptosis and cell cycle blockade are typical biologic effects observed in tumor cells after proteasome inhibition. The proteasome is responsible for the degradation of a variety of intracellular proteins and plays a key role in the regulation of many cellular processes. The aim of the present work was therefore to explore the effects of ajoene on the proteasome activities. In vitro activities of 20S proteasome purified from human erythrocytes on fluorogenic peptide substrates specific for trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and peptidylglutamyl peptide hydrolyzing activities revealed that ajoene inhibited the trypsin-like activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further, the ability of 20S proteasome to degrade the OVA(51-71) peptide, a model proteasomal substrate, was partially but significantly inhibited by ajoene. In addition, when human leukemia cell line HL60 was treated with ajoene, both trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activities were affected, cells arrested in G2/M phase and total amount of cytosolic proteasome increased. All these data clearly indicate that ajoene may affect proteasome function and activity both in vitro and in the living cell.

Among them, somatic hypermutation of the IgH gene variable region (VH gene) is a powerful tool for detection of B cell differentiation. B-cells and B-cell neoplasms have been divided into following; 1) pre-GC B-cells and neoplasms with a germline VH gene and 2) GC and post-GC B-cells and neoplasms with a somatically mutated VH gene. In this article, we review normal B-cell differentiation and histogenesis of various types of B-cell neoplasms on the aspect of somatic mutation of the rearranged VH gene. In particular, differences between CD5+ and CD5- B-cell neoplasms, using our own data of over 100 cases with B-cell neoplasms, are discussed. Although CD5+ B-cells are included in pre-GC B-cells for the reason of germline VH gene in most of CD5+ B-cells, an about 5% of CD5+ B-cells show somatically mutated VH gene. The rearranged VH gene of CD5+ B-cell neoplasms shows heterogeneity, whereas CD5- B-cell neoplasms possess somatically mutated VH gene with a mean of 8 approximately 12%. Both CD5+ B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and CD5+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma display that about half of cases show a germline or low frequency of somatic mutation and the others possess somatically mutated VH gene. CD5+ mantle cell lymphoma constitutes most cases with germline and a small number of cases with mutated VH gene. Therefore, CD5- B-cells & CD5- B-cell neoplasms are distinct from CD5+ B-cells and CD5+ B-cell neoplasms in somatic mutation of VH gene.

PLZF has been reported to have pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative activity both in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Using a modified subtractive hybridization, we identified PLZF as an androgen-responsive gene in the rat ventral prostate. Northern blot and Western blot were used to characterize the regulation of PLZF by androgens in LNCaP cells. Stable transfections of PLZF in LNCaP cells were performed to assay the effect of PLZF overexpression on LNCaP cell proliferation. RESULTS: PLZF mRNA was transiently up-regulated by androgens in the regressed ventral prostate of castrated adult rat. PLZF was also up-regulated by androgens, at both mRNA and protein levels, in the androgen-responsive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Androgen induction of PLZF mRNA was not inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide but inhibited by androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide, indicating that PLZF is a direct androgen-responsive gene. To study the functions of PLZF in androgen action, LNCaP sublines stably overexpressing PLZF were generated. PLZF overexpression inhibited LNCaP proliferation either in the presence or absence of androgen, which is consistent with the reported anti-proliferative activity of PLZF. CONCLUSIONS: The above observations indicate that PLZF is an androgen-responsive gene with anti-proliferative activity in prostate cancer cells.","['Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Jiang, Feng', 'Wang, Zhou']","['Jiang F', 'Wang Z']","['Department of Urology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prostate,The Prostate,8101368,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Androgens/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Prostate/*physiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2004/04/06 05:00,2004/06/17 05:00,['2004/04/06 05:00'],"['2004/04/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pros.20000 [doi]'],ppublish,Prostate. 2004 Jun 1;59(4):426-35. doi: 10.1002/pros.20000.,,,"['P50 CA90386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK51193/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of Spi-1 in proerythroblasts blocks their differentiation. We have shown that Spi-1 promotes the use of the proximal 5'-splice site during the E1A pre-mRNA splicing and interferes with the effect of TLS (Translocated in LipoSarcoma) in this splicing assay. TLS was identified from chromosomal translocations in human liposarcoma and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we determine the function of Spi-1 domains in splicing and in the interference with TLS. In transient transfection assays in erythroid cells, we show that the DNA binding domain cooperates with the transactivation domain or the PEST region of Spi-1 to modify the function of TLS in splicing. Interestingly, the 27 C-terminal amino acids, which determine the DNA binding activity of Spi-1, are necessary for the splicing function of Spi-1 as well as for its ability to interfere with TLS. Finally, we demonstrate that in leukemic proerythroblasts overexpressing Spi-1, TLS has lost its splicing effect.

Line 6(3) strain chickens are resistant to ALV tumorigenesis, largely failing to develop Myc-transformed follicles, although they show similar levels of ALV infection and integration as lymphoma-susceptible strains. Immunohistochemical analysis determined that the transformed follicles that do arise in lymphoma-resistant birds show much lower and more variable Myc overexpression than those of susceptible birds. This reduced Myc overexpression fails to block B-cell differentiation in resistant birds, while high Myc consistently blocks development at a late embryo stage in susceptible birds. This failure of Myc to block differentiation results in a normal pattern of posthatching bursal emigration in resistant transformed follicles, while transformed follicles of susceptible birds grow rapidly due to blocked emigration. Forced Myc overexpression produces transformed follicles in resistant birds, indicating that resistant lymphocytes can tolerate high Myc expression.

Of the 10 (6.2%) sarcoma cases, there was one case each of leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, malignant nerve sheath tumor, poorly differentiated sarcoma, reticulum cell sarcoma, dendritic cell sarcoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. The oral mucosa was involved in all of cases. Isolated oral ulcerations were the first sign in 45% of the cases. Diffuse and persistent oral ulcerations with a progressive course could be a sign of malignancy, either recognized or occult. In the absence of a clear diagnosis, malignancy should be suspected and extensive work-up performed. The full spectrum of signs of PNP may not be present initially. Repeated biopsies, direct and indirect immunofluorescence as well as screening indirect immunofluorescence on murine bladder are required for diagnosis. Clinicians should be highly suspicious when signs and symptoms suggestive of PNP are present in cancer patients, of hematologic and non-hematologic origin.",,"['Kaplan, Ilana', 'Hodak, Emmilia', 'Ackerman, Lehavit', 'Mimouni, Daniel', 'Anhalt, Grant J', 'Calderon, Shlomo']","['Kaplan I', 'Hodak E', 'Ackerman L', 'Mimouni D', 'Anhalt GJ', 'Calderon S']","['Department of Dermatology, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus, Petach Tiqva, Israel. ikaplan@post.tau.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Oral Oncol,Oral oncology,9709118,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*complications', 'Breast Neoplasms/*complications', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/complications/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Cysts/complications', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*complications', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*complications/pathology', 'Pemphigus/*complications/pathology']",93,2004/04/06 05:00,2004/10/06 09:00,['2004/04/06 05:00'],"['2003/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2003/09/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2004/04/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/10/06 09:00 [medline]', '2004/04/06 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.oraloncology.2003.09.020 [doi]', 'S1368837503002227 [pii]']",ppublish,Oral Oncol. 2004 Jul;40(6):553-62. doi: 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2003.09.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first cycle was non- rhTPO-treated cycle as control, in the second cycle rhTPO of the dosage of 1.0 microg.kg(-1).d(-1) was administered subcutaneously 6-24 hours after the beginning of chemotherapy for at most 14 days. Laboratory tests including complete blood counts, urinalysis, serum chemistry, coagulant test, chest radiography, and electrocardiography were made. Serum samples were screened for anti-rhTPO antibodies. RESULTS: In rhTPO-treated cycle, the platelet count was higher [the mean minimal platelet count was 13 x 10(9)/L, significantly higher than that of the control cycle (12 x 10(9)/L, P = 0.002), the mean maximal platelet count was 186 x 10(9) cells/L, significantly higher than that of the control cycle (122 x 10(9)/L, P < 0.001)].

The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR), can reactivate these silent TSGs and is an interesting agent to investigate for therapy of leukemia. It has been reported that the effectiveness of 5-AZA-CdR to reactivate TSG can be enhanced by inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDIs). HDIs can convert a compact chromatin structure to an open configuration that facilitates gene expression. An interesting HDI is phenylbutyrate (PB), which has shown some clinical activity for the therapy of leukemia. In this report we have investigated the antineoplastic activity of 5-AZA-CdR and PB alone and in combination on murine L1210 lymphoid leukemic cells. The in vitro treatment of 5-AZA-CdR and PB in combination produced a greater inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis, and also a greater reduction on colony formation on both L1210 and human HL-60 leukemic cells as compared to either drug alone. The combination also produced a synergistic activation of the TSG, p15CDN2B, in the L1210 cells. In mice with L1210 leukemia the combination showed enhanced antineoplastic activity. We also observed an enhancement of the antineoplastic activity of this combination in mice with L1210 leukemia.

Of 66 patients with hematologic malignancies, excluding multiple myeloma who received an allogeneic or autologous HSC transplant, paraproteins were detected in 12 patients using immunoelectrophoresis. None of the patients showed paraproteinemia before HSC transplantation. The class of paraproteins most commonly seen was IgG. In 9 of these 12 patients (75%), a paraprotein was detected continuously after HSC transplantation for an average duration of 464 days, while others demonstrated a transient appearance of the protein. Paraproteinemia after HSC transplantation was not related to the stem cell source, (allograft vs. autograft), age, gender, viral infection and graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). None of the patients developed plasma cell dyscrasia after the appearance of the paraprotein, while 1 patient developed secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Junctional regions of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes provide the best tool to study clonality, lineage association and minimal residual disease (MRD) in T-ALL. In this study, we have analyzed the suitability of clonal TCR gamma and delta junctional gene rearrangement status of T-ALL patients at diagnosis as a prognostic marker for T-ALL. We studied peripheral blood samples of 50 newly diagnosed patients with T-ALL in India for incidence of clonal TCR gamma and delta junctional region gene rearrangements by PCR-coupled heteroduplex analysis. Of these, 17 T-ALL patients uniformly treated on MCP 841 protocol were followed for more than 40 months (range: 41.26-55.82 months; mean: 49.26) and their clonal TCRgammadelta genotype was correlated with clinical outcome with respect to duration of complete remission, disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free survival. We also compared the clinical and biological features of TCRgammadelta + T-ALL and TCRalphabeta + T-ALL for their relative order of significance. Thirty per cent (15 of 50) of Indian T-ALL patients exhibited clonal rearrangements of both TCR gamma and delta genes. A significant proportion of these patients (73.3%, 11 of 15 P < 0.005) showed predominant usage of VgammaI-Jgamma1.3/2.3 with Vdelta1-Jdelta1 genes. A statistically significant association of L2 and L1 FAB blast morphology with TCRgammadelta + T-ALL and TCRalphabeta + T-ALL, respectively was observed (P = 0.001 by Fisher's Exact Test). The survival rate in DFS group was higher for TCRgammadelta + T-ALL compared to TCRalphabeta + T-ALL (P = 0.1378 by Log rank test). Thus we have identified clonal TCR gamma and delta junctional gene rearrangement status of T-ALL patients at diagnosis as a prognostic marker and predictor of response to chemotherapy.

The purpose of this study was to determine the dose of pentostatin (dCF) that could be combined with chlorambucil and prednisone to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), evaluate the toxicity of the resulting regimen and to estimate its efficacy. This was a multi-institutional Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) phase I-II study. Individuals with active B-CLL were eligible if they had no prior treatment or were in sensitive first relapse, provided they had normal renal and hepatic function. Pentostatin was evaluated in combination with orally administered chlorambucil 30 mg/m2 and prednisone 80 mg/day, 1-5 of each 14-day cycle. The pentostatin dose was 2 mg/m2 IV, day 1 for the first 6 patients; 3 mg/m2 IV, day 1 for the next 6 patients; and 4 mg/m2 IV, day 1 for the last set of 6 patients. Fifty-five patients were entered. Because of increasing toxicity with no apparent improvement in clinical efficacy on escalation of the pentostatin dose, 2 mg/m2 was chosen as the phase II dose, and 43 patients were treated at this level. Thirty-nine of these patients were eligible, of which 38 were evaluable for response, 36 of these 38 had no prior treatment. Complete response (CR) manifested by normal bone marrow morphology, peripheral blood counts and resolution of any lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly occurred in 17 patients (45%). The overall objective response rate was 87%. The median response duration was 33 months and the median survival 5 years. The median time to treatment failure is 32 months. Severe (Grade 3+) infections were seen in 31% of patients and included bacterial pneumonia (n = 4), Pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 1), fungal pneumonia (n = 2), urinary tract infection with sepsis (n = 1) and Herpes Zoster (n = 5). Overall, 11 patients had H. Zoster while on study. Due to toxicity, 33% of patients stopped therapy. Pentostatin, chlorambucil and prednisone is a highly active regimen in CLL but cannot be recommended in present form because of an unacceptable incidence of opportunistic infections. These findings add to other recent reports which suggest combination therapy with pentostatin and alkylators are active in B-CLL.

Since survival is poor once relapse occurs, new genetic tools above karyotype at diagnosis are needed to predict leukemia free survival. Recently, Flt3/ITD has been reported as an independent marker for clinical outcome in most studies concerning adult AML patients. To assess the prognostic relevance of activating mutations of Flt3, pretreatment samples of 100 not-M3 AML patients, all of them subjected to an intensive chemotherapy regimen, were analyzed for Flt3/ITD; 25/100 patients had one or more Flt3-ITD. Flt3/ITD patients had higher WBC count (P = 0.005), a lower incidence of a preceding MDS (P = 0.004) and most of them had a normal karyotype. Flt3/ITD had no impact on CR achievement while karyotype remained the most powerful prognostic factor (HR 2.8 95% CI 1.2 6.3). However, post-remission outcome was significantly worsened by the presence of Flt3/ITD. Median RFS of the Flt3/ITD patients was 5 vs. 27 months compared to the patients with wild-type Flt3 (P = 0.0002); moreover, Flt3/ITD patients had a significantly poorer post-remission survival (11 vs. 38 months, P = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, the presence of Flt3-ITD significantly affected relapse free survival and post-remission survival (HR 3.1 and 2.1, respectively).

Prognostic models based mostly on pretreatment factors have been established and attempt to identify good- and poor-prognosis patients to assign them to risk-adapted therapies. Although achievement of a complete response (CR) is still the most significant clinical endpoint for survival, criteria for CR are arbitrarily defined. Besides the questionable numerical cut-off points that characterize CR, remission is not an all-or-none phenomenon. The shorter the time to CR, the better is the long-term outcome in chemotherapy-treated patients. Response during therapy can thus supplement pretreatment prognostic information. Shorter time to platelet recovery in patients achieving CR has been demonstrated to be associated with longer overall and disease-free survival in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), including Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Focusing on hematpoietic recovery may reflect a multitude of biological processes that occur during response to therapy and provide important information about the host's ability to fight and contain residual leukemic cells.

Several studies have established a time frame for the development of ALL which could lead to the identification of specific exposures linked to leukemogenesis from the generation of the initial leukemic clone until clinical diagnosis. Utilizing newborn screening ('Guthrie') cards, leukemic clones have been detected retrospectively in dried blood spots using two different PCR-based approaches: (i) the amplification of patient/leukemia-specific breakpoint fusion sequences of rearranged oncogenes; and (ii) the amplification of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) or T cell receptor (TcR) gene rearrangements. These studies support the hypothesis that a large proportion of childhood ALL cases arise in utero. In several studies, a long latency period from the generation in utero of the initial ALL clone to clinical diagnosis, indicates that additional genetic events are required for the full development of the leukemia phenotype, potentially from postnatal exposures (e.g. infections).

Many of those affected, usually by point mutations in one allele, are predisposed to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adult life. The RUNX1 protein complexes with core binding factor beta (CBFB) to form a heterodimeric core binding transcription factor (CBF) that regulates many genes important in hematopoiesis. RUNX1 was first identified as the gene on chromosome 21 that is rearranged by the translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22.12) recurrently found in the leukemic cells of patients with AML. In addition to the t(8;21), RUNX1 is rearranged with one of several partner genes on other chromosomes by somatically acquired translocations associated with hematological malignancies. Point mutations of RUNX1 are also found in sporadic leukemias to reinforce the important position of this gene on the multi-step path to leukemia. In animal models, at least one functional copy of RUNX1 is required to effect definitive embryonic hematopoiesis. Cells expressing dominant-negative mutants of RUNX1 are readily immortalized and transformed, and those RUNX1 mutants which retain CBFB binding ability may possess dominant-negative function. However, in some families there is transmitted one mutated allele of RUNX1 with no dominant-negative function, demonstrating that simple haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 predisposes to AML and also causes a generalized hematopoietic stem cell disorder most recognizable as thrombocytopenia.",,"['Ganly, Peter', 'Walker, Logan C', 'Morris, Christine M']","['Ganly P', 'Walker LC', 'Morris CM']","['Cancer Genetics Research Group, Christchurch School of Medicine and Health Sciences, PO Box 4345, Christchurch, New Zealand. peter.ganly@cdhb.govt.nz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",77,2004/04/06 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2004/04/06 05:00'],"['2004/04/06 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/06 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000139611 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2004 Jan;45(1):1-10. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000139611.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventeen patients were not treated before donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), eight patients received interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and five underwent chemotherapy. The method of DLI was the bulk dose regimen. The median time between DLIs was 6 weeks. The median number of infusions was three; the median time from transplant to relapse was 17 months and from relapse to DLI 2 months. Eleven patients (37%) were in molecular/cytogenetic relapse, 14 (47%) in chronic phase, and five (16%) in accelerated or blastic phase. Seventeen patients (57%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Chronic GVHD was observed in 15 of 24 (62%) patients. Four (13%) patients developed cytopenia after a median of 30 days. Nineteen (63%) patients achieved response, 15 of them developed GVHD. The response rate according to the disease phase was molecular or cytogenetic relapse: 91%, chronic phase: 57%, and accelerated or blastic phase: 20%. The median time to response was 6 months.

In contrast, the synthetic taxane ortataxel (BAY 59-8862, IDN-5109) is effective against Pgp-expressing cells by virtue of modulation of Pgp-mediated transport. The synthetic taxane tRA96023 also modulates Pgp and is noncytotoxic due to removal of the tubulin-binding side chain at the C-13 position of the taxane backbone. We studied the effects of ortataxel and tRA96023 on the other MDR-associated ABC transport proteins, multidrug resistance protein (MRP-1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, MXR, ABCG2). METHODS: Modulation of mitoxantrone, daunorubicin and doxorubicin retention and cytotoxicity by ortataxel and tRA96023 was studied in established cell lines overexpressing Pgp, MRP-1 and wild type (BCRP(R482)) and mutant (BCRP(R482T)) BCRP, and was compared with modulation by the established Pgp-, MRP-1- and BCRP-specific modulators PSC-833, probenecid and fumitremorgin C, respectively. RESULTS: Ortataxel effectively modulated drug retention and cytotoxicity in cell lines overexpressing MRP-1 and BCRP(R482), in addition to Pgp. tRA96023 modulated drug retention and cytotoxicity in cell lines overexpressing BCRP(R482) and Pgp, but not those overexpressing MRP-1. Neither ortataxel nor tRA96023 modulated BCRP(R482T). CONCLUSIONS: The synthetic taxane derivatives ortataxel and tRA96023 are broad-spectrum ABC protein modulators.

However, the mechanism of hepatotoxicity induced by these drugs remains obscure. We have investigated the relationship of a rise in aminotransferase levels to erythrocyte levels of methotrexate and its polyglutamates, 6-thioguanine nucleotides, the major cytotoxic metabolites of 6-mercaptopurine, and methylated metabolites of 6-mercaptopurine generated by thiopurine methyltransferase in competition with the formation of 6-thioguanine nucleotides. METHOD: Weighted means of alanine aminotransferase levels and metabolites of methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine were calculated from a total of 929 blood samples from 43 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during maintenance therapy with methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine. RESULTS: Weighted means of aminotransferase levels were significantly related to the average doses of 6-mercaptopurine (r(s) = 0.60, P <.001), erythrocyte levels of methylated metabolites of 6-mercaptopurine (r(s) = 0.63, P <.001), and thiopurine methyltransferase activity (r(s) = 0.32, P =.03). Weighted means of aminotransferase levels were negatively correlated with erythrocyte levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides and were not related to the average doses of methotrexate or erythrocyte levels of methotrexate and its polyglutamates. CONCLUSION: It was found that 6-mercaptopurine and its methylated metabolites are correlated with the degree of hepatotoxicity during methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine maintenance therapy. Further studies are needed to explore whether aminotransferase levels could be used as a surrogate marker for methylated metabolites of 6-mercaptopurine and thus to evaluate 6-mercaptopurine treatment compliance.",,"['Nygaard, Ulrikka', 'Toft, Nina', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Nygaard U', 'Toft N', 'Schmiegelow K']","['The Pediatric Clinic II, The University Hospital of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Herein a short case report is presented. The elderly male patient had a prosthetic valve in the aortic position and also suffered from two malignant diseases: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and a more recently developed lung cancer with metastatic spread into both lungs. The patient had a major gastrointestinal bleed, leading to a sudden fall of haematocrit (0.09), and to a collapse of peripheral circulation due to too excessive a coumarol effect (International Normalized Ratio > 8). An acute left ventricular failure developed during the early period of the emergency blood transfusion, so the correction of prothrombin time by fresh-frozen plasma (due to the large volume requirement) was not feasible. The patient received 50 microg/kg intravenous bolus of NovoSeven (recombinant active factor VII) in an almost desperate situation. The International Normalized Ratio changed to 2.1 in 30 min; bleeding had stopped immediately. There was neither evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (in spite of the age and underlying diseases) nor loss of valve patency or infective endocarditis during follow-up.

The present study analyses the presence of circulating activated platelets, using simultaneously flow cytometry and aggregometric studies in MPD. We studied 28 patients: 13 with polycythaemia vera, seven with essential thrombocythaemia, and eight chronic myeloid leukaemia. We performed functional tests, aggregation and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release and flow cytometric assays (mepacrine staining and platelet activation markers CD62, CD63 and fibrinogen binding (B-FG)). Twenty-one MPD samples (75%) had reduced aggregation and ATP release. Acquired delta-SPD was detected in 11 of 28 MPD patients (39%), and we found no association between reduced mepacrine labelling and abnormal ATP release. High levels of activation markers were obtained: CD62 in 19 of 28 patients (68%), CD63 in 13 of 28 patients (46%) and B-FG in 19 of 28 patients (68%). The most prevalent abnormality was a reduced aggregation and ATP release. The lack of association between ATP release and mepacrine labelling suggests that other mechanisms, besides the deficit of intraplatelet ATP/adenosine diphosphate, might occur.

The need to track environmentally mediated chronic diseases is increasingly recognized. Trends in childhood illnesses are 1 element of a framework for children's environmental health indicators, which also includes trends in contaminants in the environment and in concentrations of contaminants in bodies of children and their mothers. This article presents data on 3 groups of important childhood diseases or disorders that seem to be caused or exacerbated, at least in part, by exposure to environmental agents and for which nationally representative data are available. They are asthma, childhood cancers, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Data were used from the National Health Interview Survey for asthma and neurodevelopmental disorders; the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program for childhood cancer incidence; and the National Vital Statistics System for childhood cancer mortality. The prevalence of children with asthma doubled between 1980 and 1995, from 3.6% in 1980 to 7.5% in 1995. The annual incidence of childhood cancer increased from 1975 until approximately 1990 and seems to have become fairly stable since. Childhood cancer mortality has declined substantially during the past 25 years. Incidence of certain types of cancers has increased since 1974, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, central nervous system tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Dust on a parent's work clothes has transported a hazard at work to a hazard at home (lead, asbestos, and chlordecone). Causality is established by showing a dose-response effect and reproducing the effect in studies of other exposed groups or by using another epidemiologic method, eg, prospective instead of retrospective study. Also, the findings should be biologically plausible and not attributable to a concomitant variable such as cigarette smoking. Contrary to front-page newspaper headlines, incidence rates for childhood leukemia are not rising. Preserving specimens for future studies has been valuable: blood from people who were exposed to dioxin in Seveso, Italy; mummified umbilical cords containing methyl mercury at Minamata Bay, Japan; and Guthrie dried blood spots to screen retrospectively for 43 genetic disorders and a specific prenatal cytogenetic abnormality in some children with 1 form of leukemia.

PML bodies are one of the most prominent nuclear substructures which have been implicated in transcription regulation during apoptosis and stress responses. Bach2 is a member of the BTB-basic region leucine zipper factor family and represses transcription activity directed by the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, the Maf recognition element, and the antioxidant-responsive element. Bach2 forms nuclear foci associated with PML bodies upon oxidative stress. Here, we demonstrate that transcription activity associated with PML bodies is selectively repressed by the recruitment of Bach2 around PML bodies. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments revealed that Bach2 showed rapid turnover in the nuclear foci. The Bach2 N-terminal region including the BTB domain is essential for the focus formation. Sumoylation of Bach2 is required for the recruitment of the protein around PML bodies.

However, the molecular mechanisms used by myeloid tumor cells to escape apoptosis are not fully understood. Here we report that Myc/Raf-transformed macrophages require the transcription factor C/EBP beta to prevent cell death. In contrast to wild-type cells, C/EBP beta(-/-) macrophages were completely dependent on macrophage colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor for survival and displayed impaired tumorigenicity in vivo. Microarray analysis revealed that C/EBP beta-deficient cells expressed significantly reduced levels of the prosurvival factor insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Overexpression of C/EBP beta stimulated transcription from the IGF-I promoter, indicating that IGF-I is a direct transcriptional target of C/EBP beta. Serological neutralization of IGF-I in C/EBP beta(+/+) tumor cell cultures induced apoptosis, showing that IGF-I functions as an autocrine survival factor in these cells. Macrophage tumor cells derived from IGF-I(-/-) mice were GF dependent, similar to C/EBP beta-deficient cells. Forced expression of either C/EBP beta or IGF-I in C/EBP beta(-/-) bone marrow cells restored Myc/Raf-induced transformation and permitted neoplastic growth without exogenous GFs. Thus, our findings demonstrate that C/EBP beta is essential for oncogenic transformation of macrophages and functions at least in part by regulating expression of the survival factor IGF-I.",,"['Wessells, Jennifer', 'Yakar, Shoshana', 'Johnson, Peter F']","['Wessells J', 'Yakar S', 'Johnson PF']","['Eukaryotic Transcriptional Regulation Section, Laboratory of Protein Dynamics and Signaling, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",,2004/04/03 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/04/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.24.8.3238-3250.2004 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2004 Apr;24(8):3238-50. doi: 10.1128/MCB.24.8.3238-3250.2004.,,,,,PMC381667,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here describe the functional regulation of TEL via ERK pathways. Overexpressed TEL becomes phosphorylated in vivo by activated ERK. TEL is also directly phosphorylated in vitro by ERK. The inducible phosphorylation sites are Ser(213) and Ser(257). TEL binds to a common docking domain in ERK. In vivo ERK-dependent phosphorylation reduces trans-repressional and DNA-binding abilities of TEL for ETS-binding sites. A mutant carrying substituted glutamates on both Ser(213) and Ser(257) functionally mimics hyperphosphorylated TEL and also shows a dominant-negative effect on TEL-induced transcriptional suppression. Losing DNA-binding affinity through phosphorylation but heterodimerizing with unmodified TEL could be an underlying mechanism. Moreover, the glutamate mutant dominantly interferes with TEL-induced erythroid differentiation in MEL cells and growth suppression in NIH 3T3 cells. Finally, endogenous TEL is dephosphorylated in parallel with ERK inactivation in differentiating MEL cells and is phosphorylated through ERK activation in Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells.

We describe the design, structural characterization, immunogenicity, and neutralizing potential of antibodies elicited by conformational peptides derived from the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) gp21 envelope glycoprotein spanning residues 347-374. We used a novel template design and a unique synthetic approach to construct two peptides (WCCR2T and CCR2T) that would each assemble into a triple helical coiled coil conformation mimicking the gp21 crystal structure. The peptide B-cell epitopes were grafted onto the epsilon side chains of three lysyl residues on a template backbone construct consisting of the sequence acetyl-XGKGKGKGCONH2 (where X represents the tetanus toxoid promiscuous T cell epitope (TT) sequence 580-599). Leucine substitutions were introduced at the a and d positions of the CCR2T sequence to maximize helical character and stability as shown by circular dichroism and guanidinium hydrochloride studies. Serum from an HTLV-1-infected patient was able to recognize the selected epitopes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Mice immunized with the wild-type sequence (WCCR2T) and the mutant sequence (CCR2T) elicited high antibody titers that were capable of recognizing the native protein as shown by flow cytometry and whole virus ELISA. Sera and purified antibodies from immunized mice were able to reduce the formation of syncytia induced by the envelope glycoprotein of HTLV-1, suggesting that antibodies directed against the coiled coil region of gp21 are capable of disrupting cell-cell fusion.

Prior exposure of Jurkat lymphoblastic leukemia cells to a marginally toxic concentration of MS-275 (e.g., 500 nM) for 24 h sharply increased mitochondrial injury, caspase activation, and apoptosis in response to a minimally toxic concentration of fludarabine (500 nM), resulting in highly synergistic antileukemic interactions and loss of clonogenic survival. Simultaneous exposure to MS-275 and fludarabine also led to synergistic effects, but these were not as pronounced as observed with sequential treatment. Similar interactions were noted in the case of (a) other human leukemia cell lines (e.g., U937, CCRF-CEM); (b) other HDAC inhibitors (e.g., sodium butyrate); and (c) other nucleoside analogues (e.g., 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, gemcitabine). Potentiation of fludarabine lethality by MS-275 was associated with acetylation of histones H3 and H4, down-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and Mcl-1, enhanced cytosolic release of proapoptotic mitochondrial proteins (e.g., cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, and apoptosis-inducing factor), and caspase activation. It was also accompanied by the caspase-dependent down-regulation of p27(KIP1), cyclins A, E, and D(1), and cleavage and diminished phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein. However, increased lethality of the combination was not associated with enhanced fludarabine triphosphate formation or DNA incorporation and occurred despite a slight reduction in the S-phase fraction. Prior exposure to MS-275 attenuated fludarabine-mediated activation of MEK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt, and enhanced c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase phosphorylation; furthermore, inducible expression of constitutively active MEK1/2 or Akt significantly diminished MS-275/fludarabine-induced lethality. Combined exposure of cells to MS-275 and fludarabine was associated with a significant increase in generation of reactive oxygen species; moreover, both the increase in reactive oxygen species and apoptosis were largely attenuated by coadministration of the free radical scavenger L-N-acetylcysteine. Finally, prior administration of MS-275 markedly potentiated fludarabine-mediated generation of the proapoptotic lipid second messenger ceramide. Taken together, these findings indicate that the HDAC inhibitor MS-275 induces multiple perturbations in signal transduction, survival, and cell cycle regulatory pathways that lower the threshold for fludarabine-mediated mitochondrial injury and apoptosis in human leukemia cells. They also provide insights into possible mechanisms by which novel, clinically relevant HDAC inhibitors might be used to enhance the antileukemic activity of established nucleoside analogues such as fludarabine.",,"['Maggio, Sonia C', 'Rosato, Roberto R', 'Kramer, Lora B', 'Dai, Yun', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Paik, David S', 'Czarnik, Ann C', 'Payne, Shawn G', 'Spiegel, Sarah', 'Grant, Steven']","['Maggio SC', 'Rosato RR', 'Kramer LB', 'Dai Y', 'Rahmani M', 'Paik DS', 'Czarnik AC', 'Payne SG', 'Spiegel S', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)', '1ZNY4FKK9H (entinostat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,2004/04/03 05:00,2004/05/20 05:00,['2004/04/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2631 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Res. 2004 Apr 1;64(7):2590-600. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.can-03-2631.,,,"['CA 100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DIF-1 at 10-40 micro M dose-dependently suppressed cell growth and increased the intracellular cyclic AMP concentration in K562 leukemia cells.

Little is known about the overall levels of CpG island methylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). To provide a baseline estimate of global aberrant methylation and identify target sequences for additional investigation, we performed Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning on 10 CLL samples. Two methylation-sensitive landmark enzymes were used (NotI and AscI), allowing assessment of over 3000 CpG islands in each sample. Tumor-derived Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning profiles were compared with profiles from CD19-selected B cells from normal volunteers and matched normal neutrophils from 4 CLL patients. We found 2.5-8.1% (mean 4.8%) of the CpG islands in CLL samples were aberrantly methylated compared with controls, and the methylation events had a nonrandom distribution (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, we identified 193 aberrantly methylated sequences, of which 93% have CpG island characteristics and 90% have homology to genes or expressed sequences. One such gene, the G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (GRM7), possibly inhibits cyclic AMP signaling in the induction of apoptosis. Bisulfite sequencing of GRM7 confirmed extensive CpG island methylation, and treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) resulted in up-regulated expression of several genes in vitro with concurrent cellular depletion of DNMT1 protein.

Using methylated CpG amplification-representation difference analysis, we identified a DNA fragment corresponding to the Tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) promoter-associated CpG island as one of the genes hypermethylated in the leukemia cell line K562. Because TIG1 has been proposed to act as a tumor suppressor, we tested the hypothesis that cytosine methylation of the TIG1 promoter suppresses its expression and causes a loss of responsiveness to retinoic acid in some neoplastic cells. We examined TIG1 methylation and expression status in 53 human cancer cell lines and 74 primary tumors, including leukemia and head and neck, breast, colon, skin, brain, lung, and prostate cancer. Loss of TIG1 expression was strongly associated with TIG1 promoter hypermethylation (P < 0.001). There was no correlation between TIG1 promoter methylation and that of retinoid acid receptor beta2 (RARbeta2), another retinoic-induced putative tumor suppressor gene (P = 0.78). Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine for 5 days restored TIG1 expression in all eight silenced cell lines tested. TIG1 expression was also inducible by treatment with 1 micro M all-trans-retinoic acid for 3 days except in densely methylated cell lines. Treatment of the K562 leukemia cells with demethylating agent combined with all-trans-retinoic acid induced apoptosis.

Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3-zeta subunits of the TCR is an initial step in the transduction of signaling cascades. However, zeta phosphorylation is also promoted by ZAP-70, as TCR-induced zeta phosphorylation is defective in ZAP-70-deficient T cells. We show that this defect is corrected by stable expression of ZAP-70, but not Syk, in primary and transformed T cells. Indeed, these proteins are differentially coupled to the TCR with a 5- to 10-fold higher association of ZAP-70 with zeta as compared to Syk. Low-level Syk-zeta binding is associated with significantly less Lck coupled to the TCR. Moreover, diminished coupling of Lck to zeta correlates with a poor phosphorylation of the positive regulatory tyr352 residue of Syk. Thus, recruitment of Lck into the TCR complex with subsequent zeta chain phosphorylation is promoted by ZAP-70 but not Syk. Importantly, the presence of ZAP-70 positively regulates the TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. The interplay between Syk and ZAP-70 in thymocytes, certain T cells, and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, in which they are coexpressed, will therefore modulate the amplitude of antigen-mediated receptor signaling.",,"['Steinberg, Marcos', 'Adjali, Oumeya', 'Swainson, Louise', 'Merida, Peggy', 'Di Bartolo, Vincenzo', 'Pelletier, Ludivine', 'Taylor, Naomi', 'Noraz, Nelly']","['Steinberg M', 'Adjali O', 'Swainson L', 'Merida P', 'Di Bartolo V', 'Pelletier L', 'Taylor N', 'Noraz N']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite de Recherches 5535/Institut Federatife de Recherche, F-34293 Montpellier 5, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (antigen T cell receptor, zeta chain)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Enzyme Precursors/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Subunits/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Syk Kinase', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase']",,2004/04/03 05:00,2004/08/31 05:00,['2004/04/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/08/31 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-12-4314 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)43604-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2004 Aug 1;104(3):760-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-12-4314.

In this work, we show that alloimmune-mediated mechanisms induce mast cell activation and expression of CC chemokines in remodeling rat tracheal allografts. Decreased expression of rat mast cell protease (RMCP) I and II, in concert with tryptase release in tracheal allografts, identified degranulation of stored serine proteases as an early mast cell response to allotransplantation. Transient upregulation of c-Kit expression occurred in a synchronous manner, suggesting that c-Kit receptor signaling controls mast cell responses. Increased expression of CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 2 and CCL3 by RMCP I-positive cells identified mast cells as epithelial and mesenchymal sources of chemoattractant chemokines in allograft airways. Cyclosporin A immunosuppression both attenuated and delayed these changes in mast cell phenotypes. Incubation of rat basophil leukemia 2H3 cells with CCL2 or CCL3 decreased surface c-Kit expression, an effect blocked by protease inhibitors. By controlling surface receptor availability, CC chemokines may regulate c-Kit signaling via a novel proteolytic mechanism.

AML is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults, particularly in individuals over 60 years of age; AML also accounts for 15-20% of childhood leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of relevant studies published in the English language. Economic analyses of AML published between 1990 and 2002 were identified from electronic data sources using broad search criteria. Additional studies were obtained by manual searches of bibliographies of articles identified in the electronic searches. Articles were screened for relevance and included if the main theme included some element of AML cost of treatment, cost drivers, or cost-effectiveness. Studies reporting only drug prices without a formal comparison or analysis were not included. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included in the review. Although information was limited on the comprehensive economic burden of AML from a societal perspective, the costs appear to be split equally between direct and indirect costs. Direct costs of AML from a public payer perspective were available for a few countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, US (Medicare), and Italy. These studies found that the key cost drivers appear to be hospitalization length of stay related to initial chemotherapy, relapse of disease, and bone marrow transplant (BMT) and peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). Several cost analyses have been published comparing the different treatment strategies; however, most of them were published in the early 1990s, and their analysis revolved around cost-comparison rather than comprehensive cost-effectiveness. The published studies investigated pharmacological agents (e.g., idarubicin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, fludarabine and combination therapies), as well as BMT, PBSCT, and the treatment of complications. CONCLUSION: Studies addressing the economic costs and burden of AML are relatively sparse in the international literature. Possible reasons for such a lack of information appear to include the low incidence rate of AML (e.g., about 260,000 new cases were reported in 2002 in the world) and the fact that it primarily afflicts older adults >60 years of age, making broad, well-designed economic analyses a challenge for most researchers. However, due to the high cost associated with the medical procedures (e.g., BMT, PBSCT) and the aging of the world population, further research is warranted.",,"['Redaelli, Alberto', 'Botteman, Marc F', 'Stephens, Jennifer M', 'Brandt, Suzanne', 'Pashos, Chris L']","['Redaelli A', 'Botteman MF', 'Stephens JM', 'Brandt S', 'Pashos CL']","['Global Outcomes Research-Oncology, Pharmacia Corporation, Via Robert Koch 1.2, 20152 Milan, Italy. alberto.redaelli@pharmacia.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Legislation', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*economics/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/economics', 'Cost Savings', '*Cost of Illness', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay/economics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*economics/therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'United States']",29,2004/04/03 05:00,2004/05/12 05:00,['2004/04/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/12 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1016/j.ctrv.2003.11.002 [doi]', 'S0305737203002056 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2004 May;30(3):237-47. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2003.11.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 18 patients who received HLA compatible NST were evaluated. Peripheral blood and bone marrow were collected before and after transplantation at different time. DNA was extracted using QIAmp blood mini kit. Nine different STR markers were co-amplified in a single reaction by commercial AmpF/STR profiler plus PCR amplification kit. Separation of the PCR products and fluorescence detection were performed with ABI prism 310 genetic analyzer with capillary electrophoresis. Genescan and genotype software were used for size calling and quantification of peak areas. The formula to calculate donor chimerism values was based on different allelic distribution types between the donor and recipient. RESULTS: (1) Serial STR-PCR analysis revealed that donor chimerism became dominant (DC > 60%) by day 8; it preceded the detection of hematologic engraftment by an average of 4 days. It was also shown that chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients frequently had more delayed donor engraftment as compared with patients of acute leukemia or nonmalignant hematological diseases because the pretransplantation immune status of these two kinds of patients was different. (2) After NST, chimeric status had a process of conversion from the mixed chimerism (MC) to full donor chimerism (FDC). (3) The incidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD) of FDC group was higher than that of MC group (90.0% vs 62.5%). The average time between establishment of FDC and appearance of GVHD was 9 days. (4) Full donor chimerism and stable mixed chimerism with a high level of donor cells were compatible with disease free survival. On the contrary, progressive decrease of donor chimerism value was always followed by hematological relapse or graft rejection. CONCLUSIONS: Sequencial and quantitative detection of donor chimerism may be of great value to study the kinetics of engraftment of NST, to evaluate the status of engraftment, to predict the outcome and prognosis of patients posttransplant and to guide implementation of therapy at an early stage.",,"['Tang, Xiao-wen', 'Wu, De-pei', 'Xia, Xue-ming', 'Sun, Ai-ning', 'Zhu, Zi-ling', 'Ruan, Chang-geng']","['Tang XW', 'Wu DP', 'Xia XM', 'Sun AN', 'Zhu ZL', 'Ruan CG']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China. xwtang1@sina.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*Transplantation Chimera']",,2004/04/03 05:00,2004/07/23 05:00,['2004/04/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 2004 Feb;43(2):98-101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclin E was detected by Western blotting in purified B-CLL cells from peripheral blood samples of all 12 patient tested but not in normal peripheral blood B cells. While cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) expression was similar in different samples, p27 and cyclin E expression was highly variable. We further investigated the regulation of p27, cyclin E and cdk2 in an in vitro model of cycling B-CLL cells. Cyclin E and cdk2 expression was increased in B-CLL cells stimulated with a CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide and interleukin-2, while p27 expression rapidly declined. This was accompanied by the increased formation of cyclin E-cdk2 complexes, which were able to phosphorylate Histone H1 in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition of cdk2 activity with Roscovitine-inhibited thymidine incorporation and Histone H1 phosphorylation.

MMPs-2 and -9 are the principal MMPs produced by lymphocytes; these enzymes can degrade a number of matrix proteins but are the two main MMPs that digest type IV collagen, the major component of basement membranes. Therefore, these enzymes are potentially important for tissue invasion and remodelling by malignant lymphocytes. This study showed that chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells produce and secrete variable amounts of pro-MMP-9, but no MMP-2 or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). The pro-enzyme was found in monomeric and dimeric forms and also complexed with lipocalin. Moreover, a small fraction of secreted monomer became associated with the cell surface and activated upon cell adhesion to insolubilized type IV collagen. High levels of intracellular MMP-9 were associated with advanced (stage C) disease and with poor patient survival. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that MMP-9 was associated with areas of tissue invasion and remodelling.

In this study, we assess the immunogenicity and adverse events following varicella vaccination in immunosuppressed cancer children. METHODS: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-seronegative cancer children received two doses of live-attenuated VZV vaccine (Varilrix) in a span of 3 months. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were in the maintenance phase of chemotherapy, whereas those with solid tumours joined the study around 3-6 months from treatment discontinuation. VZV-specific cellular and humoral immune responses were measured before and after VZV vaccination. RESULTS: The median (range) age of the 17 patients was 4.4 yr (2.0-14.5). Thirteen had ALL, one had myelodysplastic syndrome and three had solid tumours. Following vaccination, the VZV-specific stimulation index (SI) increased from 1.7 (0.9-2.9) to 17.9 (5.9-36.0) (P < 0.001). Similarly, SI to phytohaemagglutinin mitogen increased from 1136 (499-1930) to 1714 (848-2518) (P = 0.028). There were also significant increases in CD4+ cells and CD4:CD8 ratio as well as a reduction in CD16/56+ cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Seroconversion rate to VZV was 19% after one dose and increased to 94% after the second dose of VZV vaccine. Serum VZV-specific IgG concentrations also increased significantly following two doses when compared with one dose of VZV vaccine (P = 0.0004). One subject developed possibly vaccine-related chickenpox with self-limiting hepatitis at 5 wk following vaccination. None of the patients developed herpes-zoster at a median (range) follow-up of 27.5 months (24.0-30.0). CONCLUSIONS: Non-immune cancer children can be effectively vaccinated against chickenpox at the defined period. However, the safety of chickenpox vaccine in these immunosuppressed children needs to be further studied.",['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.'],"['Leung, Ting-Fan', 'Li, Chi-Kong', 'Hung, Emily C W', 'Chan, Paul K S', 'Mo, Chi-Wai', 'Wong, Raymond P O', 'Chik, Ki-Wai']","['Leung TF', 'Li CK', 'Hung EC', 'Chan PK', 'Mo CW', 'Wong RP', 'Chik KW']","['Department of Paediatrics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR, China. leung2142@cuhk.edu.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Chickenpox/etiology/prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunization Schedule', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Safety', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/administration & dosage/immunology']",,2004/04/03 05:00,2004/05/18 05:00,['2004/04/03 05:00'],"['2004/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/05/18 05:00 [medline]', '2004/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00216.x [doi]', 'EJH216 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2004 May;72(5):353-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2004.00216.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphisms of genes encoding for xenobiotics and drug transporters are potential factors, which can influence the risk of developing ALL and its clinical outcome. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC)-family transporter involved in protection against xenobiotics and multi-drug resistance. Recently, the single-nucleotide polymorphism C3435T of MDR1 gene has been found to be associated with altered tissue expression and function of P-gp. To evaluate whether C3435T MDR1 polymorphism is associated with the occurrence and outcome of ALL, 113 children with ALL (median age 5.1 yr) and 175 healthy individuals of Polish Caucasian origin were studied by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. The mutant homozygous TT genotype was found to be associated with occurrence of ALL (OR, 95% CI; 1.8, 1.1-3.1; P = 0.037). Besides, the analysis of factors influencing clinical outcome of our ALL patient cohort showed that CC genotype carriers had significantly lower event-free survival probability (pEFS) (0.62 vs. 0.87; P = 0.007) and overall survival probability (pOS) (0.72 vs. 0.91; P = 0.006). The Cox proportional hazards model-based analysis revealed that the hazard ratios for lower pEFS and lower pOS among CC homozygous subjects were 3.9 (P = 0.008) and 3.3 (P = 0.02), respectively. In conclusion, the results of the present study provide evidence that C3435T MDR1 polymorphism may involve both the susceptibility to and the clinical outcome of childhood ALL. Carriers of the TT genotype are more at risk of developing ALL than other individuals, whereas CC genotype carriers are supposed to have worse prognosis.",['Copyright Blackwell Munksgaard 2004.'],"['Jamroziak, Krzysztof', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Balcerczak, Ewa', 'Mistygacz, Magda', 'Trelinska, Joanna', 'Mirowski, Marek', 'Bodalski, Jerzy', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Jamroziak K', 'Mlynarski W', 'Balcerczak E', 'Mistygacz M', 'Trelinska J', 'Mirowski M', 'Bodalski J', 'Robak T']","['Department of Haematology, Medical University of Lodz, ul.

Only a few investigations have focused on the prognostic significance of FLT3 alterations in AML among the elderly, yielding conflicting results. In the present study, the frequency and clinical relevance of FLT3 abnormalities were ascertained in a cohort of elderly AML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 109 AMLs, occurring in patients above the age of 60 yr (median 71.5), were investigated. DNA was extracted from fresh bone marrow cells or from cells in fixative and investigated for the presence of ITD of exons 14 and 15 and the ATKD D835 in exon 20. RESULTS: ITDs and ATKDs were identified in 20 (18%) and 11 (10%) of the cases, respectively. Three cases displayed both an ITD and an ATKD. FLT3 abnormalities were associated with leukocytosis (ITD P < 0.01; ATKD P = 0.069), and the monocytic FAB subtypes M4 and M5 [ITD (P < 0.05), ATKD (P = 0.05)], and ITD and ATKD were significantly (P < 0.05) more common in cases with a normal karyotype. There was no correlation between the presence of FLT3 abnormalities and complete remission rates or overall survival. CONCLUSION: A correlation was observed between FLT3 abnormalities and leukocytosis, a normal karyotype, and the M4/M5 subtypes of leukemia.

A retroviral vector derived from a murine stem cell virus was constructed to integrate the CD34EGFP gene into the genome of the cells for labeling. Our experiment demonstrates that the 454 bp segment upstream of the murine CD34 cDNA sequence has full function of promoter activity and can serve as a cell-specific promoter for driving the expression of EGFP in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), providing a living color for labeling stem cells. The CD34EGFP marker was tested in various types of cells, including terminally differentiated cells, CD34(+) mouse myeloid leukemia progenitor cells, CD34(-) hematopoietic cells, and CD34(+) HSCs. We show that the engineered CD34EGFP cell marker is expressed in the CD34(+) stem or progenitor cells but not in CD34(-) or terminally differentiated cells. RT-PCR assay indicates that the transcription level of the CD34EGFP gene from CD34 promoter is almost the same as that from CMV promoter in CD34(+) progenitor cells. The approach we present here offers a framework for genetic engineering of fluorescent cell markers for labeling and tracking stem cells in vivo.
