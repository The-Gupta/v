However, this technique is not sufficiently sensitive. Multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) provides a readily available and highly sensitive method to identify and quantify cPCs that could complement PB smear assessment. However, an optimal quantitative cutoff for cPCs by MFC to identify pPCL has not been established. Thus, a total of 591 patients newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients who had their PB samples evaluated morphologically by PB smear, and immunophenotypically by MFC prior to beginning therapy were evaluated. The presence of >/=200 cPCs/muL by MFC (N = 25 or 5% of the total population) was chosen to identify patients with >/=5% cPCs by PB smear with a specificity of 99% and a sensitivity of 77%. For patients with >/=200 cPCs/muL by MFC compared to the remainder of the cohort, the median Time to next therapy (TTNT) was 18 vs 30 months and the median OS was 38 vs 70 months respectively. Thus, MFC assessment of PB can be utilized in conjunction with the morphological assessment of a PB smear to aid in improving the identification of pPCL among NDMM patients.","['Evans, Laura A', 'Jevremovic, Dragan', 'Nandakumar, Bharat', 'Dispenzieri, Angela', 'Buadi, Francis K', 'Dingli, David', 'Lacy, Martha Q', 'Hayman, Suzanne R', 'Kapoor, Prashant', 'Leung, Nelson', 'Fonder, Amie', 'Hobbs, Miriam', 'Hwa, Yi Lisa', 'Muchtar, Eli', 'Warsame, Rahma', 'Kourelis, Taxiarchis V', 'Go, Ronald', 'Russell, Stephen', 'Lust, John A', 'Lin, Yi', 'Siddiqui, Mustaqeem', 'Kyle, Robert A', 'Gertz, Morie A', 'Rajkumar, S Vincent', 'Kumar, Shaji K', 'Gonsalves, Wilson I']","['Evans LA', 'Jevremovic D', 'Nandakumar B', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Buadi FK', 'Dingli D', 'Lacy MQ', 'Hayman SR', 'Kapoor P', 'Leung N', 'Fonder A', 'Hobbs M', 'Hwa YL', 'Muchtar E', 'Warsame R', 'Kourelis TV', 'Go R', 'Russell S', 'Lust JA', 'Lin Y', 'Siddiqui M', 'Kyle RA', 'Gertz MA', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Kumar SK', 'Gonsalves WI']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200326,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",2020/03/05 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2020/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25773 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Jun;95(6):637-642. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25773.

MicroRNAs have potential regulatory roles in response to chemotherapy. The goal of this study was to determine the microRNA that may have effects on the expression level of brain and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BAALC) and to investigate the in vitro and ex vivo association between their expression levels. METHODS: In silico tools were utilized to determine a putative miRNA targeting BALLC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate expression levels of BAALC and its predicted microRNA, miR-326, in bone marrow samples of 30 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 13 controls, in addition to the resistant and parental CCRF-CEM cell lines. To assess the status of response to therapy, minimal residual disease was measured using single-strand conformation polymorphism. RESULTS: MiR-326 was selected due to the strong possibility of its interaction with BAALC according to the obtained in silico results. Statistical analysis showed a significant downregulation of miR-326 and overexpression of BALLC in drug-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line and patients compared with the parental cell line and drug-sensitive patients, respectively (P = 0.015, 0.005, 0.0484 and 0.0005, respectively). The expression profiles of miR-326 and BAALC were inversely correlated (P = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: The results introduced the inversely combined expression levels of miR-326 and BAALC as a novel, independent prognostic biomarker for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = 0.007). Moreover, bioinformatics data showed a possible regulatory role for miR-326 on BAALC mRNA, which may possibly contribute to the development of drug resistance in patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Ghodousi, Elaheh Sadat', 'Aberuyi, Narges', 'Rahgozar, Soheila']","['Ghodousi ES', 'Aberuyi N', 'Rahgozar S']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Sciences and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Sciences and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Sciences and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MIRN326 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2020/03/05 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['5780183 [pii]', '10.1093/jjco/hyaa025 [doi]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 2020 Jun 10;50(6):671-678. doi: 10.1093/jjco/hyaa025.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

We have previously observed that multidrug-resistant 2 (Mdr2(-/-) ) double knockout (DKO) mice lacking tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (Tr(-/-) ) display a more extensive ductular reaction and hepatic fibrosis compared to Mdr2(-/-) mice. This observation suggests that the magnitude of the DR-cell population may be regulated by apoptosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: To examine this concept, we cultured epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive reactive cholangioids (ERCs) obtained from wild-type (WT), Tr(-/-) , Mdr2(-/-) and DKO mice. Single-cell transcriptomics and immunostaining of both WT and DKO ERCs confirmed their DR-cell phenotype. Moreover, DKO ERCs displayed a unique translational cluster with expression of chemokines, indicating a reactive state. Incubation with the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) inhibitor S63845, a proapoptotic BH3-mimetic therapy, significantly decreased DKO and Mdr2(-/-) ERC viability compared to WT. Intravenous administration of S63845 significantly reduced the DR-cell population and markers of inflammation and liver fibrosis in Mdr2(-/-) and DKO mice. Furthermore, DKO mice treated with S63845 displayed a significant decrease in hepatic B lymphocytes compared to untreated mice as assessed by high-definition mass cytometry by time-of-flight. Coculture of bone marrow-derived macrophages with ERCs from DKO mouse livers up-regulated expression of the B cell-directed chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5. Finally, DR cells were noted to be primed for apoptosis with Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer activation in vitro and in vivo in primary sclerosing cholangitis liver specimens. CONCLUSIONS: DR cells appear to play a key role in recruiting immune cells to the liver to actively create an inflammatory and profibrogenic microenvironment. Pharmacologic targeting of MCL1 in a mouse model of chronic cholestasis reduces DR-cell and B-cell populations and hepatic fibrosis.","['Azad, Adiba I', 'Krishnan, Anuradha', 'Troop, Leia', 'Li, Ying', 'Katsumi, Tomohiro', 'Pavelko, Kevin', 'Kostallari, Enis', 'Guicciardi, Maria Eugenia', 'Gores, Gregory J']","['Azad AI', 'Krishnan A', 'Troop L', 'Li Y', 'Katsumi T', 'Pavelko K', 'Kostallari E', 'Guicciardi ME', 'Gores GJ']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Thiophenes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic/*pathology', '*Cholestasis/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule/metabolism', '*Epithelial Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Liver Cirrhosis/etiology/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology']",2020/03/05 06:00,2021/04/30 06:00,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2019/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.31211 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2020 Sep;72(3):1013-1028. doi: 10.1002/hep.31211.,,"['P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK084567/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK124182/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007198/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5P30 CA15083-43C1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK124182/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30DK084567/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK07198/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],PMC7774262,['NIHMS1649506'],,,['Arch Toxicol. 2020 Oct;94(10):3607-3608.

An exploratory objective examined patients with AML receiving chemotherapy only. METHODS: We used Optum's de-identified Clinformatics((R)) Data Mart Database to construct cumulative cost trajectories from chemotherapy initiation to death or LDE (through 31 December 2014) for US patients aged 20-74 years diagnosed between 1 March 2004 and 31 December 2013 (n = 187 alloHCT; n = 253 chemotherapy only). We used generalized additive modeling (GAM) to predict expected trajectories and bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs) at user-specified intervals conditional on dates of alloHCT and death or LDE relative to chemotherapy initiation. RESULTS: Expected costs (in 2017 values) for a hypothetical patient receiving alloHCT 60 days after chemotherapy initiation and followed for 5 years were $US572,000 (95% CI 517,000-633,000); $US119,000 (95% CI 51,000-192,000); $US102,000 (95% CI 0-285,000); $US79,000 (95% CI 0-233,000), for years 1-4, respectively, and either $US494,000 (95% CI 212,000-799,000) or $US108,000 (95% CI 0-230,000) in year 5, whether the patient died or was lost to follow-up on day 1825, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of cost accrual varied over time since chemotherapy initiation, with accelerations around the time of alloHCT and death. GAM is a potentially useful approach for imputing longitudinal costs relative to treatment initiation and one or more intercurrent, clinical, or terminal events in randomized controlled trials or registries with unrecorded costs or for dynamic decision-analytic models.","['Mau, Lih-Wen', 'Preussler, Jaime M', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Leppke, Susan', 'Majhail, Navneet S', 'Meyer, Christa L', 'Mupfudze, Tatenda', 'Saber, Wael', 'Steinert, Patricia', 'Vanness, David J']","['Mau LW', 'Preussler JM', 'Burns LJ', 'Leppke S', 'Majhail NS', 'Meyer CL', 'Mupfudze T', 'Saber W', 'Steinert P', 'Vanness DJ']","['National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Blood & Marrow Transplant Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Apriori Bayesian Consulting, LLC, 2643 Sleepy Hollow Drive, State College, PA, 16803, USA. dvanness@aprioribayesian.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Algorithms', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Databases, Factual', 'Drug Therapy/economics', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs/trends', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/economics', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health/*economics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Economic', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/05 06:00,2021/04/02 06:00,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40273-020-00891-w [doi]', '10.1007/s40273-020-00891-w [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 2020 May;38(5):515-526. doi: 10.1007/s40273-020-00891-w.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9790-2988'],"['1U24HL138660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 HL138660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5U24CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSH250201700006C/HRSA/HRSA HHS/United States']",,PMC7194165,['NIHMS1571388'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the first human with MKL1 deficiency, leading to a novel primary immunodeficiency, was identified. We report a second family with 2 siblings with a homozygous frameshift mutation in MKL1. The index case died as an infant from progressive and severe pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor wound healing. The younger sibling was preemptively transplanted shortly after birth. The immunodeficiency was marked by a pronounced actin polymerization defect and a strongly reduced motility and chemotactic response by MKL1-deficient neutrophils. In addition to the lack of MKL1, subsequent proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of patient neutrophils revealed actin and several actin-related proteins to be downregulated, confirming a role for MKL1 as a transcriptional coregulator. Degranulation was enhanced upon suboptimal neutrophil activation, whereas production of reactive oxygen species was normal. Neutrophil adhesion was intact but without proper spreading. The latter could explain the observed failure in firm adherence and transendothelial migration under flow conditions. No apparent defect in phagocytosis or bacterial killing was found. Also, monocyte-derived macrophages showed intact phagocytosis, and lymphocyte counts and proliferative capacity were normal. Nonhematopoietic primary fibroblasts demonstrated defective differentiation into myofibroblasts but normal migration and F-actin content, most likely as a result of compensatory mechanisms of MKL2, which is not expressed in neutrophils. Our findings extend current insight into the severe immune dysfunction in MKL1 deficiency, with cytoskeletal dysfunction and defective extravasation of neutrophils as the most prominent features.","['Sprenkeler, Evelien G G', 'Henriet, Stefanie S V', 'Tool, Anton T J', 'Kreft, Iris C', 'van der Bijl, Ivo', 'Aarts, Cathelijn E M', 'van Houdt, Michel', 'Verkuijlen, Paul J J H', 'van Aerde, Koen', 'Jaspers, Gerald', 'van Heijst, Arno', 'Koole, Wouter', 'Gardeitchik, Thatjana', 'Geissler, Judy', 'de Boer, Martin', 'Tol, Simon', 'Bruggeman, Christine W', 'van Alphen, Floris P J', 'Verhagen, Han J M P', 'van den Akker, Emile', 'Janssen, Hans', 'van Bruggen, Robin', 'van den Berg, Timo K', 'Liem, Kian D', 'Kuijpers, Taco W']","['Sprenkeler EGG', 'Henriet SSV', 'Tool ATJ', 'Kreft IC', 'van der Bijl I', 'Aarts CEM', 'van Houdt M', 'Verkuijlen PJJH', 'van Aerde K', 'Jaspers G', 'van Heijst A', 'Koole W', 'Gardeitchik T', 'Geissler J', 'de Boer M', 'Tol S', 'Bruggeman CW', 'van Alphen FPJ', 'Verhagen HJMP', 'van den Akker E', 'Janssen H', 'van Bruggen R', 'van den Berg TK', 'Liem KD', 'Kuijpers TW']","['Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Immunology, Rheumatology, and Infectious Diseases, Emma Children's Hospital, AUMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Hemostasis, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Intensive Care and.', ""Department of Neonatology, Amalia Children's Hospital, Radboud Institute for Health Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research Facilities and.', 'Department of Blood Cell Research, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam University Medical Center (AUMC), University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Research Facilities and.', 'Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematopoiesis, Sanquin Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Biochemistry, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands;

Recent studies suggest the involvement of multiple microRNAs in the tumorigenesis of various leukemias. However, until now, no comprehensive database exists for miRNAs and their cognate target genes involved specifically in ALL. Therefore, we developed 'LeukmiR' a dynamic database comprising in silico predicted microRNAs, and experimentally validated miRNAs along with the target genes they regulate in mouse and human. LeukmiR is a user-friendly platform with search strings for ALL-associated microRNAs, their sequences, description of target genes, their location on the chromosomes and the corresponding deregulated signaling pathways. For the user query, different search modules exist where either quick search can be carried out using any fuzzy term or by providing exact terms in specific modules. All entries for both human and mouse genomes can be retrieved through multiple options such as miRNA ID, their accession number, sequence, target genes, Ensemble-ID or Entrez-ID. User can also access miRNA: mRNA interaction networks in different signaling pathways, the genomic location of the targeted regions such as 3'UTR, 5'UTR and exons with their gene ontology and disease ontology information in both human and mouse systems. Herein, we also report 51 novel microRNAs which are not described earlier for ALL. Thus, LeukmiR database will be a valuable source of information for researchers to understand and investigate miRNAs and their targets with diagnostic and therapeutic potential in ALL.

This study was to find a more precise early prognosis index at 3 months in the patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP, especially for the patients with BCR-ABL1(IS) >10%. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 79 newly diagnosed CML-CP patients from October 2013 to April 2017. All patients took imatinib regularly and continuously and monitored BCR-ABL1 transcript level at baseline and 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 months after starting imatinib treatment. Results: Among the 44(55.7%) patients with BCR/ABL1(IS) </=10% at 3 months after imatinib treatment, 12(27.3%) cases did not achieve major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months, and 7(14.9%) patients with the halving time BCR-ABL1 transcript </=40 days failed to achieve MMR at 12 months. However, approximately twenty-six percent of the patients with BCR-ABL1(IS) >10% still obtained MMR. Moreover, the patients with BCR-ABL1(IS) </=10% and halving time </=40 days had a significantly better MMR than that of the patients with the BCR-ABL1(IS) </=10% and halving time >40 days (88.6% versus 11.1%, P <0.001). However, the patients with the BCR-ABL1(IS) >10% and halving time >40 days rarely achieved MMR at 12 months. Conclusion: These data indicated that the halving time of BCR-ABL1 transcript was also an important prognostic factor as that of the BCR-ABL1(IS). Combined observations of these two prognosis indexes are more accurate predictor for the long-term molecular response, especially for the CML-CP patients with BCR-ABL1(IS) >10%, and which is helpful for TKI switching as early as possible to improve patients' survival and reduce drug costs.","['Cai, Zhimei', 'Jia, Xiting', 'Zi, Jie', 'Song, Huihui', 'Wang, Shujun', 'McGrath, Mary', 'Zhao, Lidong', 'Song, Chunhua', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Cai Z', 'Jia X', 'Zi J', 'Song H', 'Wang S', 'McGrath M', 'Zhao L', 'Song C', 'Ge Z']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.', 'Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, The First People's Hospital of Lianyungang, The Affiliated Lianyungang Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Lianyungang, Jiangsu, China."", 'Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200203,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,2020/03/05 06:00,2020/03/05 06:01,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.38752 [doi]', 'jcav11p2234 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Feb 3;11(8):2234-2240. doi: 10.7150/jca.38752. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) The author(s).'],PMC7052929,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'decline', 'imatinib']",,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic aberrations in AML are structurally diverse and currently detected by different diagnostic assays. This study sought to establish whole transcriptome RNA sequencing as single, comprehensive, and flexible platform for AML diagnostics. We developed HAMLET (Human AML Expedited Transcriptomics) as bioinformatics pipeline for simultaneous detection of fusion genes, small variants, tandem duplications, and gene expression with all information assembled in an annotated, user-friendly output file. Whole transcriptome RNA sequencing was performed on 100 AML cases and HAMLET results were validated by reference assays and targeted resequencing. The data showed that HAMLET accurately detected all fusion genes and overexpression of EVI1 irrespective of 3q26 aberrations. In addition, small variants in 13 genes that are often mutated in AML were called with 99.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and tandem duplications in FLT3 and KMT2A were detected by a novel algorithm based on soft-clipped reads with 100% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity. In conclusion, HAMLET has the potential to provide accurate comprehensive diagnostic information relevant for AML classification, risk assessment and targeted therapy on a single technology platform.","['Arindrarto, Wibowo', 'Borras, Daniel M', 'de Groen, Ruben A L', 'van den Berg, Redmar R', 'Locher, Irene J', 'van Diessen, Saskia A M E', 'van der Holst, Rosalie', 'van der Meijden, Edith D', 'Honders, M Willy', 'de Leeuw, Rick H', 'Verlaat, Wina', 'Jedema, Inge', 'Kroes, Wilma G M', 'Knijnenburg, Jeroen', 'van Wezel, Tom', 'Vermaat, Joost S P', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Janssen, Bart', 'de Knijff, Peter', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'van den Akker, Erik B', ""Hoen, Peter A C 't"", 'Kielbasa, Szymon M', 'Laros, Jeroen F J', 'Griffioen, Marieke', 'Veelken, Hendrik']","['Arindrarto W', 'Borras DM', 'de Groen RAL', 'van den Berg RR', 'Locher IJ', 'van Diessen SAME', 'van der Holst R', 'van der Meijden ED', 'Honders MW', 'de Leeuw RH', 'Verlaat W', 'Jedema I', 'Kroes WGM', 'Knijnenburg J', 'van Wezel T', 'Vermaat JSP', 'Valk PJM', 'Janssen B', 'de Knijff P', 'van Bergen CAM', 'van den Akker EB', ""Hoen PAC'"", 'Kielbasa SM', 'Laros JFJ', 'Griffioen M', 'Veelken H']","['Center for Computational Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'GenomeScan B.V, 2333 BZ, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Chemical Cell Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Forensic Laboratory for DNA Research, Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, 3015CN, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'GenomeScan B.V, 2333 BZ, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Forensic Laboratory for DNA Research, Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Computational Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'The Delft Bioinformatics Lab, Delft University of Technology, 2628CD, Delft, The Netherlands.', 'Section of Molecular Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'The Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Medical Center, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Center for Computational Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, 2300RC, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Most patients with chronic phase (CP) now have a normal life expectancy. Another goal is achieving a stable deep molecular response (DMR) and discontinuing medication for treatment-free remission (TFR). The European LeukemiaNet convened an expert panel to critically evaluate and update the evidence to achieve these goals since its previous recommendations. First-line treatment is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI; imatinib brand or generic, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib are available first-line). Generic imatinib is the cost-effective initial treatment in CP. Various contraindications and side-effects of all TKIs should be considered. Patient risk status at diagnosis should be assessed with the new EUTOS long-term survival (ELTS)-score. Monitoring of response should be done by quantitative polymerase chain reaction whenever possible. A change of treatment is recommended when intolerance cannot be ameliorated or when molecular milestones are not reached.

To define the outcome of sAML in the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), a retrospective, registry-based comparison was performed, including 11,439 patients with de novo and 1325 with sAML. Among transplants in first complete remission (CR1) (n = 8,600), the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (RI) and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 28.5% and 16.4% for de novo, and 35% and 23.4% for sAML. Three-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS) and Graft-versus-Host Disease/relapse-free survival (GRFS) was 60.8%, 55.1%, and 38.6% for de novo, and 46.7%, 41.6%, and 28.4% for sAML, respectively. In multivariate analysis, sAML was associated with a lower OS (HR = 1.33 [95% CI = 1.21-1.48]; p < 10(-5)), LFS (HR = 1.32 [95% CI = 1.19-1.45]; p < 10(-5)) and GRFS (HR = 1.2 [95% CI = 1.1-1.31]; p < 10(-4)) and higher NRM (HR = 1.37 [95% CI = 1.17-1.59]; p < 10(-4)) and RI (HR = 1.27 [95% CI = 1.12-1.44]; p < 10(-3)). Results of the Cox model were confirmed in a matched-pair analysis. In contrast, results did not differ between de novo and sAML after alloSCT in induction failure or relapse.

Indeed, recent advances in nanoscale sample preparation have enabled effective processing of single cells. In particular, the concept of using boosting/carrier channels in isobaric labeling to increase the sensitivity in MS detection has also been increasingly used for quantitative proteomic analysis of small-sized samples including single cells. However, the full potential of such boosting/carrier approaches has not been significantly explored, nor has the resulting quantitation quality been carefully evaluated. Herein, we have further evaluated and optimized our recent boosting to amplify signal with isobaric labeling (BASIL) approach, originally developed for quantifying phosphorylation in small number of cells, for highly effective analysis of proteins in single cells. This improved BASIL (iBASIL) approach enables reliable quantitative single-cell proteomics analysis with greater proteome coverage by carefully controlling the boosting-to-sample ratio (e.g. in general <100x) and optimizing MS automatic gain control (AGC) and ion injection time settings in MS/MS analysis (e.g. 5E5 and 300 ms, respectively, which is significantly higher than that used in typical bulk analysis). By coupling with a nanodroplet-based single cell preparation (nanoPOTS) platform, iBASIL enabled identification of approximately 2500 proteins and precise quantification of approximately 1500 proteins in the analysis of 104 FACS-isolated single cells, with the resulting protein profiles robustly clustering the cells from three different acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. This study highlights the importance of carefully evaluating and optimizing the boosting ratios and MS data acquisition conditions for achieving robust, comprehensive proteomic analysis of single cells.","['Tsai, Chia-Feng', 'Zhao, Rui', 'Williams, Sarah M', 'Moore, Ronald J', 'Schultz, Kendall', 'Chrisler, William B', 'Pasa-Tolic, Ljiljana', 'Rodland, Karin D', 'Smith, Richard D', 'Shi, Tujin', 'Zhu, Ying', 'Liu, Tao']","['Tsai CF', 'Zhao R', 'Williams SM', 'Moore RJ', 'Schultz K', 'Chrisler WB', 'Pasa-Tolic L', 'Rodland KD', 'Smith RD', 'Shi T', 'Zhu Y', 'Liu T']","['Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Biological Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.', 'Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99354.

The present study retrospectively analyzed the prognostic factors in patients with de novo AML at a single institution owing to the observation of some differences with the reported data from the Western world. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with de novo AML who had been referred to King Abdulla Medical City were included. All patients had undergone bone marrow aspiration, biopsy, flow cytometry, cytogenetics (conventional and fluorescence in situ hybridization panel performed at Mayo Clinic), molecular tests, and other routine tests. RESULTS: The data from 170 patients were reviewed. Of the 170 patients, 26 had had acute promyelocytic leukemia, 16 with AML had received less intensive therapy, 119 had received intensive induction, and 8 had refused treatment. The present analysis was limited to the 119 patients who had received intensive induction therapy. For the major cytogenetic categories, 17 of 27 patients with core binding factor leukemia (62.9%) were reassigned to the intermediate (n = 10; 37%) or unfavorable (n = 7; 25.9%) risk group according to the FLT3-ITD and NPM results. Of the 50 cases of normal cytogenetic findings, 2 (4%) were considered unfavorable, 12 (24%), favorable, 30 intermediate (60%), and 6 (12%) unknown. The median leukemia-free survival was 21.5 months. The median overall survival was 16.4 +/- 2.2 months, with a 3-year survival rate of 37.2%. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the cytogenetics results (P = .002) and the presence of FLT-3 (P = .03) were independent prognostic factors for relapse-free survival. Performance status, response, relapse, and cytogenetics findings were independent prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSIONS: The results from the present study revealed some differences in patient age and cytogenetic risk groups for patients with AML in our region and those in the Western world, including a younger median age, relevance of core binding factor leukemia, and a greater incidence of monosomies.","['Alabdulwahab, Amal S', 'Elsayed, Hussein G', 'Sherisher, Mohamed A', 'Zeeneldin, Ahmed', 'Elbjeirami, Wafa M']","['Alabdulwahab AS', 'Elsayed HG', 'Sherisher MA', 'Zeeneldin A', 'Elbjeirami WM']","['Department of Hematology, King Abdullah Medical City, Holly Capital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Hematology, King Abdullah Medical City, Holly Capital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

We retrospectively analyzed 304 consecutive AML patients, with non-favorable NCCN risk who received initial treatment at our center with either 7 + 3 (n = 86) or FLAG+/-Ida (n = 218). Patients in the FLAG+/-Ida group were more likely to achieve remission after one course of induction (74 % vs 62 %, p < 0.001) and had a faster time to achieve CR (30 days vs 37.5, p < 0.001) compared to 7 + 3. The time from diagnosis to transplant was shorter among CR patients after FLAG+/-Ida compared to 7 + 3 (115 vs. 151 days, p < 0.003). The 3-year post-remission OS and DFS was significantly better for patients receiving FLAG-Ida at 54 % and 49 % compared to 39 % and 32 % for 7 + 3 respectively (P = 0.01).

Traditionally, ANAs have been considered as reporters of abnormal immunological events associated with the onset and progression of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD), also called ANA-associated rheumatic diseases (AARD), as well as clinical biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of these diseases. However, based on our current knowledge, it is not apparent that autoantibodies presenting the DFS IIF pattern fall into these categories. These antibodies invariably target a chromatin-associated protein designated as dense fine speckled protein of 70 kD (DFS70), also known as lens epithelium-derived growth factor protein of 75 kD (LEDGF/p75) and PC4 and SFRS1 Interacting protein 1 (PSIP1). This multi-functional protein, hereafter referred to as DFS70/LEDGF, plays important roles in the formation of transcription complexes in active chromatin, transcriptional activation of specific genes, regulation of mRNA splicing, DNA repair, and cellular survival against stress. Due to its multiple functions, it has emerged as a key protein contributing to several human pathologies, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), leukemia, cancer, ocular diseases, and Rett syndrome. Unlike other ANAs, ""monospecific"" anti-DFS70/LEDGF autoantibodies (only detectable ANA in serum) are not associated with SARD and have been detected in healthy individuals and some patients with non-SARD inflammatory conditions. These observations have led to the hypotheses that these antibodies could be considered as negative biomarkers of SARD and might even play a protective or beneficial role. In spite of 20 years of research on this autoantibody-autoantigen system, its biological and clinical significance still remains enigmatic. Here we review the current state of knowledge of this system, focusing on the lessons learned and posing emerging questions that await further scrutiny as we continue our quest to unravel its significance and potential clinical and therapeutic utility.","['Ortiz-Hernandez, Greisha L', 'Sanchez-Hernandez, Evelyn S', 'Casiano, Carlos A']","['Ortiz-Hernandez GL', 'Sanchez-Hernandez ES', 'Casiano CA']","['Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, 92350, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, USA.', 'Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, 92350, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, USA.', 'Center for Health Disparities and Molecular Medicine, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, CA, 92350, USA. ccasiano@llu.edu.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, USA. ccasiano@llu.edu.', 'Department of Medicine/Division of Rheumatology, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, Loma Linda, USA. ccasiano@llu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200203,England,Auto Immun Highlights,Auto- immunity highlights,101532391,,,,2020/03/05 06:00,2020/03/05 06:01,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13317-020-0126-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13317-020-0126-4 [pii]']",epublish,Auto Immun Highlights. 2020 Feb 3;11(1):3. doi: 10.1186/s13317-020-0126-4.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7320-4333'],"['R21CA226654-01A1/National Institutes of Health (US)', 'R21CA226654-01A1S1/National Institutes of Health (US)', 'P20MD006988-Project 2/National Institutes of Health (US)', 'R25GM060507/National Institutes of Health (US)']",,PMC7065333,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-DFS', 'Antinuclear autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'Cancer', 'DFS70', 'Dense fine speckles', 'Interacting partners', 'LEDGF/p75', 'PSIP1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst this association is well-described with agents such as rituximab and natalizumab, the literature describing the occurrence of PML with ofatumumab therapy (especially in a haematology setting) is sparse. This case aims to draw attention to the above association with a particular focus on the mechanisms by which B-cell-depleting therapy can precipitate PML during the treatment of haematological malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old Caucasian man presented with acute-on-subacute confusion and reduced mobility. He had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia for which he had completed six cycles of ofatumumab and chlorambucil 2 months prior to presentation. Biochemistry, physical examination and imaging were unremarkable on admission. Subsequent neurological examination demonstrated diminished reflexes and an extensor right plantar, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment revealed white matter hyperintensities in the frontal lobes with restricted diffusion surrounding these areas. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated normal cell counts and chemistry but detected John Cunningham virus (JCV) via polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with a quantitative value of 41,850 gEg/ml. CSF immunophenotyping excluded malignant processes. A diagnosis of PML was confirmed, and with the support of palliative care, the patient was discharged to a hospice for ongoing care with the family's agreement. CONCLUSION: PML remains a rare complication of ofatumumab treatment. Nevertheless, clinicians should maintain a certain level of suspicion for this risk, especially in the context of patients presenting with clinical syndromes of encephalopathy and focal neurologic deficits. Furthermore, research to better our understanding of the manifold links between B-cell function and JCV regulation could provide valuable information for use in the future prevention and treatment of PML.","['Forryan, James', 'Yong, Jun']","['Forryan J', 'Yong J']","['The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool, UK. james.forryan@me.com.', 'Haematology Department, Duncan Building, Liverpool, UK. james.forryan@me.com.', 'The Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool, UK.', 'Haematology Department, Duncan Building, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200303,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*adverse effects', 'Brain/pathology', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*etiology', 'Hospice Care', 'Humans', 'JC Virus/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Palliative Care', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2020/03/05 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/03/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-020-2360-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-020-2360-9 [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2020 Mar 3;14(1):39. doi: 10.1186/s13256-020-2360-9.,,,,PMC7055117,,['NOTNLM'],"['Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,', 'Ofatumumab, Monoclonal antibodies, B-cell-depleting therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigation of the functional responses of cells to various PUFA often involves cell culture experiments, which can then inform or guide subsequent in vivo and clinical investigations. In this study, human carcinoma and leukemia cell lines (MCF-7, HepG2, THP-1, Jurkat) were incubated for 3 days in the presence of up to 150 muM of exogenous arachidonic or eicosapentaenoic acids. At concentrations up to 20 muM these PUFA were enriched in cellular phospholipids, but at concentrations of 20 muM or higher cells accumulated large quantities of these PUFA and their elongation products into triglycerides. This coincided with decreased cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. Inhibition of DGAT1 but not DGAT2 enhanced the cytotoxic effect of exogenous PUFA suggesting a protective role of PUFA sequestration into TGs. Lower (10 muM) and higher (50 muM) exogenous PUFA concentrations also had different impacts on the expression of PUFA metabolizing enzymes. Overall, these results indicate that caution must be exercised when planning in vitro experiments since elevated concentrations of PUFA can lead to dysfunctional cellular responses that are not predictive of in vivo responses to dietary PUFA.","['Mbarik, Maroua', 'Biam, Roody S', 'Robichaud, Philippe-Pierre', 'Surette, Marc E']","['Mbarik M', 'Biam RS', 'Robichaud PP', 'Surette ME']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, NB, E1A 3E9, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, NB, E1A 3E9, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, NB, E1A 3E9, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, NB, E1A 3E9, Canada.

Thus, targeting angiogenic signaling is a promising treatment strategy, especially for relapsed and resistant AML. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of apatinib, a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets VEGFR2. METHODS: Several AML cell lines were exposed to various concentrations of apatinib, and then CCK8 and Annexin V/PI assays were performed to determine IC50 values and apoptosis, respectively. The effect of apatinib against primary AML cells from 57 adult patients and 11 normal controls was also analyzed utilizing an apoptosis assay. Next, we tested the underlying mechanism of apatinib in AML using western blotting and mass cytometry (CyTOF). Finally, the activity of apatinib against tumor growth and angiogenesis was further evaluated in vivo in xenograft models. RESULTS: We found apatinib signi fi cantly inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis in AML cell lines in vitro. Similarly, apatinib showed cytotoxicity against primary AML cells but didn't affect normal BMMCs. Its effect was highly correlated with several clinical features, such as NPM1 mutation, extramedullary infiltration, relapsed/refractory disease, and M2 and M5 FAB subtypes. In addition, apatinib suppressed AML growth and attenuated angiogenesis in xenograft models. Mechanistically, apatinib-induced cytotoxicity was closely associated with inhibition of the VEGFR2-mediated Src/STAT3 and AKT/mTOR pathways and induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.

In addition to their ability to kill microorganisms, several AMPs also exhibit selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells and are collectively referred to as anticancer peptides (ACPs). Here a large library of AMPs, mainly derived from the porcine cathelicidin peptide, tritrpticin (VRRFPWWWPFLRR), were assessed for their anticancer activity against the Jurkat T cell leukemia line. These anticancer potencies were compared to the cytotoxicity of the peptides towards normal cells isolated from healthy donors, namely peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and red blood cells (RBCs; where hemolytic activity was assessed). Among the active tritrpticin derivatives, substitution of Arg by Lys enhanced the selectivity of the peptides towards Jurkat cells when compared to PBMCs. Additionally, the side chain length of the Lys residues was also optimized to further enhance the tritrpticin ACP selectivity at low concentrations. The mechanism of action of the peptides with high selectivity involved the permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane of Jurkat cells, without formation of apoptotic bodies. The incorporation of non-natural Lys-based cationic amino acids could provide a new strategy to improve the selectivity of other synthetic ACPs to enhance their potential for therapeutic use against leukemia cells.","['Arias, Mauricio', 'Haney, Evan F', 'Hilchie, Ashley L', 'Corcoran, Jennifer A', 'Hyndman, M Eric', 'Hancock, Robert E W', 'Vogel, Hans J']","['Arias M', 'Haney EF', 'Hilchie AL', 'Corcoran JA', 'Hyndman ME', 'Hancock REW', 'Vogel HJ']","['Biochemistry Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr. NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada; Biophysics Group, School of Physics, Faculty of Sciences, Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Sede Medellin, Calle 65 No 59A-110, Medellin, Colombia.', 'Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.', 'Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; Department of Biology, Acadia University, Wolfville, NS B4P 2R6, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; Microbiology, Immunology and Infectious Disease Department, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of Urology, Southern Alberta Institute of Urology, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB T2V 1P9, Canada.', 'Centre for Microbial Diseases and Immunity Research, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.', 'Biochemistry Research Group, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Calgary, 2500 University Dr. NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.

TET3 mutations are infrequent in AML, but the level of TET3 expression in HSCs has been found to decline with age. We examined the impact of gradual decrease of TET function in AML development by generating mice with Tet deficiency at various degrees. Tet2f/f and Tet3f/f mice were crossed with mice expressing Mx1-Cre to generate Tet2f/wtTet3f/fMx-Cre+ (T2DeltaT3), Tet2f/fTet3f/wtMx-Cre+ (DeltaT2T3), and Tet2f/fTet3f/fMx-Cre+ (DeltaT2DeltaT3) mice. All DeltaT2DeltaT3 mice died of aggressive AML at a median survival of 10.7 weeks. By comparison, T2DeltaT3 and DeltaT2T3 mice developed AML at longer latencies, with a median survival of approximately 27 weeks. Remarkably, all 9 T2DeltaT3 and 8 DeltaT2T3 mice with AML showed inactivation of the remaining nontargeted Tet2 or Tet3 allele, respectively, owing to exonic loss in either gene or stop-gain mutations in Tet3. Recurrent mutations other than Tet3 were not noted in any mice by whole-exome sequencing. Spontaneous inactivation of residual Tet2 or Tet3 alleles is a recurrent genetic event during the development of AML with Tet insufficiency.","['Shrestha, Raksha', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto, Mamiko', 'Maie, Koichiro', 'Oshima, Motohiko', 'Ishihara, Masatomo', 'Suehara, Yasuhito', 'Fukumoto, Kota', 'Nakajima-Takagi, Yaeko', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Kato, Takayasu', 'Muto, Hideharu', 'Sakamoto, Tatsuhiro', 'Kusakabe, Manabu', 'Nannya, Yasuhito', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Ueno, Hiroo', 'Saiki, Ryunosuke', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Chiba, Kenichi', 'Shiraishi, Yuichi', 'Miyano, Satoru', 'Mouly, Enguerran', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Koseki, Haruhiko', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Chiba, Shigeru']","['Shrestha R', 'Sakata-Yanagimoto M', 'Maie K', 'Oshima M', 'Ishihara M', 'Suehara Y', 'Fukumoto K', 'Nakajima-Takagi Y', 'Matsui H', 'Kato T', 'Muto H', 'Sakamoto T', 'Kusakabe M', 'Nannya Y', 'Makishima H', 'Ueno H', 'Saiki R', 'Ogawa S', 'Chiba K', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Miyano S', 'Mouly E', 'Bernard OA', 'Inaba T', 'Koseki H', 'Iwama A', 'Chiba S']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, and.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, and.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, The Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute for the Advanced Study of Human Biology (WPI ASHBi), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Cellular Signaling, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'INSERM U1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1170, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima, Japan;

Despite the clear overall clinical benefit, the number of patients achieving complete remissions with the single agent is relatively low, a problem shared by the vast majority of targeted agents. Here, we searched for novel copanlisib-based combinations. Copanlisib was tested as a single agent, in combination with an additional 17 drugs in 26 cell lines derived from mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and T-cell lymphomas. In vivo experiments, transcriptome analyses, and immunoblotting experiments were also performed. Copanlisib as a single agent showed in vitro dose-dependent antitumor activity in the vast majority of the models. Combination screening identified several compounds that synergized with copanlisib. The strongest combination was with the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitor venetoclax. The benefit of the combination over single agents was also validated in an MZL xenograft model and in MCL primary cells, and was due to increased induction of apoptosis, an effect likely sustained by the reduction of the antiapoptotic proteins myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) and BCL-XL, observed in MCL and MZL cell lines, respectively. These data supported the rationale for the design of the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) 66/18 phase 1 study currently exploring the combination of copanlisib and venetoclax in relapsed/refractory lymphomas.","['Tarantelli, Chiara', 'Lange, Martin', 'Gaudio, Eugenio', 'Cascione, Luciano', 'Spriano, Filippo', 'Kwee, Ivo', 'Arribas, Alberto J', 'Rinaldi, Andrea', 'Jourdan, Thibaud', 'Berthold, Melanie', 'Sturz, Andrea', 'Sperl, Carolyn', 'Margheriti, Francesco', 'Scalise, Lorenzo', 'Gritti, Giuseppe', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Stathis, Anastasios', 'Liu, Ningshu', 'Zucca, Emanuele', 'Politz, Oliver', 'Bertoni, Francesco']","['Tarantelli C', 'Lange M', 'Gaudio E', 'Cascione L', 'Spriano F', 'Kwee I', 'Arribas AJ', 'Rinaldi A', 'Jourdan T', 'Berthold M', 'Sturz A', 'Sperl C', 'Margheriti F', 'Scalise L', 'Gritti G', 'Rossi D', 'Stathis A', 'Liu N', 'Zucca E', 'Politz O', 'Bertoni F']","['Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Unita Strutturale Complessa Ematologia, Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland; and.', 'Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland; and.', 'Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, USI, Lugano, Switzerland.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland; and.', 'Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universita della Svizzera Italiana (USI), Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'WI6V529FZ9 (copanlisib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', '*Lymphoma, T-Cell', '*Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Pyrimidines', 'Quinazolines', 'Sulfonamides']",2020/03/04 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31446-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000844 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Mar 10;4(5):819-829. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000844.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7065481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective study of 43 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and/or myelodysplastic syndromes who were treated with an antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) (32 patients) or anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) (9 patients) blockade or both (2 patients) prior to HSCT with the primary outcome of aGVHD by day 100 after HSCT. Outcome analyses were stratified by GVHD prophylaxis as use of post-HSCT cyclophosphamide (PTCy) (22 patients) or not (non-PTCy) (21 patients). RESULTS: The PTCy group demonstrated a trend toward lower grade 3 to 4 aGVHD when compared with the non-PTCy group (5% vs 22%), although the rates of grade 2 to 4 aGVHD were comparable (49% vs 56%). The interval between CPI and HSCT did not appear to impact the incidence of aGVHD. However, a higher incidence of grade 3 to 4 aGVHD was observed in patients who received >4 treatments of CPI prior to HSCT if they were not given PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis (43% vs 12%). Matched control analyses using patients with no prior use of CPI confirmed the increase in grade 3 to 4 aGVHD with those agents. However, that increased risk was limited to patients who did not receive PTCy and was not observed in patients who received PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis. Despite persistent improvement in GVHD with the use of PTCy, disease control was not compromised and progression-free survival at 1 year was found to be superior for patients treated with PTCy compared with those not receiving PTCy among patients with prior use of CPI (55% vs 22%). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicated that HSCT with prior use of CPI appears feasible in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and/or myelodysplastic syndromes and the use of PTCy as GVHD prophylaxis improves outcomes.","['Oran, Betul', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Saliba, Rima M', 'Alfayez, Mansour', 'Al-Atrash, Gheath', 'Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Mehta, Rohtesh S', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Rezvani, Katy', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Sharma, Padmanee', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Daver, Naval']","['Oran B', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Saliba RM', 'Alfayez M', 'Al-Atrash G', 'Ciurea SO', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Mehta RS', 'Popat UR', 'Ravandi F', 'Alousi AM', 'Kadia TM', 'Konopleva M', 'DiNardo CD', 'Rezvani K', 'Shpall EJ', 'Sharma P', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Champlin RE', 'Daver N']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200303,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/03/04 06:00,2021/01/15 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32796 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 May 15;126(10):2193-2205. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32796.

The non-structural protein NS4 is the only AHSV protein that localizes to the nucleus. Here we report that all AHSV reference and representative field strains express one of the two forms of NS4, i.e. NS4-I or NS4-II. Both forms of NS4 are nucleocytoplasmic proteins, but NS4-I has a stronger nuclear presence whilst NS4-II has a proportionally higher cytoplasmic distribution. A subtype of NS4-II containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS), named NLS-NS4-II, displays distinct punctate foci in the nucleus. We showed that NS4 likely enters the nucleus via passive diffusion as a result of its small size. Colocalization analysis with nuclear compartments revealed that NS4 colocalizes with promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), suggesting a role in the antiviral response or interferon signalling. Interestingly, we showed that two other AHSV proteins also interact with nuclear components. A small fraction of the NS1 tubules were present in the nucleus and associated with PML-NBs; this was more pronounced for a virus strain lacking NS4. A component of nuclear speckles, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2) was recruited to viral inclusion bodies (VIBs) in the cytoplasm of AHSV-infected cells and colocalized with NS2. Nuclear speckles are important sites for cellular mRNA transcript processing and maturation. Collectively, these results provide data on three AHSV non-structural proteins interacting with host cell nuclear components that could contribute to overcoming antiviral responses and creating conditions that will favour viral replication.","['Boughan, Shareen', 'Potgieter, A Christiaan', 'van Staden, Vida']","['Boughan S', 'Potgieter AC', 'van Staden V']","['Department of Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Focus Area for Human Metabolomics, North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa.', 'Deltamune (Pty) Ltd, Moraine house - The Braes, 193 Bryanston Drive, Bryanston, Gauteng, 2191, South Africa.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Genetics and Microbiology, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200228,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",IM,"['African Horse Sickness Virus/genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/*virology', 'Coiled Bodies/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytoplasm/*virology', '*Genome, Viral', 'Host Microbial Interactions', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/genetics/metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Serogroup', 'Sf9 Cells', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/09/17 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.001396 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2020 Apr;101(4):366-384. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.001396.

Although there are many genetic and cytogenetic prognostic factors for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), prognosis is difficult to predict because of the heterogeneity of AML. Prognostic factors, including messenger RNA (mRNA) expression, have been determined for other malignancies, but not for AML. A total of 402 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas, GSE12417 (GPL96, 97), and GSE12417 (GPL570) were included in this study. In Kaplan-Meier curve analyses, high expression of family with sequence similarity 213 member A (FAM213A), which activates antioxidant proteins, was associated with worse prognosis of AML. Similar to the results of the survival curve, C-indices and area under the curve values were high. Current prognostic factors of AML, unlike those of other cancers, do not take mRNA expression into consideration. Thus, the development of mRNA-based prognostic factors would be beneficial for accurate prediction of the survival of AML patients. Additionally, in vivo validation using zebrafish revealed that fam213a is important for myelopoiesis at the developmental stage and is a negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The findings implicate fam213a as a novel prognostic factor for AML patients.","['Oh, Chang-Kyu', 'Ha, Mihyang', 'Han, Myoung-Eun', 'Heo, Hye J', 'Myung, Kyungjae', 'Lee, Yoonsung', 'Oh, Sae-Ock', 'Kim, Yun Hak']","['Oh CK', 'Ha M', 'Han ME', 'Heo HJ', 'Myung K', 'Lee Y', 'Oh SO', 'Kim YH']","['Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Interdisplinary Program of Genomic Science, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Center for Genomic Integrity, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), Ulsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.', 'Biomedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Busan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Pusan National University, Yangsan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200318,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zebrafish']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2728 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;38(3):381-389. doi: 10.1002/hon.2728.

The present study investigated the involvement of the cofilin 1 signaling pathway in diallyl disulfide (DADS)induced differentiation and the inhibitory effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human leukemia HL60 cells. First, it was identified that 8 microM DADS suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced differentiation based on the reduced nitroblue tetrazolium ability and increased CD11b and CD33 expression. DADS significantly downregulated the expression of cofilin 1 and phosphorylated cofilin 1 in HL60 leukemia cells. Second, it was verified that silencing cofilin 1 markedly promoted 8 microM DADSinduced differentiation and the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and invasion. Overexpression of cofilin 1 obviously suppressed 8 microM DADSinduced differentiation and the inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and invasion. Third, the present study examined the mechanisms by which 8 microM DADS decreases cofilin 1 expression and activation. The results revealed that 8 microM DADS inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of Rac1, Rhoassociated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) as well as the phosphorylation of LIMK1 in HL60 cells, while 8 microM DADS enhanced the effects of the Rac1ROCK1LIMK1 pathway in cells overexpressing cofilin 1 compared with that in control HL60 cells. These results suggest that the anticancer function of DADS on HL60 leukemia cells is regulated by the Rac1ROCK1LIMK1cofilin 1 pathway, indicating that DADS could be a promising antileukemia therapeutic compound.","['Ling, Hui', 'Ji, Xiaoxia', 'Lei, Yanping', 'Jia, Yanhong', 'Liu, Fang', 'Xia, Hong', 'Tan, Hui', 'Zeng, Xi', 'Yi, Lan', 'He, Jie', 'Su, Qi']","['Ling H', 'Ji X', 'Lei Y', 'Jia Y', 'Liu F', 'Xia H', 'Tan H', 'Zeng X', 'Yi L', 'He J', 'Su Q']","['Key Laboratory of Tumor Cellular and Molecular Pathology (University of South China), College of Hunan Province, Cancer Research Institute, Hengyang Medical College, University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan 421001, P.R.

IFIT2 expression levels were restored in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. To investigate the effect of IFIT2 on CML patients, a stable IFIT2 expressing K562 cell line was established. It was demonstrated that IFIT2 overexpression in K562 cells inhibits cell proliferation and arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase. In addition, it was demonstrated by western blotting that IFIT2 inhibits the BCRABL oncoprotein and regulates its downstream AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. IFIT2 could induce cell cycle arrestassociated gene p27kip1 by degrading cullin1mediated E3 ligases. In summary, the present study demonstrated that IFIT2 was efficacious in inhibiting CML and is a potential therapeutic target.","['Zhang, Zhanglin', 'Li, Na', 'Liu, Shuyuan', 'Jiang, Mei', 'Wan, Jinghua', 'Zhang, Yonglu', 'Wan, Lagen', 'Xie, Caifeng', 'Le, Aiping']","['Zhang Z', 'Li N', 'Liu S', 'Jiang M', 'Wan J', 'Zhang Y', 'Wan L', 'Xie C', 'Le A']","['Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang, Jiangxi 330006, P.R.

Inter-individual differences in the metabolism of these drugs greatly influence the risk of thiopurine induced toxicity and therapy failure. These differences are the consequence of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic variability among patients. Pharmacogenomics aims to individualize therapy according to the specific genetic signature of a patient. Treatment protocols based on thiopurine drugs have already been improved by applying pharmacogenomics in pediatric clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to summarize the application of thiopurine pharmacogenomics in pediatric patients suffering from acute leukemias, different types of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as in posttransplant care. METHODS: We searched PubMed/Medline database to identify thiopurine pharmacogenomic markers clinically relevant in pediatric diseases. RESULTS: TPMT and NUDT15 pharmacogenomic testing is done in pediatric care, contributing to the reduction of thiopurine induced toxicity. Data on numerous novel potential pharmacogenomic markers relevant for optimization of thiopurine treatment are still controversial (ITPA, ABCC4, NT5C2, PRPS1, GSTM1, FTO gene variants). Majority of evidences regarding thiopurine pharmacogenomics in pediatrics have been acquired by studying acute lymphoblastic leukemia and inflammatory bowel disease. For other pediatric diseases, namely acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, juvenile autoimmune hepatitis and renal allograft transplantation, data are still scarce. CONCLUSION: Thiopurine pharmacogenomics has shown to be one of the best examples of successful application of pharmacogenomics in pediatrics.","['Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Kotur, Nikola', 'Stankovic, Biljana', 'Gasic, Vladimir', 'Lucafo, Marianna', 'Decorti, Giuliana', 'Zukic, Branka']","['Pavlovic S', 'Kotur N', 'Stankovic B', 'Gasic V', 'Lucafo M', 'Decorti G', 'Zukic B']","['Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Health Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health - IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', 'Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Drug Metab,Current drug metabolism,100960533,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Azathioprine/*therapeutic use', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pediatrics/methods', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2020/03/04 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['CDM-EPUB-104964 [pii]', '10.2174/1389200221666200303113456 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Metab. 2020;21(1):53-62. doi: 10.2174/1389200221666200303113456.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Thiopurine drugs', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'inflammatory bowel diseases', 'pediatrics', 'personalized medicine', 'pharmacogenomics.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate ET diagnosis and treatment in a pediatric cohort. PROCEDURE: Data of patients with ET from three hospitals were reviewed. Molecular diagnosis included JAK2V617F, CALR, and MPL mutations. Patients were evaluated for acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS). Follow-up included clinical symptoms, adverse events, and treatment. RESULTS: Twelve children (median age: 8 years, range 1-14.5) were included. Mean lag period between the first documentation of thrombocytosis until ET diagnosis was 36 months. Six patients were positive for JAK2V617F and two for CALR mutations. In six of nine patients, AVWS was diagnosed. At diagnosis, only 33% of patients started therapy with aspirin (n = 4) and hydroxyurea (n = 2). In three of eight untreated patients, therapy was added during follow-up. The cohort was followed for a median of 32.5 months (range: 4-108 months). Clinical follow-up disclosed vascular complications in 4 of 12 patients (deep vein thrombosis, n = 1; transient ischemic attack, n = 3). Two females experienced excessive bleeding; both were diagnosed with AVWS. Neither leukemia nor myelofibrosis evolved in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Increased awareness to pediatric ET is warranted, as delayed diagnosis is common. Compared to adults, AVWS may be more prevalent among children with ET.","['Barg, Assaf Arie', 'Toren, Amos', 'Tamary, Hannah', 'Yacobovich, Joanne', 'Steinberg-Shemer, Orna', 'Gilad, Oded', 'Goldstein, Gal', 'Miskin, Hagit', 'Revel-Vilk, Shoshana', 'Rosenbeg, Nurit', 'Kenet, Gili', 'Zemer, Vered Shkalim']","['Barg AA', 'Toren A', 'Tamary H', 'Yacobovich J', 'Steinberg-Shemer O', 'Gilad O', 'Goldstein G', 'Miskin H', 'Revel-Vilk S', 'Rosenbeg N', 'Kenet G', 'Zemer VS']","['Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'The Israeli National Hemophilia Center, Thrombosis Unit and Amalia Biron Research Institute of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petach Tikva, Israel."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology & BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat-Gan, Israel."", 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'The Israeli National Hemophilia Center, Thrombosis Unit and Amalia Biron Research Institute of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'The Israeli National Hemophilia Center, Thrombosis Unit and Amalia Biron Research Institute of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Clalit Health Services, Petach Tikva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20200302,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*genetics/therapy']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28183 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 May;67(5):e28183. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28183.

They are often associated with neutropenia and responsive to immunosuppression. The true nature of this entity is not well understood. Some cases are reported as reactive phenomena with very limited experience in pediatric population. METHODS: Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory database has been reviewed retrospectively. Patients with identifiable distinct CD5-dim T-cell population and positive clonal T-cell receptor rearrangement were included in the analysis. Clinical and laboratory data were then reviewed. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of children and young adults with increased peripheral blood clonal T-LGL population characterized by dim CD5 expression with wide range of underlying immune dysregulation/stimulation disorders were reviewed. Extended follow up with repeat testing suggested the reactive nature of persistent clonal T-LGL proliferations in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations indicate that clonal T-LGL proliferations in children and young adults are reactive in nature and some can be persistent with an indolent course with unknown consequentiality. Clonal T-LGL cells could be targeting the most prominent immunogenic stressor(s) involved as a control mechanism.","['Savasan, Sureyya', 'Al-Qanber, Batool', 'Buck, Steven', 'Wakeling, Erin', 'Gadgeel, Manisha']","['Savasan S', 'Al-Qanber B', 'Buck S', 'Wakeling E', 'Gadgeel M']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan."", ""Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Carman and Ann Adams Department of Pediatrics, Karmanos Cancer Center, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan."", 'Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Detroit Medical Center University Laboratories, Detroit, Michigan.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hematology/Oncology Flow Cytometry Laboratory, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens/*metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', '*T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28231 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 May;67(5):e28231. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28231.

The sphingolipid rheostat is proposed to control cell fate through maintaining balance between pro-apoptotic and pro-survival sphingolipids. This balance is regulated by metabolising enzymes involved in sphingolipid production. One such enzyme, sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2), produces pro-survival sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) by phosphorylation of pro-apoptotic sphingosine. Elevated SPHK2 has been found in multiple cancer types and contributes to cell survival, chemotherapeutic resistance and apoptosis resistance. We have previously shown elevation of S1P in large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia serum and cells isolated from patients. Here, we examined SPHK2 expression in LGL leukaemia and found SPHK2 mRNA and protein upregulation in a majority of LGL leukaemia patient samples. Knockdown of SPHK2 with siRNA in LGL leukaemia cell lines decreased proliferation. Additionally, the use of ABC294640 or K145, both SPHK2-specific inhibitors, decreased viability of LGL leukaemia cell lines. ABC294640 selectively induced apoptosis in LGL cell lines and freshly isolated LGL leukaemia patient cells compared to normal controls.

The incidence and risk factors associated with TA-TMA are not well known. A retrospective analysis from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) was conducted including patients receiving allo-HCT between 2008 and 2016, with the primary objective of evaluating the incidence of TA-TMA. Secondary objectives included identification of risk factors associated with TA-TMA, and the impact of TA-TMA on overall survival and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Among 23,665 allo-HCT recipients, the 3-year cumulative incidence of TA-TMA was 3%. Variables independently-associated with increased incidence of TA-TMA included female sex, prior autologous transplant, primary disease (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and severe aplastic anaemia), donor type (mismatched or unrelated donor), conditioning intensity (myeloablative), GVHD prophylaxis (sirolimus + calcineurin inhibitor), pre-transplant kidney dysfunction and acute GVHD (time-varying effect). TA-TMA was associated with higher mortality (HR = 3.1, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 2.8-16.3) and RRT requirement (HR = 7.1, 95% CI = 5.7-311.6). This study provides epidemiologic data on TA-TMA and its impact on transplant outcomes. Increased awareness of the risk factors will enable providers to be vigilant of this uncommon but serious transplant complication. The results will also provide benchmarking for future study designs and comparisons.","['Epperla, Narendranath', 'Li, Ang', 'Logan, Brent', 'Fretham, Caitrin', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Chee, Lynette', 'Copelan, Edward', 'Freytes, Cesar O', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Prestidge, Tim', 'Saber, Wael', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'Yared, Jean A', 'Loren, Alison', 'Pasquini, Marcelo']","['Epperla N', 'Li A', 'Logan B', 'Fretham C', 'Chhabra S', 'Aljurf M', 'Chee L', 'Copelan E', 'Freytes CO', 'Hematti P', 'Lazarus HM', 'Litzow M', 'Nishihori T', 'Olsson RF', 'Prestidge T', 'Saber W', 'Wirk B', 'Yared JA', 'Loren A', 'Pasquini M']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Equity, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), National Marrow Donor Program/Be The Match, Minneapolis, MN.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Department of Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital Center & Research, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Royal Melbourne Hospital City Campus, Victoria, Australia.', 'Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Carolinas HealthCare System, Charlotte, NC.', 'Texas Transplant Institute, San Antonio, TX.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI.', 'Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Transplant Center, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN.', 'Department of Blood & Marrow Transplant and Cellular Immunotherapy (BMT CI), Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm.', 'Centre for Clinical Research Sormland, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', ""Blood and Cancer Centre, Starship Children's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand."", 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.', 'Division of Bone Marrow Transplant, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA.', 'Blood & Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Twin Study']",20200302,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', '*Thrombotic Microangiopathies/etiology/mortality/therapy', '*Twins', '*Unrelated Donors']",2020/03/04 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16457 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jun;189(6):1171-1181. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16457.

Here, we used next-generation sequencing to evaluate the mutational profile of 166 low-risk AML patients: 30 core-binding factor (CBF)-AMLs, 33 nucleophosmin (NPM1)-AMLs, 4 biCEBPalpha-AMLs and 101 acute promyelocytic leukaemias (APLs). Functional categories of mutated genes differed among subgroups. NPM1-AMLs showed frequent variations in DNA-methylation genes (DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2) (79%), although without prognostic impact. Within this group, splicing-gene mutations were an independent factor for relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS). In CBF-AML, poor independent factors for RFS and OS were mutations in RAS pathway and cohesin genes, respectively. In APL, the mutational profile differed according to the risk groups. High-risk APLs showed a high mutation rate in cell-signalling genes (P = 0.002), highlighting an increased incidence of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) (65%, P < 0.0001). Remarkably, in low-risk APLs (n = 28), NRAS mutations were strongly correlated with a shorter five-year RFS (25% vs. 100%, P < 0.0001). Overall, a high number of mutations (>/=3) was the worst prognostic factor RFS (HR = 2.6, P = 0.003). These results suggest that gene mutations may identify conventional low-risk AML patients with poor prognosis and might be useful for better risk stratification and treatment decisions.","['Prieto-Conde, Maria Isabel', 'Jimenez, Cristina', 'Garcia-Alvarez, Maria', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Medina, Alejandro', 'Cuello, Rebeca', 'Balanzategui, Ana', 'Alonso, Jose M', 'Sarasquete, Maria Eugenia', 'Queizan, Jose Antonio', 'Alcoceba, Miguel', 'Barez, Abelardo', 'Puig, Noemi', 'Cantalapiedra, Alberto', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Gonzalez-Diaz, Marcos', 'Chillon, Maria Carmen']","['Prieto-Conde MI', 'Jimenez C', 'Garcia-Alvarez M', 'Ramos F', 'Medina A', 'Cuello R', 'Balanzategui A', 'Alonso JM', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Queizan JA', 'Alcoceba M', 'Barez A', 'Puig N', 'Cantalapiedra A', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Gonzalez-Diaz M', 'Chillon MC']","['Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Virgen Blanca de Leon, Leon, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Rio Carrion de Palencia, Palencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Nuestra Senora de Sonsoles de Avila, Avila, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Rio Hortega, Valladolid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, IBSAL, CIBERONC and Center for Cancer Research-IBMCC (USAL-CSIC), University Hospital of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Risk Factors']",2020/03/04 06:00,2021/01/13 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16420 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 May;189(4):718-730. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16420.

While dasatinib potently inhibits BCR-ABL1, it is not a highly selective kinase inhibitor and may have off-target effects. A neonatal rat cardiac myocyte model was used to investigate potential mechanisms by which dasatinib damaged myocytes. The anthracycline cardioprotective drug dexrazoxane was shown to be ineffective in preventing dasatinib-induced myocyte damage. Dasatinib treatment increased doxorubicin accumulation in myocytes and doxorubicin-induced myocyte damage, likely through its ability to bind to one or more ABC-type efflux transporters. Dasatinib induced myocyte damage either after a brief treatment that mimicked the clinical situation, or more potently after continuous treatment. Dasatinib slightly induced apoptosis in myocytes as evidenced by increases in caspase-3/7 activity. Dasatinib treatment reduced pERK levels in myocytes most likely through inhibition of RAF, which dasatinib strongly inhibits. Thus, inhibition of the RAF/MEK/ERK pro-survival pathway in the heart may be, in part, a mechanism by which dasatinib induces cardiovascular toxicity.","['Hasinoff, Brian B', 'Patel, Daywin']","['Hasinoff BB', 'Patel D']","['College of Pharmacy, Apotex Centre, University of Manitoba, 750 McDermot Avenue, Winnipeg, MB, R3E 0T5, Canada.

However, the impact on late mortality in this population is largely unexamined. We investigated temporal trends in mortality among 5-year AYA cancer survivors. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify AYAs (age 15-39 years) diagnosed with cancer during 1975-2011 who survived at least 5 years beyond diagnosis. Survival months were accrued from 5 years postdiagnosis until death or the end of 2016. Cumulative mortality from all causes, the primary cancer, other cancers, and noncancer or nonexternal causes (ie, excluding accidents, suicide, homicide) were estimated according to diagnosis era. RESULTS: Among 282 969 five-year AYA cancer survivors, 5-year mortality (ie, from 5 through 10 years postdiagnosis) from all-causes decreased from 8.3% (95% confidence interval = 8.0% to 8.6%) among those diagnosed in 1975-1984 to 5.4% (95% confidence interval = 5.3% to 5.6%) among those diagnosed in 2005-2011. This was largely explained by decreases in mortality from the primary cancer (6.8% to 4.2%) between these periods. However, for specific cancer types, including colorectal, bone, sarcomas, cervical/uterine, and bladder, cumulative mortality curves demonstrated little improvement in primary cancer mortality over time. Some reduction in late mortality from noncancer or nonexternal causes was apparent for Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, kidney cancer, head and neck cancers, and trachea, lung, and bronchus cancers. CONCLUSION: Over the past four decades, all-cause and cancer-specific mortality have decreased among 5-year AYA cancer survivors overall, but several cancer types have not shared in these improvements.","['Anderson, Chelsea', 'Nichols, Hazel B']","['Anderson C', 'Nichols HB']","['American Cancer Society, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/04 06:00,2021/04/20 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['5739965 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djaa014 [doi]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2020 Oct 1;112(10):994-1002. doi: 10.1093/jnci/djaa014.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

However, the underlying cause of the oncogenic effect of Arg882His in DNMT3A is not fully understood. Here, we discovered that DNMT3A WT enzyme under conditions that favor non-cooperative kinetic mechanism as well as DNMT3A Arg882His variant acquire CpG flanking sequence preference akin to that of DNMT3B, which is non-cooperative. We tested if DNMT3A Arg882His could preferably methylate DNMT3B-specific target sites in vivo. Rescue experiments in Dnmt3a/3b double knockout mouse embryonic stem cells show that the corresponding Arg878His mutation in mouse DNMT3A severely impairs its ability to methylate major satellite DNA, a DNMT3A-preferred target, but has no overt effect on the ability to methylate minor satellite DNA, a DNMT3B-preferred target. We also observed a previously unappreciated CpG flanking sequence bias in major and minor satellite repeats that is consistent with DNMT3A and DNMT3B specificity suggesting that DNA methylation patterns are guided by the sequence preference of these enzymes. We speculate that aberrant methylation of DNMT3B target sites could contribute to the oncogenic potential of DNMT3A AML variant.","['Norvil, Allison B', 'AlAbdi, Lama', 'Liu, Bigang', 'Tu, Yu Han', 'Forstoffer, Nicole E', 'Michie, Amie R', 'Chen, Taiping', 'Gowher, Humaira']","['Norvil AB', 'AlAbdi L', 'Liu B', 'Tu YH', 'Forstoffer NE', 'Michie AR', 'Chen T', 'Gowher H']","['Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Basic Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX 78957, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Epigenetics and Molecular Carcinogenesis, Division of Basic Sciences, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Smithville, TX 78957, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA methyltransferase 3B)']",IM,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Arginine', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA, Satellite/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein/genetics', 'Substrate Specificity']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['5775308 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkaa139 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Apr 17;48(7):3761-3775. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa139.,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI121403/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM118654/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Histone cell cycle regulator A (HIRA), a histone chaperone, regulates hemogenic to hematopoietic transition involved in normal hematopoiesis. But, its role remains unexplored in leukemia, a case of dysregulated hematopoiesis. Here, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database analysis showed enhanced HIRA mRNA expression in cells of hematopoietic and lymphoid origin with maximal expression in the chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line, K562. This observation was further endorsed by the induced expression of HIRA in CML patient samples compared to healthy individuals and Acute Myeloid Leukemia patients. Downregulation of HIRA in K562 cells displayed cell cycle arrest, loss in proliferation, presence of polyploidy with significant increase in CD41(+) population thereby limiting proliferation but inducing differentiation of leukemia cells to megakaryocyte fate. Induced megakaryocyte differentiation of mouse Hira-knockout hematopoietic progenitors in vivo further confirmed the in vitro findings in leukemia cells. Molecular analysis showed the involvement of MKL1/GATA2/H3.3 axis in dictating differentiation of CML cells to megakaryocytes. Thus, HIRA could be exploited for differentiation induction therapy in CML and in chronic pathological conditions involving low platelet counts.","['Majumder, Aditi', 'Dharan, Arya T', 'Baral, Ishita', 'Varghese, Pallavi Chinnu', 'Mukherjee, Ananda', 'Subhadradevi, Lakshmi', 'Narayanan, Geetha', 'Dutta, Debasree']","['Majumder A', 'Dharan AT', 'Baral I', 'Varghese PC', 'Mukherjee A', 'Subhadradevi L', 'Narayanan G', 'Dutta D']","['Regenerative Biology Program Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology Thiruvananthapuram India.', 'Manipal Academy of Higher Education Manipal India.', 'Regenerative Biology Program Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology Thiruvananthapuram India.', 'Regenerative Biology Program Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology Thiruvananthapuram India.', 'Manipal Academy of Higher Education Manipal India.', 'Regenerative Biology Program Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology Thiruvananthapuram India.', 'Manipal Academy of Higher Education Manipal India.', 'Cancer Research Program Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology Thiruvananthapuram India.', 'Department of Cancer Research Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Campus Thiruvananthapuram India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology Regional Cancer Centre, Medical College Campus Thiruvananthapuram India.', 'Regenerative Biology Program Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology Thiruvananthapuram India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190814,United States,FASEB Bioadv,FASEB bioAdvances,101733210,,,,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:01,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1096/fba.2019-00014 [doi]', 'FBA21077 [pii]']",epublish,FASEB Bioadv. 2019 Aug 14;1(9):525-537. doi: 10.1096/fba.2019-00014. eCollection 2019 Sep.,,,['(c) 2019 The Authors.'],PMC6996362,,['NOTNLM'],"['GATA2', 'MKL1', 'hematopoietic precursors', 'histone variant H3.3', 'proliferation']",,,['The authors declare that we have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of Kras in differentiation of myeloid cells remains unclear. This study showed the involvement of Kras in a novel regulatory mechanism underlying the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation of human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. Kras was found to positively regulate DMSO-induced differentiation, with the activity of Kras increasing upon DMSO. Inhibition of Kras attenuated CD11b expression in differentiated HL-60 cells. GSK3beta, an important component of Wnt signaling, was found to be a downstream signal of Kras. Phosphorylation of GSK3beta was markedly enhanced by DMSO treatment. Moreover, inhibition of GSK3beta enhanced CD11b expression and triggered the accumulation in the nucleus of beta-catenin and Tcf in response to DMSO. Inhibitors of beta-catenin-mediated pathways blocked CD11b expression, further indicating that beta-catenin is involved in the differentiation of HL-60 cells. Elevated expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPvarepsilon accompanied by the expression of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor was observed during differentiation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Kras engages in cross talk with the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway upon DMSO treatment of HL-60 cells, thereby regulating the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. These results indicate that Kras acts as a tumor suppressor during the differentiation of myeloid cells.","['Yokoyama, Noriko', 'Kim, Yeon-Jeong', 'Hirabayashi, Yoshio', 'Tabe, Yoko', 'Takamori, Kenji', 'Ogawa, Hideoki', 'Iwabuchi, Kazuhisa']","['Yokoyama N', 'Kim YJ', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Tabe Y', 'Takamori K', 'Ogawa H', 'Iwabuchi K']","['Institute for Environmental and Gender Specific Medicine Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine Urayasu Chiba Japan.', 'Laboratory for Neuronal Growth Mechanisms Riken Brain Science Institutes Saitama Japan.', 'Institute for Environmental and Gender Specific Medicine Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine Urayasu Chiba Japan.', 'Cellular Informatics Laboratory RIKEN Wako Saitama Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine Juntendo University School of Medicine Hospital Hongo Tokyo Japan.', 'Institute for Environmental and Gender Specific Medicine Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine Urayasu Chiba Japan.', 'Institute for Environmental and Gender Specific Medicine Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine Urayasu Chiba Japan.', 'Institute for Environmental and Gender Specific Medicine Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine Urayasu Chiba Japan.', 'Infection Control Nursing Juntendo University Graduate School of Health Care and Nursing Urayasu Chiba Japan.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry Juntendo University Faculty of Health Care and Nursing Urayasu Chiba Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190701,United States,FASEB Bioadv,FASEB bioAdvances,101733210,,,,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:01,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1096/fba.2019-00004 [doi]', 'FBA21055 [pii]']",epublish,FASEB Bioadv. 2019 Jul 1;1(7):435-449. doi: 10.1096/fba.2019-00004. eCollection 2019 Jul.,,,['(c) 2019 The Authors.'],PMC6996383,,['NOTNLM'],"['GSK3beta', 'HL-60 cell differentiation', 'Wnt/beta-catenin', 'tumor suppressor', 'wild-type Kras']",,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the expression of miR-27b, miR-29a, and miR-155, their prognostic roles, and their potential targets in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and breast cancer (BC) by qRT-PCR were investigated. In two case-control studies, qRT-PCR was used to analyze the peripheral blood serum of 15 CLL patients and tissue samples of 15 BC patients for the expression of miR-27b, miR-29a, and miR-155. miRNA expression levels were calculated using the qRT-PCR method. The results revealed a significant increase in the expression of all miRNAs in patients with BC and CLL compared with respective healthy groups (p < 0.001). In BC patients, there was a significant difference between the expression of miR-155 and miR-29a (p < 0.05), miR-155 and miR-27b (p < 0.01), and miR-27b and miR-29a (p < 0.001). In CLL patients, a significant difference between expression of both miR-27b and miR-29a compared with expression of miR-155 (p < 0.001) was found. Furthermore, a significant association between miR-155 and prevascular invasion was found. Significantly, elevated circulating miRNAs were shown to be BC specific and could differentiate BC tissues from the controls. It was demonstrated that miRNAs used in this study and their expression profiles can be developed as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis of CLL and BC. Further studies utilizing a larger test group of patients would provide identification of miRNAs as key players in intercellular interactions.","['Raeisi, Farzaneh', 'Mahmoudi, Esmaeil', 'Dehghani-Samani, Mina', 'Hosseini, Seyedeh Sahar Ebrahimi', 'Ghahfarrokhi, Ameneh Mehri', 'Arshi, Asghar', 'Forghanparast, Kayvan', 'Ghazanfari, Samaneh']","['Raeisi F', 'Mahmoudi E', 'Dehghani-Samani M', 'Hosseini SSE', 'Ghahfarrokhi AM', 'Arshi A', 'Forghanparast K', 'Ghazanfari S']","['Young Researchers and Elite Club, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shahrekord, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Physics, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Young Researchers and Elite Club, Shahrekord Branch, Islamic Azad University, Shahrekord, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Shahrekord University, Shahrekord, Iran.', 'Biotechnology Research Center, Bushehr Branch, Persian Gulf University, Bushehr, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, Basic Health Sciences Institute, Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran.', 'Young Researchers and Elite Club, Najafabad Branch, Islamic Azad University, Najafabad, Iran.', 'Canoga Park Urgent Care Family Medicine, 20905 Sherman Way, Canoga Park, CA 91303, USA.', 'Aachen-Maastricht Institute for Biobased Materials, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Maastricht University, Geleen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biohybrid & Medical Textiles (Biotex), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200123,United States,Mol Ther Oncolytics,Molecular therapy oncolytics,101666776,,,,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:01,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.omto.2020.01.004 [doi]', 'S2372-7705(20)30012-7 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Ther Oncolytics. 2020 Jan 23;16:230-237. doi: 10.1016/j.omto.2020.01.004. eCollection 2020 Mar 27.,,,['(c) 2020.'],PMC7037977,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'biomarker', 'breast cancer', 'miRNAs', 'qRT-PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the real role of AZT in this effect is still unclear. In fact, while reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibition could explain reduction of clonal expansion and of renewal of HTLV-1 infected cells during ATL progression, this effect alone seems insufficient to justify the evident and prompt decrease of the pro-viral load in treated patients. We have previously demonstrated that AZT is endowed with an intrinsic pro-apoptotic potential towards both peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors or some tumor cell lines, but this cytotoxic potential cannot be fully achieved unless IkappaBalpha phosphorylation is inhibited. Since the constitutive activation of NF-kappa B (NF-kappaB) appears a common biological basis of HTLV-1-infected cells, a pharmacological inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation seems a potential strategy for treating and preventing HTLV-1 related pathologies. In this study, we have demonstrated that a combination treatment with the IkappaBalpha phosphorylation inhibitor Bay 11-7085 and AZT induced increased levels of regulated cell death (RCD) by apoptosis compared to the single treatments in HTLV-1 infected cells of different origin. Importantly, levels of RCD were considerably higher in infected cells in comparison with the uninfected ones. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activation following the combined treatment was confirmed by analysis of both gel-shift and functional activity of the NF-kappaB complex proteins, p65/p52. Moreover, a transcriptional analysis revealed that the addition of Bay 11-7085 to AZT treatment in HTLV-1-infected cells modified their transcriptional profile, by inducing the upregulation of some pro-apoptotic genes together with the downregulation of some anti-apoptotic genes. Our data suggest that addition of adequate concentrations of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation inhibitor to therapeutic regimens including AZT could be a promising strategy in ATL.","['Matteucci, Claudia', 'Marino-Merlo, Francesca', 'Minutolo, Antonella', 'Balestrieri, Emanuela', 'Valletta, Elena', 'Macchi, Beatrice', 'Mastino, Antonio', 'Grelli, Sandro']","['Matteucci C', 'Marino-Merlo F', 'Minutolo A', 'Balestrieri E', 'Valletta E', 'Macchi B', 'Mastino A', 'Grelli S']","['1Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.0000 0001 2300 0941grid.6530.0', '2IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo, Messina, Italy.grid.419419.0', '1Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.0000 0001 2300 0941grid.6530.0', '1Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.0000 0001 2300 0941grid.6530.0', '1Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.0000 0001 2300 0941grid.6530.0', '3Department of Chemical Science and Technologies, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.0000 0001 2300 0941grid.6530.0', '4Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical, and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, Messina, Italy.0000 0001 2178 8421grid.10438.3e', '5The Institute of Translational Pharmacology, CNR, Rome, Italy.0000 0001 1940 4177grid.5326.2', '1Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Rome, Italy.0000 0001 2300 0941grid.6530.0']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200218,United States,Cell Death Discov,Cell death discovery,101665035,,,,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:01,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41420-020-0243-x [doi]', '243 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Discov. 2020 Feb 18;6:9. doi: 10.1038/s41420-020-0243-x. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],PMC7028944,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer therapy', 'Preclinical research']",,,['Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Towards this goal, it is essential to develop strategies to activate C-H bonds that are distal from a functional group. In this context, distinguishing remote C-H bonds on adjacent carbon atoms is an extraordinary challenge due to the lack of electronic or steric bias between the two positions. Herein, we report the design of a catalytic system leveraging a remote directing template and a transient norbornene mediator to selectively activate a previously inaccessible remote C-H bond that is one bond further away. The generality of this approach has been demonstrated with a range of heterocycles, including a complex anti-leukaemia agent and hydrocinnamic acid substrates.","['Shi, Hang', 'Lu, Yi', 'Weng, Jiang', 'Bay, Katherine L', 'Chen, Xiangyang', 'Tanaka, Keita', 'Verma, Pritha', 'Houk, Kendall N', 'Yu, Jin-Quan']","['Shi H', 'Lu Y', 'Weng J', 'Bay KL', 'Chen X', 'Tanaka K', 'Verma P', 'Houk KN', 'Yu JQ']","['The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. houk@chem.ucla.edu.', 'The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA. yu200@scripps.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200302,England,Nat Chem,Nature chemistry,101499734,"['0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Norbornanes)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)', '7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)']",IM,"['Carbon/*chemistry', 'Catalysis', 'Coordination Complexes/chemistry', 'Hydrogen/*chemistry', 'Isoquinolines/*chemistry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Norbornanes/chemistry', 'Palladium/chemistry', 'Quinolines/*chemistry']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41557-020-0424-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41557-020-0424-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Chem. 2020 Apr;12(4):399-404. doi: 10.1038/s41557-020-0424-5.

However, a long-standing question is how well these cell lines truly represent tumor cells in patients. Here, we employ a recently described method of transcriptional correlation profiling to compare similarity of 66 MM cell lines to 779 newly diagnosed MM patient tumors. We found that individual MM lines differ significantly with respect to patient tumor representation, with median R ranging from 0.35 to 0.54. ANBL-6 was the ""best"" line, markedly exceeding all others (p < 2.2e-16). Notably, some widely used cell lines (RPMI-8226, U-266) scored poorly in our patient similarity ranking (48 and 52 of 66, respectively). Lines cultured with interleukin-6 showed significantly improved correlations with patient tumor (p = 9.5e-4). When common MM genomic features were matched between cell lines and patients, only t(4;14) and t(14;16) led to increased transcriptional correlation. To demonstrate the utility of our top-ranked line for preclinical studies, we showed that intravenously implanted ANBL-6 proliferates in hematopoietic organs in immunocompromised mice. Overall, our large-scale quantitative correlation analysis, utilizing emerging datasets, provides a resource informing the MM community of cell lines that may be most reliable for modeling patient disease while also elucidating biological differences between cell lines and tumors.","['Sarin, Vishesh', 'Yu, Katharine', 'Ferguson, Ian D', 'Gugliemini, Olivia', 'Nix, Matthew A', 'Hann, Byron', 'Sirota, Marina', 'Wiita, Arun P']","['Sarin V', 'Yu K', 'Ferguson ID', 'Gugliemini O', 'Nix MA', 'Hann B', 'Sirota M', 'Wiita AP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. arun.wiita@ucsf.edu.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA. arun.wiita@ucsf.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Transcriptome']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0785-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0785-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Oct;34(10):2754-2765. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0785-1.

To identify new culprits which promote and drive ALCL, we performed a total transcriptome sequencing and discovered 1208 previously unknown intergenic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), including 18 lncRNAs preferentially expressed in ALCL. We selected an unknown lncRNA, BlackMamba, with an ALK(-) ALCL preferential expression, for molecular and functional studies. BlackMamba is a chromatin-associated lncRNA regulated by STAT3 via a canonical transcriptional signaling pathway. Knockdown experiments demonstrated that BlackMamba contributes to the pathogenesis of ALCL regulating cell growth and cell morphology. Mechanistically, BlackMamba interacts with the DNA helicase HELLS controlling its recruitment to the promoter regions of cell-architecture-related genes, fostering their expression. Collectively, these findings provide evidence of a previously unknown tumorigenic role of STAT3 via a lncRNA-DNA helicase axis and reveal an undiscovered role for lncRNA in the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype of ALK(-)ALCL.","['Fragliasso, Valentina', 'Verma, Akanksha', 'Manzotti, Gloria', 'Tameni, Annalisa', 'Bareja, Rohan', 'Heavican, Tayla B', 'Iqbal, Javeed', 'Wang, Rui', 'Fiore, Danilo', 'Mularoni, Valentina', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Lhoumaud, Priscillia', 'Skok, Jane', 'Zanetti, Eleonora', 'Merli, Francesco', 'Ciarrocchi, Alessia', 'Elemento, Oliver', 'Inghirami, Giorgio']","['Fragliasso V', 'Verma A', 'Manzotti G', 'Tameni A', 'Bareja R', 'Heavican TB', 'Iqbal J', 'Wang R', 'Fiore D', 'Mularoni V', 'Chan WC', 'Lhoumaud P', 'Skok J', 'Zanetti E', 'Merli F', 'Ciarrocchi A', 'Elemento O', 'Inghirami G']","['Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, 42123, Italy.', 'Institute for Computational Biomedicine & Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10021, USA.', 'Tri-Institutional Training Program in Computational Biology and Medicine, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, 42123, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, 42123, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Medicine PhD Program, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, 41125, Italy.', 'Institute for Computational Biomedicine & Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10021, USA.', 'Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68182, USA.', 'Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68182, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, 42123, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, 91010, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', 'Pathology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, 42123, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, 42123, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Translational Research, Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, 42123, Italy. alessia.ciarrocchi@ausl.re.it.', 'Institute for Computational Biomedicine & Caryl and Israel Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10021, USA. ole2001@med.cornell.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, 10065, USA. ggi9001@med.cornell.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 5.99.- (HELLS protein, human)']",IM,"['Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase/*deficiency', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Clonal Evolution', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/*genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Models, Biological', '*Phenotype', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Interference', '*RNA, Long Noncoding']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0754-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0754-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Nov;34(11):2964-2980. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0754-8.

Recurrent somatic mutations of splicing factor genes are common in some hematologic cancers but are relatively uncommon in acute myeloid leukemia (AML, < 20% of patients). We examined whether RNA splicing differences exist in AML, even in the absence of splicing factor mutations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We developed a bioinformatics pipeline to study alternative RNA splicing in RNA-sequencing data from large cohorts of patients with AML. RESULTS: We have identified recurrent differential alternative splicing between patients with poor and good prognosis. These splicing events occurred even in patients without any discernible splicing factor mutations. Alternative splicing recurrently occurred in genes with specific molecular functions, primarily related to protein translation. Developing tools to predict the functional impact of alternative splicing on the translated protein, we discovered that approximately 45% of the splicing events directly affected highly conserved protein domains. Several splicing factors were themselves misspliced and the splicing of their target transcripts were altered. Studying differential gene expression in the same patients, we identified that alternative splicing of protein translation genes in ELN(Adv) patients resulted in the induction of an integrated stress response and upregulation of inflammation-related genes. Finally, using machine learning techniques, we identified a splicing signature of four genes which refine the accuracy of existing risk prognosis schemes and validated it in a completely independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Our discoveries therefore identify aberrant alternative splicing as a molecular feature of adverse AML with clinical relevance.See related commentary by Bowman, p. 3503.","['Anande, Govardhan', 'Deshpande, Nandan P', 'Mareschal, Sylvain', 'Batcha, Aarif M N', 'Hampton, Henry R', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Lehmann, Soren', 'Wilkins, Marc R', 'Wong, Jason W H', 'Unnikrishnan, Ashwin', 'Pimanda, John E']","['Anande G', 'Deshpande NP', 'Mareschal S', 'Batcha AMN', 'Hampton HR', 'Herold T', 'Lehmann S', 'Wilkins MR', 'Wong JWH', 'Unnikrishnan A', 'Pimanda JE']","['Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre & Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Hematology Centre, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Medical Data Processing, Biometrics and Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Data Integration for Future Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre & Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany.', 'Hematology Centre, Karolinska University Hospital and Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre & Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Adult Cancer Program, Lowy Cancer Research Centre & Prince of Wales Clinical School, University of New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

The purpose is to determine the clinical relevance of SNPs identified through the use of HapMap lymphoblastoid cell-based models, in predicting cytarabine response and toxicity in AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested clinical significance of SNPs associated with cytarabine sensitivity in children with AML treated on Children's Oncology Group regimens (CCG 2941/2961). Endpoints included overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and TRM. Patients who received bone marrow transplant were excluded. We tested 124 SNPs associated with cytarabine sensitivity in HapMap cell lines in 348 children to determine whether any associated with treatment outcomes. In addition, we tested five SNPs previously associated with TRM in children with AML in our independent dataset of 385 children. RESULTS: Homozygous variant genotypes of rs2025501 and rs6661575 had increased in vitro cellular sensitivity to cytarabine and were associated with increased TRM. TRM was particularly increased in children with variant genotype randomized to high-dose cytarabine (rs2025501: P = 0.0024 and rs6661575 P = 0.0188). In analysis of previously reported SNPs, only the variant genotype rs17202778 C/C was significantly associated with TRM (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We report clinical importance of two SNPs not previously associated with cytarabine toxicity. Moreover, we confirm that SNP rs17202778 significantly impacts TRM in pediatric AML. Cytarabine sensitivity genotypes may predict TRM and could be used to stratify to standard versus high-dose cytarabine regimens, warranting further study in prospective AML trials.","['Phillips, Christine L', 'Lane, Adam', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Wilkey, Alyss', 'Radloff, Gretchen', 'Lange, Beverly', 'Gamazon, Eric R', 'Dolan, M Eileen', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Phillips CL', 'Lane A', 'Gerbing RB', 'Alonzo TA', 'Wilkey A', 'Radloff G', 'Lange B', 'Gamazon ER', 'Dolan ME', 'Davies SM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.

Although transplacental infection is considered the predominant route of vertical transmission of BLV, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain to be elucidated. Notably, how BLV passes through the blood-placental barrier remains unclear, given that BLV is transmitted primarily by cell-to-cell contact. One hypothesis is that B cell migration to the placenta may be induced by certain endometrium-expressed chemokines. To test this hypothesis, we performed an in vitro cell migration assay using bovine B cell lines and endometrial epithelial cells. Cell migration assays showed that two bovine B cell lines, BL2M3 and BL3.1 cells, were attracted to the supernatant of bovine endometrial epithelial cells (BEnEpCs). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that expression levels of mRNAs encoding the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10 were higher in BEnEpCs than in MDBK cells. Additionally, an inhibition assay using immune serum against CCL2 and CXCL10 showed suppression of migration of bovine B cell lines. A syncytium assay showed that cells expressing BLV envelope (Env) protein fused with BEnEpCs. Here we found that bovine B cells are attracted by chemokines produced in the endometrium and that cells expressing BLV Env protein fused with endometrium epithelial cells. These results explain part of the molecular mechanism of transplacental transmission during BLV infection, although further analysis will be required. Advances in these areas are expected to contribute to controlling the spread of BLV.","['Andoh, Kiyohiko', 'Nishimori, Asami', 'Sakumoto, Ryosuke', 'Hayashi, Ken-Go', 'Hatama, Shinichi']","['Andoh K', 'Nishimori A', 'Sakumoto R', 'Hayashi KG', 'Hatama S']","['Division of Viral Disease and Epidemiology, National Institute of Animal Health, National Agriculture and Food Research Organization, 3-1-5 Kannondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-0856, Japan.

Recently, this technology has been explored for its potential utility in providing new and unique treatments for viral infection. Marek's disease virus (MDV) and avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J), major immunosuppressive viruses, cause significant economic losses to the chicken industry. Here, we evaluated the efficacy of using MDV as a CRISPR/Cas9-delivery system to directly target and disrupt the reverse-transcribed products of the ALV-J RNA genome during its infection cycle in vitro and in vivo. We first screened multiple potential guide RNA (gRNA) target sites in the ALV-J genome and identified several optimized targets capable of effectively disrupting the latently integrated viral genome and providing efficient defense against new infection by ALV-J in cells. The optimal single-gRNAs and Cas9-expression cassettes were inserted into the genome of an MDV vaccine strain. The results indicated that engineered MDV stably expressing ALV-J-targeting CRISPR/Cas9 ef fi ciently resisted ALV-J challenge in host cells. These findings demonstrated the CRISPR/Cas9 system as an effective treatment strategy against ALV-J infection. Furthermore, the results highlighted the potential of MDV as an effective delivery system for CRISPR/Cas9 in chickens.","['Liu, Yongzhen', 'Xu, Zengkun', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Yu, Mengmeng', 'Wang, Suyan', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Liu, Changjun', 'Zhang, Yanping', 'Gao, Li', 'Qi, Xiaole', 'Cui, Hongyu', 'Pan, Qing', 'Li, Kai', 'Wang, Xiaomei']","['Liu Y', 'Xu Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Yu M', 'Wang S', 'Gao Y', 'Liu C', 'Zhang Y', 'Gao L', 'Qi X', 'Cui H', 'Pan Q', 'Li K', 'Wang X']","[""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China."", ""Avian Immunosuppressive Diseases Division, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, 150069, People's Republic of China.

However, the development of drug resistance greatly limits its application. Overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in many types of cancer is responsible for the reduction of the cellular uptake of various anticancer drugs causing multidrug resistance (MDR), the major obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. Recently, we have obtained a novel synthetic 5-FU analog, U-332 [(R)-3-(4-bromophenyl)-1-ethyl-5-methylidene-6-phenyldihydrouracil], combining a uracil skeleton with an exo-cyclic methylidene group. U-332 was highly cytotoxic for HL-60 cells and showed similar cytotoxicity in the 5-FU resistant subclone (HL-60/5FU), in which this analog almost completely abolished expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, multidrug resistance associate protein 1 (ABCC1). The expression of ABC transporters is usually correlated with NF-kappaB activation. The aim of this study was to determine the level of NF-kappaB subunits in the resistant HL-60/5-FU cells and to evaluate the potential of U-332 to inhibit activation of NF-kappaB family members in this cell line. METHODS: Anti-proliferative activity of compound U-332 was assessed by the MTT assay. In order to disclose the mechanism of U-332 cytotoxicity, quantitative real-time PCR analysis of the NF-kappaB family genes, c-Rel, RelA, RelB, NF-kappaB1, and NF-kappaB2, was investigated. The ability of U-332 to reduce the activity of NF-kappaB members was studied by ELISA test. RESULTS: In this report it was demonstrated, using RT-PCR and ELISA assay, that members of the NF-kappaB family c-Rel, RelA, RelB, NF-kappaB1, and NF-kappaB2 were all overexpressed in the 5-FU-resistant HL-60/5FU cells and that U-332 potently reduced the activity of c-Rel, RelA and NF-kappaB1 subunits in this cell line. CONCLUSIONS: This finding indicates that c-Rel, RelA and NF-kappaB1 subunits are responsible for the resistance of HL-60/5FU cells to 5-FU and that U-332 is able to reverse this resistance. U-332 can be viewed as an important lead compound in the search for novel drug candidates that would not cause multidrug resistance in cancer cells.","['Dlugosz-Pokorska, Angelika', 'Pieta, Marlena', 'Kedzia, Jacek', 'Janecki, Tomasz', 'Janecka, Anna']","['Dlugosz-Pokorska A', 'Pieta M', 'Kedzia J', 'Janecki T', 'Janecka A']","['Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215, Lodz, Poland. anna.janecka@umed.lodz.pl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,England,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,BMC pharmacology & toxicology,101590449,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RELA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fluorouracil', 'Genes, rel', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics', 'Uracil/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/11/26 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40360-020-0397-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s40360-020-0397-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol. 2020 Mar 2;21(1):18. doi: 10.1186/s40360-020-0397-4.,,,,PMC7053076,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ELISA assay', '*Multidrug resistance', '*NF-kappaB subunits', '*Real-time PCR', '*Uracil analog U-332']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No study has focused on the prognostic role of WT1 expression in adult B-ALL patients receiving chemotherapy only.Methods: Using TaqMan-based real time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR), we detected the WT1 transcript levels of 162 de-novo adult B-ALL patients at the time of diagnosis and analysed their clinical features.Results: WT1 overexpression was defined as a transcript level higher than 0.50%, which is the upper limit in normal bone marrow. WT1 overexpression was identified in 66.0% of the patients and was an independent positive prognostic factor for CIR, RFS and OS in patients who received chemotherapy only (CIR: HR = 0.236 [95% confidence interval 0.094-0.592]; P = 0.002; RFS: HR = 0.223 [0.092-0.543]; P = 0.001; OS: HR = 0.409 [0.214-0.783]; P = 0.007) and in patients who did not have BCR-ABL fusion or KMT2A rearrangements (CIR: HR = 0.431 [0.201-0.921]; P = 0.030; RFS: HR = 0.449 [0.224-0.899]; P = 0.024; OS: HR = 0.521 [0.278-0.977]; P = 0.042). However, WT1 overexpression had no prognostic value in patients who received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Furthermore, allo-HSCT could improve the prognosis of patients with low WT1 expression.Conclusion: Therefore, testing for WT1 expression at the time of diagnosis may predict outcomes in adult B-ALL patients who receive only chemotherapy and who do not have the BCR-ABL fusion gene or KMT2A rearrangements. Allo-HSCT may improve the prognosis of patients with low WT1 transcript levels.","['Wang, Shujuan', 'Wang, Chong', 'Li, Tao', 'Wang, Weiqiong', 'Hao, Qianqian', 'Xie, Xinsheng', 'Wan, Dingming', 'Jiang, Zhongxing', 'Liu, Yanfang']","['Wang S', 'Wang C', 'Li T', 'Wang W', 'Hao Q', 'Xie X', 'Wan D', 'Jiang Z', 'Liu Y']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/04 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1735670 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):118-124. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1735670.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Adult', 'BCR-ABL fusion', 'KMT2A rearrangements', 'WT1 expression', 'chemotherapy', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In providing answers to such questions as how to select the donors of MST and which factors were involved in the outcome of MST. One hundred thirty-one AML patients from four centers with lower or standard risk of prognosis after complete remission were given three courses of MST: high dose of cytarabine plus infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-mismatched donors. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival were compared, with respect to gender difference, number of HLA-matched loci, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR), and ligand mismatch between donors and recipients. Median LFS of recipients with different KIR ligands from those of donors was found to be significantly higher than that of recipients having identical ligands with donors (P < 0.05). The mean LFS was statistically different between recipients whose donors had HLA-C1/C2 ligand and those whose donors had C1/C1 or C2/C2 ligand (P < 0.05).

Massive efforts are now being undertaken to reproduce the high efficacy of CAR T cells in the treatment of other malignancies. Here, predictive preclinical model systems are important, and the current gold standard for preclinical evaluation of CAR T cells are mouse xenografts. However, mouse xenograft assays are expensive and slow. Therefore, an additional vertebrate in vivo assay would be beneficial to bridge the gap from in vitro to mouse xenografts. Here, we present a novel assay based on embryonic zebrafish xenografts to investigate CAR T cell-mediated killing of human cancer cells. Using a CD19-specific CAR and Nalm-6 leukemia cells, we show that live observation of killing of Nalm-6 cells by CAR T cells is possible in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, we applied Fiji macros enabling automated quantification of Nalm-6 cells and CAR T cells over time. In conclusion, we provide a proof-of-principle study that embryonic zebrafish xenografts can be used to investigate CAR T cell-mediated killing of tumor cells. This assay is cost-effective, fast, and offers live imaging possibilities to directly investigate CAR T cell migration, engagement, and killing of effector cells.","['Pascoal, Susana', 'Salzer, Benjamin', 'Scheuringer, Eva', 'Wenninger-Weinzierl, Andrea', 'Sturtzel, Caterina', 'Holter, Wolfgang', 'Taschner-Mandl, Sabine', 'Lehner, Manfred', 'Distel, Martin']","['Pascoal S', 'Salzer B', 'Scheuringer E', 'Wenninger-Weinzierl A', 'Sturtzel C', 'Holter W', 'Taschner-Mandl S', 'Lehner M', 'Distel M']","[""Innovative Cancer Models, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Next Generation CAR T Cells, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', ""Development of Cellular Therapeutics, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Innovative Cancer Models, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Innovative Cancer Models, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Innovative Cancer Models, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Development of Cellular Therapeutics, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Tumor Biology, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", 'Christian Doppler Laboratory for Next Generation CAR T Cells, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria.', ""Development of Cellular Therapeutics, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria."", ""Innovative Cancer Models, St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, Zimmermannplatz 10, 1090 Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200229,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/03/04 06:00,2020/03/04 06:01,['2020/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030567 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030567 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Feb 29;12(3). pii: cancers12030567. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030567.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4282-6356'],"['7940628/Osterreichische Forschungsforderungsgesellschaft', 'LS18-111/Vienna Science and Technology Fund', 'W1224/Austrian Science Fund']",,PMC7139560,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T cells', 'CD19 CAR', 'in vivo imaging', 'zebrafish xenografts']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-27 can inhibit tumor growth and progression through direct and indirect mechanisms, such as inhibition of proliferation, angiogenesis, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, and anti-tumor immune response. B-CLL is characterized by remarkable immune perturbation, which leads to disease complications and reduced effectiveness of the treatment. Natural killer cells (NK) are considered as an important arm for the elimination of transformed cells. However, NK cells have shown significant impairment in patients with CLL. Here we analyzed the activity of recombinant human (rh) IL-27-stimulated NK cells in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of CLL patients using cell surface flow cytometry assessment, and cytotoxicity assay. We showed that rhIL-27 can increase CD69 on NK cells both in BM and PB. Interestingly, BM-NK cells treated with rhIL-27 exhibited a significant increase in degranulation and NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity as compared with untreated NK cells, whereas it did not improve NK cell activity of PB. These observations added further explanation to the anti-tumor activity of IL-27 and also could pave the way to adoption immunostimulatory adjuvant for therapies in CLL.","['Hemati, Maral', 'Rasouli Nejad, Zahra', 'Shokri, Mohammad-Reza', 'Ghahremanfard, Farahnaz', 'Mir Mohammadkhani, Majid', 'Kokhaei, Parviz']","['Hemati M', 'Rasouli Nejad Z', 'Shokri MR', 'Ghahremanfard F', 'Mir Mohammadkhani M', 'Kokhaei P']","['Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran; Student Research Committee, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran; Student Research Committee, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Health Research Center of Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Cancer Research Center, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran; Department of Oncology-Pathology, BioClinicum, Karolinska University Hospital Solna and Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

Improvements in pediatric therapy including the addition of L-asparaginase (L-ASP) have enabled cure rates in excess of 90% to be achieved in children. More recently L-ASP-containing pediatric protocols are being used to treat younger adults with ALL and have improved survival by approximately 2-fold. However, a toxicity associated with L-ASP-containing therapy in ALL is venous thromboembolism (VTE) which is associated with significant morbidity in this patient population and results in interruptions in L-ASP therapy that can impact on survival outcomes. The incidence of VTE among adult patients with ALL receiving L-ASP containing therapy has been reported to be as high as 43%. Despite this, there is a lack of evidence-based recommendations for VTE prophylaxis in this clinical context; low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and/or AT replacement have mostly been used. The low-quality data and inconveniences associated with these VTE prophylaxis regimens highlight the need to evaluate alternatives such as direct oral anticoagulants for the prevention of L-ASP-associated VTE in ALL.

Leukotrienes are central to immune responses, but are also involved in inflammatory disorders and 5-LO expression is associated with leukemia stem cell survival. It is therefore important to understand mechanisms that control 5-LO expression. This study investigated the control of 5-LO expression and leukotriene biosynthesis following the maturation of human monocytic cells. MonoMac-1 (MM1) and THP-1 cells were incubated for up to 72 h with or without LPS and TGF-beta. LPS, but not TGF-beta, increased CD14 expression in both MM1 and THP-1 cells. Incubation with LPS (100 ng/ml) and TGF-beta (1 ng/ml) synergistically increased the capacity of MM1 cells to produce 5-LO products from undetectable levels to 40+/-5 pmol/10(6) cells. 5-LO product biosynthesis in THP-1 cells increased 25-fold. A synergistic effect of LPS and TGF-beta was measured with increases in 5-LO mRNA of 54- and 13-fold in MM1 and THP-1 cells, respectively. 5-LO protein expression increased significantly in both MM1 and THP-1 cells. ALOX5 promoter activity was significantly elevated >2-fold in both cell lines following LPS treatment, but TGF-beta was without effect. The main 5-LO products were cysteinyl-leukotrienes, however LPS and TGF-beta did not impact on the capacity of the cells to metabolize leukotriene A4. Overall, this study demonstrates that receptor-mediated stimulation of MM1 and THP-1 cells by LPS is associated with increased 5-LO expression. This represents a new mechanism by which leukotriene biosynthesis can be modulated by pathological agents.","['Poirier, Samuel J', 'Boudreau, Luc H', 'Flamand, Nicolas', 'Surette, Marc E']","['Poirier SJ', 'Boudreau LH', 'Flamand N', 'Surette ME']","[""Departement de chimie et biochimie, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, NB, E1A 3E9, Canada; Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et pneumologie de Quebec-Universite Laval, Departement de medecine, Faculte de medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, G1V 4G5, Canada."", 'Departement de chimie et biochimie, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, NB, E1A 3E9, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de cardiologie et pneumologie de Quebec-Universite Laval, Departement de medecine, Faculte de medecine, Universite Laval, Quebec City, QC, G1V 4G5, Canada."", 'Departement de chimie et biochimie, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, NB, E1A 3E9, Canada.

We identified canonical HOTTIP-HOXA13 targets, CYP26B1, CLIC5, CHI3L1 and UCP2-responsible for cell growth and cell invasion. Genome-wide analysis revealed that 38% of HOTTIP-regulated genes contain H3K4me3 and HOTTIP enrichment at their promoters, without HOXA13 binding. HOTTIP complexes with WDR5-MLL1 to trans-activate oncogenic proteins CYB5R2, SULT1A1, KIF26A, SLC1A4, and TSC22D1 by directly inducing H3K4me3 at their promoters. The WDR5, MLL1, and H3K4me3 levels at their promoters and their expression levels are sensitive to HOTTIP expression. These results indicate the importance of the noncanonical trans-acting HOTTIP-WDR5-MLL1 pathway in the HOTTIP regulatory mechanism by promoting oncogenic protein expression. Furthermore, HOTTIP is regulated by miR-497 in PDAC cells, but HOTTIP is negatively correlated with miR-497 levels in PDAC tissues. In conclusion, HOTTIP is upregulated in PDAC due to the loss of the inhibitory miR-497; HOTTIP promotes PDAC progression through the canonical HOTTIP-HOXA13 axis. A novel noncanonical trans-acting HOTTIP-WDR5-MLL1-H3K4me3 pathway is also delineated.","['Wong, Chi Hin', 'Li, Chi Han', 'He, Qifang', 'Chan, Stephen Lam', 'Tong, Joanna Hung-Man', 'To, Ka-Fai', 'Lin, Li-Zhu', 'Chen, Yangchao']","['Wong CH', 'Li CH', 'He Q', 'Chan SL', 'Tong JH', 'To KF', 'Lin LZ', 'Chen Y']","['School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong; Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, 518087, China.

Given to the prominent involvement of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes in the formation of neoplastic nature of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), this study was aimed to evaluate the suppressive effect of pan-HDAC inhibitor panobinostat on both NB4 and primary APL patients cells, either in the context of mono- or co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Panobinostat effectively reduced the survival of APL cells; however, as compared to NB4, the viability of primary cells was inhibited at higher concentrations. Our results also showed that although HDAC inhibition could merely block the survival signals transduced from MSC, the presence of PI3K inhibitor could robustly reinforce panobinostat cytotoxicity; suggesting that MSC-induced activation of PI3K may attenuate, at least partly, the efficacy of HDAC inhibition in APL cells. In addition, cellular and molecular investigations on NB4 revealed that not only panobinostat induced p21-mediated G1 arrest and ROS-mediated apoptosis, but also exerted a superior cytotoxicity when combined with c-Myc and autophagy inhibitors. Last but not least, we found that panobinostat combined with arsenic trioxide (ATO) prompted a synergistic effect and provided an improved therapeutic value in NB4; proposing that the abrogation of HDAC using panobinostat might be a befitting approach in APL, either as a single agent or in a combined-modal strategy.","['Mosleh, Mohammad', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Mosleh M', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Bashash D']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

METHODS: The CYP2B6 gene polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-RFLP and Sanger DNA sequencing in 126 patients with AL and 161 healthy controls. RESULTS: Compared with controls, there were significantly higher frequencies of GT and TT genotypes and T alleles in AL patients (p < .05), particularly in fusion gene-positive AL patients. There was no significant difference in CYP2B6 polymorphic genotypes and T alleles between AL patients with complete remission after the first course of chemotherapy and controls (p > .05), while the frequencies in AL patients with partial remission and no remission were significantly higher. The CYP2B6 allele frequency in Han Chinese in Northwest China was significantly different to that reported in Han Chinese and other ethnic minorities in southern China, Uygur Chinese, Vietnamese, African, German, British, Spanish, Turkish, and Argentinian populations; however, there was no significant difference compared with allele frequencies reported in Tibetan and Mongolian Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and American populations. CONCLUSION: Our findings show a strong correlation of the CYP2B6 c.516G>T polymorphism in the Han population of Northwest China with AL, especially fusion gene-positive AL, and indicate a poor prognosis after the first course of chemotherapy.

Since the currently used bacterial l-asparaginase causes side effects, searching for new enzyme sources has been an active field of research. This study focuses on the characterization of an l-asparaginase-producing fungal strain. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sarocladium strictum was identified as a potent enzyme-producing strain. For the enhancement of enzyme production, we used two-level factorial design and response surface methodology. The optimization of significant factors showed a 1.84-fold increase in enzyme production. The Km and Vmax values of the enzyme were 9.74 mmol l(-1) and 8.19 mumol min(-1) . The toxicity of the produced l-asparaginase was measured on K562 and HL60 cancer cell lines and L6 as normal cells. The IC50 values were calculated as 0.4 and 0.5 IU ml(-1) for K562 and HL60 respectively and no significant effect was observed in L6. BrdU proliferation and caspase-3 activity assay in l-asparaginase treated HL60 and K562 cells indicated that cell proliferation rates and apoptotic cell death were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: The cytotoxic properties of the produced fungal enzyme indicated significant growth inhibition in cancer cells while having a little toxic effect on normal cells. The possibility of mass production alongside having suitable cytotoxic and kinetic properties suggest the probable use of the produced l-asparaginase for further researches as a potential chemotherapeutic agent. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The lack of significant l-glutaminase activity and promising toxicity properties in S. strictum and the closer evolutionary relativeness of fungi enzymes to human enzymes compared to bacterial enzymes suggest a new source with lower toxicity and anti-cancerous properties, causing less side effect problems.","['Golbabaie, A', 'Nouri, H', 'Moghimi, H', 'Khaleghian, A']","['Golbabaie A', 'Nouri H', 'Moghimi H', 'Khaleghian A']","['Department of Microbial Biotechnology, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbial Biotechnology, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbial Biotechnology, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200322,England,J Appl Microbiol,Journal of applied microbiology,9706280,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Asparaginase/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hypocreales/enzymology/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jam.14623 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Microbiol. 2020 Aug;129(2):356-366. doi: 10.1111/jam.14623.

Moreover, even in the subgroup analyses stratified according to MRD status, acute and chronic GVHD were not significantly associated with better overall survival. Therefore, less intensive GVHD prophylaxis to achieve a GVL effect is not recommended for Ph-positive ALL.","['Akahoshi, Yu', 'Igarashi, Aiko', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kako, Shinichi']","['Akahoshi Y', 'Igarashi A', 'Fukuda T', 'Uchida N', 'Tanaka M', 'Ozawa Y', 'Kanda Y', 'Onizuka M', 'Ichinohe T', 'Tanaka J', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kako S']","['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200302,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16540 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jul;190(1):84-92. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16540.

Since the publication of the first study in 2008, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have also been used with increasing frequency, including in pediatric patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD, and the manufacturing process has undergone further development. MSC-Frankfurt am Main (MSC-FFM, Obnitix), which is manufactured from pooled mononuclear bone marrow cells from 8 donors using a standardized process, resulted in a response rate of 84% in children with steroid-refractory aGVHD. We report on a 13-year-old female patient with acute myeloid leukemia who received Obnitix as a third-line treatment for gastrointestinal (GI) aGVHD in a life-threatening situation. The patient was initially given a total of 4 Obnitix infusions as per the regulatory approval, with her symptoms improving from day 9 after the first infusion. The second cycle of 4 Obnitix infusions followed due to persistent severe protein-losing enteropathy and resulted in complete remission. A systematic review of the literature on MSC in pediatric patients with steroid-refractory aGVHD confirms that MSC treatment beyond 4 weeks is employed in accordance with treatment protocols or on a case-by-case basis. To summarize, aGVHD activity can be checked endoscopically in patients with persistent GI symptoms and a second Obnitix cycle can then be administered if appropriate, with the goal of achieving complete remission. Future studies should also investigate the potential influence of tissue repair properties as an element in MSCs' efficacy in GI aGVHD.","['Gruhn, Bernd', 'Brodt, Grit', 'Ernst, Jana']","['Gruhn B', 'Brodt G', 'Ernst J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Steroids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/05/20 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['00043426-202104000-00032 [pii]', '10.1097/MPH.0000000000001758 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Apr 1;43(3):e419-e425. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001758.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The eye offers direct access for endothelial health assessment via the retinal microvasculature. The aim of the study was to investigate whether image-based retinal vessel analysis is a feasible method of assessing endothelial health in survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) were estimated using the 30-year Framingham Risk Score in 73 childhood leukemia survivors (median age: 25; median years from diagnosis: 19) and 78 healthy controls (median age: 23). Radial arterial stiffness was measured using pulse wave analyzer, while endothelial activation markers were measured by soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1). Retinal fundus images were analyzed for central retinal artery/vein equivalents (CRAE/CRVE) and arteriolar-venular ratio (AVR). RESULTS: cALL survivors had higher CRF (P<0.0001), arterial stiffness (P=0.001), and sVCAM-1 (P=0.007) compared with controls. Survivors also had significantly higher CRVE (P=0.021) while AVR was significantly lower (P=0.026) in survivors compared with controls, compatible with endothelial dysfunction. In cALL survivors with intermediate risk for CVD, CRAE, and AVR are significantly lower, while sVCAM-1 and sICAM-1 are significantly higher when compared with survivors with low CVD risk after adjusting with covariates (age, sex, and smoking status). CONCLUSIONS: cALL survivors have an increased risk of CVD compared with age-matched peers. The survivors demonstrated microvasculopathy, as measured by retinal vascular analysis, in addition to physical and biochemical evidence of endothelial dysfunction. These changes predate other measures of CVD. Retinal vessel analysis may be utilized as a robust screening tool for identifying survivors at increased risk for developing CVD.","['Azanan, Mohamad S', 'Chandrasekaran, Sudhashini', 'Rosli, Erda S', 'Chua, Ling Ling', 'Oh, Lixian', 'Chin, Tong Foh', 'Yap, Tsiao Yi', 'Rajagopal, Revathi', 'Rajasuriar, Reena', 'MacGillivray, Tom', 'Trucco, Emanuele', 'Ramli, Norlina', 'Kamalden, Tengku A', 'Ariffin, Hany']","['Azanan MS', 'Chandrasekaran S', 'Rosli ES', 'Chua LL', 'Oh L', 'Chin TF', 'Yap TY', 'Rajagopal R', 'Rajasuriar R', 'MacGillivray T', 'Trucco E', 'Ramli N', 'Kamalden TA', 'Ariffin H']","['Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Malaya Eye Research Centre, University of Malaya.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Medicine.', 'VAMPIRE Project, Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh.', 'VAMPIRE Project, Computing (SSEN), University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Malaya Eye Research Centre, University of Malaya.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Malaya Eye Research Centre, University of Malaya.', 'Departments of Pediatrics.', 'Pediatric Oncology Research Laboratory, Faculty of Medicine.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Retinal Vessels/*pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001766 [doi]', '00043426-202008000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Aug;42(6):e394-e400. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001766.,,['MC_PC_15027/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to assess if the CML patient progressed from AIHA and explore the underlying factors of the poor outcome after the achievement of molecular complete remission (MCR). PATIENT CONCERNS: A patient with AIHA underwent splenectomy because of poor response to immune inhibitors. The spleen biopsy showed reactive hyperplasia. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with CML because of over-expression of the BCR-ABL (P210) gene in the bone marrow (BM), 1 year after receiving the diagnosis of AIHA. INTERVENTIONS: The splenectomy was performed as the patient was unresponsive to the standard treatments consisting of immunoglobulin and dexamethasone. The removed spleen was sent for pathological examination. After she was diagnosed with CML, she received imatinib treatment. OUTCOMES: The spleen biopsy confirmed the translocation of 22q11/9q34. No BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation was detected and there was no expression of the WT1 or EVI1 genes. After splenectomy, the number of peripheral white blood cells was consistently higher than normal during the total therapy time for CML even though she showed MCR. Two years after CML was diagnosed, the patient died from severe infection. The BM gene array analysis displayed 3 types of chromosomal abnormalities: gain (14q32.33), uniparental disomy (UPD) Xp11.22-p11.1), and UPD Xp11.1-q13.1. LESSONS: AIHA may be a clinical phase of CML progression in this patient. Both splenectomy and prolonged oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors may have contributed to the high risk of infection and her subsequent death. In addition, the gain of chromosome 14q32.33 may be related to her poor outcome.","['Li, Xiang', 'Cai, Sisi', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'Wang, Hongxiang', 'Wang, Li', 'You, Yong', 'Zhang, Min']","['Li X', 'Cai S', 'Zhong Z', 'Wang H', 'Wang L', 'You Y', 'Zhang M']","['Institution of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Institution of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Institution of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Institution of Hematology, The central hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institution of Hematology, The central hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institution of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.', 'Institution of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Splenectomy']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000019256 [doi]', '00005792-202002280-00032 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Feb;99(9):e19256. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019256.,,,,PMC7478578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hundreds of radionuclides, most of them short-lived, were produced in the atmospheric tests. The radioactive clouds produced by the explosions were usually partitioned between the troposphere and the stratosphere: the activity that remained in the troposphere resulted in local and regional fallout, consisting mainly of short-lived radionuclides and in relatively high doses for the populations residing in the vicinity of the test site, whereas the activity that reached the stratosphere returned to the ground with a half-life of ~1 y and was composed of long-lived radionuclides that contaminated all uncovered materials on Earth to a small extent and led to low-level irradiation of the world population for decades or more. The health effects resulting from exposure to radioactive fallout constitute, in most cases, small excesses over baseline rates for thyroid cancer and leukemia. An extra 49,000 cases of thyroid cancer would be expected to occur among the US population from exposure to radioactive fallout from the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests that were conducted at the Nevada Test Site in the 1950s. In addition, there could be as many as 11,000 deaths from non-thyroid cancers related to fallout from all atmospheric tests that were conducted at all sites in the world, with leukemia making up 10% of the total. Public concern arose in part from the secrecy that surrounded the nuclear testing programs and, for a long time, the poor communication regarding the consequences of the tests, both in terms of radiation doses and of health effects. Sociological and political pressures contributed to the establishment of programs of compensation for radiation exposures and evidence of radiation-induced diseases in countries that incurred significant fallout from nuclear weapons testing.","['Bouville, Andre']",['Bouville A'],"['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (retired).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Cohort Studies', '*Environment', '*Health', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', '*Nuclear Weapons', '*Politics', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', '*Sociology']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0000000000001237 [doi]', '00004032-202004000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2020 Apr;118(4):360-381. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000001237.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, E/R is insufficient to cause overt leukemia since it generates a clinically silent pre-leukemic clone which persists in the bone marrow but fails to out-compete normal progenitors. Conversely, pre-leukemic cells show increased susceptibility to transformation following additional genetic insults. Infections/inflammation are the most accredited triggers for mutations accumulation and leukemic transformation in E/R(+) pre-leukemic cells. However, precisely how E/R and inflammation interact in promoting leukemia is still poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that IL6/TNFalpha/ILbeta pro-inflammatory cytokines cooperate with BM-MSC in promoting the emergence of E/R(+) Ba/F3 over their normal counterparts by differentially affecting their proliferation and survival. Moreover, IL6/TNFalpha/ILbeta-stimulated BM-MSC strongly attract E/R(+) Ba/F3 in a CXCR2-dependent manner. Interestingly, E/R-expressing human CD34(+) IL7R(+) progenitors, a putative population for leukemia initiation during development, were preserved in the presence of BM-MSC and IL6/TNFalpha/ILbeta compared to their normal counterparts. Finally, the extent of DNA damage increases within the inflamed niche in both control and E/R-expressing Ba/F3, potentially leading to transformation in the apoptosis-resistant pre-leukemic clone. Overall, our data provide new mechanistic insights into childhood ALL pathogenesis.","['Beneforti, Linda', 'Dander, Erica', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Acunzo, Denise', 'Bertagna, Mayla', 'Ford, Anthony', 'Gentner, Bernhard', 'Kronnie, Geertruy Te', 'Vergani, Patrizia', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Biondi, Andrea', ""D'Amico, Giovanna"", 'Palmi, Chiara', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Beneforti L', 'Dander E', 'Bresolin S', 'Bueno C', 'Acunzo D', 'Bertagna M', 'Ford A', 'Gentner B', 'Kronnie GT', 'Vergani P', 'Menendez P', 'Biondi A', ""D'Amico G"", 'Palmi C', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Dipartimento della Salute della Donna e del Bambino, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento della Salute della Donna e del Bambino, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Ostetricia, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBER-ONC), ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Clinica Pediatrica, MBBM Foundation, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano-Bicocca, MBBM Foundation, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16523 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jul;190(2):262-273. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16523.

Teas from the plant Camellia sinensis can be grouped into green, black and oolong tea, and drinking habits vary cross-culturally. C sinensis contains polyphenols, one subgroup being catechins. Catechins are powerful antioxidants, and laboratory studies have suggested that these compounds may inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Some experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies have suggested that green tea may have cancer-preventative effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess possible associations between green tea consumption and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality as primary outcomes, and safety data and quality of life as secondary outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched eligible studies up to January 2019 in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of previous reviews and included studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all epidemiological studies, experimental (i.e. randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) and nonexperimental (non-randomised studies, i.e. observational studies with both cohort and case-control design) that investigated the association of green tea consumption with cancer risk or quality of life, or both. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two or more review authors independently applied the study criteria, extracted data and assessed methodological quality of studies. We summarised the results according to diagnosis of cancer type. MAIN RESULTS: In this review update, we included in total 142 completed studies (11 experimental and 131 nonexperimental) and two ongoing studies. This is an additional 10 experimental and 85 nonexperimental studies from those included in the previous version of the review. Eleven experimental studies allocated a total of 1795 participants to either green tea extract or placebo, all demonstrating an overall high methodological quality based on 'Risk of bias' assessment. For incident prostate cancer, the summary risk ratio (RR) in the green tea-supplemented participants was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 1.36), based on three studies and involving 201 participants (low-certainty evidence). The summary RR for gynaecological cancer was 1.50 (95% CI 0.41 to 5.48; 2 studies, 1157 participants; low-certainty evidence). No evidence of effect of non-melanoma skin cancer emerged (summary RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.92; 1 study, 1075 participants; low-certainty evidence). In addition, adverse effects of green tea extract intake were reported, including gastrointestinal disorders, elevation of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure and skin/subcutaneous reactions. Consumption of green tea extracts induced a slight improvement in quality of life, compared with placebo, based on three experimental studies. In nonexperimental studies, we included over 1,100,000 participants from 46 cohort studies and 85 case-control studies, which were on average of intermediate to high methodological quality based on Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 'Risk of bias' assessment. When comparing the highest intake of green tea with the lowest, we found a lower overall cancer incidence (summary RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07), based on three studies, involving 52,479 participants (low-certainty evidence). Conversely, we found no association between green tea consumption and cancer-related mortality (summary RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07), based on eight studies and 504,366 participants (low-certainty evidence). For most of the site-specific cancers we observed a decreased RR in the highest category of green tea consumption compared with the lowest one. After stratifying the analysis according to study design, we found strongly conflicting results for some cancer sites: oesophageal, prostate and urinary tract cancer, and leukaemia showed an increased RR in cohort studies and a decreased RR or no difference in case-control studies. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings from experimental and nonexperimental epidemiological studies yielded inconsistent results, thus providing limited evidence for the beneficial effect of green tea consumption on the overall risk of cancer or on specific cancer sites. Some evidence of a beneficial effect of green tea at some cancer sites emerged from the RCTs and from case-control studies, but their methodological limitations, such as the low number and size of the studies, and the inconsistencies with the results of cohort studies, limit the interpretability of the RR estimates. The studies also indicated the occurrence of several side effects associated with high intakes of green tea. In addition, the majority of included studies were carried out in Asian populations characterised by a high intake of green tea, thus limiting the generalisability of the findings to other populations. Well conducted and adequately powered RCTs would be needed to draw conclusions on the possible beneficial effects of green tea consumption on cancer risk.","['Filippini, Tommaso', 'Malavolti, Marcella', 'Borrelli, Francesca', 'Izzo, Angelo A', 'Fairweather-Tait, Susan J', 'Horneber, Markus', 'Vinceti, Marco']","['Filippini T', 'Malavolti M', 'Borrelli F', 'Izzo AA', 'Fairweather-Tait SJ', 'Horneber M', 'Vinceti M']","['University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Research Center in Environmental, Nutritional and Genetic Epidemiology (CREAGEN), Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, Via Campi 287, Modena, Italy, 41125.', 'University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Research Center in Environmental, Nutritional and Genetic Epidemiology (CREAGEN), Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, Via Campi 287, Modena, Italy, 41125.', ""University of Naples 'Federico II', Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine and Surgery, Via D Montesano 49, Naples, Italy, 80131."", ""University of Naples 'Federico II', Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine and Surgery, Via D Montesano 49, Naples, Italy, 80131."", 'University of East Anglia, Norwich Medical School, Earlham Road, Norwich, Norfolk, UK, NR4 7TJ.', 'Paracelsus Medical University, Klinikum Nuremberg, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology and Hematology, Prof.-Ernst-Nathan-Str. 1, Nuremberg, Germany, D-90419.', 'University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Research Center in Environmental, Nutritional and Genetic Epidemiology (CREAGEN), Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, Via Campi 287, Modena, Italy, 41125.', 'Boston University School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, 715 Albany Street, Boston, USA, MA 02118.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200302,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Tea)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/prevention & control', '*Camellia sinensis/chemistry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mouth Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Phytotherapy/*methods', 'Plant Extracts/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Polyphenols', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Skin Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control', '*Tea/adverse effects', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/epidemiology/prevention & control']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD005004.pub3 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2020 Mar 2;3:CD005004. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD005004.pub3.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We describe clinicopathologic features of leukemia in 9 hedgehogs, including eosinophilic leukemia (n = 3) and acute leukemia/leukemic phase of lymphoma (n = 6). All 3 hedgehogs with eosinophilic leukemia were older than 2 years of age; in contrast, 4 of 6 cases of acute leukemia/lymphoma were <2 years old. Hedgehogs presented for non-specific clinical signs of anorexia and lethargy. On hematologic testing, hedgehogs with eosinophilic leukemia had a marked leukocytosis, consisting mostly of eosinophilic precursors with fewer mature eosinophils, whereas there were 43-97% immature cells (blasts) in the blood of hedgehogs with acute leukemia/lymphoma. Anemia (n = 6) and/or thrombocytopenia (n = 6) were concurrent findings. Increased liver enzyme activities (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) and hypoalbuminemia were the common findings on biochemical panels. All cases of eosinophilic leukemia and 4 cases of acute leukemia/lymphoma died shortly after diagnosis (median 7 days, range 0-41 days), whereas 2 cases of acute leukemia/lymphoma lived for 94 or 101 days. Postmortem examination in 5 cases (1 eosinophilic leukemia, 4 acute leukemia/lymphoma) showed bone marrow infiltrates, confirming eosinophilic leukemia and acute leukemia in 1 and 3 cases, and bone marrow necrosis in 1 animal with acute leukemia/lymphoma. Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow sections confirmed a T-cell acute leukemia in 1 case. Several hedgehogs had concurrent carcinomas. Hedgehogs suffer from eosinophilic leukemia and acute leukemia/lymphoma. However, classification of acute leukemia by lineage was not possible due to lack of hedgehog cross-reactive or species-specific reagents.","['Koizumi, Iori', 'Hernandez-Muguiro, Daniela', 'Chu, Shelley Ann Ash', 'Stokol, Tracy', 'Asakawa, Midori Goto']","['Koizumi I', 'Hernandez-Muguiro D', 'Chu SAA', 'Stokol T', 'Asakawa MG']","['Koizumi Nest Animal Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'CityU Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Department of Population Medicine and Diagnostic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Veterinary Specialists Emergency Center, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200211,Switzerland,Front Vet Sci,Frontiers in veterinary science,101666658,,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:01,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fvets.2020.00054 [doi]'],epublish,Front Vet Sci. 2020 Feb 11;7:54. doi: 10.3389/fvets.2020.00054. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Koizumi, Hernandez-Muguiro, Chu, Stokol and Asakawa.']",PMC7026476,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'cancer', 'cytology', 'eosinophilic leukemia', 'histopathology', 'immunohistochemistry', 'lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its expression was found to be silenced by methylation in many human tumors, preventing tumor cells from undergoing apoptosis and supporting its role as a tumor suppressor. Subsequently, ASC was also identified as a central adaptor molecule of the inflammasome complex, which mediates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1beta and IL-18). Inflammatory cytokines have been shown to mediate tumor-promoting functions. Thus, in the context of cancer development and progression, ASC may exert opposing functions, i.e., be either tumor-suppressing by inducing tumor cell apoptosis, or tumor-promoting by favoring secretion of inflammatory cytokines (by tumor cells and/or tumor infiltrating myeloid cells) within the tumor microenvironment. Here, we report and discuss this dual role of ASC by also considering the final contribution of each of its two main functions in several cancer types, taking into consideration the correlation between ASC expression, clinical correlates, and patients' survival. ASC and inflammasome targeting strategies are being developed. However, before the use of such treatments in clinical practice, it is fundamental to better dissect the role of ASC in different tumors, in order to privilege or avoid their use in those tumors in which ASC exerts an anti-tumor or pro-tumor function, respectively.","['Protti, Maria Pia', 'De Monte, Lucia']","['Protti MP', 'De Monte L']","['Tumor Immunology Unit, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Tumor Immunology Unit, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200204,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:01,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2020.00040 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2020 Feb 4;8:40. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2020.00040. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Protti and De Monte.'],PMC7010858,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASC/TMS1', 'IL-18', 'IL1', 'inflammasome', 'myeloid cells', 'tumor cells', 'tumor suppressor gene']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hot embossing technique (HE) allows the obtainment of PCL scaffolds with a regular array of micro pillars on their surface. The main drawback affecting this kind of micro fabrication process is that such structural superficial details can be damaged when detaching the replica from the mold. Therefore, the present study has focused on the optimization of the HE processes through the development of an analytical model for the prediction of the demolding force as a function of temperature. This model allowed calculating the minimum demolding force to obtain regular micropillars without defects. We demonstrated that the results obtained by the analytical model agree with the experimental data. To address the importance of controlling accurately the fabricated microstructures, we seeded on the PCL scaffolds human stromal cell line (HS-5) and monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) to evaluate how the presence of regular or deformed pillars affect cells viability.

Methods: Bioinformatics was used to predict differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) in AML. The morphology of BMMSC-derived MVs was observed under an electron microscope, and the positional relation of MVs and OCI-AML2 cells was observed by a fluorescence microscope. MTT, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays were used to analyze the effects of MVs on OCI-AML2 cells. The targeted relationship between miR-221-3p and CDKN1C was detected by dual luciferase assay. Results: It was verified that miR-221-3p promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of OCI-AML2 cells, and induced the cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase as well as inhibited cell apoptosis. Further studies showed that MVs promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of AML, and induced the cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase through miR-221-3p. It was confirmed that miR-221-3p can directly target CDKN1C to regulate cell cycle, proliferation and invasion of AML. Conclusion: miR-221-3p in BMMSC-derived MVs regulated AML cell cycle, cell proliferation and invasion through targeting CDKN1C. miR-221-3p and CDKN1C were considered to be potential targets and biomarkers for the treatment of AML in clinic.","['Zhang, Xuewu', 'Xu, Yu', 'Wang, Jinghan', 'Zhao, Shuqi', 'Li, Jianhu', 'Huang, Xin', 'Xu, Huan', 'Zhang, Xiang', 'Suo, Shanshan', 'Lv, Yunfei', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Yu, Wenjuan']","['Zhang X', 'Xu Y', 'Wang J', 'Zhao S', 'Li J', 'Huang X', 'Xu H', 'Zhang X', 'Suo S', 'Lv Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Yu W']","['Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine First Affiliated Hospital, Hangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200214,Switzerland,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,101632513,,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:01,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fbioe.2020.00081 [doi]'],epublish,Front Bioeng Biotechnol. 2020 Feb 14;8:81. doi: 10.3389/fbioe.2020.00081. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Zhang, Xu, Wang, Zhao, Li, Huang, Xu, Zhang, Suo, Lv, Zhang', 'and Yu.']",PMC7033425,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'BMMSC', 'cell cycle', 'cell proliferation and invasion', 'miR-221-3p', 'microvesicles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with healthy people, AML patients expressed 31 signature proteins, among which, 27 were significantly higher expressed and 4 proteins were lower. When patients were divided into favorable and poor prognosis, 12 signature proteins were significantly differentially expressed between these two groups. Furthermore, in order to identify the accuracy of cytokine expression profiles, we verified and analyzed the expression of THBS1 (Thrombospondin 1) in 116 patients and 9 healthy people. We found that THBS1 was lowly expressed in AML patients, which might be induced by promoter methylation, and patients with low THBS1 possessed shorter survivor time.

Mylotarg is the first AML-targeting drug from a new generation of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) therapies aiming at the acute leukemia cell compartment with increased specificity. This agent targets leukemia cells for apoptosis with a cytotoxic payload, calicheamicin, carried by a CD33-specific antibody. Calicheamicin induces DNA double strand breaks (DSB) which, if left unrepaired, lead to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells. However, repair of DSB by the non-homologous end joining pathway driven by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) can reduce the efficacy of calicheamicin. M3814 is a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of DNA-PK. This compound effectively blocks DSB repair, strongly potentiates the antitumor activity of ionizing radiation and DSB-inducing chemotherapeutics and is currently under clinical investigation. Suppressing DSB repair with M3814 synergistically enhanced the apoptotic activity of calicheamicin in cultured AML cells. Combination of M3814 with Mylotarg in two AML xenograft models, MV4-11 and HL-60, demonstrated increased efficacy and significantly improved survival benefit without elevated body weight loss. Our results support a new application for pharmacological DNA-PK inhibitors as enhancers of Mylotarg and a potential new combination treatment option for AML patients.","['Carr, Michael I', 'Zimmermann, Astrid', 'Chiu, Li-Ya', 'Zenke, Frank T', 'Blaukat, Andree', 'Vassilev, Lyubomir T']","['Carr MI', 'Zimmermann A', 'Chiu LY', 'Zenke FT', 'Blaukat A', 'Vassilev LT']","['Translational Innovation Platform Oncology, EMD Serono Research and Development Institute, Inc., Billerica, MA, United States.', 'Translational Innovation Platform Oncology, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Translational Innovation Platform Oncology, EMD Serono Research and Development Institute, Inc., Billerica, MA, United States.', 'Translational Innovation Platform Oncology, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Translational Innovation Platform Oncology, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.', 'Translational Innovation Platform Oncology, EMD Serono Research and Development Institute, Inc., Billerica, MA, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200213,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:01,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00127 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Feb 13;10:127. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00127. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Carr, Zimmermann, Chiu, Zenke, Blaukat and Vassilev.']",PMC7031257,,['NOTNLM'],"['ADC-antibody drug conjugate', 'AML-acute myeloid leukemia', 'DNA-PK', 'DSB-double-strand break', 'therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different EV subtypes have been identified that transfer regulatory molecules between cells, influencing gene expression, and altering cellular phenotypes. Evidence from a range of studies suggests that EV trafficking enhances cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy in solid tumors. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), EVs contribute to the dynamic crosstalk between AML cells, hematopoietic elements and stromal cells and promote adaptation of compartmental bone marrow (BM) function through transport of protein, RNA, and DNA. Careful analysis of leukemia cell EV content and phenotypic outcomes provide evidence that vesicles are implicated in transferring several known key mediators of chemoresistance, including miR-155, IL-8, and BMP-2.

A second prevalence study of these viruses were accomplished in 2018, 28 years after initial survey. Analysis of these studies provide insights about strategies of elimination of hepatitis viruses at remote areas. Materials and methods: In 2018, prevalence of hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HTLV was checked in 305 subjects in the islands those covered in 1990's survey. Hepatitis A virus was checked by the presence of anti-HAV IgG in sera; HBV was affirmed when hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in sera. Hepatitis C virus infection was evaluated by the presence of antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) and infection with HTLV was estimated by immunoassay. The methodology of assessment of different hepatitis viruses were optimized on the basis of present scientific knowhow. Results: In 1990, the prevalence of HAV (presence of anti-HAV), HBV (presence of HBsAg), HCV (positivity for anti-HCV), and HTLV was found in 79.3%, 11.1%, 2.2%, and 3.3% of apparently health subjects of the islands, respectively. The prevalence of HAV, HBV, HCV, and HTLV was 47.9%, 4.6%, 1.0%, and 3.0%, respectively, in 2018. A shift of age of infected persons tilted towards right as the days progressed. Conclusion: The study indicates a scenario of elimination of hepatitis viruses in Japan as lower trends of prevalence of HAV, HBV, and HCV have been recorded in 2018 compared with 1990, mainly by preventive measures. The most notable finding is that there are almost no new case below the age of 40 years, indicating an effective containment measure against these viruses.

For acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however, the optimal target surface antigen has yet to be discovered. Alternatively, T-cell receptor (TCR)-redirected T-cells target intracellular antigens, marking a broader territory of available target antigens. Currently, adoptive TCR T-cell therapy uses peripheral blood lymphocytes for the introduction of a transgenic TCR. However, this can cause graft-versus-host disease, due to mispairing of introduced and endogenous TCR chains. Therefore, we started from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), that do not express a TCR yet, isolated from healthy donors, patients in remission after chemotherapy and AML patients at diagnosis. Using the OP9-DL1 in vitro co-culture system and agonist selection, TCR-transduced HSPC develop into mature tumor antigen-specific T-cells with only one TCR. We show here that this approach is feasible with adult HSPC from clinically relevant sources, albeit with slower maturation and lower cell yield compared to cord blood HSPC. Moreover, cryopreservation of HSPC does not have an effect on cell numbers or functionality of the generated T-cells. In conclusion, we show here that it is feasible to generate TA-specific T-cells from HSPC from adult healthy donors and patients and we believe these T-cells could be of use as a very valuable form of patient-tailored T-cell immunotherapy.","['Bonte, Sarah', 'De Munter, Stijn', 'Goetgeluk, Glenn', 'Ingels, Joline', 'Pille, Melissa', 'Billiet, Lore', 'Taghon, Tom', 'Leclercq, Georges', 'Vandekerckhove, Bart', 'Kerre, Tessa']","['Bonte S', 'De Munter S', 'Goetgeluk G', 'Ingels J', 'Pille M', 'Billiet L', 'Taghon T', 'Leclercq G', 'Vandekerckhove B', 'Kerre T']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200217,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Neoplasms/therapy', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', '*T-Lymphocytes']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:01,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2020.1727078 [doi]', '1727078 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2020 Feb 17;9(1):1727078. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2020.1727078. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0637-4893'],,"['(c) 2020 The Author(s).

Historically, prohibitive immunological barriers resulting from the high degree of HLA-mismatch included graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) and graft failure. These were overcome with increasingly sophisticated strategies to manipulate the sensitive balance between donor and recipient immune cells. Three different approaches are currently in clinical use: (a) ex vivo T-cell depletion resulting in grafts with defined immune cell content (b) extensive immunosuppression with a T-cell replete graft consisting of G-CSF primed bone marrow and PBSC (GIAC) (c) T-cell replete grafts with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Intriguing studies have recently elucidated the immunologic mechanisms by which PTCy prevents GVHD. Each approach uniquely affects post-transplant immune reconstitution which is critical for the control of post-transplant infections and relapse. NK-cells play a key role in haplo-HCT since they do not mediate GVHD but can successfully mediate a graft-vs.-leukemia effect. This effect is in part regulated by KIR receptors that inhibit NK cell cytotoxic function when binding to the appropriate HLA-class I ligands. In the context of an HLA-class I mismatch in haplo-HCT, lack of inhibition can contribute to NK-cell alloreactivity leading to enhanced anti-leukemic effect. Emerging work reveals immune evasion phenomena such as copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity of the incompatible HLA alleles as one of the major mechanisms of relapse. Relapse and infectious complications remain the leading causes impacting overall survival and are central to scientific advances seeking to improve haplo-HCT. Given that haploidentical donors can typically be readily approached to collect additional stem- or immune cells for the recipient, haplo-HCT represents a unique platform for cell- and immune-based therapies aimed at further reducing relapse and infections. The rapid advancements in our understanding of the immunobiology of haplo-HCT are therefore poised to lead to iterative innovations resulting in further improvement of outcomes with this compelling transplant modality.","['Baumeister, Susanne H C', 'Rambaldi, Benedetta', 'Shapiro, Roman M', 'Romee, Rizwan']","['Baumeister SHC', 'Rambaldi B', 'Shapiro RM', 'Romee R']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Clinical and Experimental Sciences Department, ASST Spedali Civili, University of Pavia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200214,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/methods', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Transplantation, Haploidentical/adverse effects']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00191 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Feb 14;11:191. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00191. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Baumeister, Rambaldi, Shapiro and Romee.']",PMC7033970,,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK-cells', '*graft-vs.-leukemia', '*haploidentical', '*immunobiology', '*stem cell transplantation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GvHD is characterized by dysregulated immune responses and resulting tissue damage of target organs. Recent investigations have focused on Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) as a therapeutic tool, based on its regulatory functions in GvHD pathogenesis and their instrumental role in mitigating GvHD severity while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) activity. There are several challenges to its clinical application, including their paucity, impaired suppressive activity, and instability in vivo. Herein, we report that IL-27 pre-stimulation enhances suppressive functions of both mouse and human Tregs. In a complete MHC mismatched murine bone marrow transplant model, IL-27 pre-stimulated polyclonal iTregs diminish acute (a)GvHD lethality, while preserving the GvL effect. Allo-antigen specificity further improves suppressive functions when combined with IL-27 pre-stimulation. In a xenogeneic (human to mouse) GvHD model, IL-27 pre-stimulated human iTregs are superior in protecting recipients from GvHD. Lastly, we compared gene expression profiles of circulating Tregs isolated from HCT recipients with and without aGvHD and found that Tregs from aGvHD patients express distinct gene signatures enriched in immune activation and inflammation. Therefore, these results highlight a novel function of IL-27 in enforcing Treg functions to prevent aGvHD mediated lethality, proposing the hypothesis that dysregulated Treg functions may account for the potential mechanisms underlying GvHD development.","['Le, Hongnga T', 'Keslar, Karen', 'Nguyen, Quang Tam', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Hamilton, Betty K', 'Min, Booki']","['Le HT', 'Keslar K', 'Nguyen QT', 'Blazar BR', 'Hamilton BK', 'Min B']","['Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, United States.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Inflammation and Immunity, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200212,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MYDGF protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer/methods', 'Allografts/immunology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/*immunology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Heterografts/immunology', 'Interleukins/*administration & dosage/blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Transcriptome', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00181 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Feb 12;11:181. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00181. eCollection 2020.,,"['P01 AI056299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL118979/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL147324/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 AI034495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL056067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI121524/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI125247/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA142106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Copyright (c) 2020 Le, Keslar, Nguyen, Blazar, Hamilton and Min.']",PMC7028690,,['NOTNLM'],"['*GvHD', '*IL-27', '*adoptive transfer', '*regulatory T cell', '*transplantation', '*xenogeneic GvHD']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because expression of the aberrant target protein is exclusive to malignant cells, immunotherapy directed against neoantigens should avoid ""on-target, off-tumor"" toxicity. The efficacy of neoantigen vaccines in melanoma and glioblastoma and of adoptive transfer of neoantigen-specific T cells in epithelial tumors indicates that neoantigens are valid therapeutic targets. Improvements in sequencing technology and innovations in antigen discovery approaches have facilitated the identification of neoantigens. In comparison to many solid tumors, hematologic malignancies have few mutations and thus fewer potential neoantigens. Despite this, neoantigens have been identified in a wide variety of hematologic malignancies. These include mutated nucleophosmin1 and PML-RARA in acute myeloid leukemia, ETV6-RUNX1 fusions and other mutated proteins in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, BCR-ABL1 fusions in chronic myeloid leukemia, driver mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms, immunoglobulins in lymphomas, and proteins derived from patient-specific mutations in chronic lymphoid leukemias.

CD44 is a glycoprotein involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The isoform containing the variant domain 6 of CD44 gene (CD44v6) has been implicated in tumorigenesis, tumor cell invasion and metastasis and represents an attractive target for CAR T cell therapies. Targeting CD44v6 antigen has been shown to control tumor growth in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma mouse models. While CAR T approach for the treatment of B cell malignancies has shown great success, response rates among patients with solid cancer are less favorable. The purpose of our study was to test the efficacy of CD44v6.CAR T cells, produced in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), in adenocarcinoma tumor models. We generated a bicistronic retroviral vector containing the CD44v6 CAR and the HSV-TK Mut2 suicide gene to enhance the safety of the proposed CAR T cell therapy. CD44v6 transduced CAR T cells were homogeneously positive for DeltaLNGFR selection marker, were enriched in T central memory (TCM) and T memory stem cells (TSCM) and displayed a highly activated phenotype. In vitro assays revealed antigen-specific activation and cytotoxicity of human CD44v6.CAR T cells against CD44v6 expressing tumor cell lines. When infused in immunodeficient tumor bearing mice, human CD44v6.CAR T cells were able to reach, infiltrate and proliferate at tumor sites, finally resulting in tumor growth control. Next, we checked if cells produced in compliance with GMP grade standards retained the same antitumor activity of those produced with research grade materials and protocols. Noteworthy, no differences in the potency of the CAR T obtained with the two manufacturing processes were observed. In conclusion, our preclinical results suggest that CD44v6.CAR T based adoptive therapy could be a promising strategy in solid cancer treatment.","['Porcellini, Simona', 'Asperti, Claudia', 'Corna, Stefano', 'Cicoria, Eleonora', 'Valtolina, Veronica', 'Stornaiuolo, Anna', 'Valentinis, Barbara', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Traversari, Catia']","['Porcellini S', 'Asperti C', 'Corna S', 'Cicoria E', 'Valtolina V', 'Stornaiuolo A', 'Valentinis B', 'Bordignon C', 'Traversari C']","['Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.', 'Research Department, MolMed SpA, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200204,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD44 protein, human)', '0 (CD44v6 antigen)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lung/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Ovary/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00099 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Feb 4;11:99. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00099. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Porcellini, Asperti, Corna, Cicoria, Valtolina, Stornaiuolo,', 'Valentinis, Bordignon and Traversari.']",PMC7010926,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T', '*CD44v6', '*GMP grade', '*adoptive therapy', '*solid tumor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, FCRL6 revealed unexpected heterogeneity in the developmental origins, regulation, and selection of natural Abs at the pre-BCR checkpoint with implications for autoimmunity and lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Honjo, Kazuhito', 'Won, Woong-Jai', 'King, Rodney G', 'Ianov, Lara', 'Crossman, David K', 'Easlick, Juliet L', 'Shakhmatov, Mikhail A', 'Khass, Mohamed', 'Vale, Andre M', 'Stephan, Robert P', 'Li, Ran', 'Davis, Randall S']","['Honjo K', 'Won WJ', 'King RG', 'Ianov L', 'Crossman DK', 'Easlick JL', 'Shakhmatov MA', 'Khass M', 'Vale AM', 'Stephan RP', 'Li R', 'Davis RS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Civitan International Research Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Division, National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Program in Immunobiology, Carlos Chagas Filho Institute of Biophysics, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200214,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphatidylcholines/immunology/metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/immunology']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2020.00082 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2020 Feb 14;11:82. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2020.00082. eCollection 2020.,,"['P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI110553/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Copyright (c) 2020 Honjo, Won, King, Ianov, Crossman, Easlick, Shakhmatov, Khass,', 'Vale, Stephan, Li and Davis.']",PMC7033751,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-1 cells', '*antibody repertoire', '*autoimmunity', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*innate-like B cells', '*lymphocyte development', '*lymphocyte selection', '*natural antibodies']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Contrary to T cells, natural killer (NK) cells kill their targets in a non-antigen-specific manner and do not carry the risk of inducing graft vs. host disease (GvHD), allowing application of donor-derived cells in an allogenic setting. Hence, unlike autologous CAR-T cells, therapeutic CD19-CAR-NK cells can be generated as an off-the-shelf product from healthy donors. Nevertheless, genetic engineering of peripheral blood (PB) derived NK cells remains challenging and optimized protocols are needed. In our study, we aimed to optimize the generation of CD19-CAR-NK cells by retroviral transduction to improve the high antileukemic capacity of NK cells. We compared two different retroviral vector platforms, the lentiviral and alpharetroviral, both in combination with two different transduction enhancers (Retronectin and Vectofusin-1). We further explored different NK cell isolation techniques (NK cell enrichment and CD3/CD19 depletion) to identify the most efficacious methods for genetic engineering of NK cells. Our results demonstrated that transduction of NK cells with RD114-TR pseudotyped retroviral vectors, in combination with Vectofusin-1 was the most efficient method to generate CD19-CAR-NK cells. Retronectin was potent in enhancing lentiviral/VSV-G gene delivery to NK cells but not alpharetroviral/RD114-TR. Furthermore, the Vectofusin-based transduction of NK cells with CD19-CARs delivered by alpharetroviral/RD114-TR and lentiviral/RD114-TR vectors outperformed lentiviral/VSV-G vectors. The final generated CD19-CAR-NK cells displayed superior cytotoxic activity against CD19-expressing target cells when compared to non-transduced NK cells achieving up to 90% specific killing activity. In summary, our findings present the use of RD114-TR pseudotyped retroviral particles in combination with Vectofusin-1 as a successful strategy to genetically modify PB-derived NK cells to achieve highly cytotoxic CD19-CAR-NK cells at high yield.","['Muller, Stephan', 'Bexte, Tobias', 'Gebel, Veronika', 'Kalensee, Franziska', 'Stolzenberg, Eva', 'Hartmann, Jessica', 'Koehl, Ulrike', 'Schambach,

(2) Do patients with rheumatic diseases display different responses to treatment with anti-rheumatic agents when they are HTLV-1 carriers? (3) Is adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) more prevalent in HTLV-1 carriers with rheumatic diseases who are treated with anti-rheumatic agents? These questions are important because increasing numbers of patients with rheumatic diseases are currently receiving treatment with aggressive medicines such as immunosuppressants and biologics. Studies on HTLV-1 gene-transgenic mice have shown manifestations resembling rheumatic diseases. Epidemiological studies have shown a high incidence of HTLV-1 infection in patients with rheumatic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome, and polymyositis. HTLV-1-positive and HTLV-1-negative patients with RA have displayed similar immunological features including the seroprevalence of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies. Conversely, attenuated effectiveness of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors for HTLV-1-positive patients with RA in Japan has been reported. Therefore, although no direct evidence has shown that HTLV-1 infection alone causes rheumatic diseases, HTLV-1 may affect the inflammation of RA. Although the incidence of ATL or HAM/TSP among patients with rheumatic diseases has not been investigated in large-scale studies, ATL or HAM/TSP has developed among HTLV-1-positive patients with rheumatic diseases. HTLV-1 infection may affect the clinical course of patients with rheumatic diseases, particularly after receiving anti-rheumatic agents. Because studies on these issues are limited, further investigation with large sample sizes is necessary.","['Umekita, Kunihiko', 'Okayama, Akihiko']","['Umekita K', 'Okayama A']","['Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases, and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Infectious Diseases, and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200211,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,2020/03/03 06:00,2020/03/03 06:01,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2020.00152 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2020 Feb 11;11:152. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00152. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Umekita and Okayama.'],PMC7025999,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis', 'adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs', 'human T-cell leukemia virus type 1', 'rheumatic diseases', 'rheumatoid arthritis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glaucocalyxin A (GLA), an ent-kaurene diterpene isolated from Rabdosia japonica, is one of the main active ingredients showing potent inhibitory effects against several types of tumor cells. To the best of our knowledge, studies regarding the structural modification and Structure- Activity Relations (SAR) of this compound have not yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to discover more potent derivatives of GLA and investigate their SAR and cytotoxicity mechanisms. METHODS: Novel 7-O- and 14-O-derivatives of GLA were synthesized by condensation of acids or acyl chloride. The anti-tumor activities of these derivatives against various human cancer cell lines were evaluated in vitro by MTT assays. Apoptosis assays of compound 17 (7,14-diacylation product) were performed on A549 and HL-60 cells by flow cytometry and TUNNEL. The acute toxicity of this compound was tested on mice, at the dose of 300mg per kg body weight. RESULTS: Seventeen novel 7-O- and 14-O-derivatives of GLA (1-17) were synthesized. These compounds showed potent cytotoxicity against the tested cancer cell lines, and almost all of them were found to be more cytotoxic than GLA and oridonin. Of the synthesized derivatives, compound 17 presented the greatest cytotoxicity, with IC50 values of 0.26muM and 1.10muM in HL-60 and CCRF-CEM cells, respectively. Furthermore, this compound induced weak apoptosis of A549 cells but showed great potential in stimulating the apoptosis of HL- 60 cells. Acute toxicity assays indicated that compound 17 is relatively safer. CONCLUSION: The results reported herein indicate that the synthesized GLA derivatives exhibited greater cytotoxicity against leukemia cells than against other types of tumors. In particular, 7,14-diacylation product of GLA was found to be an effective anti-tumor agent. However, the cytotoxicity mechanism of this product in A549 cells is expected to be different than that in other tumor cell lines. Further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.","['Liu, Hong-Chuan', 'Qiao, Li-Ming', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Xiang, Zhao-Bao', 'Chen, Hai-Sheng', 'Yu, Shi-Chong', 'Zhang, Da-Zhi', 'Wang, Ting', 'Zhang, Yue-Fan', 'Jin, Yong-Sheng']","['Liu HC', 'Qiao LM', 'Zheng W', 'Xiang ZB', 'Chen HS', 'Yu SC', 'Zhang DZ', 'Wang T', 'Zhang YF', 'Jin YS']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, the 72nd Group Army Hospital of PLA, Huzhou, Zhejiang Province 313000, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Natural Medicine Research of Chongqing Education Commission, Chongqing Technology and Business University, Chongqing, 400067, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '79498-31-0 (glaucocalyxin A)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/05/29 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-104935 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520620666200302114550 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2020;20(10):1241-1249. doi: 10.2174/1871520620666200302114550.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Rabdosia japonica', '*SAR', '*Synthesis', '*apoptosis', '*cytotoxicity', '*glaucocalyxin A']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to the rarity of these tumours in children, and the consequent absence of collaborative prospective trials, there is no clear consensus on how the unique characteristics of paediatric meningiomas impact clinical status, management approach, and survival. Much of the evidence and treatment recommendations for paediatric meningiomas are extrapolated from adult data. Translating and adapting adult treatment recommendations into paediatric practice can be challenging and might inadvertently lead to inappropriate management. In 2009, Traunecker et al. published guidelines for the management of intracranial meningioma in children and young people on behalf of UK Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG). Ten years later we have developed the updated guidelines following a comprehensive appraisal of the literature. Complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for symptomatic meningiomas, while radiotherapy remains the only available adjuvant therapy and may be necessary for those tumours that cannot be completely removed. However, significant advances have been made in the identification of the genetic and molecular alterations of meningioma, which has not only a potential value in the development of therapeutic agents but also in surveillance of childhood meningioma survivors. This guideline builds upon the CCLG 2009 guideline. We summarise recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment, surveillance and long-term follow-up of children and adolescents with meningioma.","['Szychot, Elwira', 'Goodden, John', 'Whitfield, Gillian', 'Curry, Sarah']","['Szychot E', 'Goodden J', 'Whitfield G', 'Curry S']","['Paediatric Oncology Cinical Studies, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, London.', 'The Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, London.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Clinical Neuro-oncology, The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, UK.', ""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Southampton Children's Hospital, Southampton, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200302,England,Br J Neurosurg,British journal of neurosurgery,8800054,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Meningeal Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy', '*Meningioma/diagnosis/therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/02688697.2020.1726286 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Neurosurg. 2020 Apr;34(2):142-153. doi: 10.1080/02688697.2020.1726286.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of small and non-coding RNAs modulating gene expression via binding to the target mRNAs. We aimed to characterize the expression profiles of various miRNAs in different stages of Ph(+) CML patients. METHODS: This case-controlled study was conducted in 75 CML patients and 25 healthy controls. The subjects were categorized into 4 groups; newly diagnosed patients, treatment-response patients, treatment-failure patients, and healthy controls. Expressions of miRNAs was analyzed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: miR-150 expression was downregulated in the treatment failure patients compared to the control group (p = 0.003212) while miRNA 148b expression up-regulated in the treatment failure patients than the control group (p = 0.038016). miR-10a expression was up-regulated in newly diagnosed and treatment response patients compared to control group (p = 0.003934, p = 0.000292, respectively).

Here we summarize the salient biology and genetic and clinical features of a number of these conditions including some more recently described genetic variants.","['Wiggins, Meredith', 'Stevenson, William']","['Wiggins M', 'Stevenson W']","['Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200302,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,,IM,"['*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/01/06 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13173 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Jun;42 Suppl 1:75-81. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13173.

There are limited data on the role of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in t-ALL. Recent reports suggest comparable outcomes of t-ALL with de novo ALL after HSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all patients of t-ALL who underwent HSCT at our center. Patients were analyzed for prior malignancy, therapy, time to diagnosis of t-ALL, clinical, laboratory characteristics, transplant details, relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Eighteen patients (M:F ratio 1:1; Median age 44 years) underwent HSCT for t-ALL. Median latent period from primary malignancy to t-ALL was 44.8 months. 11q23 rearrangement and t(9;22) were present in 33.3% and 22.2% patients, respectively. Stem cell donors were matched related, matched unrelated, and haploidentical in 27.8% (n = 5), 55.6% (n = 10), and 16.7% (n = 3) patients, respectively. Five patients died before D+ 100 (27.8%). Estimated 2-year RFS and OS were 47.1% and 51.8%, respectively. We did not find any pretransplant and post-transplant risk factors that were predictive of improved OS or RFS after multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Allogeneic HSCT outcomes in t-ALL were comparable to HSCT outcomes in de novo ALL. Multicenter studies with more patients and longer follow-up may provide factors affecting outcome and survival.","['Vasudevan Nampoothiri, Ram', 'Law, Arjun Datt', 'Lam, Wilson', 'Chen, Carol', 'Al-Shaibani, Zeyad', 'Loach, David', 'Michelis, Fotios V', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan', 'Mattsson, Jonas', 'Kumar, Rajat', 'Lipton, Jeffrey Howard', 'Viswabandya, Auro']","['Vasudevan Nampoothiri R', 'Law AD', 'Lam W', 'Chen C', 'Al-Shaibani Z', 'Loach D', 'Michelis FV', 'Kim DDH', 'Mattsson J', 'Kumar R', 'Lipton JH', 'Viswabandya A']","['Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Hans Messner Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200318,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13403 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Jul;105(1):24-29. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13403.

The present study showed that Yansuanmalingua (YASML) can inhibit type 2 PRRSV replication using plaque assay, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence assay. Furthermore, inhibition of PRRSV replication was shown to be related to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-dependent apoptosis-induction by YASML in the PRRSV-infected MARC-145, and TLR3-dependent apoptosis-induction by YASML was found to suppress PRRSV replication via the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 pathways, respectively. Meanwhile, activation of the caspase-3 pathway seemed to be related to the downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) expression. Our results showed that YASML-induced TLR3-dependent apoptosis could be blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor and small interfering RNA against TLR3. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that YASML exerts its anti-PRRSV effect by activating the caspase-8/caspase-3 signaling pathway and by negatively regulating Mcl-1 expression. These findings not only provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of YASML inhibition of PRRSV replication via the TLR3-dependent apoptosis pathway but also suggest potential, new antiviral drugs by expressing caspase-3 or down expressing Mcl-1.","['Ding, Yaozhong', 'Li, Guoxiu', 'Cheng, Fangzhen', 'Dai, Junfei', 'Hu, Yonghao', 'Zhang, Jie']","['Ding Y', 'Li G', 'Cheng F', 'Dai J', 'Hu Y', 'Zhang J']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Gansu Agricultural University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Etiological Biology, National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference Laboratory, Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu, China.', 'China Agricultural Veterinarian Biology Science and Technology Co.

T helper type 1 cell (Th1)/Th2 imbalance is involved in development of autophagy and AML. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IRF2-INPP4B axis regulates autophagy and apoptosis of AML cells via regulating Th1/Th2 cell differentiation. The frequencies of Th2 cells and Th1 cells in transfected CD4+ T cells were determined by flow cytometry. The levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-13 in peripheral blood and transfected CD4+ T cells from AML patients and healthy donors were examined by ELISA assay. The mRNA levels of IRF2 and INPP4B in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from AML patients and healthy donors were detected by qRT-PCR. Autophagy was evaluated by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of autophagy-associated proteins. AML cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. In this study, elevated frequencies of Th2 cells and reduced frequencies of Th1 cells, as well as higher expression of IRF2 and INPP4B, were observed in PBMCs from AML patients relative to healthy donors. Furthermore, IRF2 inhibited Th1 cell differentiation and promoted Th2 cell differentiation through INPP4B. Moreover, we confirmed that IRF2-INPP4B-mediated regulation of Th1/Th2 differentiation promoted autophagy and inhibited apoptosis of AML cells. Collectively, IRF2-INPP4B axis regulates autophagy and apoptosis of AML cells via regulating Th1/Th2 cell differentiation. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: In the present study, we confirmed that IRF2-INPP4B-mediated regulation of Th1/Th2 balance promoted autophagy and inhibited apoptosis of AML cells. These findings might provide clues in better understanding of the mechanisms of AML.","['Zhang, Feng', 'Zhu, Kai', 'Liu, Lin', 'Zhu, Junfeng', 'Li, Jiajia', 'Zhang, Pingping', 'Hu, Zhongli', 'Yuan, Yuan']","['Zhang F', 'Zhu K', 'Liu L', 'Zhu J', 'Li J', 'Zhang P', 'Hu Z', 'Yuan Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200301,England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.66 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/*metabolism', 'Th2 Cells/*metabolism']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.3511 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2020 Jul;38(5):582-590. doi: 10.1002/cbf.3511.

The intestinal microbiota has been recognized as a key regulator of mucosal immune responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that intestinal microbial changes would be associated with enterocyte loss and systemic inflammation during induction treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We prospectively included 51 children newly-diagnosed with ALL treated in Denmark in 2015-2018. Plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma citrulline (marker of functional enterocytes mass) measurements and fecal samplings were performed on treatment Days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. Moreover, intestinal mucositis was scored by a trained nurse/physician. Fecal samples in patients and 19 healthy siblings were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3-V4 region). Bacterial alpha diversity was lower in patients compared to siblings. It decreased from Day 1 to Days 8-22 and increased on Day 29. Shannon alpha diversity index was correlated with CRP on Days 15-29 (rho = -0.33-0.49; p < 0.05) and with citrulline on Days 15 and 29 (although with p values <0.06, rho = 0.32-0.34).

Initially characterized within the cardiovascular system, one such member, SMYD2, has been implicated as an oncogene in leukemias deriving from flawed hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation. We show here that conditional SMYD2 loss disrupts hematopoiesis at and downstream of the HSC via both apoptotic loss and transcriptional deregulation of HSC proliferation and disruption of Wnt-beta-Catenin signaling. Yet, previously documented SMYD2 cell cycle targets were unscathed. Turning our analysis to human leukemias, we observed that SMYD2 is highly expressed in CML, MLLr-B-ALL, AML, T-ALL, and B-ALL leukemias and its levels in B-ALL correlate with poor survival. SMYD2 knockdown results in apoptotic death and loss of anchorage-independent transformation of each of these hematopoietic leukemias. These data provide an underlying mechanism by which SMYD2 acts during normal hematopoiesis and as a proto-oncogene in leukemia.","['Brown, Mark A', 'Edwards, Melissa A', 'Alshiraihi, Ilham', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Dekker, Joseph D', 'Tucker, Haley O']","['Brown MA', 'Edwards MA', 'Alshiraihi I', 'Geng H', 'Dekker JD', 'Tucker HO']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station A5000, Austin, TX, 78712, USA.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station A5000, Austin, TX, 78712, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biosciences, The University of Texas at Austin, 1 University Station A5000, Austin, TX, 78712, USA. haleytucker@austin.utexas.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200302,England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.12.2 (lysine monooxygenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (SMYD2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Smyd2 protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41435-020-0094-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41435-020-0094-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Immun. 2020 Feb;21(2):119-130. doi: 10.1038/s41435-020-0094-8.

Here, we investigate the role of ZBTB7A and its mutations in the context of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that clinically relevant ZBTB7A mutations in AML t(8;21) lead to loss of function and result in perturbed myeloid differentiation with block of the granulocytic lineage in favor of monocytic commitment. In addition, loss of ZBTB7A increases glycolysis and hence sensitizes leukemic blasts to metabolic inhibition with 2-deoxy-D-glucose. We observed that ectopic expression of wild-type ZBTB7A prevents RUNX1-RUNX1T1-mediated clonal expansion of human CD34+ cells, whereas the outgrowth of progenitors is enabled by ZBTB7A mutation. Finally, ZBTB7A expression in t(8;21) cells lead to a cell cycle arrest that could be mimicked by inhibition of glycolysis. Our findings suggest that loss of ZBTB7A may facilitate the onset of AML t(8;21), and that RUNX1-RUNX1T1-rearranged leukemia might be treated with glycolytic inhibitors.","['Redondo Monte, Enric',

Therefore, prevention of obesity leads to the prevention of metabolic diseases. In light of this, substances that exert anti-obesity effects are crucial for the prevention of obesity. Indirubin, a 3,2' bisindole isomer of indigo, is the active component of the traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of chronic myelocytic leukemia. In particular, indirubin-3'-oxime (1) was shown to inhibit the differentiation of adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of nine indirubin-3'-oxime derivatives against lipid accumulation during differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells. Among the compounds tested, 5-methoxyindirubin-3'-oxime (2) and 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (7) at 5 microM exhibited significantly stronger inhibitory activity than indirubin-3'-oxime (1). Furthermore, 5-methoxyindirubin-3'-oxime (2) and 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (7) markedly suppressed the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha, peroxisome proliferator activator gamma2, and adipocyte protein 2, both of which are key adipogenic regulators at the intermediate stage of adipocyte differentiation. Our results demonstrate that 5-methoxyindirubin-3'-oxime (2) and 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (7) significantly down-regulated lipid accumulation during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, suggesting their potential as novel therapeutic drugs against the development of obesity.","['Nobushi, Yasuhito', 'Saito, Hiroaki', 'Miyairi, Shinichi', 'Uchiyama, Taketo', 'Kishikawa, Yukinaga']","['Nobushi Y', 'Saito H', 'Miyairi S', 'Uchiyama T', 'Kishikawa Y']","['School of Pharmacy, Nihon University.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nihon University.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nihon University.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nihon University.', 'School of Pharmacy, Nihon University.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"[""0 (5-methoxyindirubin 3'-oxime)"", '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oximes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', ""0 (indirubin-3'-monoxime)"", 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)']",IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells/cytology', 'Adipocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Indoles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Lipid Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Oximes', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1248/bpb.b19-00910 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2020;43(3):503-508. doi: 10.1248/bpb.b19-00910.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['3T3-L1 cell', ""indirubin-3'-oxime derivative"", 'lipid accumulation', 'obesity']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aim to assess the epidemiologic characteristics of this association and emphasize the importance of carefully approaching such cases. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with CLL between 2000 and 2015 and registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database of the US National Cancer Institute were identified using the SEER*stat software (version 8.3.5). The Multiple Primary Standardized Incidence Ratios session of the SEER*stat software (version 8.3.5) was used to calculate the observed/expected (O/E) ratios of melanoma. RESULTS: 48,876 CLL cases were reviewed, of which 474 developed a second primary melanoma of the skin. O/E ratio was 2.07 (95% CI 1.89-2.27), and excess risk was 9.7 per 10,000. The increase in melanoma risk was higher within the first 5 years following CLL diagnosis; O/E=2.22 (95% CI 1.56-2.14) and excess risk was 10.43 per 10,000. It was higher in males compared to females O/E was 2.10 (95% CI 1.89-2.33) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.62-2.40) in males and females, respectively, and in people aged 45-64; O/E=2.30 (95% CI 1.95-2.70). Out of 7827 CLL patients receiving chemotherapy, 70 later developed melanoma with a significant O/E of 2.28 (95% CI 1.77-2.88) and an excess risk of 10.66 per 10,000. CONCLUSION: CLL increases the risk of developing melanoma, especially within 5 years of the diagnosis, and in white males aged between 45-64 years. It is crucial to keep rigorous screening, high-suspicion and close follow-up for recurrence in consideration while managing these patients.","['Turk, Tarek', 'Saad, Anas M', 'Al-Husseini, Muneer J', 'Gad, Mohamed M']","['Turk T', 'Saad AM', 'Al-Husseini MJ', 'Gad MM']","['Department of Dermatology and Venereology, General Commission of the Red Crescent Hospital, Ministry of Health, Damascus, Syria.

From 47 to 57 wk, average weekly mortality increased from 0.11 to 3.0%, and egg production decreased from 10 to 30%, with a peak mortality rate (3.0%) observed at 54 wk of age. Necropsy of 11 birds demonstrated tissue damage that included hepatitis, liver hemorrhage, rupture, and/or enlarged livers. Microscopic liver lesions exhibited hepatocytic necrosis, lymphocytic periphlebitis, and myeloid leukosis. While no bacteria were recovered from liver and spleen samples, avian hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA was detected in all 11 tested hens by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Of these, subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) proviral DNA was detected in 5 hens by PCR. Alignments of partial ORF2 gene sequences obtained here demonstrated shared identity (76 to 97%) with corresponding sequences of other known avian HEV isolates. Env sequences of ALV-J isolates obtained here shared 50.1 to 55% identity with other ALV subgroups and 91.8 to 95.5% identity with other known ALV-J isolates. Phylogenetic tree analysis of selected sequences obtained here grouped an avian HEV sequence with genotype 3 HEV and assigned an ALV-J sequence to a branch separate from known ALV-J subgroups. Immunohistochemical results confirmed the presence of avian HEV and ALV-J in livers. Therefore, these results suggest that avian HEV and ALV-J co-infection caused the outbreak of hepatitis and liver hemorrhagic syndrome observed in the layer hen flock analyzed in this study.","['Sun, Yani', 'Lu, Qizhong', 'Zhang, Jingfei', 'Li, Xiaoxuan', 'Zhao, Jiakai', 'Fan, Wenqi', 'Ji, Pinpin', 'Wang, Kun', 'Zhou, En-Min', 'Zhao, Qin']","['Sun Y', 'Lu Q', 'Zhang J', 'Li X', 'Zhao J', 'Fan W', 'Ji P', 'Wang K', 'Zhou EM', 'Zhao Q']","['Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', ""Xi'an Center for Animal Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China."", 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.', 'Department of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, China; Scientific Observing and Experimental Station of Veterinary Pharmacology and Diagnostic Technology, Ministry of Agriculture, Yangling, Shaanxi, China.

In order to assess the safety of these bioactive compounds, the present study aimed to determine the toxicity of an ethanolic extract of T. gardneriana, (EETg). Toxicological tests included hemolytic activity, toxicity toward the brine shrimp Artemia, cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells (MCF7) and acute oral toxicity in rodents. In addition, toxicogenomics techniques were used to determine genome expression in MCF7 cells exposed to EETg. The results showed that the extract exhibits approximately 60% of hemolytic activity at the highest tested concentration (64 microg/ml) and toxicity against nauplii of Artemia sp. (LC50 of 67.85 microg/ml). Further, EETg appears to be cytotoxic to MCF7 (cell viability reduced to 40% at 250 microg/ml after 24 hr). Genomic data demonstrated differential expression of 14 genes. Data analysis indicated possible altered pathways (e.g., xenobiotic metabolism), possible adverse health risks (e.g., hepatotoxicity), and drugs with similar gene expression profile (e.g., antimicrobials). The investigation provides important information on potentially adverse aspects of EETg, which need to be considered prior to the therapeutic utilization of this plant.Abbreviations: EETg: ethanolic extract of T. gardneriana seeds; MCF7: michigan cancer foundation-7 which refers to a human breast cell line (adenocarcinoma); NGS: next-generation sequencing; edgeR: empirical analysis of digital gene expression data in R; Consensus: consensus path database; FDR: false discovery rate; NCBI: national center for biotechnology information; KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes; Ingenuity: ingenuity pathway analysis software; CMAP: connectivity map; OECD: organization for economic co-operation and development; HL-60: human promyelocytic leukemia cells; PC3: prostate cancer cells.","['Almeida, Thiago S', 'Arantes, Mariana R', 'Lopes Neto, Jose J', 'Souza, Terezinha M', 'Pessoa, Igor P', 'Medeiros, Jackeline L', 'Tabosa, Pedro M S', 'Moreira, Thais B', 'Farias, Davi F', 'Carvalho, Ana F U']","['Almeida TS', 'Arantes MR', 'Lopes Neto JJ', 'Souza TM', 'Pessoa IP', 'Medeiros JL', 'Tabosa PMS', 'Moreira TB', 'Farias DF', 'Carvalho AFU']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Toxicogenomics, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Federal University of Paraiba, Joao Pessoa, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Ceara, Fortaleza, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200302,England,J Toxicol Environ Health A,Journal of toxicology and environmental health.

Although dysregulation of the epigenetic landscape in this leukaemia is particularly interesting given the low mutation frequency, its comprehensive analysis using whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) has not been previously performed. Here we investigated epigenetic dysregulation in nine MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML samples by comparing them to six normal myeloid controls, using a computational method that encapsulates mean DNA methylation measurements along with analyses of methylation stochasticity. We discovered a dramatically altered epigenetic profile in MLL-r AML, associated with genome-wide hypomethylation and a markedly increased DNA methylation entropy reflecting an increasingly disordered epigenome. Methylation discordance mapped to key genes and regulatory elements that included bivalent promoters and active enhancers. Genes associated with significant changes in methylation stochasticity recapitulated known MLL-r AML expression signatures, suggesting a role for the altered epigenetic landscape in the transcriptional programme initiated by MLL translocations. Accordingly, we established statistically significant associations between discordances in methylation stochasticity and gene expression in MLL-r AML, thus providing a link between the altered epigenetic landscape and the phenotype.","['Koldobskiy, Michael A', 'Abante, Jordi', 'Jenkinson, Garrett', 'Pujadas, Elisabet', 'Tetens, Ashley', 'Zhao, Feifei', 'Tryggvadottir, Rakel', 'Idrizi, Adrian', 'Reinisch, Andreas', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Goutsias, John', 'Feinberg, Andrew P']","['Koldobskiy MA', 'Abante J', 'Jenkinson G', 'Pujadas E', 'Tetens A', 'Zhao F', 'Tryggvadottir R', 'Idrizi A', 'Reinisch A', 'Majeti R', 'Goutsias J', 'Feinberg AP']","['Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Pediatric Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Institute, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Institute, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Health Science Research, Mayo Clinic , Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , New York, NY, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz , Graz, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Cancer Institute and Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Institute, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200229,United States,Epigenetics,Epigenetics,101265293,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*DNA Methylation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/03/03 06:00'],"['2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15592294.2020.1734149 [doi]'],ppublish,Epigenetics. 2020 Aug;15(8):841-858. doi: 10.1080/15592294.2020.1734149.

Sevoflurane, a frequently-used inhalational anesthetic, was discovered to have neurotoxicity that can cause neurological damage in patients. The present study was performed to investigate the protective effect of CPCGI on sevoflurane-induced nerve damage and to reveal the neuroprotective mechanisms of CPCGI. MATERIAL AND METHODS Firstly, the hippocampal neurons were separated from Sprague-Dawley embryonic rats, and were stimulated by 3% sevoflurane for different times (0, 2, 4, and 6 h). Then, cell viability and cell apoptosis were assessed by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and flow cytometry (FCM), respectively. Western blot analysis was used to determine the apoptosis-related protein expression levels. RESULTS The results demonstrated that 3% sevoflurane significantly inhibited cell viability but induced cell apoptosis in neurons in a time-dependent manner. Treatment with 3% sevoflurane also promoted the Bax (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl2)-associated X protein) and cleaved caspase3 protein expressions, and suppressed Bcl-2 and pro-caspase3 expressions in hippocampal neurons. In addition, phosphorylated (p)-p38 and p-p65 expression and the ratio of p-p38/p38 and p-p65/p65 were upregulated in a time-dependent manner after 3% sevoflurane treatment. Further analysis indicated that all the effects of 3% sevoflurane on hippocampal neurons were reversed by CPCGI pre-treatment. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the neuroprotective role of CPCGI in sevoflurane-stimulated neuronal cell damage via regulation of the MAPK/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","['Song, Haigang', 'Xun, Shining', 'He, Huali', 'Duan, Chongzhen', 'Li, Qiang']","['Song H', 'Xun S', 'He H', 'Duan C', 'Li Q']","[""Department of Anesthesiology, Xianyang Hospital of Yan'an University, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China (mainland)."", 'Department of First Anesthesiology and Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of First Anesthesiology and Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of First Anesthesiology and Surgery, Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, Shaanxi, China (mainland).', 'Department of Anesthesiology, The Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200301,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Anesthetics, Inhalation)', '0 (Cerebrosides)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '38LVP0K73A (Sevoflurane)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Anesthetics, Inhalation/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Cerebrosides/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Gangliosides/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Hippocampus/drug effects/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', '*Neurons/drug effects/physiology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Sevoflurane/*toxicity', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Swine', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2020/03/03 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/03/02 06:00'],"['2020/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['919600 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.919600 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 Mar 1;26:e919600. doi: 10.12659/MSM.919600.,,,,PMC7065510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the association between HZ and subsequent cancer risk by cancer type. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective cohort study using the Korean National Health Insurance claims database. The study enrolled 1,568,818 patients: 784,409 diagnosed with HZ between 2010 and 2015 were included in the HZ group, and 784,409 matched controls without HZ were included in the non-HZ group, with 1:1 exact matching for age, sex, and index year. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the risk of cancers based on anatomical site according to the HZ status using the Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 6 years, 22,235 and 22,316 patients in the HZ group and the non-HZ group, respectively, developed cancer (incidence rate: 7.6 vs. 7.7 per 1,000 person-years). After adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, the overall risk of cancers was slightly decreased in the HZ group compared with the non-HZ group (HR, 0.999; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.02). In post hoc analyses on organ site, the HZ group had significantly increased risk of hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.37-1.95), leukemia (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03-1.39), and lymphoma (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30) compared with the non-HZ group. Conversely, the risk of cancers in the liver (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.93) and larynx (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.92) were significantly decreased in the HZ group compared with the non-HZ group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of developing some hematological cancers increased in patients with HZ, solid cancers including liver and laryngeal cancers showed a negative association with HZ.","['Kim, Miri', 'Han, Kyungdo', 'Yoo, Seung Ah', 'Lee, Ji Hyun']","['Kim M', 'Han K', 'Yoo SA', 'Lee JH']","[""Department of Dermatology, Yeouido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", 'Department of Medical Statistics, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', ""Department of Dermatology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea."", ""Department of Dermatology, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea, yiji1@hanmail.net.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200228,Switzerland,Dermatology,"Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)",9203244,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Herpes Zoster/*complications/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2020/03/03 06:00,2021/10/21 06:00,['2020/03/02 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['000505911 [pii]', '10.1159/000505911 [doi]']",ppublish,Dermatology. 2021;237(1):73-78. doi: 10.1159/000505911.

The popularity of stem cell-based therapy is due to its flexibility and potent approach in the treatment of numerous diseases. Treatment with genetically configured HSCs favors the engraftment of transplantation without rejection. MSCs hold an immunoregulatory capacity, elicit immunosuppressive effects and are immune-privileged cells, due to the low expression of MHCII and costimulatory molecules on their cell surface.

METHODS: Using a provincial population-based database, we analyzed CLL patients who received upfront treatment in British Columbia before ibrutinib availability (1984-2014), during ibrutinib access for: relapse only (2014-2015) and for upfront treatment of patients (with 17p deletion or unfit for chemotherapy) (2015-2016). Analysis included up to third-line treatment. RESULTS: Of 1729 patients meeting inclusion criteria (median age, 66 years; 1466, period 1; 140, period 2; 123, period 3), FR was the most common first-line therapy (35.8 %, 54.3 % and 40.7 %, periods 1-3, respectively) and 18.7 % received ibrutinib upfront in period 3. The most common therapies in relapse were chemoimmunotherapy (36.1 % and 55.6 %, periods 1 and 2, second-line; 29.2 %, period 1, third-line) and ibrutinib (69.8 %, period 3, second-line; 46.4 % and 70.3 %, periods 2 and 3, third-line). OS improved for patients treated in periods 2-3 over period 1 (median OS not reached vs. 11.9 years, p < 0.001; no difference in OS for periods 2-3, p = 0.385). CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib has replaced chemoimmunotherapy as the preferred therapy in relapse. Overall survival has improved over time with access to ibrutinib.","['Huang, Steven J', 'Gerrie, Alina S', 'Young, Sean', 'Tucker, Tracy', 'Bruyere, Helene', 'Hrynchak, Monica', 'Galbraith, Paul', 'Al Tourah, Abdulwahab J', 'Dueck, Gregory', 'Noble, Michael C', 'Ramadan, Khaled M', 'Tsang, Peter', 'Hardy, Edward', 'Sehn, Laurie', 'Toze, Cynthia L']","['Huang SJ', 'Gerrie AS', 'Young S', 'Tucker T', 'Bruyere H', 'Hrynchak M', 'Galbraith P', 'Al Tourah AJ', 'Dueck G', 'Noble MC', 'Ramadan KM', 'Tsang P', 'Hardy E', 'Sehn L', 'Toze CL']","['Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada; British Columbia Cancer - Vancouver, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, British Columbia Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, British Columbia Cancer, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cytogenetics Laboratory, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada.', 'Molecular Cytogenetic Laboratory, Royal Columbian Hospital, University of British Columbia, New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.', 'British Columbia Cancer - Abbotsford, University of British Columbia, Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada.', 'British Columbia Cancer - Surrey, University of British Columbia, Surrey, British Columbia, Canada.', 'British Columbia Cancer - Kelowna, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Royal Columbian Hospital, New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.', ""St. Paul's Hospital, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada; Richmond Hospital, Richmond, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Tom McMurty & Peter Baerg Cancer Centre, Vernon Jubilee Hospital, Vernon, British Columbia, Canada.', 'British Columbia Cancer - Vancouver, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada; British Columbia Cancer - Vancouver, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Genomic regions interact with nuclear lamina, termed lamina-associated domains (LADs). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these 3D chromatin architectures remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of a potential tumor suppressor, TOP1 Binding Arginine/Serine Rich Protein (TOPORS), in genome organization. In mouse hepatocytes, chromatin interactions between A and B compartments increase and compartmentalization strength is reduced significantly upon Topors knockdown. Correspondingly, strength of TAD boundaries located at A/B borders is weakened. In the absence of TOPORS, chromatin-lamina interactions decrease and the coverage of LADs reduces from 53.31% to 46.52%. Interestingly, these changes in 3D genome are associated with PML nuclear bodies and PML-associated domains (PADs). Moreover, chromatin accessibility is altered predominantly at intergenic regions upon Topors knockdown, including a subset of enhancers. These alterations of chromatin are concordant with transcriptome changes, which are associated with carcinogenesis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that TOPORS functions as a regulator in chromatin structure, providing novel insight into the architectural roles of tumor suppressors in higher-order genome organization.","['Ji, Luzhang', 'Huo, Xiangru', 'Zhang, Yuwen', 'Yan, Zixiang', 'Wang, Qianfeng', 'Wen, Bo']","['Ji L', 'Huo X', 'Zhang Y', 'Yan Z', 'Wang Q', 'Wen B']","['Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China.', ""Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China; The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China."", ""The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Key Laboratory of Metabolism and Molecular Medicine, Ministry of Education, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, and Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, China; State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, Collaborative Innovation Center of Genetics and Development, Fudan University, Shanghai 200438, China.

A major challenge in treating these cancers is to understand and overcome endocrine resistance. The Megakaryoblastic Leukemia 1 (MKL1, MRTFA) protein is a master regulator of actin dynamic and cellular motile functions, whose nuclear translocation favors epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We previously demonstrated that nuclear accumulation of MKL1 in estrogen-responsive breast cancer cell lines promotes hormonal escape. In the present study, we confirm through tissue microarray analysis that nuclear immunostaining of MKL1 is associated with endocrine resistance in a cohort of breast cancers and we decipher the underlining mechanisms using cell line models. We show through gene expression microarray analysis that the nuclear accumulation of MKL1 induces dedifferentiation leading to a mixed luminal/basal phenotype and suppresses estrogen-mediated control of gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of DNA coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) shows a profound reprogramming in ERalpha cistrome associated with a massive loss of ERalpha binding sites (ERBSs) generally associated with lower ERalpha-binding levels. Novel ERBSs appear to be associated with EGF and RAS signaling pathways. Collectively, these results highlight a major role of MKL1 in the loss of ERalpha transcriptional activity observed in certain cases of endocrine resistances, thereby contributing to breast tumor cells malignancy.","['Jehanno, Charly', 'Fernandez-Calero, Tamara', 'Habauzit, Denis', 'Avner, Stephane', 'Percevault, Frederic', 'Jullion, Emmanuelle', 'Le Goff, Pascale', 'Coissieux, Marie May', 'Muenst, Simone', 'Marin, Monica', 'Michel, Denis', 'Metivier, Raphael', 'Flouriot, Gilles']","['Jehanno C', 'Fernandez-Calero T', 'Habauzit D', 'Avner S', 'Percevault F', 'Jullion E', 'Le Goff P', 'Coissieux MM', 'Muenst S', 'Marin M', 'Michel D', 'Metivier R', 'Flouriot G']","['Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail) - UMR_S 1085, F-35000 Rennes, France; University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Biochemistry-Molecular Biology, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Igua 4225, 11400 Montevideo, Uruguay; Bioinformatics Unit, Institut Pasteur Montevideo, Mataojo 2020, 11400 Montevideo, Uruguay; Departamento de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad Catolica del Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail) - UMR_S 1085, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, UMR 6290 CNRS, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail) - UMR_S 1085, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, UMR 6290 CNRS, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail) - UMR_S 1085, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Pathology, University Hospital Basel, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Biochemistry-Molecular Biology, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de la Republica, Igua 4225, 11400 Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail) - UMR_S 1085, F-35000 Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Institut de Genetique et Developpement de Rennes, UMR 6290 CNRS, Rennes, France.', 'Univ Rennes, Inserm, EHESP, Irset (Institut de Recherche en Sante, Environnement et Travail) - UMR_S 1085, F-35000 Rennes, France.

Besides the main effects of biomarkers, the progression of complex diseases is also influenced by gene-gene (GxG) interactions. RESEARCH QUESTION: Would screening the functional capacity of biomarkers on the basis of main effects or interactions, using multiomics data, improve the accuracy of cancer prognosis? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Biomarker screening and model validation were used to construct and validate a prognostic prediction model. NSCLC prognosis-associated biomarkers were identified on the basis of either their main effects or interactions with two types of omics data. A prognostic score incorporating epigenetic and transcriptional biomarkers, as well as clinical information, was independently validated. RESULTS: Twenty-six pairs of biomarkers with GxG interactions and two biomarkers with main effects were significantly associated with NSCLC survival. Compared with a model using clinical information only, the accuracy of the epigenetic and transcriptional biomarker-based prognostic model, measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), increased by 35.38% (95% CI, 27.09%-42.17%; P = 5.10 x 10(-17)) and 34.85% (95% CI, 26.33%-41.87%; P = 2.52 x 10(-18)) for 3- and 5-year survival, respectively, which exhibited a superior predictive ability for NSCLC survival (AUC3 year, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.83-0.93]; and AUC5 year, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.83-0.93]) in an independent Cancer Genome Atlas population. GxG interactions contributed a 65.2% and 91.3% increase in prediction accuracy for 3- and 5-year survival, respectively. INTERPRETATION: The integration of epigenetic and transcriptional biomarkers with main effects and GxG interactions significantly improves the accuracy of prognostic prediction of early-stage NSCLC survival.","['Zhang, Ruyang', 'Chen, Chao', 'Dong, Xuesi', 'Shen, Sipeng', 'Lai, Linjing', 'He, Jieyu', 'You, Dongfang', 'Lin, Lijuan', 'Zhu, Ying', 'Huang, Hui', 'Chen, Jiajin', 'Wei, Liangmin', 'Chen, Xin', 'Li, Yi', 'Guo, Yichen', 'Duan, Weiwei', 'Liu, Liya', 'Su, Li', 'Shafer, Andrea', 'Fleischer, Thomas', 'Moksnes Bjaanaes, Maria', 'Karlsson, Anna', 'Planck, Maria', 'Wang, Rui', 'Staaf, Johan', 'Helland, Aslaug', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Wei, Yongyue', 'Chen, Feng', 'Christiani, David C']","['Zhang R', 'Chen C', 'Dong X', 'Shen S', 'Lai L', 'He J', 'You D', 'Lin L', 'Zhu Y', 'Huang H', 'Chen J', 'Wei L', 'Chen X', 'Li Y', 'Guo Y', 'Duan W', 'Liu L', 'Su L', 'Shafer A', 'Fleischer T', 'Moksnes Bjaanaes M', 'Karlsson A', 'Planck M', 'Wang R', 'Staaf J', 'Helland A', 'Esteller M', 'Wei Y', 'Chen F', 'Christiani DC']","['Department of Biostatistics, Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China; Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.

Cytarabine and anthracyclines were introduced for the treatment of AML in the 1970s, and in the ensuing 4 decades, the pharmacologic pipeline has experienced a standstill. The absence of FDA approvals in AML is not a reflection of the lack of understanding of the disease biology. The field has seen major advances from the standpoint of stem cell biology and clonal evolution, and the field has also seen some therapeutic advances, but these therapeutic advances have arisen from optimization of the same traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutics rather than the development of novel therapies. The year 2017 marked a turning point with regard to FDA approvals. This review summarizes the salient clinical trials that led to the approval of 8 novel agents in AML in the past 2 years. For these agents, the clinical activity is often defined by specific molecular aberrations or metabolic features of AML cells. We also emphasize the principles of management of AML in the current era of genomic medicine, with a focus on considerations for targeting mutation-specific vulnerabilities in select patients. This review also highlights unique challenges to the use of novel agents in 2020, including considerations of curative potential with regards to bridging to allogeneic stem cell transplant, tolerability, financial toxicities, and microenvironmental hurdles. Finally, we discuss prospects on future immunotherapeutic investigational agents in the pharmacologic pipeline.","['Patel, Shyam A', 'Gerber, Jonathan M']","['Patel SA', 'Gerber JM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, UMass Memorial Medical Center, Worcester, MA.

AIM OF THE STUDY: To determine the association between the number of immune cells and the expression of surface markers in leukemic cells of patients with de novo CML who achieved molecular response. METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted in 31 patients with de novo CML. Peripheral blood samples were obtained at diagnosis for quantification of immune cells and tumor cells expressing CD200, CD135, GpP, and Bcl-2. Results were compared with a group of 60 healthy donors. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed during a 48 month follow-up period and molecular response to treatment was assessed simultaneously by QT-PCR. The group of patients with deep molecular response was compared with de novo CML patients; the cut-off value of cell count was determined by ROC analysis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard model were used to determine the significant association between the number of cells and progression-free survival. RESULTS: Differences in number of CD4, CD4Tregs, NK, gammadeltaT, monocytes, and pDC's, tumor-cells expressing CD200(+), CD135(+), GpP(+), and Bcl-2(+) were observed between patients and healthy donors. The number of gammadeltaT lymphocytes, CD200(+), and CD135(+) cells were associated with longer progression-free survival (p = 0.0112, p = 0.0012 and p = 0.0201 respectively). CONCLUSION: A gammadeltaT lymphocyte count <63 cel/uL, CD200(+) <997 cel/uL, and CD135(+) <23 317 cel/uL at diagnosis is associated with the maintenance of deep molecular response at 48 months in patients with de novo CML.","['Molina-Aguilar, Rubiraida', 'Montiel-Cervantes, Laura Arcelia', 'Anguiano-Penaloza, Santa Victoria', 'Lezama, Ruth', 'Vela-Ojeda, Jorge', 'Reyes-Maldonado, Elba']","['Molina-Aguilar R', 'Montiel-Cervantes LA', 'Anguiano-Penaloza SV', 'Lezama R', 'Vela-Ojeda J', 'Reyes-Maldonado E']","['Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Departamento de Hematologia, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital Dr. Antonio Fraga Mouret, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Unidad de Investigacion de Medicina Traslacional en Enfermedades Hemato-Oncologicas, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Departamento de Hematologia, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital Dr. Antonio Fraga Mouret, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Unidad de Investigacion de Medicina Traslacional en Enfermedades Hemato-Oncologicas, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Departamento de Hematologia, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital Dr. Antonio Fraga Mouret, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico; Unidad de Investigacion de Medicina Traslacional en Enfermedades Hemato-Oncologicas, Unidad Medica de Alta Especialidad, Hospital Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Morfologia, Escuela Nacional de Ciencias Biologicas, Instituto Politecnico Nacional, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.

The discovery of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against the BCR-ABL1 oncogenic fusion protein has revolutionized the management of CML, becoming a chronic illness rather than a life-threatening disease. Because ensuring ongoing well-being requires some knowledge, LMC France has built, in synergy with healthcare professionals from its scientific council, a CML-specific, patient-friendly knowledge base including resources and knowledge related to drug information (drug development, generics, pharmacovigilance) and drug safety using several educational tools such as videos, CML support, and CML drug sheets. To disseminate more largely, an e-university learning for regional key informants from LMC France and also CML patients and their caregivers was launched, including a large resources related to drug information and drug safety in synergy with hematologists and clinical pharmacologists.","['Daban, Mina', 'Lacroix, Clemence', 'Micallef, Joelle']","['Daban M', 'Lacroix C', 'Micallef J']","['LMC France, 13010 Marseille, France.

This may lead to the definition of novel decision support tools, able to tailor therapeutic interventions on the basis of a ""precise"" patients' risk stratification, given their health status evolution. However, longitudinal analysis requires long-term data collection and curation, which can be time demanding, expensive and sometimes unfeasible. Here we present a clinical decision support framework that combines the simulation of disease progression from cross-sectional data with a Markov model that exploits continuous-time transition probabilities derived from Cox regression. Trajectories between patients at different disease stages are stochastically built according to a measure of patient similarity, computed with a matrix tri-factorization technique. Such trajectories are seen as realizations drawn from the stochastic process driving the transitions between the disease stages. Eventually, Markov models applied to the resulting longitudinal dataset highlight potentially relevant clinical information. We applied our method to cross-sectional genomic and clinical data from a cohort of Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) patients. MDS are heterogeneous clonal hematopoietic disorders whose patients are characterized by different risks of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) development, defined by an international score. We computed patients' trajectories across increasing and subsequent levels of risk of developing AML, and we applied a Cox model to the simulated longitudinal dataset to assess whether genomic characteristics could be associated with a higher or lower probability of disease progression. We then used the learned parameters of such Cox model to calculate the transition probabilities of a continuous-time Markov model that describes the patients' evolution across stages. Our results are in most cases confirmed by previous studies, thus demonstrating that simulated longitudinal data represent a valuable resource to investigate disease progression of MDS patients.","['Nicora, G', 'Moretti, F', 'Sauta, E', 'Della Porta, M', 'Malcovati, L', 'Cazzola, M', 'Quaglini, S', 'Bellazzi, R']","['Nicora G', 'Moretti F', 'Sauta E', 'Della Porta M', 'Malcovati L', 'Cazzola M', 'Quaglini S', 'Bellazzi R']","['Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Cancer Center, Humanitas Research Hospital and Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200226,United States,J Biomed Inform,Journal of biomedical informatics,100970413,,IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Research Design']",2020/03/01 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['S1532-0464(20)30026-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103398 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomed Inform. 2020 Apr;104:103398. doi: 10.1016/j.jbi.2020.103398.

Although BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors are remarkably effective in inducing remission in chronic phase patients, they are not curative in a majority of patients due to their failure to eradicate residual CML stem/progenitor cells, which reside in bone marrow niches. Here, we presented novel dual oligopeptides-conjugated nanoparticles and demonstrated their effective delivery of arsenic trioxide in bone marrow niches for the elimination of primitive CML cells. We encapsulated As-Ni transitional metal compounds into polymeric nanoparticles based on the reverse micelle rationale. The loading density and stability of arsenic trioxide in nanoparticles were improved. In vitro experiments demonstrated that dual oligopeptides conjugated nanoparticles could deliver arsenic trioxide into bone marrow niches including endosteal niches and vascular niches. The colony-forming activity of CML cells was remarkably restrained in the presence of metaphyseal bone fragments pre-incubated with bone marrow niche targeted arsenic nanoparticles. The in vitro vascular niche model suggested that CML cell proliferation was also successfully inhibited through a tight contact with HUVECs, which were pre-treated using niche-targeted arsenic nanoparticles. This bone marrow niche targeted delivery strategy has a potential usage for the treatment of CML and other malignant hematologic disorders originated from the bone marrow.","['Fan, Luhui', 'Liu, Cong', 'Hu, Anzhi', 'Liang, Jing', 'Li, Fanzhu', 'Xiong, Yang', 'Mu, Chao-Feng']","['Fan L', 'Liu C', 'Hu A', 'Liang J', 'Li F', 'Xiong Y', 'Mu CF']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China.', 'Center for Synthetic Biochemistry, Shenzhen Institute of Synthetic Biology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310053, China.

These transcripts are classified according to their length to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Expression studies have revealed dysregulation of their expression in leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Notably, some miRNAs have been shown to define stem cell features in leukemic cells. Several lncRNAs exert their pathogenic roles via modulation of miRNA expression or function by acting as sponges for these transcripts. Consequently, recognition of the interactive network between lncRNAs and miRNAs would help in revealing the underlying mechanism of cancer. In this review, we summarize the functions and characteristics of tumor-associated lncRNAs and miRNAs as well as their participation in the hematological malignancies. These data might facilitate design of targeted therapies for this kind of malignancy.","['Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh', 'Esmaeili, Mohammadhosein', 'Taheri, Mohammad']","['Ghafouri-Fard S', 'Esmaeili M', 'Taheri M']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Urogenital Stem Cell Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

The produced leukotrienes are involved in inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, asthma, and atherosclerosis. A suitable 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor might be useful for preventing and improving the symptoms of leukotriene-related inflammatory diseases. Here, we investigate the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effect of a proanthocyanidin found in red-kerneled rice. Red-kerneled rice proanthocyanidin exhibited potent mixed noncompetitive inhibition of human and rat 5-lipoxygenases, with an IC50 values of 15.1muM against human enzyme, and 7.0muM against rat enzyme, respectively. This compound decreased leukotriene B4 production in rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 cells. In imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse skin, topical application of the proanthocyanidin suppressed hyperplasia, decreased inflammatory cell infiltration, and down-regulated expression of the psoriasis-associated genes Il17a, Il22, S100a9, and Krt1. Lipid metabolome analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry showed that red-kerneled rice proanthocyanidin treatment of psoriasis-like mouse skin dose-dependently decreased the production of leukotriene B4 but no other arachidonate metabolites. Red-kerneled rice proanthocyanidin inhibits 5-lipoxygenase, resulting in a decrease in leukotriene B4 production and psoriasis-like mouse skin inflammation. These results suggest that this proanthocyanidin may be therapeutically effective for treating leukotriene-related diseases.","['Toda, Keisuke', 'Tsukayama, Izumi', 'Nagasaki, Yuki', 'Konoike, Yuka', 'Tamenobu, Asako', 'Ganeko, Natsuki', 'Ito, Hideyuki', 'Kawakami, Yuki', 'Takahashi, Yoshitaka', 'Miki, Yoshimi', 'Yamamoto, Kei', 'Murakami, Makoto', 'Suzuki-Yamamoto, Toshiko']","['Toda K', 'Tsukayama I', 'Nagasaki Y', 'Konoike Y', 'Tamenobu A', 'Ganeko N', 'Ito H', 'Kawakami Y', 'Takahashi Y', 'Miki Y', 'Yamamoto K', 'Murakami M', 'Suzuki-Yamamoto T']","['Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan; Department of Nutrition and Life Science, Fukuyama University, Sanzo, Gakuen-cho 1, Fukuyama, Hiroshima, 729-0292, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Microenvironmental and Metabolic Health Sciences, Center for Disease Biology and Integrative Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Technology, Industrial and Social Science, Tokushima University, 2-1, Minami-jyosanjima-cho, Tokushima, 770-8513, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Microenvironmental and Metabolic Health Sciences, Center for Disease Biology and Integrative Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Nutritional Science, Okayama Prefectural University, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama, 719-1197, Japan.

It is an established human carcinogen and is known to cause acute myeloid leukemia in adults. Epidemiological evidence has since shown that benzene can cross the placenta and affect the fetal liver. Animal studies have shown that in utero exposure to benzene can increase tumor incidence in offspring. Although there have been risk factors established for acute myeloid leukemia, they still do not account for many of the cases. Clearly then, current efforts to elucidate the mechanism by which benzene exerts its carcinogenic properties have been superficial. Owing to the critical role of cell signaling pathways in the development of an organism and its various organ systems, it seems plausible to suspect that these pathways may have a role in leukemogenesis. This review article assesses current evidence of the effects of benzene on critical hematopoietic signaling pathways. Pathways discussed included Hedgehog, Notch/Delta, Wingless/Integrated, nuclear factor-kappaB and others. Following a review of the literature, it seems that current evidence about the effects of benzene on these critical signaling pathways remains limited. Given the important role of these pathways in hematopoiesis, more attention should be given to them.","['Lu, Peter C W', 'Shahbaz, Sara', 'Winn, Louise M']","['Lu PCW', 'Shahbaz S', 'Winn LM']","[""Department of Biomedical & Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Biomedical & Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""Department of Biomedical & Molecular Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada."", ""School of Environmental Sciences, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200228,England,J Appl Toxicol,Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,8109495,"['0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Benzene/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2020/03/01 06:00,2021/10/13 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jat.3961 [doi]'],ppublish,J Appl Toxicol. 2020 Aug;40(8):1018-1032. doi: 10.1002/jat.3961.

We evaluated 415 patients with AML-MRC treated from 2013 to 2018 and analyzed their clinical outcomes based on the diagnostic criteria of AML-MRC, therapy type and mutation profile. Criteria for AML-MRC included: cytogenetic abnormalities (AML-MRC-C) in 243 (59%), prior history of MDS in 75 (18%) including 47 (11%) with previously untreated MDS (AML-MRC-H) and 28 (7%) with previously treated MDS (AML-MRC-TS), and 97 (23%) with multilineage dysplasia (AML-MRC-M). Median age was 70 years (range 18-94). Among 95 evaluable patients, a total of 37 (39%) had secondary-type (ASXL1, BCOR, EZH2, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, U2AF1, ZRSR2) mutations. Mutations in ASXL1, BCOR, SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1 tended to appear in dominant clones. By multivariate analysis, AML-MRC subtype, age and serum LDH levels were independent predictors of outcome, with patients with AML-MRC-M (HR 0.56, CI 0.38-0.84, P = .004) and AML-MRC-H having better OS. Compared to a cohort of 468 patients with AML without MRC, patients with AML-MRC-M/AML-MRC-H had similar outcomes to those with intermediate risk AML by European LeukemiaNet criteria. Intensive therapy was associated with improved OS in patients with AML-MRC-M (HR 0.42, CI 0.19-0.94, P = .036) and with improved EFS in AML-MRC-M and AML-MRC-H (HR 0.26, CI 0.10-0.63, P = .003). This data suggests that not all diagnostic criteria for AML-MRC define high-risk patients and that specific subgroups may benefit from different therapeutic interventions.","['Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Class, Caleb A', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Daver, Naval', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Issa, Ghayas C', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Routbort, Mark', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Kadia, Tapan M']","['Montalban-Bravo G', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Class CA', 'Sasaki K', 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes JE', 'Daver N', 'Takahashi K', 'Short NJ', 'DiNardo CD', 'Jabbour E', 'Borthakur G', 'Naqvi K', 'Issa GC', 'Konopleva M', 'Khoury JD', 'Routbort M', 'Pierce S', 'Do KA', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Patel K', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Kadia TM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200320,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (CPX-351)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate']",2020/03/01 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25769 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 Jun;95(6):612-622. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25769.

The aim of this study was to characterize the metabolites of ponatinib in human liver microsomes as well as its reactive metabolites. Ponatinib was incubated with human liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH and trapping agents (glutathione or potassium cyanide). The metabolites were characterized by liquid chromatography in combination with Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS. Under the current conditions, six metabolites were detected and structurally identified on the basis of their accurate masses, fragmentation patterns, and retention times. M3 (N-demethylation) was unambiguously identified by matching its retention time and fragment ions with those of its reference standard. N-demethylation and oxygenation were proved to be the predominant metabolic pathways of ponatinib. In addition, two reactive metabolites (cyano adducts) were detected in human liver microsomes in the presence of potassium cyanide and NADPH, suggesting that ponatinib underwent CYP450-mediated metabolic activation, which could be one of the causative mechanisms for its hepatotoxicity. The current study provides new information regarding the metabolic profiles of ponatinib and would be helpful in understanding the effectiveness and toxicity of ponatinib, especially the mechanism of hepatotoxicity.","['Gao, Lei', 'Xu, Qiqi', 'Liu, Qingqing', 'Lang, Xiuzhuang']","['Gao L', 'Xu Q', 'Liu Q', 'Lang X']","['Department of Blood Collection, Jining Blood Center, Jining, Shandong Province, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong Province, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200312,England,Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,8610241,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Pyridazines/*analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods']",2020/03/01 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bmc.4819 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Chromatogr. 2020 Jun;34(6):e4819. doi: 10.1002/bmc.4819.

Menadione improved imatinib efficacy in K562 cells by downregulating ABCB1 expression and increased the intracellular concentration of imatinib, which confirmed that this combination regimen is more effective than imatinib monotherapy. The results demonstrate that menadione and imatinib combination therapy may be a promising approach to refractory CML.","['Xiao, Fei-Yan', 'Zhou, Fang-Jiao', 'Yuan, Fang', 'Kuang, Wei', 'Zhou, Gan', 'Zhou, Hong-Hao', 'Cao, Shan']","['Xiao FY', 'Zhou FJ', 'Yuan F', 'Kuang W', 'Zhou G', 'Zhou HH', 'Cao S']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, Changsha, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, Changsha, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, Changsha, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, Changsha, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, Changsha, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Changsha, China.', 'Institution of Drug Clinical Trial, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, Changsha, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Engineering Research Center of Applied Technology of Pharmacogenomics, Ministry of Education, Changsha, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Disorders, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Australia,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,0425076,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin K 3/*pharmacology']",2020/03/01 06:00,2021/07/14 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1440-1681.13293 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 2020 Jun;47(6):997-1004. doi: 10.1111/1440-1681.13293.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7201-7520'],,"['(c) 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*ABCB1', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*imatinib', '*menadione', '*potentiate']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of human DOCK10.2 protein in cell lines, and its induction by interleukin-4 (IL-4) in normal B lymphocytes and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, were previously demonstrated using an antiserum raised against a peptide encoded by sequences from exon 1.2. Here, expression of human DOCK10.1 protein was demonstrated using an antiserum raised against a peptide encoded by sequences from exon 1.1. Specificity of the DOCK10.1 and DOCK10.2 antisera for their respective isoforms was demonstrated using transfected human 293 T cells. Their specificity for endogenous DOCK10 was strongly suggested by the high significance of the correlations between the levels of their expected signals at the molecular size of 250 kDa and the levels of DOCK10.1 and DOCK10.2 mRNAs, respectively, in human hematopoietic cell lines. Specificity of the DOCK10.1 antiserum for DOCK10 was also demostrated in mouse using the DOCK10 knockout model. The DOCK10.1 protein was induced by IL-4 in CLL cells, which demonstrates that the mechanism by which IL-4 regulates DOCK10 is not isoform-specific. Last, to get insights into differential regulation of the DOCK10 isoforms, their protein levels in cell lines were compared with their gene expression profiles retrieved from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), leading to the identification of BCL3 and KLF12 as potential transcriptional regulators of DOCK10.1 and DOCK10.2, respectively.","['Parrado, Antonio']",['Parrado A'],"['Instituto Murciano de Investigacion Biosanitaria Virgen de La Arrixaca (IMIB-Arrixaca), El Palmar, 30120, Murcia, Spain. antonio.parrado@carm.es.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200229,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"['0 (DOCK10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Dock10 protein, human)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (IL4 protein, human)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exons', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/*biosynthesis/blood/*genetics/immunology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/chemistry/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcriptome']",2020/03/01 06:00,2021/02/03 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-020-05342-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-020-05342-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2020 Apr;47(4):3003-3010. doi: 10.1007/s11033-020-05342-5.

The occurrence of hyperleukocytosis with As2O3 treatment seriously affects the early survival rate of APL patients, but no definite explanation for such a complication has been clearly established. To clarify the causes of this situation, AS3MT polymorphisms 14215 (rs3740390), 14458 (rs11191439), 27215 (rs11191446), and 35991 (rs10748835) and profiles of plasma arsenic metabolites were evaluated in a group of 54 newly diagnosed APL patients treated with single-agent As2O3. High-performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HPLC-HG-AFS) was used to determine the concentrations of plasma arsenic metabolites. Plasma arsenic methylation metabolism capacity was evaluated by the percentage of inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), primary methylation index (PMI, MMA/iAs), and secondary methylation index (SMI, DMA/MMA). The results showed that APL patients who developed hyperleukocytosis had a higher plasma iAs%, but a lower MMA% and PMI than those who did not develop hyperleukocytosis during As2O3 treatment. In addition, patients with the AS3MT 14215 (rs3740390) CC genotype had significantly higher plasma iAs% and incidence of hyperleukocytosis, but lower PMI than patients with the CT + TT genotype. Conversely, we did not observe statistically significant associations between the occurrence of hyperleukocytosis and AS3MT 14458 (rs11191439), 27215 (rs11191446), and 35991 (rs10748835) polymorphisms in our study subjects.

However, the niches that maintain and regulate daily production of blood and immune cells are now increasingly being recognized as having an important role in the pathogenesis and chemoresistance of haematological malignancies. Within haematopoietic cells, the accumulation of a small number of recurrent mutations initiates malignancy. Concomitantly, specific alterations of the niches, which support haematopoietic stem cells and their progeny, can act as predisposition events, facilitating mutant haematopoietic cell survival and expansion as well as contributing to malignancy progression and providing protection of malignant cells from chemotherapy, ultimately leading to relapse. In this Perspective, we summarize our current understanding of the composition and function of the specialized haematopoietic niches of the bone marrow during health and disease. We discuss disease mechanisms (rather than malignancy subtypes) to provide a comprehensive description of key niche-associated pathways that are shared across multiple haematological malignancies. These mechanisms include primary driver mutations in bone marrow niche cells, changes associated with increased hypoxia, angiogenesis and inflammation as well as metabolic reprogramming by stromal niche cells. Consequently, remodelling of bone marrow niches can facilitate immune evasion and activation of survival pathways favouring malignant haematopoietic cell maintenance, defence against excessive reactive oxygen species and protection from chemotherapy. Lastly, we suggest guidelines for the handling and biobanking of patient samples and analysis of the niche to ensure that basic research identifying therapeutic targets can be more efficiently translated to the clinic. The hope is that integrating knowledge of how bone marrow niches contribute to haematological disease predisposition, initiation, progression and response to therapy into future clinical practice will likely improve the treatment of these disorders.","['Mendez-Ferrer, Simon', 'Bonnet, Dominique', 'Steensma, David P', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Ghobrial, Irene M', 'Gribben, John G', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Krause, Daniela S']","['Mendez-Ferrer S', 'Bonnet D', 'Steensma DP', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Ghobrial IM', 'Gribben JG', 'Andreeff M', 'Krause DS']","['Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK. sm2116@cam.ac.uk.', 'National Health Service Blood and Transplant, Cambridge, UK. sm2116@cam.ac.uk.', 'Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK. sm2116@cam.ac.uk.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, London, UK.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Center for Prevention of Progression of Blood Cancers, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Center for Prevention of Progression of Blood Cancers, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Medicine, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200228,England,Nat Rev Cancer,Nature reviews.

The identification of relevant therapeutic targets is challenging. Here, we investigated the immune functions, antileukemia efficacy and safety of CD28/4-1BB CAR T cells targeting CD123 the interleukin (IL)-3 receptor alpha chain which is overexpressed on BPDCN. We demonstrated that both retroviral and lentiviral engineering CD28/4-1BB CD123 CAR T cells exhibit effector functions against BPDCN cells through CD123 antigen recognition and that they efficiently kill BPDCN cell lines and BPDCN-derived PDX cells. In vivo, CD28/4-1BB CD123 CAR T-cell therapy displayed strong efficacy by promoting a decrease of BPDCN blast burden. Furthermore we showed that T cells from BPDCN patient transduced with CD28/4-1BB CD123 CAR successfully eliminate autologous BPDCN blasts in vitro. Finally, we demonstrated in humanized mouse models that these effector CAR T cells exert low or no cytotoxicity against various subsets of normal cells with low CD123 expression, indicating a potentially low on-target/off-tumor toxicity effect. Collectively, our data support the further evaluation for clinical assessment of CD28/4-1BB CD123 CAR T cells in BPDCN neoplasm.","['Bole-Richard, Elodie', 'Fredon, Maxime', 'Biichle, Sabeha', 'Anna, Francois', 'Certoux, Jean-Marie', 'Renosi, Florian', 'Tse, Frederic', 'Molimard, Chloe', 'Valmary-Degano, Severine', 'Jenvrin, Alizee', 'Warda, Walid', 'Pallandre, Jean-Rene', 'Bonnefoy, Francis', 'Poussard, Margaux', 'Deschamps, Marina', 'Petrella, Tony', 'Roumier, Christophe', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth', 'Feger, Frederic', 'Brissot, Eolia', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'HoWangYin, Kiave-Yune', 'Langlade-Demoyen, Pierre', 'Loustau, Maria', 'Caumartin, Julien', 'Godet, Yann', 'Binda, Delphine', 'Pagadoy, Maider', 'Deconinck, Eric', 'Daguindau, Etienne', 'Saas, Philippe', 'Ferrand, Christophe', 'Angelot-Delettre, Fanny', 'Adotevi, Olivier', 'Garnache-Ottou, Francine']","['Bole-Richard E', 'Fredon M', 'Biichle S', 'Anna F', 'Certoux JM', 'Renosi F', 'Tse F', 'Molimard C', 'Valmary-Degano S', 'Jenvrin A', 'Warda W', 'Pallandre JR', 'Bonnefoy F', 'Poussard M', 'Deschamps M', 'Petrella T', 'Roumier C', 'Macintyre E', 'Feger F', 'Brissot E', 'Mohty M', 'HoWangYin KY', 'Langlade-Demoyen P', 'Loustau M', 'Caumartin J', 'Godet Y', 'Binda D', 'Pagadoy M', 'Deconinck E', 'Daguindau E', 'Saas P', 'Ferrand C', 'Angelot-Delettre F', 'Adotevi O', 'Garnache-Ottou F']","['Univ.

There is mounting evidence that a circadian system disruption, involving clock genes and their downstream transcriptional regulators, is associated with epilepsy. In this study, we characterized the hippocampal expression of clock genes and PAR bZIP transcription factors (TFs) in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid (KA). The expression of PAR bZIP TFs was significantly altered following KA injection as well as in other rodent models of acquired epilepsy. Although the PAR bZIP TFs are regulated by proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral tissues, we discovered that the regulation of their expression is inflammation-independent in hippocampal tissue and rather mediated by clock genes and hyperexcitability. Furthermore, we report that hepatic leukemia factor (Hlf), a member of PAR bZIP TFs family, is invariably downregulated in animal models of acquired epilepsy, regulates neuronal activity in vitro and its overexpression in dentate gyrus neurons in vivo leads to altered expression of genes associated with seizures and epilepsy. Overall, our study provides further evidence of PAR bZIP TFs involvement in epileptogenesis and points to Hlf as the key player.","['Rambousek, Lukas', 'Gschwind, Tilo', 'Lafourcade, Carlos', 'Paterna, Jean-Charles', 'Dib, Linda', 'Fritschy, Jean-Marc', 'Fontana, Adriano']","['Rambousek L', 'Gschwind T', 'Lafourcade C', 'Paterna JC', 'Dib L', 'Fritschy JM', 'Fontana A']","['Institute of Experimental Immunology, Winterthurerstrasse 190, University of Zurich, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland. lukasch.rambousek@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Winterthurerstrasse 190, University of Zurich, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Neuroscience Center Zurich, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Laboratorio de Neurociencias, Universidad de los Andes, 7620157, Santiago, Chile.', 'Viral Vector Facility, Neuroscience Center Zurich, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 1015, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Winterthurerstrasse 190, University of Zurich, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Neuroscience Center Zurich, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Experimental Immunology, Winterthurerstrasse 190, University of Zurich, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200228,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hlf protein, mouse)', 'SIV03811UC (Kainic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Dentate Gyrus/*metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epilepsy/chemically induced/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Kainic Acid/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice']",2020/03/01 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-60638-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-60638-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 28;10(1):3760. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-60638-7.,,,,PMC7048777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once initiated, a series of multiple checkpoints ensure both accurate genomic replication and chromosomal separation. In the event of unsuccessful cell division, parallel pathways exist that induce the cell to undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. At the center of such stress-induced, intrinsic apoptotic regulation lies the BCL2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic regulatory proteins. In a proliferative state the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling proteins would be expected to favor an excess population of anti-apoptotic members. While the anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member, MCL1, has been identified to oversee mitotic progression, direct communication between the BCL2 family and cell proliferation has not been observed. In this study, we demonstrate a direct protein-protein interaction between MCL1 and the G1/S checkpoint protein, P18INK4C. This interaction is mediated by a reverse BH3 (rBH3) motif located in P18INK4C's C-terminal ankyrin repeat. MCL1 is further shown to decrease P18INK4C expression and thereby regulate cell cycle entry in a retinoblastoma (RB1)-dependent manner. Our findings establish a mechanism for translation independent and direct communication between the BCL2 family regulation of apoptosis and CDK4/6-RB regulation of early G1/S transition during cellular division/growth.","['Whitaker, Robert H', 'Placzek, William J']","['Whitaker RH', 'Placzek WJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA. placzek@uab.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200228,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",2020/03/01 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2351-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2351-1 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Feb 28;11(2):156. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2351-1.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9751-0423', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4096-8617']","['S10 RR022994/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM117391/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 NS048039/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7048787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, inducing durable hematological, cytogenetic and molecular responses. However, in Ph(+) B-ALL - as in CML progressing to blast crisis - TKIs fail to maintain disease remission. We, therefore, wanted to investigate if dual targeting of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL1 would be more effective in killing Ph(+) B-ALL cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: p210-B-ALL CD34-positive cells were used to evaluate the BCR-ABL expression and pharmacological targeting of BCL-2, by venetoclax, alone or in combination with BCR-ABL1 inhibition. RESULTS: We demonstrated the cytotoxic effect of BCL-2 inhibition and that dual targeting of BCL-2 and BCR-ABL1 with venetoclax and nilotinib further increases this cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: BCL-2 is a key survival factor for primary Ph(+) B-ALL cells and its inhibition - alone or in combination with a BCR-ABL1 TKI - should be further investigated as a potential therapeutic strategy for these patients.","['Massimino, Michele', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Romano, Chiara', 'DI Gregorio, Sandra', 'Romeo, Maria Anna', 'DI Raimondo, Francesco', 'Manzella, Livia']","['Massimino M', 'Tirro E', 'Stella S', 'Pennisi MS', 'Vitale SR', 'Puma A', 'Romano C', 'DI Gregorio S', 'Romeo MA', 'DI Raimondo F', 'Manzella L']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy michedot@yahoo.it.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from the US National Cancer Data Base of 25,621 patients aged 60 to 79 years, with a diagnosis of AML from 2004 to 2014, who had received single-agent versus multiagent chemotherapy. A Cox proportional hazard model was used for overall survival (OS) analysis for the entire study cohort and separately for patients who had received single-agent (n = 6743) versus multiagent (n = 6743) chemotherapy, matched for age, Charlson comorbidity index, and AML subtype. RESULTS: The use of multiagent chemotherapy was high overall (70%) but declined with factors, such as increasing age, Charlson comorbidity index, AML subtype other than good risk, academic center, lower rate of high school graduation, and more recent year of diagnosis. Patients treated with multiagent chemotherapy had greater 1-year OS (43% vs. 28%), especially for patients aged 60 to 69 years and those with good-risk AML or Charlson comorbidity index of 0 to 1. OS (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-1.36) remained more favorable for the multiagent chemotherapy group on multivariable analysis. This was confirmed in a matched cohort analysis. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest real-world study that has demonstrated an association between factors such as age, comorbidity, and AML subtype and the use of multiagent chemotherapy. The use of multiagent chemotherapy was associated with improved OS, especially for patients aged <70 years, those with good-risk AML, and those with a low Charlson comorbidity index.","['Bhatt, Vijaya R', 'Shostrom, Valerie', 'Holstein, Sarah A', 'Al-Kadhimi, Zaid S', 'Maness, Lori J', 'Berger, Ann', 'Armitage, James O', 'Gundabolu, Krishna']","['Bhatt VR', 'Shostrom V', 'Holstein SA', 'Al-Kadhimi ZS', 'Maness LJ', 'Berger A', 'Armitage JO', 'Gundabolu K']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.

This association has shifted to be related to flooding events and outdoor activities; few cases are related to high-risk factors found in immunosuppressed patients. Scarcely a handful of cases have serological evidence of immune response against Leptospira serovar Bratislava representing serogroup Australis, a serovar associated with poor reproductive performance in swine and horses, and recently with cats. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein, we describe a rare clinical presentation of disseminated Leptospira infection in an immunosuppressed 65-year-old woman. She was admitted to the emergency room with fever, bacteraemia, bilateral uveitis and pulmonary involvement. The patient denied outdoor activities; she only had wide exposure to faeces and urine from cats living in her home. Her medical history included idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) diagnosed at the age of 18. She did not respond to medical treatment, and a splenectomy was performed. At age 60, she was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), and was treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) -Imatinib. The patient voluntarily discontinued the treatment for the last 6 months. After extensive workup, no microorganisms were identified by the commonly used stains in microbiology. The diagnosis was performed through dark-field microscopy, microagglutination test (MAT), Leptospira genus-specific PCR, the IS1500 PCR for identification of pathogenic species, and 16S based sequencing for the genus identification. CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressed patients may acquire uncommon infections from ubiquitous microorganisms. In this case, serology evidence of exposure to Leptospira serovar Bratislava by MAT and the presence of the Leptospira genus were identified. It should be on mind for the diagnosis in otherwise healthy patients, and thoroughly search on splenectomised patients exposed to animals. Additionally, this report highlights the usefulness of PCR for diagnosis of this potentially life-threatening illness.","['Garcia-Mendez, J', 'Cervera-Ceballos, E', 'Atilano-Lopez, D', 'Arroyo-Escalante, S', 'Moncada-Barron, D', 'Leyva-Leyva, M', 'Hernandez-Castro, R', 'Carrillo-Casas, E M']","['Garcia-Mendez J', 'Cervera-Ceballos E', 'Atilano-Lopez D', 'Arroyo-Escalante S', 'Moncada-Barron D', 'Leyva-Leyva M', 'Hernandez-Castro R', 'Carrillo-Casas EM']","['Direccion de Docencia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia y Parasitologia, Facultad de Medicina, UNAM, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Direccion de Docencia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Diagnostico-Bacteriologia, Seccion Leptospira, Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Division de Laboratorio Clinico, Hospital General ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Division de Laboratorio Clinico, Hospital General ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular e Histocompatibilidad, Direccion de investigacion, Hospital General ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Ecologia de Agentes Patogenos, Direccion de investigacion, Hospital General ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular e Histocompatibilidad, Direccion de investigacion, Hospital General ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"", Mexico City, Mexico. ekarri@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200228,England,BMC Infect Dis,BMC infectious diseases,100968551,"['0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Bacteremia/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'DNA, Bacterial/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leptospira/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Leptospirosis/*diagnosis/microbiology', 'Pneumonia, Mycoplasma/diagnosis', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/diagnosis', 'Splenectomy', 'Thorax/diagnostic imaging', 'Uveitis/diagnosis']",2020/03/01 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2017/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12879-020-4869-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12879-020-4869-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Infect Dis. 2020 Feb 28;20(1):186. doi: 10.1186/s12879-020-4869-3.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6013-8357'],,,PMC7048021,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura', 'Immunosuppression', 'Leptospira', 'Leptospirosis', 'Serovar Bratislava', 'Splenectomy', ""Weil's disease""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mammalian nuclear protein ataxia-telangiectasia (NPAT) gene, encoded by the responsible gene for ataxia telangiectasia, is a functional Mxc orthologue. However, their roles in tumorigenesis are unclear. Genetic analyses of the mxc mutants and larvae having LG-specific depletion revealed that a reduced activity of the gene resulted in the hyperplasia, which is caused by hyper-proliferation of immature LG cells. The depletion of mxc in mature hemocytes of the LG resulted in the hyperplasia. Furthermore, the inhibition of HLB formation was required for LG hyperplasia. In the mutant larvae, the total mRNA levels of the five canonical histones decreased, and abnormal forms of polyadenylated histone mRNAs, detected rarely in normal larvae, were generated. The ectopic expression of the polyadenylated mRNAs was sufficient for the reproduction of the hyperplasia. The loss of HLB function, especially 3-end processing of histone mRNAs, is critical for malignant LG hyperplasia in this leukemia model in Drosophila. We propose that mxc is involved in the activation to induce adenosine deaminase-related growth factor A (Adgf-A), which suppresses immature cell proliferation in LG.","['Kurihara, Masanori', 'Komatsu, Kouyou', 'Awane, Rie', 'Inoue, Yoshihiro H']","['Kurihara M', 'Komatsu K', 'Awane R', 'Inoue YH']","['Department of Insect Biomedical Research, Center for Advanced Insect Research Promotion, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Matsugasaki, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-0962, Japan.', 'Department of Insect Biomedical Research, Center for Advanced Insect Research Promotion, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Matsugasaki, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-0962, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200226,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Mxc protein, Drosophila)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (adenosine deaminase-related growth factor, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drosophila/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Hemocytes/*metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hyperplasia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Larva/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",2020/03/01 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21051586 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21051586 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Feb 26;21(5). pii: ijms21051586. doi: 10.3390/ijms21051586.,,,,PMC7084650,,['NOTNLM'],"['Adgf-A', 'Drosophila', 'STAT', 'hemocytes', 'lymph gland', 'tumorigenesis']",,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation R132H, which changes the functionality of an enzyme to produce mutagenic 2-hydroxyglutarate instead of a normal product, is particularly important in this field. A series of inhibitors were described for these enzymes of which ivosidenib was the first to be approved for treating leukemia and bile duct cancers in 2018. Here, we investigated the polypharmacological landscape of the activity for known sulfamoyl derivatives that are inhibitors, which are selective towards IDH1 R132H. These compounds appeared to be effective inhibitors of several non-receptor kinases at a similar level as imatinib and axitinib. The antiproliferative activity of these compounds against a panel of cancer cells was tested and is explained based on the relative expression levels of the investigated proteins. The multitargeted activity of these compounds makes them valuable agents against a wide range of cancers, regardless of the status of IDH1.","['Malarz, Katarzyna', 'Mularski, Jacek', 'Pacholczyk, Marcin', 'Musiol, Robert']","['Malarz K', 'Mularski J', 'Pacholczyk M', 'Musiol R']","['August Chelkowski Institute of Physics and Silesian Center for Education and Interdisciplinary Research, University of Silesia in Katowice, 75 Pulku Piechoty 1, 41-500 Chorzow, Poland.', 'Institute of Chemistry, University of Silesia in Katowice, 75 Pulku Piechoty 1A, 41-500 Chorzow, Poland.', 'Silesian University of Technology, Department of Systems Biology and Engineering, Akademicka 16, 44-100 Gliwice, Poland.', 'Institute of Chemistry, University of Silesia in Katowice, 75 Pulku Piechoty 1A, 41-500 Chorzow, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200226,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/03/01 06:00,2020/03/01 06:01,['2020/03/01 06:00'],"['2020/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12030536 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12030536 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Feb 26;12(3). pii: cancers12030536. doi: 10.3390/cancers12030536.,,"['2016/23/N/NZ7/00351/Narodowe Centrum Nauki', '2018/31/B/NZ7/02122/Narodowe Centrum Nauki']",,PMC7139656,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL kinase, leukemia', 'IDH1 inhibitor', 'anticancer activity', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'tyrosine kinase']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viral infection of macaques can compromise animal health as well as the results of biomedical research, and infected animals constitute an occupational health risk. Therefore, monitoring macaque colonies for viral infection is an important task. We used a commercial chip-based assay to analyze sera of 231 macaques for the presence of antibody responses against nine animal and human viruses. We report high seroprevalence of cytomegalovirus (CMV), lymphocryptovirus (LCV), rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV) and simian foamy virus (SFV) antibodies in all age groups. In contrast, antibodies against simian retrovirus type D (SRV/D) and simian T cell leukemia virus (STLV) were detected only in 5% and 10% of animals, respectively, and were only found in adult or aged animals. Moreover, none of the animals had antibodies against herpes B virus (BV), in keeping with the results of in-house tests previously used for screening. Finally, an increased seroprevalence of measles virus antibodies in animals with extensive exposure to multiple humans for extended periods of time was observed. However, most of these animals were obtained from external sources, and a lack of information on the measles antibody status of the animals at the time of arrival precluded drawing reliable conclusions from the data. In sum, we show, that in the colony studied, CMV, LCV, RRV and SFV infection was ubiquitous and likely acquired early in life while SRV/D and STLV infection was rare and likely acquired during adulthood.","['Kaul, Artur', 'Schonmann, Uwe', 'Pohlmann, Stefan']","['Kaul A', 'Schonmann U', 'Pohlmann S']","['Infection Biology Unit, German Primate Center - Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, 37077 Gottingen, Germany.', 'Laboratory Animal Sciences Unit, German Primate Center, 37077 Gottingen, Germany.', 'Infection Biology Unit, German Primate Center - Leibniz Institute for Primate Research, 37077 Gottingen, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology and Psychology, University of Gottingen, 37073 Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190326,Germany,Primate Biol,Primate biology,101730502,,,,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/29 06:01,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2018/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5194/pb-6-1-2019 [doi]', '01021829 [pii]']",epublish,Primate Biol. 2019 Mar 26;6(1):1-6. doi: 10.5194/pb-6-1-2019. eCollection 2019.,,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Artur Kaul et al.'],PMC7041514,,,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients and Methods: A total of 479 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with frontline imatinib between January 2010 and December 2017 were enrolled in this retrospective study. The ELTS score was evaluated on the end-points including complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and CML-related death, and the efficiency of the ELTS score was further compared with the historical Sokal, Hasford, EUTOS scores. Results: With a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 9-112 months), 462 evaluable patients were stratified into the ELTS low-risk (n = 230), ELTS intermediate-risk (n = 168) and ELTS high-risk (n = 64) groups. For the regular assessment indicators like CCyR, PFS and OS, the ELTS scoring system could effectively identify the corresponding risk groups, similarly with the results provided by previous scoring systems. With respect to the CML-related death, the ELTS score could accurately identify a high-risk group with a significantly higher risk of dying of CML, and the 5-year cumulative incidence occurred in the ELTS high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups was 11% (95% CI: 3-19%), 5% (95% CI: 1-9%) and 2% (95% CI: 0-4%), respectively. Most notably, the ELTS score outperformed the Sokal, Hasford and EUTOS scores without statistical difference among different risk groups. Conclusion: The ELTS score could effectively predict the prognosis of imatinib-treated CML patients in real-life settings.","['Yang, Xiawan', 'Bai, Yanliang', 'Shi, Mingyue', 'Zhang, Wanjun', 'Niu, Junwei', 'Wu, Chengye', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Xu, Zhiwei', 'Liu, Xiang', 'Chen, Yuqing', 'Sun, Kai']","['Yang X', 'Bai Y', 'Shi M', 'Zhang W', 'Niu J', 'Wu C', 'Zhang L', 'Xu Z', 'Liu X', 'Chen Y', 'Sun K']","[""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Research Service Center, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Geriatric Medicine, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital and Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Henan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200220,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/29 06:01,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S237467 [doi]', '237467 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Feb 20;12:1293-1301. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S237467. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2183-2741', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7896-0912']",,['(c) 2020 Yang et al.'],PMC7039071,,['NOTNLM'],"['EUTOS', 'EUTOS long-term survival score', 'Hasford', 'Sokal', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivation of FBXW7 gene is frequently observed in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, suggesting a significant tumor-suppressive role for FBXW7 in the pathobiology of this leukemia. Considering the role of microRNAs in cell proliferation and regulation of apoptosis, the aim of this study was to identify novel oncogenic microRNAs that suppress FBXW7 in patients with T-ALL. Patients and Methods: The expression levels of two bioinformatically predicted microRNAs - miR-32 and miR-107 were compared in patients with T-ALL and a control group. A total of 80 plasma samples were subjected to RNA extraction, and the microRNA expression profiles were assessed by the RT-qPCR. The expression level of miR-103 was used as the endogenous reference for normalization of quantitative data. Results: The plasma levels of miR-32 and miR-107 in patients with T-ALL were significantly higher (5.65, P < 0.001) and lower (0.432, P = 0.002), respectively. On the other hand, the expression levels of FBXW7 gene were significantly downregulated by -76.9 fold in T-ALL patients (P < 0.001). The results of the ROC curve analysis indicated that overexpression of miR-32 might be used to distinguish T-ALL patients with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: miR-32 is considered as a novel oncomir that targets FBXW7 and might have a role in the etiology or progression of T-ALL. Furthermore, miR-32 can potentially serve as a non-invasive biomarker for detection of T-ALL.","['Mansouri, Sanaz', 'Khansarinejad, Behzad', 'Mosayebi, Ghasem', 'Eghbali, Aziz', 'Mondanizadeh, Mahdieh']","['Mansouri S', 'Khansarinejad B', 'Mosayebi G', 'Eghbali A', 'Mondanizadeh M']","['Department of Biotechnology and Molecular Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Molecular Medicine, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.', 'Molecular and Medicine Research Center, Arak University of Medical Sciences, Arak, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200218,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/29 06:01,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S238470 [doi]', '238470 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Feb 18;12:1253-1259. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S238470. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6221-8847'],,['(c) 2020 Mansouri et al.'],PMC7035948,,['NOTNLM'],"['FBXW7', 'T-ALL', 'biomarker', 'microRNA']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flt3 is activated by the Flt3 ligand, the monomeric form of which is a polypeptide of about 200 amino acid residues. Both membrane-associated and soluble Flt3 ligands, which are a product of the same gene, function as noncovalent dimers. FLT3 mutations occur in about one-third of newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients. This disease is a malignancy of hematopoietic progenitor cells with a variable clinical course; the incidence of this disorder is more than twice that of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemias (20,000 vs. 8500 new patients per year, respectively, in the United States). FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) results from the head-to-tail duplication of from one to more than 100 amino acids within the juxtamembrane domain and such duplication occurs in about 20-25 % of patients with acute myelogenous leukemias. FLT3 tyrosine kinase (FLT3 TK) mutations, usually within the activation segment, occur in 5-10 % of these patients. The mainstay for the care of acute myelogenous leukemias include daunorubicin or idarubicin and cytarabine. Older patients who are not candidates for such traditional therapy are usually given 5-azacitidine, decitabine, or clofarabine. The addition of orally effective small molecule Flt3 inhibitors to these therapies may prolong event-free and overall survival, a subject of ongoing clinical studies. Midostaurin is US FDA-approved in combination with standard cytarabine and daunorubicin for first-line induction chemotherapy and in combination with cytarabine for second-line consolidation chemotherapy in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemias with FLT3-postive mutations. Moreover, gilteritinib is a Flt3 multikinase inhibitor that is also FDA approved for the care of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemias with FLT3 mutations. Quizartinib is a Flt3 multikinase inhibitor that was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory Flt3-positive acute myelogenous leukemias. Gilteritinib and quizartinib bind to Flt3 with the inactive DFG-Dout structure and are classified as type II inhibitors. Furthermore, ponatinib is a multikinase inhibitor that is approved as therapy for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic and chronic myelogenous leukemias; it is used off label for the treatment of patients with acute myelogenous leukemias. Moreover, sorafenib is FDA-approved for the treatment of hepatocellular, renal cell, and differentiated thyroid cancers and it is used off label as maintenance therapy following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemias. Other drugs that are in clinical trials for the treatment of this disorder include sunitinib, crenolanib, FF10101, and lestaurtinib. Unlike chronic myelogenous leukemias, which result solely from the formation of the BCR-Abl chimeric protein kinase, acute myelogenous leukemias result from multi-factorial causes and are prone to be resistant to both cytotoxic and targeted therapies. Consequently, there is a pressing need for better understanding the etiologies of acute myelogenous leukemias and for the development of more effective therapies.","['Roskoski, Robert Jr']",['Roskoski R Jr'],"['Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, 3754 Brevard Road, Suite 116, Box 19, Horse Shoe, NC, 28742-8814, United States.

Herein, we investigated the anticancer potential of a new synthetic compound, 2-ethyl-3-methyliden-1-tosyl-2,3-dihydroquinolin-4-(1H)-one (AJ-374) against myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell line. This analog was selected from the small library of synthetic dihydroquinolinones on the basis of its strong antiproliferative activity against HL-60 cells and 30-fold lower cytotoxicity towards healthy HUVEC cells. AJ-374 promoted the arrest of the cells in the subG0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in the first 24 h. Treatment of HL-60 cells with AJ-374 caused an increase in annexin-V positive cells, activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3, dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and enhancement of FAS protein level. Apoptosis induction triggered by this quinolinone was blocked by the pre-treatment of the cells with caspase-8, -9 and -3 inhibitors. The obtained results indicated that AJ-374-induced apoptosis was executed by both, the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The cytotoxic activity of AJ-374 was also associated with down-regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and was independent of reactive oxygen species generation. Taken together, these results suggest that AJ-374 exerts a potent anticancer effect on leukemia cells, with a wide safety margin, which makes this analog an attractive drug candidate for further testing.","['Drogosz-Stachowicz, Joanna', 'Dlugosz-Pokorska, Angelika', 'Gach-Janczak, Katarzyna', 'Jaskulska, Agata', 'Janecki, Tomasz', 'Janecka, Anna']","['Drogosz-Stachowicz J', 'Dlugosz-Pokorska A', 'Gach-Janczak K', 'Jaskulska A', 'Janecki T', 'Janecka A']","['Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, 90-924, Lodz, Poland.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry, Lodz University of Technology, 90-924, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, 92-215, Lodz, Poland.

High complete remission (CR) rates often include minimal residual disease (MRD), leading to relapse and repeated treatments. Rituximab can clear MRD, but long-term results are unknown and optimal timing of rituximab undefined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to first-line cladribine 0.15 mg/kg intravenously days 1-5 with 8 weekly doses of rituximab 375 mg/m(2) begun either day 1 (concurrent, CDAR) or >/= 6 months later (delayed) after detection of MRD in blood. MRD tests included blood and bone marrow (BM) flow cytometry, and BM immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients with purine analog-naive classic HCL were randomly assigned 1:1 to concurrent versus delayed arms. At 6 months after CDAR versus cladribine monotherapy, CR rates were 100% versus 88% (P = .11), MRD-free CR rates 97% versus 24% (P < .0001, primary end point), and blood MRD-free rates 100% versus 50% (P < .0001), respectively. At 96 months median follow-up, 94% versus 12% remained MRD free. Compared with CDAR, delayed rituximab after cladribine achieved lower rate (67% of 21 evaluable patients; P = .0034) and durability (P = .0081, hazard radio favoring CDAR, 0.094) of MRD-free CR. Nevertheless, 12 patients in the delayed arm remained MRD free when restaged 6-104 (median, 78) months after last delayed rituximab treatment. Compared with cladribine monotherapy, CDAR led to brief grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (59% v 9%; P < .0001) and platelet transfusions without bleeding (35% v 0%; P = .0002), but higher neutrophil (P = .017) and platelet (P = .0015) counts at 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Achieving MRD-free CR of HCL after first-line cladribine is greatly enhanced by concurrent rituximab and less so by delayed rituximab. Longer follow-up will determine if MRD-free survival leads to less need for additional therapy or cure of HCL.","['Chihara, Dai', 'Arons, Evgeny', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Wang, Hao-Wei', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Xi, Liqiang', 'Steinberg, Seth M', 'Feurtado, Julie', 'James, Lacey', 'Wilson, Wyndham', 'Braylan, Raul C', 'Calvo, Katherine R', 'Maric, Irina', 'Dulau-Florea, Alina', 'Kreitman, Robert J']","['Chihara D', 'Arons E', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Yuan CM', 'Wang HW', 'Zhou H', 'Raffeld M', 'Xi L', 'Steinberg SM', 'Feurtado J', 'James L', 'Wilson W', 'Braylan RC', 'Calvo KR', 'Maric I', 'Dulau-Florea A', 'Kreitman RJ']","['Medical Oncology Service, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Biostatistics and Data Management Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Office of Research Nursing, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Medical Oncology Service, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200228,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rituximab/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2020/02/29 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.02250 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 May 10;38(14):1527-1538. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.02250.

MRD monitoring is done by multiparameter flow cytometry, IG/TCR quantitative PCR or reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR of leukemic fusion transcripts providing a reliable measurement of treatment response. However, occasionally bone marrow (BM) aspirates may not yield representative material or be misinterpreted due to treatment-induced changes in MRD marker profile, undetected subclones at diagnosis, contamination with peripheral blood or cell adhesion and stroma cell interactions posing a risk for underestimating MRD levels and misclassifying resistant disease that may be detected by traditional BM morphology methods, immunohistochemistry, karyotyping and FISH. We present four cases with high MRD levels where MRD monitoring failed to provide the correct stratification information. Through these cases, we discuss the continued need to consider all available information including BM smears, touch imprints and trephine biopsy preparations not only at diagnosis but throughout remission monitoring in pediatric ALL.","['Rathe, Mathias', 'Preiss, Birgitte', 'Marquart, Hanne Vibeke', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Wehner, Peder Skov']","['Rathe M', 'Preiss B', 'Marquart HV', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Wehner PS']","[""Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark."", 'Department of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Research Unit of Pathology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Hans Christian Andersen Children's Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200325,Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Remission Induction']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/apm.13037 [doi]'],ppublish,APMIS. 2020 May;128(5):414-419. doi: 10.1111/apm.13037.

The miR146a rs2910164 polymorphism, which is closely responsive for its expression, has been reported to associate with the risk of several solid cancers. The study aimed at examining the association of the it with susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 266 patients with childhood ALL and 266 healthy controls, and rs2910164 genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. RESULTS: The allele G was associated with decreased childhood ALL risk (OR=0.66, 95%CI=0.52-0.85, p=0.0011). Consistently, the GG genotype was associated with a decreased susceptibility (OR=0.40, 95%CI=0.23-0.67, p=0.0004). Patients with CG and GG genotypes were of earlier onset than those with CC genotype (p=0.0255 and p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: MiR146a rs2910164 G allele serves as a protective marker for childhood ALL in Taiwan.","['Pei, Jen-Sheng', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Hsu, Pei-Chen', 'Chen, Chao-Chun', 'Chin, Yu-Ting', 'Huang, Tai-Lin', 'Hsu, Yuan-Nian', 'Kuo, Chien-Chung', 'Wang, Yun-Chi', 'Tsai, Chia-Wen', 'Gong, Chi-Li', 'Bau, DA-Tian']","['Pei JS', 'Chang WS', 'Hsu PC', 'Chen CC', 'Chin YT', 'Huang TL', 'Hsu YN', 'Kuo CC', 'Wang YC', 'Tsai CW', 'Gong CL', 'Bau DT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Pediatric Orthopedics, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Department of Physiology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. datian@mail.cmuh.org.tw artbau2@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Medical Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,"['0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Taiwan']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/09/26 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['17/2/175 [pii]', '10.21873/cgp.20178 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2020 Mar-Apr;17(2):175-180. doi: 10.21873/cgp.20178.,,,"['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",PMC7078834,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Taiwan', 'case-control study', 'genotype', 'miR146a', 'polymorphism']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the association of genetically predicted lipid traits with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. METHODS: Genome-wide association study data from the InterLymph Consortium were available for 2,661 DLBCLs, 2,179 CLLs, 2,142 FLs, 824 MZLs, and 6,221 controls. SNPs associated (P < 5 x 10(-8)) with high-density lipoprotein (HDL, n = 164), low-density lipoprotein (LDL, n = 137), total cholesterol (TC, n = 161), and triglycerides (TG, n = 123) were used as instrumental variables (IV), explaining 14.6%, 27.7%, 16.8%, and 12.8% of phenotypic variation, respectively. Associations between each lipid trait and NHL subtype were calculated using the MR inverse variance-weighted method, estimating odds ratios (OR) per standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: HDL was positively associated with DLBCL (OR = 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30) and MZL (OR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.18), while TG was inversely associated with MZL risk (OR = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83-0.99), all at nominal significance (P < 0.05). A positive trend was observed for HDL with FL risk (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 0.99-1.19; P = 0.087). No associations were noteworthy after adjusting for multiple testing. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence of a clear or strong association of these lipid traits with the most common NHL subtypes. While these IVs have been previously linked to other cancers, our findings do not support any causal associations with these NHL subtypes. IMPACT: Our results suggest that prior reported inverse associations of lipid traits are not likely to be causal and could represent reverse causality or confounding.","['Kleinstern, Geffen', 'Camp, Nicola J', 'Berndt, Sonja I', 'Birmann, Brenda M', 'Nieters, Alexandra', 'Bracci, Paige M', 'McKay, James D', 'Ghesquieres, Herve', 'Lan, Qing', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Zhang, Yawei', 'Purdue, Mark P', 'Zeleniuch-Jacquotte, Anne', 'Giles, Graham G', 'Vermeulen, Roel', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Albanes, Demetrius', 'Teras, Lauren R', 'Brooks-Wilson, Angela R', 'Vajdic, Claire M', 'Kane, Eleanor', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'Salles, Gilles', 'Vijai, Joseph', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Skibola, Christine F', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Cerhan, James R']","['Kleinstern G', 'Camp NJ', 'Berndt SI', 'Birmann BM', 'Nieters A', 'Bracci PM', 'McKay JD', 'Ghesquieres H', 'Lan Q', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Benavente Y', 'Monnereau A', 'Wang SS', 'Zhang Y', 'Purdue MP', 'Zeleniuch-Jacquotte A', 'Giles GG', 'Vermeulen R', 'Cocco P', 'Albanes D', 'Teras LR', 'Brooks-Wilson AR', 'Vajdic CM', 'Kane E', 'Caporaso NE', 'Smedby KE', 'Salles G', 'Vijai J', 'Chanock SJ', 'Skibola CF', 'Rothman N', 'Slager SL', 'Cerhan JR']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Huntsman Cancer Institute and University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', ""Channing Division of Network Medicine, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Institute for Immunodeficiency, Medical Center -

The prior standard of care, chemoimmunotherapy, is being replaced by targeted agents, and the utility of chemotherapy has come under question. In this review, we examine recent data comparing chemoimmunotherapy to targeted agents, how these data impact clinical management, and whether there are potential future roles for cytotoxic chemotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical trials have shown improved clinical outcomes with targeted agents compared to traditional chemoimmunotherapy. Based on these data, the current treatment paradigm primarily favors targeted agents over chemoimmunotherapy, with a few exceptions. However, targeted agents have notable limitations, and thus, there may be a future role of cytotoxic chemotherapy when administered in combination with targeted agents. Although targeted agents have nearly replaced chemoimmunotherapy in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, novel combinations utilizing chemotherapy are being developed that may lead to better outcomes.","['Lee, Jason C', 'Lamanna, Nicole']","['Lee JC', 'Lamanna N']","['Columbia University Medical Center, NY, USA.', 'Columbia University Medical Center, NY, USA. nl2129@cumc.columbia.edu.', 'Associate Attending, Leukemia Service, Director of the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Program, Hematologic Malignancies Section, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, NY, USA. nl2129@cumc.columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00563-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00563-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Apr;15(2):72-82. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00563-8.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chemoimmunotherapy', '*Chemotherapy', '*Cytotoxic agent', '*Ibrutinib', '*Targeted agent', '*Venetoclax']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 38 (18%) patients harbored the T315I mutation in this period. According to the type of salvage therapy, patients were divided into subgroups of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients (n = 9) and HSCT nonrecipients (n = 29). In the latter subgroup, there were 7 patients who newly acquired the T315I mutation after HSCT, and the median time was 10.8 months. In addition to these 7 cases, 5 out of 22 patients were managed with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and ponatinib. There were 4 patients in the HSCT recipient subgroup who were treated with CAR-T cells or ponatinib before HSCT. The complete molecular remission (CMR) and recurrence rate of HSCT recipients were both 67%, and the median recurrence time was 3.6 months. A better overall survival (OS) was observed in the HSCT recipient subgroup than in the HSCT nonrecipient subgroup (median of 12.3 months vs 3.3 months, respectively; p = 0.004). Compared with patients who were not bridging to HSCT, the patients who were treated with CAR-T cells and/or ponatinib and bridged to HSCT tended to have a better OS (median of 3.3 months vs 13.3, respectively; p = 0.09). In conclusion, the outcomes in ALL patients with the T315I BCR-ABL1 mutation were poor. A better OS can be achieved through ponatinib, CAR-T cells, and bridging to HSCT, but it also has a higher risk of recurrence.","['Ting, Shi', 'Mixue, Xie', 'Lixia, Zhu', 'Xueying, Li', 'Wanzhuo, Xie', 'Xiujin, Ye']","['Ting S', 'Mixue X', 'Lixia Z', 'Xueying L', 'Wanzhuo X', 'Xiujin Y']","['Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Program in Clinical Medicine, School of Medicine of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Senior Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. yxjsunny@zju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200227,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', '*Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyridazines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03949-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03949-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):829-834. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03949-z.

To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed a retrospective database of 520 PV patients seen at 10 academic institutions across the United States. Taking hematologic laboratory data at approximately 3-month intervals (or as available) for all patients for duration of follow-up, we used group-based trajectory modeling to identify latent clusters of patients who follow distinct trajectories with regard to their leukocyte, hematocrit, and platelet counts over time. We then tested the association between trajectory membership and hazard of 2 major outcomes: thrombosis and disease evolution to myelofibrosis, myelodysplastic syndrome, or acute myeloid leukemia. Controlling for relevant covariates, we found that persistently elevated leukocyte trajectories were not associated with the hazard of a thrombotic event (P = .4163), but were significantly associated with increased hazard of disease evolution in an ascending stepwise manner (overall P = .0002). In addition, we found that neither hematocrit nor platelet count was significantly associated with the hazard of thrombosis or disease evolution.","['Ronner, Lukas', 'Podoltsev, Nikolai', 'Gotlib, Jason', 'Heaney, Mark L', 'Kuykendall, Andrew T', ""O'Connell, Casey"", 'Shammo, Jamile', 'Fleischman, Angela G', 'Scherber, Robyn M', 'Mesa, Ruben', 'Yacoub, Abdulraheem', 'Perkins, Cecelia', 'Meckstroth, Shelby', 'Behlman, Lindsey', 'Chiaramonte, Matthew', 'Salehi, Mahta', 'Ziadkhanpour, Kimia', 'Nguyen, Hellen', 'Siwoski, Olivia', 'Hung, Annie Kwok', 'Janania Martinez, Michelle', 'Nguyen, Jenny', 'Patel, Sagar', 'Kollipara, Revathi', 'Dave, Ami', 'Randall, Megan', 'Grant, Michael', 'Harrison, Mitchell', 'Fernandez Soto, Paola', 'Tremblay, Douglas', 'Hoffman, Ronald', 'Moshier, Erin', 'Mascarenhas, John']","['Ronner L', 'Podoltsev N', 'Gotlib J', 'Heaney ML', 'Kuykendall AT', ""O'Connell C"", 'Shammo J', 'Fleischman AG', 'Scherber RM', 'Mesa R', 'Yacoub A', 'Perkins C', 'Meckstroth S', 'Behlman L', 'Chiaramonte M', 'Salehi M', 'Ziadkhanpour K', 'Nguyen H', 'Siwoski O', 'Hung AK', 'Janania Martinez M', 'Nguyen J', 'Patel S', 'Kollipara R', 'Dave A', 'Randall M', 'Grant M', 'Harrison M', 'Fernandez Soto P', 'Tremblay D', 'Hoffman R', 'Moshier E', 'Mascarenhas J']","['Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'H.

Amplitude and duration of the Notch response is controlled by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1), a hallmark of the leukemogenic process. Here, we show that HDAC3 controls NICD1 acetylation levels directly affecting NICD1 protein stability. Either genetic loss-of-function of HDAC3 or nanomolar concentrations of HDAC inhibitor apicidin lead to downregulation of Notch target genes accompanied by a local reduction of histone acetylation. Importantly, an HDAC3-insensitive NICD1 mutant is more stable but biologically less active. Collectively, these data show a new HDAC3- and acetylation-dependent mechanism that may be exploited to treat Notch1-dependent leukemias.","['Ferrante, Francesca', 'Giaimo, Benedetto Daniele', 'Bartkuhn, Marek', 'Zimmermann, Tobias', 'Close, Viola', 'Mertens, Daniel', 'Nist, Andrea', 'Stiewe, Thorsten', 'Meier-Soelch, Johanna', 'Kracht, Michael', 'Just, Steffen', 'Kloble, Patricia', 'Oswald, Franz', 'Borggrefe, Tilman']","['Ferrante F', 'Giaimo BD', 'Bartkuhn M', 'Zimmermann T', 'Close V', 'Mertens D', 'Nist A', 'Stiewe T', 'Meier-Soelch J', 'Kracht M', 'Just S', 'Kloble P', 'Oswald F', 'Borggrefe T']","['Institute of Biochemistry, University of Giessen, Friedrichstrasse 24, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Giessen, Friedrichstrasse 24, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute for Genetics, University of Giessen, Heinrich-Buff-Ring 58-62, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University of Giessen, Heinrich-Buff-Ring 58-62, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis\'\' (B061), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis\'\' (B061), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg Germany.', 'Genomics Core Facility, Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Hans-Meerwein-Str. 3, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Genomics Core Facility, Institute of Molecular Oncology, Philipps-University, Hans-Meerwein-Str. 3, 35043 Marburg, Germany.', 'Rudolf Buchheim Institute of Pharmacology, University of Giessen, Schubertstrasse 81, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'Rudolf Buchheim Institute of Pharmacology, University of Giessen, Schubertstrasse 81, 35392 Giessen, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Molecular Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine II, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Giessen, Friedrichstrasse 24, 35392 Giessen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (apicidin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Protein Stability', 'Receptor, Notch1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['5763097 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkaa088 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Apr 17;48(7):3496-3512. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa088.,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Mutations activating the MAPK pathway are found in more than 80% of patients with ECD, mainly the BRAFV600E activating mutation in 57% to 70% of cases, followed by MAP2K1 in close to 20%. The discovery of BRAF mutations and of other MAP kinase pathway alterations, as well as the co-occurrence of ECD with LCH in 15% of patients with ECD, led to the 2016 revision of the classification of histiocytoses in which LCH and ECD belong to the ""L"" group. Both conditions are considered inflammatory myeloid neoplasms. Ten percent of ECD cases are associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms and/or myelodysplastic syndromes. Some of the most striking signs of ECD are the long bone involvement (80%-95%), as well as the hairy kidney appearance on computed tomography scan (63%), the coated aorta (40%), and the right atrium pseudo-tumoral infiltration (36%). Central nervous system involvement is a strong prognostic factor and independent predictor of death. Interferon-alpha seems to be the best initial treatment of ECD. Since 2012, more than 200 patients worldwide with multisystem or refractory ECD have benefitted from highly effective therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Targeted therapies have an overall, robust, and reproducible efficacy in ECD, with no acquired resistance to date, but their use may be best reserved for the most severe manifestations of the disease, as they may be associated with serious adverse effects and as-yet-unknown long-term consequences.","['Haroche, Julien', 'Cohen-Aubart, Fleur', 'Amoura, Zahir']","['Haroche J', 'Cohen-Aubart F', 'Amoura Z']","['Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Medecine Interne 2, Maladies Auto-Imunes et Systemiques, Centre National de Reference des Histiocytoses, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Medecine Interne 2, Maladies Auto-Imunes et Systemiques, Centre National de Reference des Histiocytoses, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Service de Medecine Interne 2, Maladies Auto-Imunes et Systemiques, Centre National de Reference des Histiocytoses, Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Erdheim-Chester Disease/*complications/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/10/29 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62094-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002766 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Apr 16;135(16):1311-1318. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002766.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although JAK2V617F and CALR allele burden are the main transformation risk factors, inflammation plays a critical role by driving clonal expansion toward end-stage disease. NF-kappaB is a key mediator of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. Here, we explored the involvement of miR-146a, a brake in NF-kappaB signaling, in MPN susceptibility and progression. rs2910164 and rs2431697, that affect miR-146a expression, were analyzed in 967 MPN (320 PV/333 ET/314 MF) patients and 600 controls. We found that rs2431697 TT genotype was associated with MF, particularly with post-PV/ET MF (HR = 1.5; p < 0.05). Among 232 PV/ET patients (follow-up time=8.5 years), 18 (7.8%) progressed to MF, being MF-free-survival shorter for rs2431697 TT than CC + CT patients (p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified TT genotype as independent predictor of MF progression. In addition, TT (vs. CC + CT) patients showed increased plasma inflammatory cytokines. Finally, miR-146a(-/-) mice showed significantly higher Stat3 activity with aging, parallel to the development of the MF-like phenotype. In conclusion, we demonstrated that rs2431697 TT genotype is an early predictor of MF progression independent of the JAK2V617F allele burden. Low levels of miR-146a contribute to the MF phenotype by increasing Stat3 signaling.","['Ferrer-Marin, F', 'Arroyo, A B', 'Bellosillo, B', 'Cuenca, E J', 'Zamora, L', 'Hernandez-Rivas, J M', 'Hernandez-Boluda, J C', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez, C', 'Luno, E', 'Garcia Hernandez, C', 'Kerguelen, A', 'Fiallo-Suarez, D V', 'Gomez-Casares, M T', 'Ayala, R', 'Velez, P', 'Boque, C', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, V', 'Arrizabalaga, B', 'Estrada, N', 'Cifuentes, R', 'Arcas, I', 'de Los Reyes-Garcia, A M', 'Besses, C', 'Vicente, V', 'Alvarez-Larran, A', 'Teruel-Montoya, R', 'Gonzalez-Conejero, R', 'Martinez, C']","['Ferrer-Marin F', 'Arroyo AB', 'Bellosillo B', 'Cuenca EJ', 'Zamora L', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Fernandez-Rodriguez C', 'Luno E', 'Garcia Hernandez C', 'Kerguelen A', 'Fiallo-Suarez DV', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Ayala R', 'Velez P', 'Boque C', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Arrizabalaga B', 'Estrada N', 'Cifuentes R', 'Arcas I', 'de Los Reyes-Garcia AM', 'Besses C', 'Vicente V', 'Alvarez-Larran A', 'Teruel-Montoya R', 'Gonzalez-Conejero R', 'Martinez C']","['Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain. fferrermarin@gmail.com.', 'CIBERER (U765), Murcia, Spain. fferrermarin@gmail.com.', 'UCAM, Murcia, Spain. fferrermarin@gmail.com.', 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', ""ICO-Badalona, Institut d'Investigacio contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain."", 'Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Hospital General de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.', 'Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Dr Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Dr Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Hospital Doce de Octubre, UCM, CNIO, CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'ICO-Hospital Duran y Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'ICO-Hospital Duran y Reynals, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario de Cruces, Bilbao, Spain.', ""ICO-Badalona, Institut d'Investigacio contra la Leucemia Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain."", 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'CIBERER (U765), Murcia, Spain.', 'Servicio de Anatomia Patologica, Hospital General Universitario Reina Sofia, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'CIBERER (U765), Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar (IMIM), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'CIBERER (U765), Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hospital Morales Meseguer, Centro Regional de Hemodonacion, IMIB-Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200227,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MIRN146 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NF-kappa B)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/pathology']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/11/21 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0767-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0767-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Oct;34(10):2648-2659. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0767-3.

Between April 2002 and March 2008, 1138 children with non-T ALL were enrolled in the JACLS ALL-02 trial. Patients were stratified into three groups using age, white blood cell count, unfavorable genetic abnormalities, and treatment response: standard risk (SR), high risk (HR), and extremely high risk (ER). Prophylactic cranial radiation therapy (PCRT) was abolished except for CNS leukemia. Four-year event-free survival (4yr-EFS) and 4-year overall survival (4yr-OS) rates for all patients were 85.4% +/- 1.1% and 91.2% +/- 0.9%, respectively. Risk-adjusted therapy resulted in 4yr-EFS rates of 90.4% +/- 1.4% for SR, 84.9% +/- 1.6% for HR, and 66.5% +/- 4.0% for ER. Based on NCI risk classification, 4yr-EFS rates were 88.2% in NCI-SR and 76.4% in NCI-HR patients, respectively. Compared to previous trial ALL-97, 4yr-EFS of NCI-SR patients was significantly improved (88.2% vs 81.2%, log rank p = 0.0004). The 4-year cumulative incidence of isolated (0.9%) and total (1.5%) CNS relapse were significantly lower than those reported previously. In conclusion, improved EFS in NCI-SR patients and abolish of PCRT was achieved in ALL-02.","['Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Yumura-Yagi, Keiko', 'Takahashi, Yoshihiro', 'Usami, Ikuya', 'Suenobu, So-Ichi', 'Nishimura, Shinichiro', 'Suzuki, Nobuhiro', 'Hashii, Yoshiko', 'Deguchi, Takao', 'Moriya-Saito, Akiko', 'Kato, Koji', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki', 'Hirayama, Masahiro', 'Iguchi, Akihiro', 'Kawasaki, Hirohide', 'Hori, Hiroki', 'Sato, Atsushi', 'Kudoh, Tooru', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Oda, Megumi', 'Hara, Junichi', 'Horibe, Keizo']","['Hasegawa D', 'Imamura T', 'Yumura-Yagi K', 'Takahashi Y', 'Usami I', 'Suenobu SI', 'Nishimura S', 'Suzuki N', 'Hashii Y', 'Deguchi T', 'Moriya-Saito A', 'Kato K', 'Kosaka Y', 'Hirayama M', 'Iguchi A', 'Kawasaki H', 'Hori H', 'Sato A', 'Kudoh T', 'Nakahata T', 'Oda M', 'Hara J', 'Horibe K']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hyogo Prefectural Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan. imamura@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan. imamura@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp.', 'Yumura Clinic, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hyogo Prefectural Amagasaki General Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Division of General Pediatrics and Emergency Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Oita University, Oita, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima University Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido Medical Center for Child Health and Rehabilitation, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hyogo Prefectural Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics Kansai Medical University, Hirakata, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University, Tsu, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Miyagi Children's Hospital, Sendai, Japan."", 'Saiseikai Nishiotaru Hospital, Otaru, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Application, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Okayama University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Osaka City General Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200227,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation/*mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Adjustment/*methods', 'Survival Rate']",2020/02/29 06:00,2020/10/31 06:00,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2019/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-020-0287-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-020-0287-4 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 Feb 27;10(2):23. doi: 10.1038/s41408-020-0287-4.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5727-4470', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6850-2782', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1367-3883']",,,PMC7046744,,,,,,,,,,['Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study Group (JACLS)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This multicenter, investigator-initiated phase-II study evaluates a sequential treatment with two cycles of bendamustine debulking for patients with a higher tumor load, followed by ofatumumab and ibrutinib induction and maintenance treatment. An all-comer population, irrespective of prior treatment, physical fitness and genetic factors was included. The primary endpoint was the investigator assessed overall response rate at the end of induction treatment. Of 66 patients enrolled, one patient with early treatment discontinuation was excluded from the efficacy analysis as predefined by the protocol. Thirty-nine patients (60%) were treatment-naive and 26 patients (40%) had relapsed/refractory CLL, 21 patients (32%) had a del(17p) and/or TP53 mutation and 45 patients (69%) had an unmutated IGHV status. At the end of the induction, 60 of 65 patients (92%) responded and 9 (14%) achieved minimal residual disease negativity (<10-4) in peripheral blood. No unexpected or cumulative toxicities occurred, most common CTC degrees III/IV adverse events were neutropenias, anaemia, infusion-related reactions, and diarrhoea.

The current, great increase in new treatments, such as immunotherapy, constitutes a new clinical and regulatory paradigm. Cellular immunotherapy is one of these types of immunotherapy. In particular, the advanced therapy drugs with chimeric antigen receptors in the T-lymphocytes (CAR-T), and particularly the CAR-T19 cells, has opened up a new scenario in the approach to haematology tumours like acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and the B-Cell lymphomas. The approval of tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel by the regulatory authorities has led to the setting up of the National Plan for Advanced Therapies-CAR-T drugs in Spain. There is evidence of, not only the advantage of identifying the centres most suitable for their administration, but also the need for these to undergo a profound change in order that their healthcare activity is extended, in some cases, to the ability for the in-house manufacture of these types of therapies. The hospitals specialised in paediatric haematology-oncology thus have the challenge of progressing towards a healthcare model that integrates cellular immunotherapy, having the appropriate capacity to manage all aspects relative to their use, manufacture, and administration of these new treatments.","['Mirones, Isabel', 'Moreno, Lucas', 'Patino-Garcia, Ana', 'Lizeaga, Garbine', 'Moraleda, Jose M', 'Toribio, Maria Luisa', 'Perez-Martinez, Antonio']","['Mirones I', 'Moreno L', 'Patino-Garcia A', 'Lizeaga G', 'Moraleda JM', 'Toribio ML', 'Perez-Martinez A']","['Unidad de Investigacion Traslacional y Terapias Avanzadas, Servicio de Hemato-Oncologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Espana.', ""Servicio de Hemato-Oncolologia Pediatrica, Hospital Universitario Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Espana."", 'Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria de Navarra (IDISNA), Pamplona, Espana.

Despite successful response rates of CML patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), resistance eventually arises due to BCR-ABL-dependent and independent mechanisms. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein acting in the interface between apoptosis deregulation and cell cycle progression. In CML, high levels of survivin have been associated with late stages of disease and therapy resistance. In this review, we provide an overview of important aspects concerning survivin subcellular localization and expression pattern in CML patients and cell lines. Moreover, we highlight the relevance of molecular networks involving survivin for disease progression and treatment resistance. Finally, we discuss the mechanisms accounting for survivin overexpression, as well as novel therapeutic interventions that have been designed to counteract survivin-associated malignancy in CML.","['Bernardo, Paula Sabbo', 'Lemos, Lauana Greicy Tonon', 'de Moraes, Gabriela Nestal', 'Maia, Raquel Ciuvalschi']","['Bernardo PS', 'Lemos LGT', 'de Moraes GN', 'Maia RC']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Program of Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Program of Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Program of Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Program of Molecular Hemato-Oncology, Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

In this study, primary cultures of mouse TECs were isolated and identified with TEC-specific antibodies CK5 and CK8. These TECs were immortalized by retroviral transduction of simian virus (SV) 40 large T antigen. We then compared the functions of TECs and immortalized TECs (iTECs). Cell morphology and the proliferative capacity of TECs and iTECs were observed by inverted microscope photography and crystal violet assay after passage. A soft agar assay was then performed to observe their clone formation ability. The expression levels of epithelial cell related factors, such as IL-7, Lptin, Pax-9, Sema3A and et al., were detected by IF and qPCR. TECs were co-cultured with human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1), and the effect of TECs on promoting THP-1 proliferation was observed with flow cytometry and CFSE labeling. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase assay was measured to detect the anti-aging capabilities of the cells. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by propidium iodide (PI) staining, and paclitaxel (PTX)-induced apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-PI staining to evaluate the anti-apoptotic ability of the cells. Throughout, we found that the immortalized TECs still retain the characteristics of primary TECs, such as the morphology, function and epithelial characteristics; however, iTECs have stronger capabilities in proliferation and anti-aging. Our research suggests that the iTECs were successfully immortalized by SV40 large T antigen, and that the biological characteristics and functions of iTECs were similar to the original TECs. This immortalized cell can be used as an efficient cell model in functional research of the thymus substituting primary TECs with iTECs.","['Shen, Jia-Man', 'Ma, Li', 'He, Kai', 'Guo, Wen-Qin', 'Ding, Chuan', 'Hoffman, Robert D', 'He, Bing-Qian', 'Zheng, Hong-Bin', 'Gao, Jian-Li']","['Shen JM', 'Ma L', 'He K', 'Guo WQ', 'Ding C', 'Hoffman RD', 'He BQ', 'Zheng HB', 'Gao JL']","['Collage of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310053, China.', 'College of Basic Medical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310053, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Medical School of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310009, China.', 'Collage of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310053, China.', 'Collage of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310053, China.', 'International Education College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310053, China; DAOM Department, Five Branches University, San Jose, CA, 95131, USA.', 'International Education College, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310053, China.', 'College of Basic Medical Science, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310053, China.

It may occur both in the germ and the somatic cells, resulting in congenital and developmental disorders and cancer, respectively. Asymptomatic individuals may be carriers of chromotriptic rearrangements and experience recurrent reproductive failures when two or more chromosomes are involved. Several mechanisms are postulated to underlie chromothripsis. The most attractive hypothesis involves chromosome pulverization in micronuclei, followed by the incorrect reassembly of fragments through DNA repair to explain the clustered nature of the observed complex rearrangements. Moreover, exogenous or endogenous DNA damage induction and dicentric bridge formation may be involved. Chromosome instability is commonly observed in the cells of patients with DNA repair disorders, such as ataxia telangiectasia, Nijmegen breakage syndrome, and Bloom syndrome. In addition, germline variations of TP53 have been associated with chromothripsis in sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia. In the present review, we focus on the underlying mechanisms of chromothripsis and the involvement of defective DNA repair genes, resulting in chromosome instability and chromothripsis-like rearrangements.","['Nazaryan-Petersen, Lusine', 'Bjerregaard, Victoria Alexandra', 'Nielsen, Finn Cilius', 'Tommerup, Niels', 'Tumer, Zeynep']","['Nazaryan-Petersen L', 'Bjerregaard VA', 'Nielsen FC', 'Tommerup N', 'Tumer Z']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Kennedy Center, Department of Clinical Genetics, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, 2600 Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Center for Genomic Medicine, Rigshospitalet, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Kennedy Center, Department of Clinical Genetics, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, 2600 Glostrup, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200225,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,2020/02/29 06:00,2020/02/29 06:01,['2020/02/29 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9030613 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9030613 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Feb 25;9(3). pii: jcm9030613. doi: 10.3390/jcm9030613.,,['4183-00482B/The Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF)'],,PMC7141117,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)', 'DNA repair', 'DNA repair disorders', 'TP53', 'ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)', 'ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)', 'chromosome pulverization', 'chromothripsis', 'micronuclei', 'structural variants']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its pathogenesis mechanisms and therapeutic treatments still remain vague. Asperuloside (ASP) is an iridoid glycoside found in Herba Paederiae, and is a component from traditional Chinese herbal medicine. ASP has been suggested to have various pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor and anti-inflammation. In this study, we explored the effects of ASP on apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in human leukemia cells and in human primary leukemia blasts. ASP treatments selectively reduced the cell viability of human leukemia cells and primary leukemia blasts in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that ASP induced cell death via promoting the cleavage of Caspase-9, -3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), which was along with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and Cyto-c release from the mitochondria. In addition, we found that ASP significantly induced ER stress in leukemia cells by improving the protein expression levels of glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa (GRP78), phosphorylated protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK), phosphorylated eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), phosphorylated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (p-IRE1), X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6) and cleaved Caspase-12. Moreover, ER stress suppression markedly abrogated ASP-induced apoptosis. In addition, GRP78 knockdown significantly diminished ER stress and apoptosis triggered by ASP. Importantly, co-immunoprecipitation (IP) analysis further indicated that ASP regulated the interaction between GRP78 and PERK, subsequently meditating the apoptotic cell death. In vivo leukemia xenografts finally validated ER stress and apoptosis were related to the tumor growth reduction induced by ASP. The overall survival of mice was also improved by ASP treatments, accompanied with the significantly reduced number of white blood cells and elevated red blood cells. Together, our present results showed that ASP exerted anti-leukemic effects at least partially via inducing apoptosis regulated by ER stress, and suggested that ASP might be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for treating human leukemia.","['Rong, Chao', 'Wei, Wu', 'Yu-Hong, Tian']","['Rong C', 'Wei W', 'Yu-Hong T']","['Department of Pediatric Comprehensive Medicine, Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child-care Hospital, Lanzhou 730050, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Benxi Central Hospital, Benxi 117000, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining 272000, China.

TOX has multiple roles in the development of the adaptive immune system including development of CD4 T cells, NK cells and lymph node organogenesis. However very few antibodies recognizing this molecule have been reported and no extensive study of the expression of TOX in reactive and neoplastic lymphoid tissue has been performed to date. In the present study, we have investigated TOX expression in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues using a novel rat monoclonal antibody that recognizes its target molecule in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. A large series of normal tissues and B- and T-cell lymphomas was studied, using whole sections and tissue microarrays. We found that the majority of precursor B/T lymphoblastic, follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphomas and angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas strongly expressed the TOX protein. Burkitt and mantle cell lymphomas showed TOX expression in a small percentage of cases. TOX was not found in the majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, myelomas, marginal zone lymphomas and classical Hodgkin lymphomas. In conclusion, we describe for the first time the expression of TOX in normal and neoplastic lymphoid tissues. The co-expression of TOX and PD-1 identified in normal and neoplastic T cells is consistent with recent studies identifying TOX as a critical regulator of T-cell exhaustion and a potential immunotherapy target. Its differential expression may be of diagnostic relevance in the differential diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, the identification of the phenotype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and the recognition of peripheral T-cell lymphoma with a follicular helper T phenotype.","['Maestre, Lorena', 'Garcia-Garcia, Juan Fernando', 'Jimenez, Scherezade', 'Reyes-Garcia, Ana Isabel', 'Garcia-Gonzalez, Alvaro', 'Montes-Moreno, Santiago', 'Arribas, Alberto J', 'Gonzalez-Garcia, Patricia', 'Caleiras, Eduardo', 'Banham, Alison H', 'Piris, Miguel Angel', 'Roncador, Giovanna']","['Maestre L', 'Garcia-Garcia JF', 'Jimenez S', 'Reyes-Garcia AI', 'Garcia-Gonzalez A', 'Montes-Moreno S', 'Arribas AJ', 'Gonzalez-Garcia P', 'Caleiras E', 'Banham AH', 'Piris MA', 'Roncador G']","['Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Pathology Department, Santander, Spain.', 'Universita della Svizzera Italiana, Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Histopathology Core Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Histopathology Core Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Pathology, Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies Core Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200227,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TOX protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism/pathology']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0229743 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-29134 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Feb 27;15(2):e0229743. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0229743. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-9807-2875'],,,PMC7046285,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated a TKI-resistant K562 sub-population, K562-IR, under selective imatinib-mesylate pressure. K562-IR cells are CD34-/CD38-, BCR-Abl-independent, proliferate slowly, highly adherent and form intact tumor spheroids. Loss of CD45 and other hematopoietic markers reveal these cells have diverged from their hematopoietic origin. CD34 negativity, high expression of E-cadherin and CD44; decreased levels of CD45 and beta-catenin do not fully confer with the leukemic stem cell (LSC) phenotype. Expression analyses reveal that K562-IR cells differentially express tissue/organ development and differentiation genes. Our data suggest that the observed phenotypic shift is an adaptive process rendering cells under TKI stress to become oncogene independent. Cells develop transcriptional instability in search for a gene expression framework suitable for new environmental stresses, resulting in an adaptive phenotypic shift in which some cells partially display LSC-like properties. With leukemic/cancer stem cell targeted therapies underway, the difference between treating an entity and a spectrum of dynamic cellular states will have conclusive effects on the outcome.","['Baykal-Kose, Seda', 'Acikgoz, Eda', 'Yavuz, Ahmet Sinan', 'Gonul Geyik, Oyku', 'Ates, Halil', 'Sezerman, Osman Ugur', 'Ozsan, Guner Hayri', 'Yuce, Zeynep']","['Baykal-Kose S', 'Acikgoz E', 'Yavuz AS', 'Gonul Geyik O', 'Ates H', 'Sezerman OU', 'Ozsan GH', 'Yuce Z']","['Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Genetics and Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, School of Medicine, Acibadem University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200227,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/05/10 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0229104 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-29029 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Feb 27;15(2):e0229104. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0229104. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8654-5332', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4069-6105', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2762-0942']",,,PMC7046262,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4787100.v1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, new NQO1 roles are emerging-including its regulation of the cellular proliferation of many tumor cells-and this enzyme has been found to relate to the incidence of various diseases, including chronic myeloid leukemia. However, the mechanisms through which NQO1 influences leukemia progression remain unclear. MARTIAL AND METHODS: The current study looks to name NQO1 as a novel molecular target that modulates DNA synthesis and chronic myeloid leukemia growth. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the frequency of the T allele of NQO1 polymorphism in chronic myeloid leukemia patients is higher than that among healthy East Asian individuals (0.492 vs. 0.419) and much higher than the average level of the general population (0.492 vs. 0.289) (1000 Genomes). Functionally, NQO1 knockdown increases the protein expression of the TOP2A and MCM complex, and consequently promotes DNA synthesis and K562 cell growth. NQO1 knockdown also promotes tumorigenesis in a xenograft model. NQO1 overexpression, on the other hand, was found to have the opposite effects. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that NQO1 downregulation promotes K562 cellular proliferation via the elevation of DNA synthesis.","['Xiao, Fei-Yan', 'Jiang, Zhi-Ping', 'Yuan, Fang', 'Zhou, Fang-Jiao', 'Kuang, Wei', 'Zhou, Gan', 'Chen, Xiao-Ping', 'Liu, Rong', 'Zhou, Hong-Hao', 'Zhao, Xie-Lan', 'Cao, Shan']","['Xiao FY', 'Jiang ZP', 'Yuan F', 'Zhou FJ', 'Kuang W', 'Zhou G', 'Chen XP', 'Liu R', 'Zhou HH', 'Zhao XL', 'Cao S']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, 87 Xiangya Road, Changsha 410008, PR China;

Hematological disturbances in Down syndrome: single centre experience of thirteen years and review of the literature. Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 664-670. Neonates with Down syndrome (DS) may have hematological abnormalities such as polycythemia, thrombocytopenia and transient leukemia (TL). The primary objective of this study was to report the descriptive data of complete blood counts (CBC) of neonates with DS, which were obtained within first week of life. We wanted to focus on neonates with hematological abnormalities and compare them among those with and without TL. The secondary objective was the description of hematological malignancies in the first six years of life. Medical records of 100 neonates with DS between 2006-2018 were assessed. Hematological abnormalities were present in 73/100. We detected anemia in 16, polycythemia in eight, microcytosis in 10, leukopenia in two, leukocytosis in 11, thrombocytopenia in 26, thrombocytosis in 7 and TL in 11 patients. TL group had higher levels of leukocyte count (115.0+/-93.0x103/mm3) when compared with neonates without TL (11.7+/-5.6x103/mm3) (p < 0.001). No other statistically significant difference between groups for hemoglobin, MCV and platelet count levels was detected. In the follow- up period, two patients developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia, one hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and one Burkitt lymphoma. None of the TL survivors developed myeloid leukemia of Down Syndrome (ML-DS). Thrombocytopenia may be detected frequently in DS and it may not be a part of TL. We suggest that CBC with peripheral blood film should be evaluated for every patient to check for TL and other hematological disturbances. Despite the fact that none of our TL survivors developed overt leukemia (ML-DS), we also suggest that patients with DS be followed due to the risk of developing leukemia.","['Karakurt, Neslihan', 'Uslu, Ilker', 'Aygun, Canan', 'Albayrak, Canan']","['Karakurt N', 'Uslu I', 'Aygun C', 'Albayrak C']","['Divisions of Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Ondokuz Mayis University School of Medicine, Samsun, Turkey.', 'Divisions of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Ondokuz Mayis University School of Medicine, Samsun, Turke.', 'Divisions of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Ondokuz Mayis University School of Medicine, Samsun, Turke.', 'Divisions of Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Ondokuz Mayis University School of Medicine, Samsun, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,,IM,"['Blood Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/blood/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/07/22 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['2042 [pii]', '10.24953/turkjped.2019.05.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 2019;61(5):664-670. doi: 10.24953/turkjped.2019.05.004.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Down syndrome', '*leukocytosis', '*thrombocytopenia', '*transient leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute inflammation is an essential physiological event by immune system for a protective measure to remove cause of inflammation and failure of resolution lead to chronic inflammation. Over a period of time, a number of drugs mostly chemical have been deployed to combat acute and chronic inflammation. Recently, enzyme based anti-inflammatory drugs became popular over conventional chemical based drugs. Serratiopeptidase, a proteolytic enzyme from trypsin family, possesses tremendous scope in combating inflammation. Serine protease possesses a higher affinity for cyclooxygenase (COX-I and COX-II), a key enzyme associated with production of different inflammatory mediators including interleukins (IL), prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxane (TXs) etc. Currently, arthritis, sinusitis, bronchitis, fibrocystic breast disease, and carpal tunnel syndrome, etc. are the leading inflammatory disorders that affected the entire the globe. In order to conquer inflammation, both acute and chronic world, physician mostly relies on conventional drugs. The most common drugs to combat acute inflammation are Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone and or in combination with other drugs. However, during chronic inflammation, NSAIDs are often used with steroidal drugs such as autoimmune disorders. These drugs possess several limitations such as side effects, ADR, etc. In order to overcome these limitations and complications, enzyme based drugs (anti-inflammatory) emerged, and aim for a new high since the last decade. Serine protease, the largest proteolytic family has been reported for several therapeutic applications, including anti-inflammatory. Serratiopeptidase is a leading enzyme which has a very long history in medical as an effective anti-inflammatory drug. Current study emphasizes present scenario and future prospect of serratiopeptidase as an anti-inflammatory drug. The study also illustrates a comparative analysis of conventional drugs and enzyme based therapeutic to combat inflammation.","['Tiwari, Manju']",['Tiwari M'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, Barkatullah University, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20170201,Netherlands,Asian J Pharm Sci,Asian journal of pharmaceutical sciences,101535338,,,,2017/05/01 00:00,2017/05/01 00:01,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2016/10/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ajps.2017.01.003 [doi]', 'S1818-0876(16)30160-X [pii]']",ppublish,Asian J Pharm Sci. 2017 May;12(3):209-215. doi: 10.1016/j.ajps.2017.01.003.

Although numerous studies have been carried out to develop methods of overcoming drug resistance, the results have generally been unsatisfactory. CD40 ligand (CD40L) has been shown to improve the sensitivity of cancer cells to drug treatment. In the present study, Adriamycin (ADM)-resistant human monocytic THP-1 cells (THP-1/A cells) were developed by incubating THP-1 cells with increasing concentrations of ADM. Cells were transfected with CD40L vectors to explore the potential involvement of CD40L in regulating multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer. Cell proliferation and viability were measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay; cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry, trypan blue staining and caspase-3 activity; and the expression of MDR-associated protein 1 (MRP1) and permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) was analyzed using western blotting. The results revealed that the protein expression levels of MRP1 and P-gp were downregulated by raised CD40L expression and that the combination of raised CD40L expression with daunorubicin (DNR), a drug from which ADM is derived, significantly increased the extent of cell apoptosis, indicating that drug resistance was effectively attenuated by CD40L. Collectively, these results suggested that CD40L may contribute towards reducing DNR resistance in THP-1/A cells.","['Feng, Zhongxin', 'Chen, Qi']","['Feng Z', 'Chen Q']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, Guizhou 563003, P.R.

This aim of the present study was to investigate the profile of apoptosis-related proteins in K562 and K562/G (IM-resistant K562 cells) cells, in order to identify new biomarkers. A human apoptosis antibody array was used to screen 46 proteins in the two cells lines, among which 20 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between K562 and K562/G cells. The major proteins included secreted caspase-8, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, caspase-3 and p27. IGFBP-1 IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 were selected for the follow-up study. Subsequently, reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis and western blotting were used to detect the expression levels of the IGFBPs. The results revealed that the expression levels of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 in K562/G cells were significantly decreased compared with those in K562 cells, whereas the IGFBP-1 level was higher. Moreover, no significant correlation was observed between IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-2 and the level of the BCR-ABL fusion protein, whereas decreasing IGFBP-3 levels were associated with increasing BCR-ABL levels. These results suggested that IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 could be useful novel biomarkers for IM resistance in CML.","['Ren, Yingli', 'Yin, Shihong', 'Lin, Ya', 'Xu, Xiucai']","['Ren Y', 'Yin S', 'Lin Y', 'Xu X']","['Central Laboratory, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui 230001, P.R.

Malignant myeloid progenitor cells display excessive growth that is difficult to control without toxicity. More than 60 herbs in TCM have shown efficacy against CML. However, the key molecules and mechanisms involved in the holistic-level characterization, as well as the effective target associations, are still unknown. Methods: The present study employed a computational approach with filtering potential compounds via admetSAR, systems biology-based functional data prediction, and biochemical and molecular biological validation. Results: We generated 118 bioactive compounds from 11 herbs within four dialectical therapy groups that are most commonly used to treat CML and predicted 141 potential targets.

Five antimalarial herbal mixtures commonly used in Ghana (coded as STF, SMH, SMM, SGM, and STT) were purchased and freeze-dried. The dried samples were tested on human acute T-cell leukemia (Jurkat) and breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the tetrazolium-based colorimetric (MTT) assay while antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH free-radical scavenging assay. Among the mixtures, SMM and SGM exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity towards Jurkat cells (IC50 values 59.17 mug/ml and 49.57 mug/ml, respectively), whereas STT showed the weakest cytotoxicity (IC50 = 244.94 mug/ml). Cytotoxic effect of SMM was also strongest towards MCF-7 cells whilst the least cytotoxic sample was SGM (IC50 > 1000 mug/ml). SMM had the highest antioxidant percentage (EC50 = 1.05 mg/ml). The increasing order of antioxidant percentage among the five herbal mixtures is SMM > SMH > STT > STF > SGM. The herbal mixtures may be potential sources of toxic agents to host cells. Therefore, further toxicity studies must be performed to safeguard health of the public. Interestingly, cytotoxicities exhibited by SMM and SGM suggest the presence of anticancer constituents in them which warrant further studies.","['Dadzie, Isaac', 'Avorgbedo, Shaibu Adams', 'Appiah-Opong, Regina', 'Cudjoe, Obed']","['Dadzie I', 'Avorgbedo SA', 'Appiah-Opong R', 'Cudjoe O']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Science, School of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Science, School of Allied Health Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, University of Ghana, Legon, Ghana.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medical Sciences, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200210,Egypt,Int J Microbiol,International journal of microbiology,101516125,,,,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:01,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/01 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8645691 [doi]'],epublish,Int J Microbiol. 2020 Feb 10;2020:8645691. doi: 10.1155/2020/8645691. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2146-6796'],,['Copyright (c) 2020 Isaac Dadzie et al.'],PMC7035539,,,,,,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this paper.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Eligible studies published between Jan 2010 and April 2018 were retrieved from online bibliographic databases based on multiple keywords to generate search strings. Meta-analysis was performed using the outcome measure, Hazard Ratio (HR). A survival analysis of all studies was conducted and a subsequent forest plot was generated to evaluate the pooled effect size, across all T-ALL patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on demographic characteristics and commonly represented miRNAs among the included studies. Results: A total of 17 studies were included for systematic review, among which 16 studies were eligible for meta-analysis, which, in total discussed 32 different miRNAs. The mean effect size of HR value was 0.929 (CI 0.878-0984), which indicates a decrease in risk of death by 7.1%. The analysis was based on the random effects model with the heterogeneity measure index (I(2)) being 84.92%. The pooled effect size (HR) of upregulated and downregulated miRNA expressions on survival outcome in the T-ALL patient was 0.787 (CI 0.732-0.845) and 1.225 (CI 1.110-1.344) respectively. The subgroup analysis was performed based on demographic characteristics (age, gender, lactate dehydrogenase, WBC count) and expression of miR221 and miR46a. Conclusion: Our systematic review and meta-analysis findings suggest that the overall miRNA expression is potentially associated with a decreased likelihood of death in T-ALL patients. Although our findings are inconclusive, the results point toward miRNA expression allowing for prognostic evaluation of T-ALL patients.","['Sabarimurugan, Shanthi', 'Kumarasamy, Chellan', 'Royam Madhav, Madurantakam', 'Samiappan, Suja', 'Jayaraj, Rama']","['Sabarimurugan S', 'Kumarasamy C', 'Royam Madhav M', 'Samiappan S', 'Jayaraj R']","['Theranostics, GenesisCare, Perth, WA, Australia.', 'University of Adelaide, North Terrace Campus, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.', 'School of Biosciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India 632014.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Clinical Sciences, College of Health and Human Sciences, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, Northern Territory 0909, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200205,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:01,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S200687 [doi]', '200687 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Feb 5;12:819-839. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S200687. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7885-460X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2179-0510']",,['(c) 2020 Sabarimurugan et al.'],PMC7008181,,['NOTNLM'],"['PRISMA', 'biomarkers', 'microRNAs', 'prognosis', 'survival analysis']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in cord blood transplantation (CBT), studies of CMV infection, especially CMV viral load, on relapse are limited. Patients and Methods: Wct e retrospectively analyzed the effect of CMV infection on 3-year outcomes in 249 AML patients according to CMV DNA load (DNA copies <1000/mL and DNA copies >==1000/mL) within 100 days after CBT. Furthermore, eight-colour flow cytometry was used to detect peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in 38 patients who received CBT in the last year, and 10 healthy volunteers were included as controls. Results: The results showed that CMV DNA load did not affect the cumulative incidence of relapse in the whole study population. However, in patients with complete remission status before transplantation, the high CMV DNA load group showed a significantly reduction of relapse than the low CMV DNA load group (3.9% vs 14.6%, p=0.012, respectively), which was confirmed by multivariate analysis (HR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.73, p = 0.012). Surprisingly, high or low CMV DNA load did not significantly affect non-relapse mortality or overall survival (18.0% vs 17.0%, p=0.777 and 79.0% vs 74.6%, p=0.781, respectively). Besides, the absolute number of CD8(+) T cells were increased in the high CMV DNA load group compared with the low DNA load group 1 month after CBT (0.20x10(9)/L vs 0.10x10(9)/L, p=0.021, respectively). Conclusion: DNA copies >==1000/mL for AML patients in complete remission was associated with a lower incidence of relapse after CBT, which might partly result from the expansion of CMV-related CD8(+) T cells.","['Dong, Man-Yu', 'Tang, Bao-Lin', 'Zhu, Xiao-Yu', 'Cheng, Si-Qi', 'Fang, Xin-Chen', 'Tong, Juan', 'Wan, Xiang', 'Zheng, Chang-Cheng', 'Liu, Hui-Lan', 'Sun, Zi-Min']","['Dong MY', 'Tang BL', 'Zhu XY', 'Cheng SQ', 'Fang XC', 'Tong J', 'Wan X', 'Zheng CC', 'Liu HL', 'Sun ZM']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200207,New Zealand,Infect Drug Resist,Infection and drug resistance,101550216,,,,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:01,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IDR.S225465 [doi]', '225465 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Drug Resist. 2020 Feb 7;13:373-383. doi: 10.2147/IDR.S225465. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) 2020 Dong et al.'],PMC7012225,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA load', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'complete remission', 'cord blood transplantation', 'cytomegalovirus', 'relapse']",,,['The authors declare no competing financial interests in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Taurine-Upregulated Gene1 (TUG1) has been reported to participate in the development and progression of several cancers, including AML. Herein, we aimed to investigate the pathognomonic role of TUG1 in AML cells and its potential mechanistic pathway. Methods: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was applied to detect the expression levels of lncRNA TUG1, miR-193a-5p and Rab10 in AML bone marrow and cell lines. The CCK-8 assay was conducted to assess the cell viability of AML HL-60 and NB4 cells and cell apoptotic assay was performed to assess the cell death. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was carried out to clarify the relationships among TUG1, miR-193a-5p and Rab10. Also, the protein level of Rab10 was examined by Western blot assay. Results: LncRNA TUG1 was up-regulated in AML bone marrow and cells. Functional analysis showed that the silencing of TUG1 suppressed cell viability, while promoted cell death in AML HL-60 and NB4 cells. TUG1 targeted miR-193a-5p and negatively regulated miR-193a-5p expression. Overexpressed miR-193a-5p resulted in the decrease of cell viability and the increase in the cell death in AML cells. Restoration experiments proved that TUG1 regulated the cell viability and death of AML cells through regulating the miR-193a-5p/Rab10 axis. Rab10 was a direct target of miR-193a-5p and was inversely regulated by miR-193a-5p. TUG1 regulated the cell viability and death of AML cells through upregulating Rab10. Conclusion: Silencing of lncRNA TUG1 induces a cytotoxic effect on AML cell lines through sponging miR-193a-5p and the suppression of Rab10.","['Li, Qun', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Li Q', 'Wang J']","[""Department of PICU, First People's Hospital of Shangqiu City, Shangqiu, Henan Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of PICU, First People's Hospital of Shangqiu City, Shangqiu, Henan Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200213,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:01,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S234935 [doi]', '234935 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Feb 13;13:1289-1301. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S234935. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) 2020 Li and Wang.'],PMC7025684,,['NOTNLM'],"['Rab10', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'lncRNA TUG1', 'miR-193a-5p']",,,['The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aimed to investigate the expression characteristics of gamma-catenin in AML patients, explore the mechanisms by which gamma-catenin regulates beta-catenin, and discuss the feasibility of targeting gamma-catenin for AML treatment. Methods: The mRNA expression levels of gamma-catenin in AML patients were measured by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation was examined via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. The expression levels of related proteins were measured via Western blotting. Specific siRNA was used to modulate the expression level of the gamma-catenin gene. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were quantified by flow cytometry. The subcellular localization of gamma-catenin and beta-catenin was examined via immunofluorescence with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Results: Overexpression of gamma-catenin was frequently observed in AML and correlated with poor prognosis. Consistent with this finding, suppression of gamma-catenin in the AML cell line THP-1 induced growth inhibition, promoted apoptosis and blocked beta-catenin nuclear translocation. Interestingly, gamma-catenin knockdown sensitized THP-1 cells to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents such as cytarabine and homoharringtonine and further inhibited beta-catenin nuclear localization. Moreover, our data implied the relationship between gamma-catenin and GSK3beta (whose effect on beta-catenin is mediated by its own phosphorylation), which may be the principal mechanism underlying the anti-AML effect of gamma-catenin inhibition. Conclusion: Taken together, our results revealed a potential role of gamma-catenin in AML pathogenesis-mainly through the inhibition of GSK3beta-mediated nuclear localization of beta-catenin-and indicate that targeting gamma-catenin might offer new AML treatments.","['Qian, Jiejin', 'Huang, Xianbo', 'Zhang, Yinyin', 'Ye, Xiujin', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Qian J', 'Huang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Ye X', 'Qian W']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200212,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:01,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S230873 [doi]', '230873 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Feb 12;13:1265-1276. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S230873. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) 2020 Qian et al.'],PMC7024797,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'beta-catenin', 'gamma-catenin']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: MCF-7 cells were treated with 6-TG, and the IC50 value was measured by a cell counting kit-8 assay. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were confirmed by RNA-seq analysis. Apoptosis and cell cycle consequences were determined by flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. Results: The results showed that colony formation decreased markedly and the percentage of cell apoptosis increased after 6-TG treatment. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression decreased, and FAS expression increased. Moreover, 6-TG also induced MCF-7 cells to undergo G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and upregulated CDKN1A (p21).

Methods: The GAS2 expression level was detected by qRT-RCR and Western blot in normal T lymphocytes and T-ALL cells Jurkat and CCRF-CEM. The proliferation and invasion of Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells were detected by MTT and Transwell assay, respectively. Apoptosis and cell cycle were measured by flow cytometry. In addition, the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells was measured MTT assay and flow cytometry. Results: GAS2 was highly expressed in Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells. GAS2 could promote cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibit apoptosis of Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells. GAS2 also promoted cell cycle changes from G0/G1 phase to S phase in Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells. In addition, GAS2 could reduce the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of Jurkat and CCRF-CEM cells. GAS2 overexpression could promote the expression levels of ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bcl-2, c-myc, cyclin D1 and beta-catenin, while GAS2 knockdown could inhibit their expression levels. Meanwhile, GAS2 overexpression could inhibit Bax expression. Moreover, Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor XAV939 could inhibit the expressions of c-myc, cyclin D1 and beta-catenin, but activator LiCl could promote their expression. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that GAS2 could promote cell proliferation and invasion, and induce cell cycle, as well as inhibit apoptosis and could activate the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in T-ALL cells.","['Kong, Yan', 'Zhao, Shouyong', 'Tian, Hurong', 'Hai, Yang']","['Kong Y', 'Zhao S', 'Tian H', 'Hai Y']","[""Clinical Lab, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng City, Shandong Province 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Lab, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng City, Shandong Province 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Lab, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng City, Shandong Province 252000, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical Lab, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng City, Shandong Province 252000, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200205,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2020/02/28 06:00,2020/02/28 06:01,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S236854 [doi]', '236854 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Feb 5;13:1099-1108. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S236854. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) 2020 Kong et al.'],PMC7008185,,['NOTNLM'],"['GAS2', 'T-ALL', 'Wnt/beta-catenin pathway', 'apoptosis', 'cell cycle', 'invasion', 'proliferation']",,,['The authors report no funding and no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, CCL2-targeting drugs are extremely limited. Thus, this study aimed to explore the neuroprotection afforded by naringin in CCL2-induced cognitive impairment in rats. METHODS: Before the CCL2 intra-hippocampal injection, rats were treated with naringin for 3 consecutive days via intraperitoneal injection. Two days post-surgery, the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NORT) tests were performed to detect spatial learning and memory and object cognition, respectively. Nissl staining and dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) staining were performed to assess histopathological changes in the hippocampus. Commercial kits were used to measure the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to examine the relative mRNA expression of interleukin 1beta, (IL-1beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease 8 (caspase-8), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease 3 (caspase-3), cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2), and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax). RESULTS: In the MWM, the average escape latency and average swimming distance were significantly reduced and the crossing times were increased in the naringin-treated groups, compared with the CCL2 group. The NORT results revealed that, compared with the CCL2 rats, the discrimination index in the naringin-treated rats increased significantly. Nissl and TUNEL staining revealed that naringin protected the structure and survival of the neurons in the CA1 zone of the hippocampus. In the naringin-treated groups, the SOD and GSH-Px activities were increased, whereas the MDA levels were decreased. Furthermore, in the naringin-treated groups, the relative mRNA expression of IL-1beta and IL-6 was significantly decreased; GLAST and GLT-1 mRNA expression levels were increased, whereas PAG was decreased. In the naringin-treated groups, the relative mRNA expression levels of caspase-8, caspase-3, and Bax were decreased, whereas that of Bcl-2 was increased. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data indicated that naringin alleviated the CCL2-induced cognitive impairment. The underlying mechanisms could be associated with the inhibition of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and the regulation of glutamate metabolism.","['Long, Jiang-Yi', 'Chen, Jian-Min', 'Liao, Yuan-Jun', 'Zhou, Yi-Jun', 'Liang, Bing-Yu', 'Zhou, Yan']","['Long JY', 'Chen JM', 'Liao YJ', 'Zhou YJ', 'Liang BY', 'Zhou Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, 53002, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, 53002, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, 53002, Guangxi, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, 53002, Guangxi, China.', 'Guangxi Key Laboratory of AIDS Prevention and Treatment, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, 530021, Guang, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, 53002, Guangxi, China. zhouyan@stu.gxmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200227,England,Behav Brain Funct,Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,101245751,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', 'N7TD9J649B (naringin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', '*Chemokine CCL2', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*chemically induced/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Discrimination, Psychological/drug effects', 'Escape Reaction/drug effects', 'Flavanones/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hippocampus/*drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Morris Water Maze Test', 'Neurons/*drug effects/pathology', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recognition, Psychology']",2020/02/28 06:00,2021/09/03 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12993-020-00166-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12993-020-00166-6 [pii]']",epublish,Behav Brain Funct. 2020 Feb 27;16(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s12993-020-00166-6.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0757-4341'],"['81660213/National Natural Foundation of China', '81360192/This work was supported by the National Natural Foundation of China', '2018JJA140536/National Foundation of Guangxi']",,PMC7045422,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-inflammation', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Glutamate metabolism', 'Naringin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common pediatric T-cell malignancies include T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Although the overall survival rates have improved markedly in recent years, children with relapsed T-ALL and ALCL have very low rates of cure and few salvage therapies exist. Current treatment regimens rely on toxic chemotherapies with significant short- and long-term morbidity. Immunotherapies, including antibodies and adoptive cellular therapies, have revolutionized the treatment of B-cell malignancies in pediatrics. The adaptation of these therapies to T-cell malignancies has been slower because of challenges implicit in the design and implementation of immunotherapies for T-cell malignancies, including the potential risks of fratricide, immunosuppression, and graft versus host disease (GVHD). We present a review of current challenges in the development of immunotherapies for T-cell hematologic malignancies, potential solutions and therapies under investigation. We include a particular focus on T-ALL and ALCL. Immunotherapies offer promising strategies to improve outcomes in children with T-cell malignancies, particularly in the setting of relapse. Optimizing efficacy, mitigating toxicity, and safely integrating with conventional therapies are key considerations as immunotherapies are translated into the clinic.","['Diorio, Caroline', 'Teachey, David T']","['Diorio C', 'Teachey DT']","[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Pereleman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Pereleman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200227,England,Expert Rev Clin Immunol,Expert review of clinical immunology,101271248,,IM,"['Child', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2020/02/28 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1744666X.2020.1732819 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Immunol. 2020 Apr;16(4):361-371. doi: 10.1080/1744666X.2020.1732819.

The development of a majority of human tumors is associated with dysregulation of this pathway, resulting in increased cancer cell proliferation. Both CDK4 and CDK6, well-validated cancer drug targets, function primarily as catalytic enzymes that mediate the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Here, we determined that SPH3643 is a novel potent antiproliferative agent that inhibits CDK4/6 kinase activity. In biochemical assays, SPH3643 showed more potent inhibition of both CDK4 and CDK6 than did 2 published CDK4/6 inhibitors, LY2835219 and palbociclib, and had better selectivity than LY2835219. Further in vitro study revealed that SPH3643 blocked Cdk/Rb signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Rb(Ser780) and arrested the MCF-7 cancer cells at G0 /G1 phase, resulting in marked inhibition of the proliferation of Rb-positive cancer cell lines. In vivo SPH3643 treatment in mice bearing xenograft tumor models of breast cancer, colon cancer, acute myelocytic leukemia, and glioblastoma resulted in significant decreases in tumor growth. SPH3643 was able to particularly strongly inhibit glioblastoma (U87-MG) cell growth in the brains of orthotopic carcinoma xenograft mice due to its high degree of intracerebral penetration and significant persistence in this setting. Together these results revealed that SPH3643 is a potent, orally active small-molecule inhibitor of CDK4/6 with robust anticancer efficacy and a high degree of blood-brain barrier permeability.","['Liao, XueMei', 'Hong, Yuan', 'Mao, Yu', 'Chen, Na', 'Wang, Qian', 'Wang, Zhe', 'Zhang, LeDuo', 'Wang, Li', 'Shi, Chen', 'Shi, WeiJun', 'Ge, Hui', 'Li, AnDi', 'Li, Xin', 'Xia, GuangXin', 'Liu, YanJun']","['Liao X', 'Hong Y', 'Mao Y', 'Chen N', 'Wang Q', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang L', 'Wang L', 'Shi C', 'Shi W', 'Ge H', 'Li A', 'Li X', 'Xia G', 'Liu Y']","['Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Pharma Biotherapeutics USA Inc., San Diego, California.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.', 'Central Research Institute, Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200324,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14367 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 May;111(5):1761-1773. doi: 10.1111/cas.14367.

The prognosis and best therapy for these patients is controversial. We evaluated 158 newly diagnosed adults with this genotype who achieved histological complete remission within two cycles of induction therapy and were assigned to two post-remission strategies with and without an allotransplant. Targeted regional sequencing at diagnosis was performed and data were used to estimate their prognosis, including relapse and survival. In multivariable analyses, having wild-type or mono-allelic mutated CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) [hazard ratio (HR) 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-5.30; P = 0.032), mutated NRAS (HR 2.67, 95% CI 1.36-5.25; P = 0.004), mutated colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) (HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.12-7.27; P = 0.028) and a positive measurable residual disease (MRD)-test after the second consolidation cycle (HR 2.88, 95% CI 1.32-6.30; P = 0.008) were independently correlated with higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). These variables were also significantly associated with worse survival (HR 3.02, 95% CI 1.17-7.78, P = 0.022; HR 3.62, 95% CI 1.51-8.68, P = 0.004; HR 3.14, 95% CI 1.06-9.31, P = 0.039; HR 4.03, 95% CI 1.64-9.89, P = 0.002; respectively). Patients with >/=1 of these adverse-risk variables benefitted from a transplant, whereas the others did not. In conclusion, we identified variables associated with CIR and survival in patients with AML and normal cytogenetics without a NPM1 mutation or FLT3-ITD.","['Zhou, Ya-Lan', 'Wu, Li-Xin', 'Peter Gale,

However, not all resistant patients harbour these alterations. We have performed a whole-exome sequencing study to identify alternative molecular mechanisms that can drive ibrutinib resistance. Our findings include deletions on chromosomes 6q, including homozygous deletions, and 8p, which encompass key regulators of BTK, MYD88/NF-kappaB, and apoptotic signalling. Moreover, we have identified recurring mutations in ubiquitin ligases, innate immune signalling, and TLR/MYD88 pathway regulators in ibrutinib-resistant WM patients.","['Jimenez, Cristina', 'Chan, Gloria G', 'Xu, Lian', 'Tsakmaklis, Nickolas', 'Kofides, Amanda', 'Demos, Maria G', 'Chen, Jiaji', 'Liu, Xia', 'Munshi, Manit', 'Yang, Guang', 'Castillo, Jorge J', 'Wiestner, Adrian', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Treon, Steven P', 'Hunter, Zachary R']","['Jimenez C', 'Chan GG', 'Xu L', 'Tsakmaklis N', 'Kofides A', 'Demos MG', 'Chen J', 'Liu X', 'Munshi M', 'Yang G', 'Castillo JJ', 'Wiestner A', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Treon SP', 'Hunter ZR']","[""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Instituto de Investigacion Biomedica de Salamanca, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer, Salamanca, Spain.', ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200227,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (PLCG2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/genetics', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Phospholipase C gamma/genetics', 'Piperidines/*administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*genetics', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",2020/02/28 06:00,2021/01/26 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16463 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jun;189(6):1165-1170. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16463.

We analyzed prospective variables related to AKI and CKD in 422 allo-HCT recipients to establish risk factors of severe acute renal failure and CKD. Renal function and creatinine were periodically assessed from baseline till the last follow-up. Sixty-three patients (14%) developed severe AKI (AKI-3) at 100 days post transplant and 15% at 12 months. Variables associated with AKI-3 were age above 55 years [hazard ratio (HR): 2.4; p = 0.019], total body irradiation (TBI) (HR: 1.8; p = 0.044), high-risk cytomegalovirus reactivation (HR: 1.8; p = 0.041), and methotrexate as GVHD prophylaxis (HR: 2.1; p = 0.024). AKI-3 increased the mortality risk (HR: 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.9-3.4). The CKD prevalence in 161 living patients was 10.2% at the last follow-up and in most, CKD developed 1 year post HCT, independent of AKI. The CKD at 1 year post HCT was associated with increased mortality (HR: 3.54; p < 0.001). Interestingly, pretransplant CKD was associated with early mortality (HR: 5.6; p < 0.001). In fact, pre- and posttransplant CKD had independent unfavorable long-term outcomes. These pretransplant factors can potentially be targeted to improve allo-HCT outcomes.","['Gutierrez-Garcia, Gonzalo', 'Villarreal, Jesus', 'Garrote, Marta', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Blasco, Miquel',

Furthermore, several independent studies have proposed WBP5, and its association with Wilms Tumor-1 (WT1) expression, as part of a gene expression-based risk score for predicting survival and clinical outcome in patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). To date, the prognostic significance of the sole WBP5 expression and its impact on the survival outcome in AML patients remains largely understudied. In the present study, we have made use of publicly available patient expression arrays and have developed an unbiased approach to classify AML patients into low versus high WBP5 expressers and to balance them for known mutations and cytogenetic findings. Interestingly, we found that patients characterized by high WBP5 expression displayed inferior overall and event-free survival rates. Notably, gene expression profiling showed that patients with high WBP5 had elevated expression of several HOX cluster genes, such as HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA9 and HOXA10, and several of their partner proteins, such as MEIS1 and FOXC1, which have been demonstrated to be causative for AML. Taken together, our data suggest that WBP5 expression level could serve as an indicator for prognosis and survival outcome in patients with AML.","['Ward, C', 'Cauchy, P', 'Garcia, P', 'Frampton, J', 'Esteban, M A', 'Volpe, G']","['Ward C', 'Cauchy P', 'Garcia P', 'Frampton J', 'Esteban MA', 'Volpe G']","['Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of RNA, Chromatin and Human Disease, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, 79108, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, Birmingham, UK.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Laboratory of RNA, Chromatin and Human Disease, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China.', 'Guangzhou Regenerative Medicine and Health Guangdong Laboratory, Guangzhou, 510005, China.', 'Institute for Stem Cells and Regeneration, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China. giacomo@gibh.ac.cn.', 'Laboratory of RNA, Chromatin and Human Disease, Guangzhou, 510530, China. giacomo@gibh.ac.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, 510530, China. giacomo@gibh.ac.cn.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, B15 2TT, Birmingham, UK. giacomo@gibh.ac.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200226,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXC1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Transcriptome', 'Up-Regulation']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-60480-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-60480-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 26;10(1):3505. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-60480-x.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0659-0799', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1426-6809']",,,PMC7044279,,,,,,,['Sci Rep. 2020 Jul 30;10(1):13109.

Aberrantly activated tyrosine kinases (TK) are involved in leukemogenesis and are associated with poor treatment outcome. Kinase inhibitor (KI) treatment has shown promise in improving patient outcome in AML. However, inhibitor selection for patients is suboptimal.In a preclinical effort to address KI selection, we analyzed a panel of 16 AML cell lines using phosphotyrosine (pY) enrichment-based, label-free phosphoproteomics. The Integrative Inferred Kinase Activity (INKA) algorithm was used to identify hyperphosphorylated, active kinases as candidates for KI treatment, and efficacy of selected KIs was tested.Heterogeneous signaling was observed with between 241 and 2764 phosphopeptides detected per cell line. Of 4853 identified phosphopeptides with 4229 phosphosites, 4459 phosphopeptides (4430 pY) were linked to 3605 class I sites (3525 pY). INKA analysis in single cell lines successfully pinpointed driver kinases (PDGFRA, JAK2, KIT and FLT3) corresponding with activating mutations present in these cell lines. Furthermore, potential receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) drivers, undetected by standard molecular analyses, were identified in four cell lines (FGFR1 in KG-1 and KG-1a, PDGFRA in Kasumi-3, and FLT3 in MM6). These cell lines proved highly sensitive to specific KIs. Six AML cell lines without a clear RTK driver showed evidence of MAPK1/3 activation, indicative of the presence of activating upstream RAS mutations. Importantly, FLT3 phosphorylation was demonstrated in two clinical AML samples with a FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation.Our data show the potential of pY-phosphoproteomics and INKA analysis to provide insight in AML TK signaling and identify hyperactive kinases as potential targets for treatment in AML cell lines. These results warrant future investigation of clinical samples to further our understanding of TK phosphorylation in relation to clinical response in the individual patient.","['van Alphen, Carolien', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Beekhof, Robin', 'Cucchi, David G J', 'Piersma, Sander R', 'Knol, Jaco C', 'Henneman, Alex A', 'Pham, Thang V', 'van Meerloo, Johan', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Verheul, Henk M W', 'Janssen, Jeroen J W M', 'Jimenez, Connie R']","['van Alphen C', 'Cloos J', 'Beekhof R', 'Cucchi DGJ', 'Piersma SR', 'Knol JC', 'Henneman AA', 'Pham TV', 'van Meerloo J', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Verheul HMW', 'Janssen JJWM', 'Jimenez CR']","['Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, OncoProteomics Laboratory, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Department of Hematology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Department of Hematology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Pediatric Oncology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, OncoProteomics Laboratory, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Department of Hematology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Department of Pediatric Oncology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, OncoProteomics Laboratory, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, OncoProteomics Laboratory, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, OncoProteomics Laboratory, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, OncoProteomics Laboratory, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Department of Hematology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Department of Hematology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Department of Hematology, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Medical Oncology, Cancer Center; Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Amsterdam UMC, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, OncoProteomics Laboratory, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

The role of the iNKT cell subsets iNKT1, iNKT2, and iNKT17 in herpesvirus immunity remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we examined the protective role of cornea-resident iNKT cell subsets using the mouse model of ocular herpesvirus infection and disease. Wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (B6) mice and CD1d knockout (KO) mice were infected ocularly with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (strain McKrae). Cornea, spleen, and liver were harvested at 0, 2, 5, 8, and 14 days postinfection (p.i.), and the frequency and function of the three major iNKT cell subsets were analyzed and correlated with symptomatic and asymptomatic corneal herpesvirus infections. The profiles of 16 major pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in corneal lysates using Western blot and Luminex assays. Early during ocular herpesvirus infection (i.e., day 2), the gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing PLZF(lo)RORgammat(lo) (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gT) iNKT1 cell subset was the predominant iNKT cell subset in infected asymptomatic corneas. Moreover, compared to the asymptomatic corneas of HSV-1-infected WT mice, the symptomatic corneas CD1d KO mice, with iNKT cell deficiency, had increased levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and decreased levels of IL-12, IFN-gamma, and the JAK1, STAT1, NF-kappaB, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathways. Our findings suggest that IFN-gamma-producing PLZF(lo)RORgammat(lo) iNKT1 cells play a role in the protective innate immune response against symptomatic ocular herpes.IMPORTANCE We investigated the protective role of iNKT cell subsets in asymptomatic ocular herpesvirus infection. We found that early during ocular herpesvirus infection (i.e., on day 2 postinfection), IFN-gamma-producing PLZF(lo)RORgammat(lo) iNKT1 cells were the predominant iNKT cell subset in infected corneas of asymptomatic B6 mice (with little to no corneal herpetic disease), compared to corneas of symptomatic mice (with severe corneal herpetic disease). Moreover, compared to asymptomatic corneas of wild-type (WT) B6 mice, the symptomatic corneas of CD1d KO mice, which lack iNKT cells, showed (i) decreases in the levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12, (ii) an increase in the level of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6; and (iii) downregulation of the JAK1, STAT1, NF-kappaB, and ERK1/2 pathways. The findings suggest that early during ocular herpesvirus infection, cornea-resident IFN-gamma-producing PLZF(lo)RORgammat(lo) iNKT1 cells provide protection from symptomatic ocular herpes.","['Dhanushkodi, Nisha R', 'Srivastava, Ruchi', 'Prakash, Swayam', 'Roy, Soumyabrata', 'Coulon, Pierre-Gregoire A', 'Vahed, Hawa', 'Nguyen, Angela M', 'Salazar, Stephanie', 'Nguyen, Lan', 'Amezquita, Cassandra', 'Ye, Caitlin', 'Nguyen, Vivianna', 'BenMohamed, Lbachir']","['Dhanushkodi NR', 'Srivastava R', 'Prakash S', 'Roy S', 'Coulon PA', 'Vahed H', 'Nguyen AM', 'Salazar S', 'Nguyen L', 'Amezquita C', 'Ye C', 'Nguyen V', 'BenMohamed L']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Gavin Herbert Eye Institute, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA Lbenmoha@uci.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.', 'Institute for Immunology, University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine, Irvine, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200416,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cytokines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cornea/virology', 'Cytokines', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Herpes Simplex/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*immunology', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Keratitis, Herpetic/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/*metabolism']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00140-20 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00140-20 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2020 Apr 16;94(9). pii: JVI.00140-20. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00140-20.

Historically, patients have been hospitalized for at least 54 hours for HD MTX. Literature supports the safety and efficacy of the transition of supportive care interventions of intravenous (IV) fluids and leucovorin to ambulatory care. The goal of this quality improvement (QI) project was to implement a system to support the safe delivery of supportive care in the home after inpatient HD MTX in children with high-risk ALL. An interdisciplinary team implemented system changes including an ambulatory supportive care protocol, standard computerized order sets, family education, and education of staff in the inpatient, outpatient, and home care setting. Measurements included laboratory results of renal function and medication clearance, length of hospitalization, and family-reported quality of life. During project implementation, 10 patients completed a total of 38 cycles. The system safely and effectively supported transition to the outpatient setting for all patients. Average length of stay was decreased by 37.8 hours per HD MTX cycle. Families reported that quality of life improved in most domains with family time and sleep having largest improvement, while level of stress remained the same. Ambulatory monitoring post-HD MTX requires a multidisciplinary approach to meet individualized patient needs. Future QI efforts should consider outpatient administration of HD MTX in addition to supportive care as a means to improved quality of life.","['Ranney, Lori', 'Hooke, Mary C', 'Robbins, Kathryn']","['Ranney L', 'Hooke MC', 'Robbins K']","[""Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", ""Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", 'University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', ""Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200226,United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Home Care Services/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', '*Quality Improvement', 'Quality of Life']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1043454220907549 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2020 May/Jun;37(3):212-220. doi: 10.1177/1043454220907549.

Regulating the expression of genes through epigenetics, especially regulation through methylation, is one of the key aspects of regulating gene expression and the function of genes, which is also regulated by the pathways regulating the pathway of apoptosis. The epigenetic regulatory phenomenon in cancer cells can undergo a change in regulation and induces resistance to apoptosis against chemotherapy and anticancer factors. The purpose of the present scrutiny was defined to probe the effect of subtoxic prednisolone dose on the level of promoter methylation and gene expression of BAX and BCL2 in the CCRF-CEM cells. METHODS: The treated cells by prednisolone, cultured in RPMI 1640 medium in standard condition. Alteration in promoter DNA methylation was analyzed by use of methylation specific-PCR (MSP) technique after the defined intervened time of Prednisolone treatment with a subtoxic dose. RESULTS: Prednisolone can induce apoptosis via alteration in BAX and BCL2 genes, based on our previous scrutiny. This essay shows no varies in the Pattern of DNA methylation of examined genes; however, prednisolone changes the expression of examined genes. CONCLUSION: Lack of alteration through prednisolone treatment in DNA methylation template of BAX and BCL2 genes make this possible that Prednisolone affects apoptotic gene expression via different pathways, which need more research to be done about it.<br />.","['Ganbarjeddi, Saiedeh', 'Azimi, Ako', 'Zadi Heydarabad, Milad', 'Hemmatzadeh, Maryam', 'Mohammadi, Shahin', 'Mousavi Ardehaie, Reza', 'Zamani, Majid', 'Baharaghdam, Sina', 'Esmaeili, Sajjad', 'Ghasemi, Amin']","['Ganbarjeddi S', 'Azimi A', 'Zadi Heydarabad M', 'Hemmatzadeh M', 'Mohammadi S', 'Mousavi Ardehaie R', 'Zamani M', 'Baharaghdam S', 'Esmaeili S', 'Ghasemi A']","['School of Medicine, Karazin Kharkiv National University, Kharkiv, Ukraine.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Medicinal Plants Research Center, Yasuj University of Medical sciences, Yasuj, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Student Research Committee, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*drug effects/genetics']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.2.523 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Feb 1;21(2):523-529. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.2.523.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-0962-818X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9460-9615']",,,PMC7332151,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Methylation Specific PCR (MSP)', 'Prednisolone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study is to investigate the association of GSTP1, GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML). METHODS: A total of 200 CML patients and 100 controls were enrolled in a case-control study with GSTM1 and GSTT1 analysis with PCR and GSTP1 analysis with PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: The GSTT1 null genotype was significantly higher among CML patients suggesting that this genotype is associated with an increased risk of CML. It was found in 42% of cases as compared with 21% of the controls, (OR =2.78, 95% CI: 1.59 - 4.85; p-value =0.000). The presence of the GSTT1 genotype may thus be considered a protective factor for CML. The frequency of individuals carrying GSTM1 null genotype was slightly higher in the control group but this difference was not statistically significant. The GSTM1 null genotype was present in 35% of control cases and 34% of the CML patients, (OR=0.975, 95%CI: 0.58-1.58;p-value=0.863). Individuals with a combined GSTM1 null/GSTT1null genotype had an estimated 2.85-fold increased risk of CML, but no associated risk between GSTP1 Ile 105 Val polymorphism and CML was found (OR=1.99, 95% CI: 0.40 - 9.32; p-value = 0.417). CONCLUSIONS: No association between GSTP1 and GSTM1 with susceptibility to CML was found. GSTT1 genotype may be a protective factor for CML, while the null genotype shows association with developing CML.<br />.","['Idris, Hadeil Me', 'Elderdery, Abozer Y', 'Khalil, Hiba B', 'Mills, Jeremy']","['Idris HM', 'Elderdery AY', 'Khalil HB', 'Mills J']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al Neelain University, Sudan.', 'Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Shaqra University, Saudi Arabia.', 'Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Jouf University, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Al Neelain University, Sudan.', 'School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200201,Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Protective Factors', 'Risk Factors']",2020/02/28 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.2.499 [doi]'],epublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2020 Feb 1;21(2):499-503. doi: 10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.2.499.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6219-5312'],,,PMC7332153,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'GSTM1', 'GSTP1', 'GSTT1', 'polymorphisms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although temporary downregulation of MYC is essential at specific points, basal levels of expression are maintained, and its protein levels are not completely silenced until the B cell becomes fully differentiated into a plasma cell or a memory B cell. MYC has been described as a proto-oncogene that is closely involved in many cancers, including leukemia and lymphoma. Aberrant expression of MYC protein in these hematological malignancies results in an uncontrolled rate of proliferation and, thereby, a blockade of the differentiation process. MYC is not activated by mutations in the coding sequence, and, as reviewed here, its overexpression in leukemia and lymphoma is mainly caused by gene amplification, chromosomal translocations, and aberrant regulation of its transcription. This review provides a thorough overview of the role of MYC in the developmental steps of B cells, and of how it performs its essential function in an oncogenic context, highlighting the importance of appropriate MYC regulation circuitry.","['de Barrios, Oriol', 'Meler, Ainara', 'Parra, Maribel']","['de Barrios O', 'Meler A', 'Parra M']","['Lymphocyte Development and Disease Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, IJC Building, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Ctra de Can Ruti, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Disease Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, IJC Building, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Ctra de Can Ruti, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Lymphocyte Development and Disease Group, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, IJC Building, Campus ICO-Germans Trias i Pujol, Ctra de Can Ruti, 08916 Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200224,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Child', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/28 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9020523 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9020523 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Feb 24;9(2). pii: cells9020523. doi: 10.3390/cells9020523.,,,,PMC7072781,,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell development', '*MYC', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These markers can be attractive due to the minimally invasive nature of their acquisition through a blood draw (i.e., liquid biopsy), negating the need for painful bone marrow biopsies. CPCs or CLCs can be used for cellular/molecular analyses as well, such as immunophenotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). FISH, which is typically carried out on slides involving complex workflows, becomes problematic when operating on CLCs or CPCs due to their relatively modest numbers. Here, we present a microfluidic device for characterizing CPCs and CLCs using immunofluorescence or FISH that have been enriched from peripheral blood using a different microfluidic device. The microfluidic possessed an array of cross-channels (2-4 microm in depth and width) that interconnected a series of input and output fluidic channels. Placing a cover plate over the device formed microtraps, the size of which was defined by the width and depth of the cross-channels. This microfluidic chip allowed for automation of immunofluorescence and FISH, requiring the use of small volumes of reagents, such as antibodies and probes, as compared to slide-based immunophenotyping and FISH. In addition, the device could secure FISH results in <4 h compared to 2-3 days for conventional FISH.","['M Weerakoon-Ratnayake, Kumuditha', 'Vaidyanathan, Swarnagowri', 'Larky, Nicholas', 'Dathathreya, Kavya', 'Hu, Mengjia', 'Jose, Jilsha', 'Mog, Shalee', 'August, Keith', 'K Godwin, Andrew', 'L Hupert, Mateusz', 'A Witek, Malgorzata', 'A Soper, Steven']","['M Weerakoon-Ratnayake K', 'Vaidyanathan S', 'Larky N', 'Dathathreya K', 'Hu M', 'Jose J', 'Mog S', 'August K', 'K Godwin A', 'L Hupert M', 'A Witek M', 'A Soper S']","['Department of Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Bioengineering, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', ""Children's Mercy Hospital, Kansas City, MO 64108, USA."", 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Biofluidica Inc., BioFluidica Research Laboratory, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.', 'Center of BioModular Multiscale Systems for Precision Medicine, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.', 'Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', 'Biofluidica Inc., BioFluidica Research Laboratory, Lawrence, KS 66047, USA.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200224,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blood Donors', 'Cell Line', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*instrumentation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*instrumentation/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*instrumentation/methods', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Liquid Biopsy', 'Microfluidics/*instrumentation/methods', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*instrumentation/methods', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology']",2020/02/28 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9020519 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9020519 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Feb 24;9(2). pii: cells9020519. doi: 10.3390/cells9020519.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-6839-4515', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0397-5543', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3987-9580']","['R33 CA235597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA168524/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM130423/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P41 EB020594/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 CA224848/NH/NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA235597/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7072755,,['NOTNLM'],"['*circulating leukemia cells', '*circulating plasma cells', '*fish', '*immunophenotyping', '*liquid biopsy', '*microfluidics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of anticancer chemotherapy with a chemosensitizer of P-gp inhibitor is promising to overcome MDR, generate synergistic effects, and maximize the treatment effect. Herein, we co-encapsulated a chemotherapeutic drug of mitoxantrone (MTO) and a P-gp inhibitor of beta-elemene (betaE) in solid lipid nanoparticles (MTO/betaE-SLNs) for reversing MDR in leukemia. The MTO/betaE-SLNs with about 120 nm particle size possessed good colloidal stability and sustained release behavior. For the cellular uptake study, doxorubicin (DOX) was used as a fluorescence probe to construct SLNs. The results revealed that MTO/betaE-SLNs could be effectively internalized by both K562/DOX and K562 cells through the pathway of caveolate-mediated endocytosis. Under the optimized combination ratio of MTO and betaE, the in vitro cytotoxicity study indicated that MTO/betaE-SLNs showed a better antitumor efficacy in both K562/DOX and K562 cells than other MTO formulations. The enhanced cytotoxicity of MTO/betaE-SLNs was due to the increased cellular uptake and blockage of intracellular ATP production and P-gp efflux by betaE. More importantly, the in vivo studies revealed that MTO/betaE-SLNs could significantly prolong the circulation time and increase plasma half-life of both MTO and betaE, accumulate into tumor and exhibit a much higher anti-leukemia effect with MDR than other MTO formulations.

So, in this work, to enhance chitosan biological activities, a new synthesis of a series of Schiff base and its metals complexes (Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II)) of chitosan (CS) was prepared. Moreover, their physicochemical properties were characterized by IR, UV-Vis, SEM, melting point, thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), elemental analysis and (1)H NMR techniques. Elemental analysis data confirmed the formation of chitosan-Schiff base as well as the coordination reaction with metals ions by increasing the carbon content caused by substitution. By elemental analysis, the degrees of acetylation (DA), deacetylation (DD) and substitution (DS) were acquired 23, 77.63 and 57.90%, respectively. Additionally, the (1)H NMR spectroscopy was used for the determination of degree of deacetylation (DD) and Substitution (DS) of chitosan ranging from 87.5 and 85%, respectively. The presence of a new low-field signal at 10.23 ppm in the (1)H NMR spectra confirmed the imine proton of Schiff base. The cytotoxicity of Chitosan, Chitosan-Schiff base and its metals complexes was tested against K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and MG-63 (osteosarcoma cancer) cell lines by the MTT assay. The results suggested that the anticancer activity of Schiff base and their complexes was much better than that of pure CS against cancer MG63 cell line. Finally, through flow cytometry, we demonstrated that all compounds were efficient in inducing apoptosis effect in K562 and MG63 cell lines except Schiff base- chitosan in K562 cell lines.","['Malekshah, Rahime Eshaghi', 'Shakeri, Farideh', 'Khaleghian, Ali', 'Salehi, Mehdi']","['Malekshah RE', 'Shakeri F', 'Khaleghian A', 'Salehi M']","['Department of Chemistry, Semnan University, Semnan, Iran.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.

Employing a combination of proteomic and genetic approaches, we find that TIFAB regulates ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15) ubiquitin hydrolase activity. Expression of TIFAB in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) permits USP15 signaling to substrates, including MDM2 and KEAP1, and mitigates p53 expression. Consequently, TIFAB-deficient HSPCs exhibit compromised USP15 signaling and are sensitized to hematopoietic stress by derepression of p53. In MLL-AF9 leukemia, deletion of TIFAB increases p53 signaling and correspondingly decreases leukemic cell function and development of leukemia. Restoring USP15 expression partially rescues the function of TIFAB-deficient MLL-AF9 cells. Conversely, elevated TIFAB represses p53, increases leukemic progenitor function, and correlates with MLL gene expression programs in leukemia patients. Our studies uncover a function of TIFAB as an effector of USP15 activity and rheostat of p53 signaling in stressed and malignant HSPCs.","['Niederkorn, Madeline', 'Hueneman, Kathleen', 'Choi, Kwangmin', 'Varney, Melinda E', 'Romano, Laurel', 'Pujato, Mario A', 'Greis, Kenneth D', 'Inoue, Jun-Ichiro', 'Meetei, Ruhikanta', 'Starczynowski, Daniel T']","['Niederkorn M', 'Hueneman K', 'Choi K', 'Varney ME', 'Romano L', 'Pujato MA', 'Greis KD', 'Inoue JI', 'Meetei R', 'Starczynowski DT']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Department of Pharmaceutical Science and Research, Marshall University, Huntington, WV 25701, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Center for Autoimmune Genetics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, 45229, USA."", 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.', 'Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, The Institute of Medical Science, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA; Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA; Department of Pediatrics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA.

METHODS: Patients with CBF AML who underwent HSCT in complete remission (first or second) from January 2007 through December 2018 were included in this analysis. RESULTS: MRD by polymerase chain reaction at HSCT was assessed in 50 of 76 patients, and 44 (88%) had evidence of MRD (MRDpos). MRDpos patients had 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates of 69.3% and 66.3%, respectively. Six MRD-negative patients had 3-year OS and LFS rates of 100% and 100%, respectively. Thirty-five of the 70 evaluable patients (50%) had a day +100 MRD assessment by RT-PCR, and 14 (40%) were MRDpos. The presence of MRD by RT-PCR on day +100 was not associated with lower estimates of LFS (75% vs 82.2%; P = .3) but was associated with a higher relapse incidence, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (27.6% vs 9.7%; P = .2). CONCLUSIONS: Durable complete remissions can be achieved in patients with CBF AML with HSCT even if they are MRDpos by RT-PCR at HSCT. The clinical impact of frequent MRD monitoring for identifying a group at high risk for early relapse and then for determining the best time point for therapeutic interventions to prevent impending relapse warrants investigation in prospectively designed clinical trials.","['Yalniz, Fevzi F', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Marin, David', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Alousi, Amin M', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Rezvani, Katy', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Oran, Betul']","['Yalniz FF', 'Patel KP', 'Bashir Q', 'Marin D', 'Ahmed S', 'Alousi AM', 'Chen J', 'Ciurea SO', 'Rezvani K', 'Popat UR', 'Shpall EJ', 'Champlin RE', 'Oran B']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200226,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (MYH11 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/genetics', 'Core Binding Factors/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2020/02/27 06:00,2021/01/15 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32769 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2020 May 15;126(10):2183-2192. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32769.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) children were the population from which 26 children were enrolled in the study. They were aged between 3 and 6 years old and were randomly referred according to the intervention into two groups, Aloe-vera (AV) and sodium bicarbonate 5% (13 each). Spongeous sticks were used to help in applying the material on tongue, labial and buccal mucosa, lips, floor of the mouth, and hard palate. Two blinded external examiners evaluated oral mucosa weekly for up to 2 months using the World Health Organization grading scale. Mann-Whitney U test was used to analyze data. According to the observed findings, CIOM degrees were less severe in the aloe-vera group than in the sodium bicarbonate group. Statistically significant difference of occurrence of different CIOM degrees between groups was recorded in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th weeks of follow-up period. Moreover, Mann-Whitney U test indicated that patients in the sodium bicarbonate group began CIOM sooner than those in the aloe-vera group with a statistically significant difference (p = .001). These findings show that topical application of aloe-vera solution is effective in the prevention of CIOM in ALL children.","['Alkhouli, Muaaz', 'Laflouf, Mohannad', 'Alhaddad, Mazen']","['Alkhouli M', 'Laflouf M', 'Alhaddad M']","['Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.', 'Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Damascus University, Damascus, Syria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20200226,England,Compr Child Adolesc Nurs,Comprehensive child and adolescent nursing,101682864,"['0 (Aloe vera gel)', '0 (Plant Preparations)']",,"['Aloe', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy/methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Plant Preparations/*standards/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Stomatitis/epidemiology/*prevention & control']",2020/02/27 06:00,2021/09/02 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/24694193.2020.1727065 [doi]'],ppublish,Compr Child Adolesc Nurs. 2021 Mar;44(1):49-62. doi: 10.1080/24694193.2020.1727065.

Human Kruppel-like factor 3 (hKLF3), a newly cloned human transcription factor, has proved to be a regulator of hematopoiesis. METHODS: Sanger sequencing was performed in bone marrow (BM) samples from 17 AL patients for mutations in hKLF3 coding exons. hKLF3 expression in peripheral blood (PB) and BM samples from 45 AL patients was dynamically detected by RT-qPCR. PB samples from 31 healthy donors were tested as normal controls. RESULTS: No mutation was sequenced in hKLF3 coding exons. hKLF3 expression in PB of AL was significantly lower than that in healthy donors [0.30 (0.02-1.07) vs 1.18 (0.62-3.37), P < .0001]. Primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibited the least expression values compared with secondary AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses suggested that hKLF3 expression in PB was a good marker for AML diagnosis with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) and an optimum cutoff value of 0.67 (sensitivity 93.94% and specificity 93.55%). hKLF3 expression was upregulated significantly when AML patients acquired morphological complete remission (CR), and the level of hKLF3 seemed to be higher in patients with deeper CR than in patients with minimal residual disease (MRD).

In details, PDT-PAO-F16 mainly accumulated into mitochondria within hours and suppressed the activity of PDHC resulting in the inhibition of ATP synthesis and thermogenesis disorder. Moreover, the suppression of respiratory chain complex I and IV accelerated the mitochondrial dysfunction leading to caspase family-dependent apoptosis. In vivo, the acute promyelocytic leukemia was greatly alleviated in the PDT-PAO-F16 treated group in APL mice model. Our results demonstrated the organic arsenical precursor with fluorescence imaging and target-anticancer efficacy is a promising anticancer drug.","['Liu, Yu-Jiao', 'Fan, Xiao-Yang', 'Zhang, Dong-Dong', 'Xia, Yin-Zheng', 'Hu, Yan-Jun', 'Jiang, Feng-Lei', 'Zhou, Fu-Ling', 'Liu, Yi']","['Liu YJ', 'Fan XY', 'Zhang DD', 'Xia YZ', 'Hu YJ', 'Jiang FL', 'Zhou FL', 'Liu Y']","['Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Nanning Normal University, Nanning, 530001, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430071, China.', 'Department of Chemistry, Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430072, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Nanning Normal University, Nanning, 530001, China.', 'School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430081, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200226,Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electron Transport/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2020/02/27 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cmdc.201900686 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2020 Mar 18;15(6):552-558. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201900686.

Wnt signaling cascade regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell death processes. Thus, any alteration of the Wnt signaling pathway protein cascade might develop into various types of cancers, either by upregulation or downregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway protein components. In addition, it is reported that activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is associated with the transcriptional activation of microRNAs (miRNAs) by binding to its promoter region, suggesting feedback regulation. Considering the protein regulatory functions of various miRNAs, they can be approached therapeutically as modulatory targets for protein components of the Wnt signaling pathway. In this article, we have discussed the potential role of miRNAs in the regulation of Wnt signaling pathway proteins related to the pathogenesis of CLL via crosstalk between miRNAs and Wnt signaling pathway proteins. This might provide a clear insight into the Wnt protein regulatory function of various miRNAs and provide a better understanding of developing advanced and promising therapeutic approaches against CLL.","['Bhattacharya, Manojit', 'Sharma, Ashish Ranjan', 'Sharma, Garima', 'Patra, Bidhan Chandra', 'Lee, Sang-Soo', 'Chakraborty, Chiranjib']","['Bhattacharya M', 'Sharma AR', 'Sharma G', 'Patra BC', 'Lee SS', 'Chakraborty C']","['Institute for Skeletal Aging & Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University Hospital-College of Medicine, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Zoology, Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, West Bengal, India.', 'Institute for Skeletal Aging & Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University Hospital-College of Medicine, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Institute for Skeletal Aging & Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University Hospital-College of Medicine, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Zoology, Vidyasagar University, Midnapore, West Bengal, India.', 'Institute for Skeletal Aging & Orthopedic Surgery, Hallym University Hospital-College of Medicine, Chuncheon-si, Gangwon-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biotechnology, School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Adamas University, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200226,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']",2020/02/27 06:00,2021/08/04 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29683 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Nov;121(11):4654-4666. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29683.

HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVE: Histology-guided mass spectrometry (HGMS) is a suitable method for the differentiation of LPE from SCL in cats. ANIMALS: Forty-one cats with LPE and 52 cats with SCL. METHODS: This is a retrospective clinicopathologic study. Duodenal tissue samples of 17 cats with LPE and 22 cats with SCL were subjected to HGMS, and the acquired data were used to develop a linear discriminate analysis (LDA) machine learning algorithm. The algorithm was subsequently validated using a separate set of 24 cats with LPE and 30 cats with SCL. Cases were classified as LPE or SCL based on a consensus by an expert panel consisting of 5-7 board-certified veterinary specialists. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and clonality testing were available for all cats. The panel consensus classification served as a reference for the calculation of test performance parameters. RESULTS: Relative sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of HGMS were 86.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74.5%-98.8%), 91.7% (95% CI: 80.6%-100%), and 88.9% (95% CI: 80.5%-97.3%), respectively. Comparatively, the clonality testing had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85.7% (95% CI: 72.8%-98.7%), 33.3% (95% CI: 14.5%-52.2%), and 61.5% (95% CI: 48.3%-74.8%) relative to the panel decision. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Histology-guided mass spectrometry was a reliable technique for the differentiation of LPE from SCL in duodenal formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of cats and might have advantages over tests currently considered state of the art.","['Marsilio, Sina', 'Newman, Shelley J', 'Estep, James Scot', 'Giaretta, Paula R', 'Lidbury, Jonathan A', 'Warry, Emma', 'Flory, Andi', 'Morley, Paul S', 'Smoot, Katy', 'Seeley, Erin H', 'Powell, Matthew J', 'Suchodolski, Jan S', 'Steiner, Jorg M']","['Marsilio S', 'Newman SJ', 'Estep JS', 'Giaretta PR', 'Lidbury JA', 'Warry E', 'Flory A', 'Morley PS', 'Smoot K', 'Seeley EH', 'Powell MJ', 'Suchodolski JS', 'Steiner JM']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine and Epidemiology, UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, Davis, California.', 'Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Long Island University CVM, Brookville, New York.', 'Texas Veterinary Pathology, LLC, San Antonio, Texas.', 'Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Veterinary Specialty Hospital, San Diego, California.', 'Veterinary Education, Research, and Outreach Center, Texas A&M University, Canyon, Texas.', 'New River VDL, LLC, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'New River VDL, LLC, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'New River VDL, LLC, Morgantown, West Virginia, USA.', 'Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Gastrointestinal Laboratory, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200226,United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/*pathology', 'Cats', 'Enteropathy-Associated T-Cell Lymphoma/pathology/*veterinary', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology/*veterinary', 'Mass Spectrometry/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2020/02/27 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jvim.15742 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 2020 Mar;34(2):669-677. doi: 10.1111/jvim.15742.

There are still demands for a user-friendly approach to achieve high cell extraction efficiency and purity of a target immune cell subtype for more promising diagnosis and monitoring. For selective immune cell isolation, we developed a microstructured device, which consists of antibody-coated micropillars and micro-sieve arrays, for isolating a target immune cell subtype from bovine blood samples. The focusing micropillars can guide immune cells flowing to the subsequent micro-sieves based on deterministic lateral shifts of the cells. The arrangement of these microstructures is characterized and configured for the maximal cell capture rate. Surface modification with a selected antibody offers selective cell capture in the micro-sieves based on the antigen-antibody reaction. We prepare a cell mixture of human CD14-expressing leukemia cells (THP-1) and epithelial cells (MDA-MB-231) in diluted blood to characterize the cell isolation operation, with a selective cell isolation yield of >80%, cell purity of approximately 100% and cell viability of >93%.

METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated and described the patient profile, clinical manifestations, isolated species, treatment and outcome of patients with hematological malignancies diagnosed with these rare IFIs during 15 years in a large single hemato-oncology center. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients with hematological malignancies treated in our center had at least one positive culture or molecular identification of a rare fungus. Ninety-three isolates were considered the etiological agents of the infection. The most common underlying hematological malignancy was acute myeloid leukemia, 36 patients (41.4%). Eighty patients (91%) received chemotherapy less than 30 days prior to IFI diagnosis. The most frequent site of infection was the respiratory tract: 34 patients (39%) had pulmonary and 19 patients (22%) had a sinusal or nasopharyngeal infections. Disseminated infection, defined as positive blood cultures or parallel infection in multiple organ systems, was documented in 20 patients (23%). The most common fungal species were Fusarium (35%) and Zygomycetes (25%). Coinfection with more than one fungus was noted in 20 patients (23%). Forty-seven of 87 patients (54%) in this study died within 90 days of IFI diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Rare IFIs in patients with hematological malignancy become increasingly frequent. Early identification with traditional and molecular methods is important in management of these patients.","['Hardak, Emilia', 'Fuchs, Eyal', 'Geffen, Yuval', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Oren, Ilana']","['Hardak E', 'Fuchs E', 'Geffen Y', 'Zuckerman T', 'Oren I']","['Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Rambam Health Care Campus, P.O.

Recently, a combination of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) with Toll-like receptor agonists (TLR-P) was proposed as a new standard to generate superior cytokine-producing DCs with high migratory capacity. Here, we compare TLR-P DCs with conventional DCs matured only with the proinflammatory cytokines TNFalpha and IL-1ss (CDCs), focussing on the interaction of resulting DCs with CD8(+) T-cells. TLR-P matured DCs showed elevated expression of activation markers such as CD80 and CD83 compared to CDCs, together with a significantly higher migration capacity. Secretion of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 was highest after 16 h in TLR-P DCs, and only TLR-P DCs secreted active IL-12p70. TLR-P DCs as well as CDCs successfully primed multifunctional CD8(+) T-cells from naive precursors specific for the peptide antigens Melan-A, NLGN4X, and PTP with comparable priming efficacy and T-cell receptor avidity. CD8(+) T-cells primed by TLR-P DCs showed significantly elevated expression of the integrin VLA-4 and a trend for higher T-cell numbers after expansion. In contrast, TLR-P DCs displayed a substantially reduced capability to cross-present CMVpp65 protein antigen to pp65-specific T cells, an effect that was dose-dependent on PGE2 during DC maturation and reproducible with several responder T-cell lines. In conclusion, TLR-P matured DCs might be optimal presenters of antigens not requiring processing such as short peptides. However, PGE2 seems less favorable for maturation of DCs intended to process and cross-present more complex vaccine antigens such as lysates, proteins or long peptides.","['Gierlich, Philipp', 'Lex, Veronika', 'Technau, Antje', 'Keupp, Anne', 'Morper, Lorenz', 'Glunz, Amelie', 'Sennholz, Hanno', 'Rachor, Johannes', 'Sauer, Sascha', 'Marcu, Ana', 'Grigoleit, Gotz Ulrich', 'Wolfl, Matthias', 'Schlegel, Paul G', 'Eyrich, Matthias']","['Gierlich P', 'Lex V', 'Technau A', 'Keupp A', 'Morper L', 'Glunz A', 'Sennholz H', 'Rachor J', 'Sauer S', 'Marcu A', 'Grigoleit GU', 'Wolfl M', 'Schlegel PG', 'Eyrich M']","[""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", 'CU Systems Medicine, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine (BIMSB/BIH), Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Interfaculty Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Medical Center, Wurzburg, Germany.', ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany."", ""Laboratory for Stem Cell Processing and Cellular TherapyUniversity Medical Center, Children's Hospital, Wurzburg, Germany. eyrich_m@ukw.de."", ""University Children's Hospital Wurzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 3, Building D30, 97080, Wurzburg, Germany. eyrich_m@ukw.de.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200225,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Toll-Like Receptor 3)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Antigen Presentation/*drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cross-Priming', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Toll-Like Receptor 3/*immunology']",2020/02/27 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-019-02470-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-019-02470-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2020 Jun;69(6):1029-1042. doi: 10.1007/s00262-019-02470-1.

Combined treatment with intensive chemotherapy and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), a monoclonal anti-CD33 antibody conjugated with calicheamicin, is useful as reinduction therapy in refractory/relapsed AML. Here, we describe three cases of pediatric refractory/relapsed AML that were successfully managed with FLAG-IDA (fludarabine, cytarabine, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and idarubicin), with or without GO, as reinduction therapy before a KIR-ligand-mismatched cord blood transplant. This strategy relies on the fact that killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on cord blood natural killer (NK) cells recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles, and that donor KIR-ligand incompatibility may be associated with lower incidence of relapse and improved survival in AML, as cells that lack these inhibitory HLA ligands can activate NK cells. All three patients are currently alive and have been disease-free for 24-65 months, although one patient developed severe sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS). Thus, our strategy can result in excellent outcomes in pediatric patients with refractory/relapsed AML.","['Toyama, Daisuke', 'Matsuno, Ryosuke', 'Sugishita, Yumiko', 'Kaneko, Ryota', 'Okamoto, Naoko', 'Koganesawa, Masaya', 'Fujita, Sachio', 'Akiyama, Kosuke', 'Isoyama, Keiichi', 'Yamamoto, Shohei']","['Toyama D', 'Matsuno R', 'Sugishita Y', 'Kaneko R', 'Okamoto N', 'Koganesawa M', 'Fujita S', 'Akiyama K', 'Isoyama K', 'Yamamoto S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200212,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/27 06:01,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/1378056 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2020 Feb 12;2020:1378056. doi: 10.1155/2020/1378056. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8158-6338', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1582-7062']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Daisuke Toyama et al.'],PMC7037524,,,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SET domain, bifurcated 2 (SETDB2) can mediate gene silencing by trimethylation of the ninth lysine residue of histone H3 protein (H3K9) of the promoter and has been confirmed as an oncogene in many cancers. The role of SETDB2 in AML1-ETO positive AML is not clear. Methods: Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed to measure SETDB2 expression in bone marrow from AML patients and healthy people. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to investigate the effect of SETDB2 on prognosis of AML patients. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to investigate the regulatory mechanism of AML1-ETO on SETDB2. CCK-8 and colony formation assay were performed to measure the effect of SETDB2 on leukemic cells. Results: SETDB2 is highly expressed in AML1-ETO positive AML. The overall survival, event-free and relapse-free survival rate of patients with high SETDB2 expression was lower than those of patients with low SETDB2 expression. SETDB2 is epigenetically upregulated by AML1-ETO fusion protein. Downregulation of SETDB2 expression significantly inhibits the proliferation and clonality of leukemic cells and promotes the sensitivity of leukemic cells to an epigenetic inhibitor JQ1. Conclusion: AML1-ETO/SETDB2 is a novel epigenetic pathway of leukemogenesis and SETDB2 is a potential therapeutic target of t(8;21) AML.","['Mu, Guangfu', 'Chen, Fangping']","['Mu G', 'Chen F']","[""Department of Hematology, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan 410013, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200204,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/27 06:01,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S227036 [doi]', '227036 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Feb 4;12:783-792. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S227036. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) 2020 Mu and Chen.'],PMC7007814,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'SETDB2', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical biomarker', 'epigenetic']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ILCregs share characteristics with both innate lymphoid cells and regulatory cells; however, the significance of CD45(+)Lin(-)CD127(+)IL-10(+) ILCregs in patients with AML remains unclear. Intriguingly, ILCregs constitutively express id2, id3, sox4, tgfbr1, tgfbr2, il2rb and il2rg, but the significance of miRNAs associated with these genes has yet to be explored. In this study, we evaluate ILCreg frequency, ILCreg gene-associated miRNA quantification, and its significance in patients with AML and normal donors. Methods: Using 4 color combinations of surface and intracellular antibody staining, the CD45(+)Lin(-)CD127(+)IL-10(+) ILCregs from 12 normal donors and 42 patients newly diagnosed with AML were measured by flow cytometry. Plasma samples and bone marrow cells from 6 normal donors and 9 patients with AML were studied by next-generation sequence miRNAs quantification. Results: Our results showed that the frequency of ILCregs was 0.8924+/-1.3791% in bone marrow (BM) cells from normal donors and 0.2434+/-0.5344% in BM cells from AML patients. The frequency of ILCreg cells in AML patients was significantly lower than that in normal donors (P<0.01). Furthermore, the frequency of the CD45(+)Lin(-)CD127(+)IL-10(-) subset was 4.0869+/-6.7701% and 0.2769+/-0.2526% from normal donors and AML patients, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference of CD45(+)Lin(-)CD127(+)IL-10(-) cells between normal donors and AML patients (p<0.01). miRNA detection results showed 376 miRNAs from plasma and 182 miRNAs from BM cell samples with expression levels with a statistically significant difference between AML patients and normal donors (both Q and P-value < 0.001). Analysis of miRNAs from ILCregs associated genes including id2, id3, sox4, tgfbr1, tgfbr2, il2rb, and il3rg, from normal donors and AML patients demonstrated 34 miRNA from plasma samples and 14 miRNA segments from BM cell samples with a statistically significant difference between AML patients and normal donors (both Q and P-value <0.001). Among them, 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-193b-3p, hsa-miR-1270, hsa-miR-210-3p, and hsa-miR-486-3p) were detected in both plasma and BM cell samples. Conclusion: Our study enumerated ILCregs, then measured miRNAs from those ILCregs in AML samples for the first time. The results demonstrated the deficiency of ILCreg and differential expression of miRNAs in patients with AML.","['Yu, Jifeng', 'Li, Yingmei', 'Pan, Yue', 'Liu, Yu', 'Xing, Haizhou', 'Xie, Xinsheng', 'Wan, Dingming', 'Jiang, Zhongxing']","['Yu J', 'Li Y', 'Pan Y', 'Liu Y', 'Xing H', 'Xie X', 'Wan D', 'Jiang Z']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191231,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2020/02/27 06:00,2020/02/27 06:01,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S234327 [doi]', '234327 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Dec 31;11:10969-10982. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S234327. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1217-4385', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6882-117X']",,['(c) 2019 Yu et al.'],PMC6997219,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FCM', 'ILCregs', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'flow cytometry', 'miRNAs', 'next generation sequence', 'regulatory innate lymphoid cells']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventionally these junctional sequences are identified using laborious Sanger sequencing of excised heteroduplex bands. We found that the IGH is highly expressed in our diagnostic B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples using RNA-Seq. Therefore, we used RNA-Seq to identify IGH disease clone sequences in 258 childhood B-ALL samples for MRD monitoring. The amount of background IGH rearrangements uncovered by RNA-Seq followed the Zipf's law with IGH disease clones easily identified as outliers. Four hundred and ninety-seven IGH disease clones (median 2, range 0-7 clones/patient) are identified in 90.3% of patients. High hyperdiploid patients have the most IGH disease clones (median 3) while DUX4 subtype has the least (median 1) due to the rearrangements involving the IGH locus. In all, 90.8% of IGH disease clones found by Sanger sequencing are also identified by RNA-Seq. In addition, RNA-Seq identified 43% more IGH disease clones. In 69 patients lacking sensitive IGH targets, targeted NGS IGH MRD showed high correlation (R = 0.93; P = 1.3 x 10(-14)), better relapse prediction than conventional RQ-PCR MRD using non-IGH targets. In conclusion, RNA-Seq can identify patient-specific clonal IGH junctional sequences for MRD monitoring, adding to its usefulness for molecular diagnosis in childhood B-ALL.","['Li, Zhenhua', 'Jiang, Nan', 'Lim, Evelyn Huizi', 'Chin, Winnie Hui Ni', 'Lu, Yi', 'Chiew, Kean Hui', 'Kham, Shirley Kow Yin', 'Yang, Wentao', 'Quah, Thuan Chong', 'Lin, Hai Peng', 'Tan, Ah Moy', 'Ariffin, Hany', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng-Juh']","['Li Z', 'Jiang N', 'Lim EH', 'Chin WHN', 'Lu Y', 'Chiew KH', 'Kham SKY', 'Yang W', 'Quah TC', 'Lin HP', 'Tan AM', 'Ariffin H', 'Yang JJ', 'Yeoh AE']","['VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore."", 'Subang Jaya Medical Centre, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.', ""Department of Paediatrics, KK Women's & Children's Hospital, Singapore, Singapore."", 'University of Malaya Cancer Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", 'VIVA-NUS Centre for Translational Research in Acute Leukaemia, Department of Paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. allen.yeoh@nus.edu.sg.', ""Viva-University Children's Cancer Centre, Khoo Teck Puat-National University Children's Medical Institute, National University Hospital, National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore. allen.yeoh@nus.edu.sg."", 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. allen.yeoh@nus.edu.sg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200225,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods']",2020/02/27 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0774-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0774-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Sep;34(9):2418-2429. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0774-4.

In solid tumors, CD141(Hi) conventional dendritic cells (CD141(Hi) cDCs) are necessary for antitumor immunosurveillance and the response to immunotherapy. Here, we found that CD141(Hi) cDCs are reduced in MDS bone marrow and based on the premise established in solid tumors, we hypothesized that reduced numbers of CD141(Hi) cDCs are associated with inferior overall survival in MDS patients. We found that MDS patients with reduced numbers of CD141(Hi) cDCs, but not other DC populations, showed reduced overall survival. To examine the basis for reduction in CD141(Hi) cDCs, we found fewer numbers of progenitors committed to DC differentiation in the MDS bone marrow and these progenitors expressed lower levels of interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF8), a master regulator of CD141(Hi) cDC differentiation. To rescue impaired CD141(Hi) cDC differentiation, we used pharmacologic inhibition of lysine-specific demethylase 1A (LSD1) to promote CD141(Hi) cDC differentiation by MDS progenitors. These data reveal a previously unrecognized element of the MDS immunologic milieu. Epigenetic regulation of CD141(Hi) cDC differentiation offers an intriguing opportunity for intervention and a potential adjunct to immunotherapy for patients with MDS.","['Srivastava, Pragya', 'Tzetzo, Stephanie L', 'Gomez, Eduardo Cortes', 'Eng, Kevin H', 'Jani Sait, Sheila N', 'Kuechle, Joseph B', 'Singh, Prashant K', 'De Jong, Kitty', 'Wiatrowski, Kyle R', 'Peresie, Jennifer', 'Dimitroff, Ava', 'Lynch, Miranda L', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Abrams, Scott I', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Nemeth, Michael J']","['Srivastava P', 'Tzetzo SL', 'Gomez EC', 'Eng KH', 'Jani Sait SN', 'Kuechle JB', 'Singh PK', 'De Jong K', 'Wiatrowski KR', 'Peresie J', 'Dimitroff A', 'Lynch ML', 'Wang J', 'Abrams SI', 'Griffiths EA', 'Nemeth MJ']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Orthopaedics, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Center for Personalized Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Flow and Image Cytometry Shared Resource, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY, 14263, USA.

Here we report a cohort of 86 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) families with 49 harboring germline variants in 16 previously defined loci (57%). Whole exome sequencing in a further 37 uncharacterized families (43%) allowed us to rationalize 65 new candidate loci, including genes mutated in rare hematological syndromes (ADA, GP6, IL17RA, PRF1 and SEC23B), reported in prior MDS/AML or inherited bone marrow failure series (DNAH9, NAPRT1 and SH2B3) or variants at novel loci (DHX34) that appear specific to inherited forms of myeloid malignancies. Altogether, our series of MDS/AML families offer novel insights into the etiology of myeloid malignancies and provide a framework to prioritize variants for inclusion into routine diagnostics and patient management.","['Rio-Machin, Ana', 'Vulliamy, Tom', 'Hug, Nele', 'Walne, Amanda', 'Tawana, Kiran', 'Cardoso, Shirleny', 'Ellison, Alicia', 'Pontikos, Nikolas', 'Wang, Jun', 'Tummala, Hemanth',

We demonstrate a novel approach to simultaneously assess risks for multiple cancers to identify distinct multicancer configurations (multiple different cancer types that cluster in relatives) surrounding patients with familial bladder cancer. METHODS: This study takes advantage of a unique population-level data resource, the Utah Population Database (UPDB), containing vast genealogy and statewide cancer data. Familial risk is measured using standardized incidence risk (SIR) ratios that account for sex, age, birth cohort, and person-years of the pedigree members. RESULTS: We identify 1,023 families with a significantly higher bladder cancer rate than population controls (familial bladder cancer). Familial SIRs are then calculated across 25 cancer types, and a weighted Gower distance with K-medoids clustering is used to identify familial multicancer configurations (FMC). We found five FMCs, each exhibiting a different pattern of cancer aggregation. Of the 25 cancer types studied, kidney and prostate cancers were most commonly enriched in the familial bladder cancer clusters. Laryngeal, lung, stomach, acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin disease, soft-tissue carcinoma, esophageal, breast, lung, uterine, thyroid, and melanoma cancers were the other cancer types with increased incidence in familial bladder cancer families. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified five familial bladder cancer FMCs showing unique risk patterns for cancers of other organs, suggesting phenotypic heterogeneity familial bladder cancer. IMPACT: FMC configurations could permit better definitions of cancer phenotypes (subtypes or multicancer) for gene discovery and environmental risk factor studies.","['Hanson, Heidi A', 'Leiser, Claire L', ""O'Neil, Brock"", 'Martin, Christopher', 'Gupta, Sumati', 'Smith, Ken R', 'Dechet, Christopher', 'Lowrance, William T', 'Madsen, Michael J', 'Camp, Nicola J']","['Hanson HA', 'Leiser CL', ""O'Neil B"", 'Martin C', 'Gupta S', 'Smith KR', 'Dechet C', 'Lowrance WT', 'Madsen MJ', 'Camp NJ']","['Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah. heidi.hanson@hci.utah.edu.', 'Division of Urology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Urology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Division of Urology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Family and Consumer Studies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Division of Urology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Division of Urology, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Population Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, Utah.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20200225,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Data Collection/*methods', 'Data Mining/methods', 'Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Utah/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/27 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-19-0681 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0681 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2020 May;29(5):918-926. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-0681.

However, imatinib resistance develops in many patients. Therefore, new drugs with improved therapeutic effects are urgently needed. Berberine (BBR) is a potent BCR-ABL inhibitor for imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Protein structure analysis and virtual screening were used to identify BBR targets in CML. Molecular docking analysis, surface plasmon resonance imaging, nuclear magnetic resonance assays, and thermoshift assays were performed to confirm the BBR target. The change in BCR-ABL protein expression after BBR treatment was assessed by Western blotting. The effects of BBR were assessed in vitro in cell lines, in vivo in mice, and in human CML bone marrow cells as a potential strategy to overcome imatinib resistance. RESULTS: We discovered that BBR bound to the protein tyrosine kinase domain of BCR-ABL. BBR inhibited the activity of BCR-ABL and BCR-ABL with the T315I mutation, and it also degraded these proteins via the autophagic lysosome pathway by recruiting E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase LRSAM1. BBR inhibited the cell viability and colony formation of CML cells and prolonged survival in CML mouse models with imatinib sensitivity and resistance. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that BBR directly binds to and degrades BCR-ABL and BCR-ABL T315I via the autophagic lysosome pathway by recruiting LRSAM1. The use of BBR is a new strategy to improve the treatment of patients with CML with imatinib sensitivity or resistance.See related commentary by Elf, p. 3899.","['Yin, Zhao', 'Huang, Guiping', 'Gu, Chunming', 'Liu, Yanjun', 'Yang, Juhua', 'Fei, Jia']","['Yin Z', 'Huang G', 'Gu C', 'Liu Y', 'Yang J', 'Fei J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Drug Development for Small Nucleic Acids, Guangdong, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Drug Development for Small Nucleic Acids, Guangdong, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Drug Development for Small Nucleic Acids, Guangdong, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Drug Development for Small Nucleic Acids, Guangdong, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Drug Development for Small Nucleic Acids, Guangdong, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China. tfeijia@jnu.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Chinese Integrative Medicine, Medical College of Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Engineering Technology Research Center of Drug Development for Small Nucleic Acids, Guangdong, China.', 'Antisense Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Comment']",20200225,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (LRSAM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (LRSAM1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', '*Berberine/pharmacology', '*Berberis/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trees/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",2020/02/27 06:00,2021/03/12 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-2460 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2460 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Aug 1;26(15):4040-4053. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-2460.

Inhibition of autophagy in AML cells can make them more susceptible to chemotherapy. However, the influence of autophagy in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remains inconclusive. In the present study, we demonstrated that the expression of ATG5 and autophagy were elevated in MSCs derived from AML patients (AML-MSCs) compared to healthy donors (HD-MSCs). After inhibiting autophagy by 3-Methyladenine (3 MA) or silencing ATG5, the differentiation potential of AML-MSCs was decreased, the fraction of G0/G1 phase was increased while that of G2 phase was reduced, and the expression of CXCL12 was reduced in AML-MSCs. After co-culture of NB4 and THP1 with MSCs pretreated with 3 MA or ATG5 knockdown respectively, the sensitivity of AML cell lines to daunorubicin and doxorubicin was improved in a dose- and time-dependent manner compared to controls. The increased sensitivity of AML cells to genotoxic agents was related to ERK1/2 and AKT pathway. These results suggested ATG5 mediated potential differentiation capacities and cell cycle distribution of AML-MSCs, and targeting autophagy, especially ATG5 in AML-MSCs could improve the chemosensitivity of AML.","['Li, Ying', 'Jiang, Yajing', 'Cheng, Jingying', 'Ma, Jiao', 'Li, Qinghua', 'Pang, Tianxiang']","['Li Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Cheng J', 'Ma J', 'Li Q', 'Pang T']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Disease, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Disease, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Disease, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Disease, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Disease, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Disease, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

However, drug resistance development and relapse are still major challenges in CLL treatment. Several studies revealed that non-coding RNAs have a main role in the development and progression of CLL. Specifically, microRNAs (miRs) and tRNA-derived small-RNAs (tsRNAs) were shown to be outstanding biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and monitor the disease and to possibly anticipate drug resistance and relapse, thus supporting physicians in the selection of treatment regimens tailored to the patient needs.

To date, there have been no related reports on the anticancer effects of K313. In this study, we found that K313 reduced the viability of human B-cell leukemia (Nalm-6) and lymphoma (Daudi) cells in a dose-dependent manner without affecting healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and induced moderate cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Meanwhile, K313 mediated cell apoptosis, which was accompanied by the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, cells treated with K313 showed a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which may have been caused by the caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid, as detected by Western blot analysis. We also found that K313 led to the downregulation of p-p70S6K protein, which plays an important role in cell survival and cell cycle progression. In addition, treatment of these cells with K313 blocked autophagic flux, as reflected in the accumulation of LC3-II and p62 protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In conclusion, K313 decreases cell viability without affecting normal healthy PBMCs, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, reduces p-p70S6K protein levels, and mediates strong autophagy inhibition. Therefore, K313 and its derivatives could be developed as potential anticancer drugs or autophagy blockers in the future.","['Zhong, Wenying', 'Tang, Xinwen', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhou, Chunyu', 'Liu, Pan', 'Li, Enhui', 'Zhong, Peilin', 'Lv, Haoxue', 'Zou, Qiang', 'Wang, Maolin']","['Zhong W', 'Tang X', 'Liu Y', 'Zhou C', 'Liu P', 'Li E', 'Zhong P', 'Lv H', 'Zou Q', 'Wang M']","['Key Laboratory of Bio-resources and Eco-environment of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China.', 'Center of Science and Research, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610513, China.', 'Center of Science and Research, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610513, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610083, China.', 'College of Biological Science and Technology, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610500, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610083, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610083, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610083, China.', 'Center of Science and Research, Chengdu Medical College, Chengdu 610513, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bio-resources and Eco-environment of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610065, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200221,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzoxazoles)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Benzoxazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics']",2020/02/27 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules25040971 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules25040971 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2020 Feb 21;25(4). pii: molecules25040971. doi: 10.3390/molecules25040971.,,,,PMC7070478,,['NOTNLM'],"[""B-cell Burkitt's lymphoma"", 'B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'K313', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy blockage', 'cell cycle arrest', 'mitochondrial pathway']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the bone marrow compartment may only be one of several sites of disease manifestations, the strong clinical significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the bone marrow strongly suggests that privileged niches exist in this anatomical site favouring central elements of malignant transformation. Here, the co-existence of two hierarchical systems, originating from haematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells, has extensively been characterised with regard to regulation of the former (blood production) by the latter. How these two systems cooperate under pathological conditions is far less understood and is the focus of many current investigations. More recent single-cell sequencing techniques have now identified an unappreciated cellular heterogeneity of the bone marrow microenvironment. How each of these cell subtypes interact with each other and regulate normal and malignant haematopoiesis remains to be investigated. Here we review the evidences of how bone marrow stroma cells and malignant B cells reciprocally interact. Evidently from published data, these cell-cell interactions induce profound changes in signalling, gene expression and metabolic adaptations. While the past research has largely focussed on understanding changes imposed by stroma- on tumour cells, it is now clear that tumour-cell contact also has fundamental ramifications for the biology of stroma cells. Their careful characterisations are not only interesting from a scientific biological viewpoint but also relevant to clinical practice: Since tumour cells heavily depend on stroma cells for cell survival, proliferation and dissemination, interference with bone marrow stroma-tumour interactions bear therapeutic potential. The molecular characterisation of tumour-stroma interactions can identify new vulnerabilities, which could be therapeutically exploited.","['Mangolini, Maurizio', 'Ringshausen, Ingo']","['Mangolini M', 'Ringshausen I']","['Wellcome Trust/MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0AH, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust/MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 0AH, UK.', ""Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University hospital, Cambridge CB2 0AH, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200221,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Cell Communication/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology']",2020/02/27 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/27 06:00'],"['2020/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21041466 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21041466 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Feb 21;21(4). pii: ijms21041466. doi: 10.3390/ijms21041466.,,"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_17230/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/M008975/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '(CRUK; C49940/A17480)/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,PMC7073037,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'bone marrow stroma', 'lymphoma', 'mesenchymal cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 102 patients with advanced PanNETs, previously pretreated with one (67%) or several (33%) lines of chemotherapy, were included, of whom 90% had progressive disease and the majority (74.5%) had grade 2 tumors. 177Lu-DOTATATE, 7.4 GBq per cycle, was administered with 6- to 8-week intervals in 88% of patients utilizing a dosimetry-guided protocol until an absorbed dose of 23 Gy to the kidneys was reached. RESULTS: A mean dose of 32 +/- 10.9 GBq per patient was administered in 1-10 cycles starting a median of 36 months after PanNET diagnosis. The median follow-up was 34 months, the median PFS was 24 months, and the median OS was 42 months from start of PRRT. Independent risk factors for both progression and death were liver tumor burden >50%, more than one line of previous chemotherapy, and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Resection of the primary tumor was linked to longer survival. Bone marrow toxicity grade 3-4 occurred in 10.8%. One patient (1.0%) developed acute myeloid leukemia. Bone marrow toxicity was unrelated to type and length of previous chemotherapy, amount of administered activity, and absorbed dose to the bone marrow. CONCLUSION: 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy was feasible, highly effective, and safe in patients with advanced PanNETs heavily pretreated with chemotherapy. More than one line of chemotherapy was a therapy-related independent risk factor for shorter PFS and OS.","['Fross-Baron, Katarzyna', 'Garske-Roman, Ulrike', 'Welin, Staffan', 'Granberg, Dan', 'Eriksson, Barbro', 'Khan, Tanweera', 'Sandstrom, Mattias', 'Sundin, Anders']","['Fross-Baron K', 'Garske-Roman U', 'Welin S', 'Granberg D', 'Eriksson B', 'Khan T', 'Sandstrom M', 'Sundin A']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, katarzyna.fross_baron@medsci.uu.se.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200225,Switzerland,Neuroendocrinology,Neuroendocrinology,0035665,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', 'AE221IM3BB (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Octreotide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Organometallic Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', '*Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2020/02/26 06:00,2021/11/06 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/06 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['000506746 [pii]', '10.1159/000506746 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroendocrinology. 2021;111(4):330-343. doi: 10.1159/000506746.

However, the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and risk of cancer has so far not been well addressed. This study aimed to summarize the epidemiological evidence of the association between GDM and subsequent risk of cancer. METHODS: PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant studies, and a random-effects model was used to calculate the summary relative risks (RRs) along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: A total of 17 observational studies were selected, comprising 7 case-control and 10 cohort studies. Pooled effect estimates retrieved from these 17 studies showed that GDM was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in Asia (pooled RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01-1.70), but not in other regions, and also with thyroid cancer (RR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.16-1.42), stomach cancer (RR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.02-2.00) and liver cancer (RR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.03-1.55). However, GDM was not associated with any increased risk of colon (RR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.90-2.21), colorectal (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.95-1.41), ovarian (RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.90-1.44), cervical (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.81-1.29), pancreatic (RR: 3.49, 95% CI: 0.80-15.23), brain and nervous system (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.80-1.97), blood (leukaemia, RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.45-1.30), endometrial (RR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.20-2.98), skin (RR: 1.13, 95% CI: 0.81-1.59) or urological (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.73-1.31) cancers. CONCLUSION: GDM is associated with a greater risk of cancer in women, including breast, thyroid, stomach and liver cancers.

We performed snoRNA-focused CRISPR-Cas9 knockout library screenings that targeted the entire snoRNAnome and corresponding host genes. The C/D box containing SNORD42A was identified as an essential modulator for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell survival and proliferation in multiple human leukemia cell lines. In line, SNORD42A was consistently expressed at higher levels in primary AML patient samples than in CD34+ progenitors, monocytes, and granulocytes. Functionally, knockout of SNORD42A reduced colony formation capability and inhibited proliferation. The SNORD42A acts as a C/D box snoRNA and directs 2'-O-methylation at uridine 116 of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA).

Intensive induction chemotherapy containing cytarabine and an anthracycline has been part of the upfront and salvage treatment of AML for decades. Anthracyclines are associated with a significant risk of cardiotoxicity (especially anthracycline-related left ventricular dysfunction [ARLVD]). In the older adult population, the higher prevalence of cardiac comorbidities and risk factors may further increase the risk of ARLVD. In this article of the Young International Society of Geriatric Oncology group, we review the prevalence of ARLVD in patients with AML and factors predisposing to ARLVD, focusing on older adults when possible. In addition, we review the assessment of cardiac function and management of ARLVD during and after treatment. It is worth noting that only a minority of clinical trials focus on alternative treatment strategies in patients with mildly declined left ventricular ejection fraction or at a high risk for ARLVD. The limited evidence for preventive strategies to ameliorate ARLVD and alternative strategies to anthracycline use in the setting of cardiac comorbidities are discussed. Based on extrapolation of findings from younger adults and nonrandomized trials, we recommend a comprehensive baseline evaluation of cardiac function by imaging, cardiac risk factors, and symptoms to risk stratify for ARLVD. Anthracyclines remain an appropriate choice for induction although careful risk-stratification based on cardiac disease, risk factors, and predicted chemotherapy-response are warranted. In case of declined left ventricular ejection fraction, alternative strategies should be considered.","['Neuendorff, Nina Rosa', 'Loh, Kah Poh', 'Mims, Alice S', 'Christofyllakis, Konstantinos', 'Soo, Wee-Kheng', 'Bolukbasi, Bediha', 'Onoro-Algar, Carlos', 'Hundley, William G', 'Klepin, Heidi D']","['Neuendorff NR', 'Loh KP', 'Mims AS', 'Christofyllakis K', 'Soo WK', 'Bolukbasi B', 'Onoro-Algar C', 'Hundley WG', 'Klepin HD']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, Hematology, Oncology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Saarland University Medical School, Homburg/Saar, Germany.', 'Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, Box Hill, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Aged Medicine and.', 'Department of Cancer Services, Eastern Health, Box Hill, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Cardiology, Angiology and Intensive Care, Saarland University Medical School, Homburg/Saar, Germany.', 'Department of Geriatrics, Hospital Rey Juan Carlos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Cardiology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Health Sciences, Richmond, VA; and.', 'Section on Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Aged', '*Anthracyclines/adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity/etiology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Stroke Volume', 'Ventricular Function, Left']",2020/02/26 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31482-8 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000955 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 25;4(4):762-775. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000955.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7042993,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil (O-Clb) has been shown to prolong progression free survival (PFS, median PFS-31.5 months) and overall survival (OS) compared to chlorambucil alone. More recently, obinutuzumab given in combination with either ibrutinib or venetoclax improved PFS but not OS when compared to O-Clb. In this retrospective multinational, multicenter co-operative study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of frontline treatment with O +/- Clb in unfit patients with CLL, in a ""real-world"" setting. Patients with documented del (17p13.1)/TP53 mutation were excluded. A total of 437 patients (median age, 75.9 years; median CIRS score, 8; median creatinine clearance, 61.1 mL/min) were included. The clinical overall response rate was 80.3% (clinical complete and partial responses in 38.7% and 41.6% of patients, respectively). Median observation time was 14.1 months and estimated median PFS was 27.6 months (95% CI, 24.2-31.0). In a multivariate analysis, high-risk disease [del (11q22.3) and/or IGHV-unmutated], lymph nodes of diameter > 5 cm, obinutuzumab monotherapy and reduced cumulative dose of obinutuzumab, were all independently associated with shorter PFS. The median OS has not yet been reached and estimated 2-year OS is 88%. In conclusion, in a ""real-world"" setting, frontline treatment with O-Clb achieves PFS comparable to that reported in clinical trials. Inferior outcomes were noted in patients with del (11q22.3) and/or unmutated IGHV and those treated with obinutuzumab-monotherapy. Thus, O-Clb can be still considered as legitimate frontline therapy for unfit CLL patients with low-risk disease.","['Herishanu, Yair', 'Shaulov, Adir', 'Fineman, Riva', 'Basic-Kinda, Sandra', 'Aviv, Ariel', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, Ewa', 'Jaksic, Ozren', 'Zdrenghea, Mihnea', 'Greenbaum, Uri', 'Mandac, Inga', 'Simkovic, Martin', 'Morawska, Marta', 'Benjamini, Ohad', 'Spacek, Martin', 'Nemets, Anatoly', 'Bairey, Osnat', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Stanca Ciocan, Oana', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Dali, Nagib', 'Miras, Fatima', 'De Meuter, Anne', 'Dimou, Maria', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Bumbea, Horia', 'Szasz, Robert', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Gutwein, Odit', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Tedeschi, Alessandra', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Gimeno Vazquez, Eva', 'Marquet, Juan', 'Assouline, Sarit', 'Papaioannou, Maria', 'Braester, Andrei', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Gregor, Michael', 'Rigolin, Gian M', 'Loscertales, Javier', 'Medina Perez, Angeles', 'Nijziel, Marten R', 'Popov, Viola M', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Slavutsky, Irma', 'Itchaki, Gilad', 'Ringelstein, Shimrit', 'Goldschmidt, Neta', 'Perry, Chava', 'Levi, Shai', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Herishanu Y', 'Shaulov A', 'Fineman R', 'Basic-Kinda S', 'Aviv A', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E', 'Jaksic O', 'Zdrenghea M', 'Greenbaum U', 'Mandac I', 'Simkovic M', 'Morawska M', 'Benjamini O', 'Spacek M', 'Nemets A', 'Bairey O', 'Trentin L', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Laurenti L', 'Stanca Ciocan O', 'Doubek M', 'Shvidel L', 'Dali N', 'Miras F', 'De Meuter A', 'Dimou M', 'Mauro FR', 'Coscia M', 'Bumbea H', 'Szasz R', 'Tadmor T', 'Gutwein O', 'Gentile M', 'Scarfo L', 'Tedeschi A', 'Sportoletti P', 'Gimeno Vazquez E', 'Marquet J', 'Assouline S', 'Papaioannou M', 'Braester A', 'Levato L', 'Gregor M', 'Rigolin GM', 'Loscertales J', 'Medina Perez A', 'Nijziel MR', 'Popov VM', 'Collado R', 'Slavutsky I', 'Itchaki G', 'Ringelstein S', 'Goldschmidt N', 'Perry C', 'Levi S', 'Polliack A', 'Ghia P']","['Department of Hematology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Department of Hematology, HaEmek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Technion Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Hematooncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation Medical University, Lublin, Poland.', 'Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.', 'Ben-Gurion University, Soroka University Medical Center, Beer Sheva, Israel.', 'Clinical Hospital Merkur, Zagreb, Croatia.', 'University Hospital and Medical School Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', ""St. John's Cancer Center, Lublin, Poland."", 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.', 'Hematology Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Charles University and General Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Barzilai University Medical Center, Ashkelon, Israel.', 'Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Hospital;

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature, and identified 18 relevant publications, from which we extracted results from seven non-overlapping studies of NHL and three of MM. We performed random-effects meta-analyses for ever-exposure to glyphosate, dose-response, and risk of specific NHL subtypes. RESULTS: The meta-relative risk (RR) of NHL was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.86-1.21), that of MM was 1.04 (95% CI 0.67-1.41). The meta-RR of NHL for highest category of exposure was 1.49 (95% CI 0.37-2.61; 3 studies). The meta-RR for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was 1.31 (95% CI 0.93-1.75); that for follicular lymphoma was 0.82 (95% CI 0.93-1.70), and that for chronic lymphocytic leukemia was 0.85 (95% CI 0.20-1.49). There was indication of publication bias for studies on NHL. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis provided no overall evidence of an increased risk for both NHL and MM in subjects occupationally exposed to glyphosate. In secondary analyses we detected a small increase in risk for the category with highest level of exposure as well as for DLBCL. The evidence of publication bias suggests caution in the interpretation of the results.","['Donato, Francesca', 'Pira, Enrico', 'Ciocan, Catalina', 'Boffetta, Paolo']","['Donato F', 'Pira E', 'Ciocan C', 'Boffetta P']","['department of pediatrics and public health, university of turin, italy. francesca.donato@unito.it.', 'department of pediatrics and public health, university of turin, italy. enrico.pira@unito.it.', 'department of pediatrics and public health, university of turin, italy. catalina.ciocan@unito.it.', '. paolo.boffetta@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20200224,Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,"['4632WW1X5A (glyphosate)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Glycine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', '*Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Factors']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.23749/mdl.v111i1.8967 [doi]'],epublish,Med Lav. 2020 Feb 24;111(1):63-73. doi: 10.23749/mdl.v111i1.8967.,,,,PMC7809965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, resistance to GC is observed more frequently than resistance to other chemotherapy agents in patients with ALL relapse. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the development of GC resistance in ALL has not yet been fully uncovered. In this study, we used bioinformatic analysis methods to integrate the candidate genes and pathways participating in GC resistance in ALL and subsequently verified the bioinformatics findings with in vitro cell experiments. Ninety-nine significant common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with GC resistance were determined by integrating two gene profile datasets, including GC-sensitive and -resistant samples. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and REACTOME pathways analysis, the signaling pathways in which DEGs were significantly enriched were clustered. The GC resistance-related biologically functional interactions were visualized as DEG-associated Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network complexes, with 98 nodes and 127 edges. MYC, a node which displayed the highest connectivity in all edges, was highlighted as the core gene in the PPI network.

Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) are one of the recent important chemical synthetic compounds used in cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the apoptosis-inducing effect of 2-nitro-1-phenylethylpiperidine-1-carbodithioate (2-NDC) as an active derivative from DTCs, in combination with ATRA on human APL NB4 cells. The viability of treated NB4 cells was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethyltiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay in various concentrations (10-120 microM). The proapoptotic effects of 2-NDC were investigated by acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining, DNA ladder formation, and flow cytometry. We also assessed the oxidative stress-inducing effect of 2-NDC and in combination with ATRA on the NB4 cells. The alteration in gene expression levels of Bax, Bcl2, and Survivin was measured through a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, we redetected the interaction between 2-NDC and antiapoptotic proteins Bcl2 and Survivin via molecular docking. We found that 2-NDC induced apoptosis in NB4 cells in a time-dosage-dependent manner. Also, 2-NDC triggered apoptosis by expanding intracellular reactive oxygen species, combined with ATRA. Bax/Bcl2 ratio was modulated and Survivin was downregulated in NB4 cells upon 2-NDC treatment. Molecular docking studies indicated that 2-NDC binds to the baculovirus inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat domain of Survivin and Bcl homology 3 domain of Bcl2 with various affinities. Based on the present observations, it seems that this derivative can be estimated as an appropriate candidate for future pharmaceutical evaluations.","['Samarkhazan, N S', 'Yekta, R', 'Sayadi, M', 'Tackallou, S H', 'Safaralizadeh, R', 'Mahdavi, M']","['Samarkhazan NS', 'Yekta R', 'Sayadi M', 'Tackallou SH', 'Safaralizadeh R', 'Mahdavi M']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Central Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200225,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Survivin/*genetics', 'Thiocarbamates/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2020/02/26 06:00,2021/02/11 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0960327120905958 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 2020 Jul;39(7):960-972. doi: 10.1177/0960327120905958.

However, more and more studies have found that the cardiac toxicity of As2O3 was increased, limiting its wide clinical application. This study aims to explore the molecule mechanisms of As2O3 on cardiomyocyte injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cardiomyocyte injury under As2O3 was detected by MTT assay. The levels of NEAT1 and miR-124 were examined by RT-PCR. The functions of NEAT1 and miR-124 at H9c2 cell injury under As2O3 were detected by cell transfection of the overexpression or repression. The expression levels of inflammation factors, apoptosis genes and NF-kappaB signals were measured by Western blot in H9c2 cell lines under As2O3. The luciferase assay detected the direct interaction between NEAT1 and miR-124. RESULTS: The overexpression of NEAT1 decreased the H9c2 cells injury under As2O3. The levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha were upregulated after NEAT1 overexpression. Moreover, the luciferase assay results showed NEAT1 was directly interacting with miR-124. Silencing of miR-124 significantly increased the H9c2 cell survival under As2O3 by repressing NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Furthermore, the overexpression of NEAT1 markedly increased H9c2 cells survival under As2O3, while the miR-124 could reverse the effects. Finally, NEAT1 regulated the H9c2 cells As2O3 injury by repressing the miR-124, NF-kappa B expressions and inflammatory response. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, we found that long non-coding RNA NEAT1 regulated the expression of inflammatory factors to protect cardiomyocytes from As2O3 damage by inhibiting miR-124/NF-kappa B signaling pathway. It provides a novel potential treatment strategy for As2O3 cardiomyocytes injury.","['Chen, X-X', 'Jiang, Y-J', 'Zeng, T', 'Li, J-J']","['Chen XX', 'Jiang YJ', 'Zeng T', 'Li JJ']","['Department of Emergency, The First Affiliated Hospital to Third Military Medical University (Army Medical University), Chongqing, China. tianzeng@protonmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN124 microRNA, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NEAT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*toxicity', 'Gene Expression', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*biosynthesis', 'Rats']",2020/02/26 06:00,2021/02/12 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202002_20195 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 Feb;24(3):1378-1390. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202002_20195.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The limited regenerative capability of the neural axon is one of the major factors that hinders the recovery of SCI. To enhance the regenerative ability of neuron is a promising strategy that repairs SCI. We previously proved miR-17-5p could target Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) in primary sensory neuron. We speculated that miR-17-5p was the miRNA that targets STAT3. The Dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated miR-17-5p could bind the 3'UTR of STAT3 mRNA. The RT-qPCR and Western blot assay showed miR-17-5p could not degenerate the mRNA of STAT3, but inhibit the expression of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) via translation inhibition. MiR-17-5p inhibitor promoted the expression of STAT3, phosphorylated-STAT3 (p-STAT3) and Growth Associate Protein-43 (GAP-43), and this promotion was inhibited by STAT3 siRNA. MiR-17-5p mimics and inhibitor inhibited and promoted the neurite growth, respectively. MiR-17-5p inhibitor promoted the axon growth and AG490, the STAT3 phosphorylation inhibitor, inhibited this promotion. MiR-17-5p mimics inhibited the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3 and GAP-43, while the inhibitor promoted their expression. AG490 did not alter the expression of STAT3, while downregulated the expression both p-STAT3 and GAP-43 in miR-17-5p inhibitor&AG490 group. Taken together, these data indicated miR-17-5p could regulated cortical neuron axon growth via STAT3/GAP-43 pathway by targeting STAT3 mRNA 3'UTR. Therefore, miR-17-5p/STAT3/GAP-43 pathway plays a key role in regulating cortical neuron axon growth and could be a novel target to treat SCI.","['Zhang, Liang', 'Wang, Zhijie', 'Li, Bo', 'Xia, Ziwei', 'Wang, Xin', 'Xiu, Yucai', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Chen, Chuanjie', 'Song, Hong', 'Li, Wenhua', 'Yu, Mei', 'Zhang, Meiling', 'Wang, Kai', 'Guo, Xiaoling', 'Ren, Liqun', 'Wang, Tianyi']","['Zhang L', 'Wang Z', 'Li B', 'Xia Z', 'Wang X', 'Xiu Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Chen C', 'Song H', 'Li W', 'Yu M', 'Zhang M', 'Wang K', 'Guo X', 'Ren L', 'Wang T']","[""Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300211, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatric Internal Medicine, Affiliated Hospital of Chengde Medical University, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300211, People's Republic of China."", ""Chengde Medical University, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, Chengde Central Hospital, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Anesthesiology, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300211, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Leukemia Center, Peking Union of Medical College, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, 30020, People's Republic of China."", ""Chengde Medical University, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300211, People's Republic of China. taowentaowen@sina.com."", ""Leukemia Center, Peking Union of Medical College, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin, 30020, People's Republic of China. 870808116@qq.com."", ""Department of Neurology, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China. 870808116@qq.com."", ""Laboratory of Spinal Cord Injury and Rehabilitation, Chengde Medical University, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China. jjandt@qq.com."", ""Department of Orthopedics, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde, 067000, Hebei, People's Republic of China. jjandt@sina.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200224,Netherlands,Mol Biol Rep,Molecular biology reports,0403234,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (MIRN17 microRNA, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'GAP-43 Protein/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Neurites/*metabolism', 'Neurons/*cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11033-020-05273-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11033-020-05273-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Rep. 2020 Mar;47(3):1795-1802. doi: 10.1007/s11033-020-05273-1.

New targeted drug therapies have been shown in randomised trials to offer significant survival improvements above standard-of-care (SoC) for relapsed disease, whilst being relatively well tolerated. Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) has offered spectacular promise amongst the young adult population, with the possibility of cure for refractory disease. It has reversed the paradigm that transplant is the only curative option at relapse. Data is awaited regarding its effectiveness in the older adult population. Nelarabine represents an advance, but there remains a pressing need to develop new therapies with efficacy against T-ALL, especially in the relapse setting.Outcomes for younger adults have improved with the adoption of paediatric-like regimens, with a focus on dose intensity and heavy use of pegylated asparaginase. Defining who falls into the ""young adult"" category and would benefit from this approach remains a controversial area. In elderly patients with ALL, the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and reduction in standard chemotherapy intensity (especially for those with Philadelphia-positive disease) have significantly reduced treatment-associated mortality and resulted in durable remissions with good quality of life.Bone marrow transplantation remains a key therapy in adult ALL, and is still the treatment of choice for relapsed disease. The mortality associated with a myeloablative approach can be substantially lowered by reduced intensity conditioning, without an apparently significant reduction in efficacy.","['Hodby, Katharine A', 'Marks, David I']","['Hodby KA', 'Marks DI']","['Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK.

Due to the potent inhibition of FLT3, RET, and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), it is also being evaluated against acute myeloid leukemia (AML), biliary, and lung cancers. The multikinase inhibition profile of ponatinib may also account for its toxicity, thus analogs with improved kinase selectivity or different kinase inhibition profiles could be better tolerated. The introduction of nitrogen into drug compounds can enhance efficacy and drug properties (a concept called ""necessary nitrogen""). Here, we introduce additional nitrogen into the benzamide moiety of ponatinib to arrive at nicotinamide analogs. A nicotinamide analogue of ponatinib, HSN748, retains activity against FLT3, ABL1, RET, and PDGFRalpha/beta but loses activity against c-Src and P38alpha. MNK1 and 2 are key kinases that phosphorylate eIF4E to regulate the protein translation complex. MNK also modulates mTORC1 signaling and contributes to rapamycin resistance. Inhibitors of MNK1 and 2 are being evaluated for anticancer therapy. Ponatinib is not a potent inhibitor of MNK1 or 2, but the nicotinamide analogs are potent inhibitors of MNKs. This illustrates a powerful demonstration of the necessary nitrogen concept to alter both the potency and selectivity of drugs.","['Larocque, Elizabeth', 'Chu, Elizabeth Fei Yin', 'Naganna, Nimmashetti', 'Sintim, Herman O']","['Larocque E', 'Chu EFY', 'Naganna N', 'Sintim HO']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, 560 Oval Drive, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, 560 Oval Drive, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, 560 Oval Drive, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, 560 Oval Drive, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Institute for Drug Discovery, Purdue University, 720 Clinic Drive, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907, United States.', 'Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, 201 S.

Patients and methods: 5 patients with symptomatic splenomegaly were treated with low doses of radiation in our centre (January 2008-December 2016). 4/5 patients had malignant neoplasia (acute myeloid leukemia, non Hogdkin lymphoma and prolymphocytic B cell leukemia) and splenomegaly was caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis. 1/5 patient had benign disease (HBV liver cirrhosis) and splenomegaly was caused by vascular ectasia. Median age was 73 years (range 61-86 years). There were 4 females and 1 male. These patients had exclusively splenic pain or abdominal discomfort in 20%, exclusively cytopenias 40% and both 40%. Patients needed radiation therapy for symptomatic control. Dose per fraction was 0.5 Gy every two days; total dose initially prescribed 10 Gy. IGRT were performed in all patients to ensure an appropriate position and to adapt the treatment volume to the changes in the spleen volume along the treatment. Median craneocaudal length size of the spleen was more than 26 cm (range 15.2-34.9 cm). Results: Median radiation doses were 4.85 Gy (range 2.5-10).

Median increase of haemoglobin and platelets levels was 1.6 mg/dl and 27.950 cells respectively in the first week after the end of radiotherapy.One patient had to interrupt her treatment due to grade II neutropenia. No other toxicities were described. With a median follow-up of 39 months (16-89 months), only one recurrence was described at 24 months and consisted of thrombocytopenia. The patient received a second course of radiotherapy with excellent response. Conclusion: Low doses of radiation therapy for treatment of symptomatic splenomegaly were effective, with a low rate of side effects. Splenic pain and abdominal discomfort completely improved and cytopenias rised to secure levels.","['de la Pinta, Carolina', 'Fernandez Lizarbe, Eva', 'Montero Luis, Angel', 'Dominguez Rullan, Jose Antonio', 'Sancho Garcia, Sonsoles']","['de la Pinta C', 'Fernandez Lizarbe E', 'Montero Luis A', 'Dominguez Rullan JA', 'Sancho Garcia S']","['Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'HM Madrid, Spain.', 'Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.', 'Ramon y Cajal University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20170906,England,Tech Innov Patient Support Radiat Oncol,Technical innovations & patient support in radiation oncology,101762366,,,,2017/09/06 00:00,2017/09/06 00:01,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2017/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/09/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/06 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.tipsro.2017.08.002 [doi]', 'S2405-6324(17)30013-6 [pii]']",epublish,Tech Innov Patient Support Radiat Oncol. 2017 Sep 6;3-4:23-29. doi: 10.1016/j.tipsro.2017.08.002. eCollection 2017 Sep-Dec.,,,"['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Cases of bleeding disorders ultimately result in thrombocytopenia, but platelet aggregation dysfunction induced by dasatinib has also been demonstrated in Ph + B-ALL and CML patients. We report three Chinese children with Ph + B-ALL who received a combination treatment of chemotherapy and dasatinib and developed gastrointestinal bleeding several months later. The platelet count and clotting tests were normal, and these patients presented with dasatinib-induced platelet dysfunction.

The cat presented with truncular alopecia and numerous whitish adherent scales covering the whole body. Differential diagnoses included sebaceous adenitis, dermatophytosis, demodicosis, exfoliative dermatitis associated or not with thymoma, drug reaction, feline immunodeficiency virus- or feline leukaemia virus-associated dermatoses, epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma, and Malassezia yeasts and/or bacterial overgrowth. Blood tests were within normal limits and the retrovirus tests were negative. Skin scrapings, fungal culture, coat brushing and skin cytology were negative for parasitic or microbial elements. Radiographs showed no signs of a thymic mass. Histological examination of skin biopsies revealed marked orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, lymphocytic (CD3(+)) interface dermatitis and mural folliculitis with absence of sebaceous glands and occasional apoptotic cells in different epidermal layers. Clinical and histological findings were consistent with non-thymoma-associated exfoliative dermatitis syndrome. Ciclosporin A (7 mg/kg) was administered once daily. A dramatic improvement was observed after 3 weeks. Ciclosporin A intake was then progressively spaced out as the clinical signs diminished. Skin biopsies revealed resolution of hyperkeratosis, disappearance of the inflammatory infiltrate and recovery of the sebaceous glands. Relevance and novel information: T-cell infiltration with signs of epidermal cytotoxicity, in the absence of infectious agents or neoplastic process, suggests an immune-mediated process, and ciclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor, would be the drug of choice. This is the first report showing resolution of both the clinical and histological signs of non-thymoma-associated exfoliative dermatitis.","['Combarros, Daniel', 'Moulin, Jean-Paul', 'Correge, Sophie', 'Delverdier, Maxence', 'Cadiergues, Marie-Christine']","['Combarros D', 'Moulin JP', 'Correge S', 'Delverdier M', 'Cadiergues MC']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, Universite de Toulouse, ENVT, Toulouse, France; UDEAR, Universite de Toulouse, INSERM, ENVT, Toulouse, France.', 'Veterinary Clinic, Saint-Cere, France.', 'Veterinary Clinic, Saint-Cere, France.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, Universite de Toulouse, ENVT, Toulouse, France; IHAP, Universite de Toulouse, INRA, ENVT, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Universite de Toulouse, ENVT, Toulouse, France; UDEAR, Universite de Toulouse, INSERM, ENVT, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200211,England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:01,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116920902307 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116920902307 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2020 Feb 11;6(1):2055116920902307. doi: 10.1177/2055116920902307. eCollection 2020 Jan-Jun.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6909-0153'],,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],PMC7013115,,['NOTNLM'],"['Exfoliative dermatitis', 'ciclosporin A', 'histology', 'recovery', 'sebaceous adenitis']",,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case Report: A 41-year-old white male presented with painless, blurry vision in the left eye. Examination revealed unilateral optic nerve swelling confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Initial workup revealed mild leukocytosis, eventually diagnosed as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). No other cause of optic neuropathy was identified despite extensive investigation. The patient developed rapidly progressive retinal ganglion cell nerve fiber layer (NFL) atrophy and relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) of the left eye despite steroid treatment but stabilized after four cycles of CLL-targeted chemotherapy. Although infiltrative optic neuropathy is well-known in leukemia, presentation with only subtle vision loss is rare. Vision loss usually presents late in leukemic infiltrative optic neuropathy and therefore must be considered in patients with optic disc swelling and leukocytosis. Conclusion: When treating CLL, progressive visual decline with coexistent optic neuropathy may warrant chemotherapy.","['Sharma, Rajesh K', 'Mays, Kevin']","['Sharma RK', 'Mays K']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200202,India,J Ophthalmic Vis Res,Journal of ophthalmic & vision research,101497643,,,,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:01,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.18502/jovr.v15i1.5958 [doi]'],epublish,J Ophthalmic Vis Res. 2020 Feb 2;15(1):109-112. doi: 10.18502/jovr.v15i1.5958. eCollection 2020 Jan-Mar.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Sharma and Mays.'],PMC7001031,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Optic Neuropathy']",,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: This study evaluated 89 patients referred from all over the country to the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO) in Tehran from 2013 to 2015. We compared the immunophenotype patterns of childhood and adult ALLs including 69(77.5%) B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LBL), 2(2.2%) Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), and 18(20.2%) T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) cases using flowcytometry with broad antibody panel. Results: CD19 and CD79a were the most frequent markers for B-LBL while CD7 was the most sensitive marker in T-LBL; the frequency of CD7, CD3, and CD5 antigens were 100%, 38.9%, and 88.9%, respectively. TdT+/CD34+ was significantly higher in adult B-LBLs than children, which indicates blast cells are more immature in adults. In addition, CD10 and cCD79a were significantly higher in children with B-LBL like as CD5 and CD8 in children with T-LBL. Aberrant phenotypes including CD13, CD33, CD7, and CD117 were found in 7(10.1%) cases of B-LBL. These phenotypes were CD117, HLA-DR, and CD33 in 7(38/9%) cases of T-LBL. Expression of CD117 aberrant myeloid antigen was significantly more associated with T-LBL than with B-lineage ALL. Conclusion: Significant differences were observed in antigen-expression patterns between adult and childhood ALLs. Further studies are needed to correlate specific markers with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and prognosis with therapeutic response.","['Rezaei, Mitra Sadat', 'Esfandiari, Najmeh', 'Refoua, Sandra', 'Shamaei, Masoud']","['Rezaei MS', 'Esfandiari N', 'Refoua S', 'Shamaei M']","['Virology Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'High Institute for Research and Education in Blood Transfusion Medicine, Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'High Institute for Research and Education in Blood Transfusion Medicine, Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization, Tehran, Iran.', 'Clinical Tuberculosis and Epidemiology Research Center, National Research Institute of Tuberculosis, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Pathol,Iranian journal of pathology,101515128,,,,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:01,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.30699/IJP.2019.93974.1926 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Pathol. 2020 Winter;15(1):1-7. doi: 10.30699/IJP.2019.93974.1926.,,,['(c) 2020.'],PMC6995678,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aberrant phenotype', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Flow cytometry', 'Immunophenotyping']",,,"['The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest regarding the', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its turnover is often tightly controlled through both ubiquitin-dependent and -independent mechanisms of proteasomal degradation. Several cell stress signals, including DNA damage and cell cycle arrest, are known to elicit distinct E3 ligases to ubiquitinate and degrade MCL1. Another trigger that drives MCL1 degradation is engagement by NOXA, one of its BH3-only protein ligands, but the mechanism responsible has remained unclear. From an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we discovered that the ubiquitin E3 ligase MARCH5, the ubiquitin E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2K, and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein MTCH2 co-operate to mark MCL1 for degradation by the proteasome-specifically when MCL1 is engaged by NOXA. This mechanism of degradation also required the MCL1 transmembrane domain and distinct MCL1 lysine residues to proceed, suggesting that the components likely act on the MCL1:NOXA complex by associating with it in a specific orientation within the mitochondrial outer membrane. MTCH2 has not previously been reported to regulate protein stability, but is known to influence the mitochondrial localization of certain key apoptosis regulators and to impact metabolism. We have now pinpointed an essential but previously unappreciated role for MTCH2 in turnover of the MCL1:NOXA complex by MARCH5, further strengthening its links to BCL2-regulated apoptosis.","['Djajawi, Tirta Mario', 'Liu, Lei', 'Gong, Jia-Nan', 'Huang, Allan Shuai', 'Luo, Ming-Jie', 'Xu, Zhen', 'Okamoto, Toru', 'Call, Melissa J', 'Huang, David C S', 'van Delft, Mark F']","['Djajawi TM', 'Liu L', 'Gong JN', 'Huang AS', 'Luo MJ', 'Xu Z', 'Okamoto T', 'Call MJ', 'Huang DCS', 'van Delft MF']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Institute for Brain Research and Rehabilitation, Guangdong Key Laboratory of Mental Health and Cognitive Science, Center for Studies of Psychological Application, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Institute for Advanced Co-Creation Studies, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia. huang_d@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia. huang_d@wehi.edu.au.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, VIC, Australia. vandelft@wehi.edu.au.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia. vandelft@wehi.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200224,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIEF2 protein, human)', '0 (MTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MARCHF5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Peptide Elongation Factors/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2020/02/26 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-020-0517-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-020-0517-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Aug;27(8):2484-2499. doi: 10.1038/s41418-020-0517-0.

Among them, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib is known for a number of clinically relevant off-target actions, attributed in part to effects on components of the immune system, especially conventional T-cells and natural killer (NK)-cells. Here, we have hypothesized that dasatinib also influences non-conventional T-alphabeta cell subsets known for their potential anti-tumoral properties, namely iNKT cells and the distinct new innate CD8 T-cell subset. In mice, where the two subsets were originally characterized, an activated state of iNKT cells associated with a shift toward an iNKT cell Th1-phenotype was observed after dasatinib treatment in vivo. Despite decreased frequency of the total memory CD8 T-cell compartment, the proportion of innate-memory CD8 T-cells and their IFNgamma expression in response to an innate-like stimulation increased in response to dasatinib. Lastly, in patients administered with dasatinib for the treatment of BCR-ABL-positive leukemias, we provided the proof of concept that the kinase inhibitor also influences the two innate T-cell subsets in humans, as attested by their increased frequency in the peripheral blood.

Using an ex vivo functional screening assay, we identified that the combination of the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax (IBR + VEN), currently in clinical trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), demonstrated enhanced efficacy on primary AML patient specimens, AML cell lines, and in a mouse xenograft model of AML. Expanded analyses among a large cohort of hematologic malignancies (n = 651 patients) revealed that IBR + VEN sensitivity associated with selected genetic and phenotypic features in both CLL and AML specimens. Among AML samples, 11q23 MLL rearrangements were highly sensitive to IBR + VEN. Analysis of differentially expressed genes with respect to IBR + VEN sensitivity indicated pathways preferentially enriched in patient samples with reduced ex vivo sensitivity, including IL-10 signaling.

Dysfunction of MSCs is associated with the impaired BM microenvironment that promotes leukemia development. However, whether and how restoration of the impaired BM microenvironment can inhibit leukemia development remain unknown. Using an established leukemia model and the RNA-Seq analysis, we discovered functional degeneration of MSCs during leukemia progression. Importantly, intra-BM instead of systemic transfusion of donor healthy MSCs restored the BM microenvironment, demonstrated by functional recovery of host MSCs, improvement of thrombopoiesis, and rebalance of myelopoiesis. Consequently, intra-BM MSC treatment reduced tumor burden and prolonged survival of the leukemia-bearing mice. Mechanistically, donor MSC treatment restored the function of host MSCs and reprogrammed host macrophages into arginase 1 positive phenotype with tissue-repair features. Transfusion of MSC-reprogrammed macrophages largely recapitulated the therapeutic effects of MSCs. Taken together, our study reveals that donor MSCs reprogram host macrophages to restore the BM microenvironment and inhibit leukemia development.","['Xia, Chengxiang', 'Wang, Tongjie', 'Cheng, Hui',

Side effects associated with selinexor include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and hyponatremia. We reviewed 437 patients with multiple myeloma treated with selinexor and assessed the kinetics of adverse events and impact of supportive care measures. Selinexor reduced both platelets and neutrophils over the first cycle of treatment and reached a nadir between 28 and 42 days. Platelet transfusions and thrombopoietin receptor agonists were effective at treating thrombocytopenia, and granulocyte colony stimulating factors were effective at resolving neutropenia. The onset of gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) was most common during the first 1-2 weeks of treatment. Nausea could be mitigated with 5-HT3 antagonists and either neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, olanzapine, or cannbainoids. Loperamide and bismuth subsalicylate ameliorated diarrhea. The primary constitutional side effects of fatigue and decreased appetite could be managed with methylphenidate, megestrol, cannabinoids or olanzapine, respectively. Hyponatremia was highly responsive to sodium replacement. Selinexor has well-established adverse effects that mainly occur within the first 8 weeks of treatment, are reversible, and respond to supportive care.","['Gavriatopoulou, Maria', 'Chari, Ajai', 'Chen, Christine', 'Bahlis, Nizar', 'Vogl, Dan T', 'Jakubowiak, Andrzej', 'Dingli, David', 'Cornell, Robert F', 'Hofmeister, Craig C', 'Siegel, David', 'Berdeja, Jesus G', 'Reece, Donna', 'White, Darrell', 'Lentzsch, Suzanne', 'Gasparetto, Cristina', 'Huff, Carol Ann', 'Jagannath, Sundar', 'Baz, Rachid', 'Nooka, Ajay K', 'Richter, Joshua', 'Abonour, Rafat', 'Parker, Terri L', 'Yee, Andrew J', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Lonial, Sagar', 'Tuchman, Sascha', 'Weisel, Katja C', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Choquet, Sylvain', 'Unger, T J', 'Li, Kai', 'Chai, Yi', 'Li, Lingling', 'Shah, Jatin', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Kauffman, Michael G', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios Athanasios']","['Gavriatopoulou M', 'Chari A', 'Chen C', 'Bahlis N', 'Vogl DT', 'Jakubowiak A', 'Dingli D', 'Cornell RF', 'Hofmeister CC', 'Siegel D', 'Berdeja JG', 'Reece D', 'White D', 'Lentzsch S', 'Gasparetto C', 'Huff CA', 'Jagannath S', 'Baz R', 'Nooka AK', 'Richter J', 'Abonour R', 'Parker TL', 'Yee AJ', 'Moreau P', 'Lonial S', 'Tuchman S', 'Weisel KC', 'Mohty M', 'Choquet S', 'Unger TJ', 'Li K', 'Chai Y', 'Li L', 'Shah J', 'Shacham S', 'Kauffman MG', 'Dimopoulos MA']","['Alexandra Hospital, School of Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece. mariagabria@gmail.com.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Charbonneau Cancer Research Institute, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.', 'Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'QEII Health Sciences Center, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Duke University Cancer Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

The mechanical phenotyping of single cells therefore offers many potential diagnostic applications. Cells are viscoelastic and their response to an applied stress is highly dependent on the magnitude and timescale of the actuation. Microfluidics can be used to measure cell deformability over a wide range of flow conditions, operating two distinct flow regimes (shear and inertial) which can expose subtle mechanical properties arising from subcellular components. Here, we investigate the deformability of three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines using a range of flow conditions. These cell lines offer a model for CRC metastatic progression; SW480 derived from primary adenocarcinoma, HT29 from a more advanced primary tumor and SW620 from lymph-node metastasis. HL60 (leukemia cells) were also studied as a model circulatory cell, offering a non-epithelial comparison. We demonstrate that microfluidic induced flow deformation can be used to robustly detect mechanical changes associated with CRC progression. We also show that single-cell multivariate analysis, utilising deformation and relaxation dynamics, offers potential to distinguish these different cell types. These results point to the benefit of multiparameter determination for improving detection and accuracy of disease stage diagnosis.","['Armistead, Fern J', 'Gala De Pablo, Julia', 'Gadelha, Hermes', 'Peyman, Sally A', 'Evans, Stephen D']","['Armistead FJ', 'Gala De Pablo J', 'Gadelha H', 'Peyman SA', 'Evans SD']","['Molecular and Nanoscale Physics group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Molecular and Nanoscale Physics group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.', 'Molecular and Nanoscale Physics group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', 'Molecular and Nanoscale Physics group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK. s.d.evans@leeds.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200224,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Elasticity', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', '*Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Linear Models', 'Microfluidics', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phenotype', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Viscosity']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59952-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59952-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 24;10(1):3254. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59952-x.,,['MR/M009084/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,PMC7039955,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 1% of appendicectomies will have an incidental finding of an appendiceal neoplasm. A primary appendiceal lymphoma is extremely rare, and is found in 0.015% of all appendiceal specimens. Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B cell lymphoma characterized by translocation and dysregulation of the c-Myc gene. Burkitt leukemia is considered to be an alternative manifestation of the same pathology, and is defined by the presence of >25% Burkitt blasts within the bone marrow. The treatment approaches for Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma are similar. <strong>CASE REPORT</strong> A 6-year old girl presented with a history, examination, and radiological imaging consistent with acute appendicitis. An inflamed, edematous appendix was identified intraoperatively, and a cecectomy was performed. Histopathological investigations demonstrated Burkitt leukemia with isolated extra-nodal involvement of the appendix. The patient was subsequently started on a multi-agent steroid and chemotherapy regimen. A literature review was performed, identifying cases of Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma presenting as appendicitis. <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong> This case highlights the importance of clinical vigilance and routine specimen histopathology review, and explores key management considerations associated with the incidental diagnosis of Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma.","['Mimery, Alexander H', 'Jabbour, Joe', 'Sykes, Blake', 'MacDermid, Ewan', 'Al-Askari, Mohamed', 'De Clercq, Stefaan']","['Mimery AH', 'Jabbour J', 'Sykes B', 'MacDermid E', 'Al-Askari M', 'De Clercq S']","['Department of Surgery, Gladstone Hospital, Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Surgery, Gladstone Hospital, Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Surgery, Gladstone Hospital, Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Colorectal Surgery, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Surgery, Gladstone Hospital, Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.', 'Department of Surgery, Gladstone Hospital, Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200213,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,['0 (Steroids)'],IM,"['Abdomen, Acute', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Appendectomy', 'Appendiceal Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Steroids/therapeutic use']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/10/29 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['921568 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.921568 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2020 Feb 13;21:e921568. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.921568.,,,,PMC7038641,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of these receptors has been shown to induce inflammatory anticancer events, including differentiation and apoptosis, across a wide variety of malignancies. In contrast, intracellular pattern recognition receptors such as NOD-like receptors have been minimally studied. NOD2 is a member of the NOD-like receptor family that initiates inflammatory signaling in response to the bacterial motif muramyl dipeptide. In this study, we examined the influence of NOD2 in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, demonstrating that IFN-gamma treatment upregulated the expression of NOD2 signaling pathway members SLC15A3 and SLC15A4, downstream signaling kinase RIPK2, and the NOD2 receptor itself. This priming allowed for effective induction of caspase-1-dependent cell death upon treatment with muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE), a synthetic ligand for NOD2. Furthermore, the combination of MTP-PE and IFN-gamma on AML blasts generated an inflammatory cytokine profile and activated NK cells. In a murine model of AML, dual treatment with MTP-PE and IFN-gamma led to a significant increase in mature CD27(-) CD11b(+) NK cells as well as a significant reduction in disease burden and extended survival. These results suggest that NOD2 activation, primed by IFN-gamma, may provide a novel therapeutic option for AML.","['Buteyn, Nathaniel J', 'Santhanam, Ramasamy', 'Merchand-Reyes, Giovanna', 'Murugesan, Rakesh A', 'Dettorre, Gino M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Sarkar, Anasuya', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Mundy-Bosse, Bethany L', 'Butchar, Jonathan P', 'Tridandapani, Susheela']","['Buteyn NJ', 'Santhanam R', 'Merchand-Reyes G', 'Murugesan RA', 'Dettorre GM', 'Byrd JC', 'Sarkar A', 'Vasu S', 'Mundy-Bosse BL', 'Butchar JP', 'Tridandapani S']","['Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; butchar.2@osu.edu tridandapani.2@osu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', 'Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; butchar.2@osu.edu tridandapani.2@osu.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200224,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (NOD2 protein, human)', '0 (Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Pattern Recognition)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nod2 Signaling Adaptor Protein/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Pattern Recognition/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/metabolism']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1900885 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900885 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Apr 1;204(7):1988-1997. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900885.

Recently, NUDT15 deficiency was identified as a genetic cause of thiopurine toxicity, and NUDT15-informed preemptive dose reduction was quickly adopted in clinical settings. To exhaustively identify pharmacogenetic variants in this gene, we developed massively parallel NUDT15 function assays to determine the variants' effect on protein abundance and thiopurine cytotoxicity. Of the 3,097 possible missense variants, we characterized the abundance of 2,922 variants and found 54 hotspot residues at which variants resulted in complete loss of protein stability. Analyzing 2,935 variants in the thiopurine cytotoxicity-based assay, we identified 17 additional residues where variants altered NUDT15 activity without affecting protein stability. We identified structural elements key to NUDT15 stability and/or catalytical activity with single amino acid resolution. Functional effects for NUDT15 variants accurately predicted toxicity risk alleles in patients treated with thiopurines with far superior sensitivity and specificity compared to bioinformatic prediction algorithms. In conclusion, our massively parallel variant function assays identified 1,152 deleterious NUDT15 variants, providing a comprehensive reference of variant function and vastly improving the ability to implement pharmacogenetics-guided thiopurine treatment individualization.","['Suiter, Chase C', 'Moriyama, Takaya', 'Matreyek, Kenneth A', 'Yang, Wentao', 'Scaletti, Emma Rose', 'Nishii, Rina', 'Yang,

Evasion of apoptosis through upregulating antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family members and p53 inactivation, and abnormal activation of B-cell receptor signaling pathway are two important pathogenic factors for DLBCL. In this study, our aim is to explore a rational combination of BCL-2 inhibitor plus Brutons tyrosine kinase (BTK) blockade or p53 activation for treating DLBCL with the above characteristics. We demonstrated that a novel BCL-2 selective inhibitor APG-2575 effectively suppressed DLBCL with BCL-2 high expression via activating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. BTK inhibitor ibrutinib combined with BCL-2 inhibitors showed synergistic antitumor effect in DLBCL with mean expression of BCL-2 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) through upregulating the expression level of BIM and modulating MCL-1 and p-Akt expression. For p53 wild-type DLBCL with high expression of BCL-2, APG-2575 showed strong synergic effect with mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)p53 inhibitor APG-115 that can achieve potent antitumor effect and markedly prolong survival in animal models. Collectively, our data provide an effective and precise therapeutic strategy through rational combination of BCL-2 and BTK or MDM2p53 inhibitors for DLBCL, which deserves further clinical investigation.","['Luo, Qiuyun', 'Pan, Wentao', 'Zhou, Suna', 'Wang, Guangfeng', 'Yi, Hanjie', 'Zhang, Lin', 'Yan, Xianglei', 'Yuan, Luping', 'Liu, Zhenyi', 'Wang, Jing', 'Chen, Haibo', 'Qiu, MiaoZhen', 'Yang, DaJun', 'Sun, Jian']","['Luo Q', 'Pan W', 'Zhou S', 'Wang G', 'Yi H', 'Zhang L', 'Yan X', 'Yuan L', 'Liu Z', 'Wang J', 'Chen H', 'Qiu M', 'Yang D', 'Sun J']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer MedicineGuangzhouP.R.

Mutations on the epigenetic modifiers could affect the enzyme activity, which would result in the difference in genome-wide methylation profiles and, activation of downstream genes. Therefore, we investigated the effect of mutations on DNA methylation modification genes such as DNMT1, DNMT3A, MBD1, MBD4, TET1, TET2 and TET3 through a pan-cancer analysis. METHODS: First, we investigated the effect of mutations in DNA methylation modification genes on genome-wide methylation profiles. We collected 3,644 samples that have both of mRNA and methylation data from 12 major cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The samples were divided into two groups according to the mutational signature. Differentially methylated regions (DMR) that overlapped with the promoter region were selected using minfi and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified using EBSeq. By integrating the DMR and DEG results, we constructed a comprehensive DNA methylome profiles on a pan-cancer scale. Second, we investigated the effect of DNA methylations in the promoter regions on downstream genes by comparing the two groups of samples in 11 cancer types. To investigate the effects of promoter methylation on downstream gene activations, we performed clustering analysis of DEGs. Among the DEGs, we selected highly correlated gene set that had differentially methylated promoter regions using graph based sub-network clustering methods. RESULTS: We chose an up-regulated DEGs cluster where had hypomethylated promoter in acute myeloid leukemia (LAML) and another down-regulated DEGs cluster where had hypermethylated promoter in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). To rule out effects of gene regulation by transcription factor (TF), if differentially expressed TFs bound to the promoter of DEGs, that DEGs did not included to the gene set that effected by DNA methylation modifiers. Consequently, we identified 54 hypomethylated promoter DMR up-regulated DEGs in LAML and 45 hypermethylated promoter DMR down-regulated DEGs in COAD. CONCLUSIONS: Our study on DNA methylation modification genes in mutated vs. non-mutated groups could provide useful insight into the epigenetic regulation of DEGs in cancer.","['Lee, Chai-Jin', 'Ahn, Hongryul', 'Jeong, Dabin', 'Pak, Minwoo', 'Moon, Ji Hwan', 'Kim, Sun']","['Lee CJ', 'Ahn H', 'Jeong D', 'Pak M', 'Moon JH', 'Kim S']","['Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program in Bioinformatics, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea. sunkim.bioinfo@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea. sunkim.bioinfo@snu.ac.kr.', 'Bioinformatics Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Korea. sunkim.bioinfo@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200224,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenome', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-020-0659-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-020-0659-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2020 Feb 24;13(Suppl 3):27. doi: 10.1186/s12920-020-0659-4.,,,,PMC7038532,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DMR-DEG integration', '*DNA methylation modifier', '*Genome-wide landscape', '*Pan-cancer analysis', '*Sub-network clustering']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether the perturbed microbiota community is restored after disease remission and cessation of cancer treatment has not been evaluated. This study examines the chronological changes of gut microbiota in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prior to the start-, during-, and following cessation of chemotherapy. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a longitudinal observational study in gut microbiota profile in a group of paediatric patients diagnosed with ALL using 16 s ribosomal RNA sequencing and compared these patients' microbiota pattern with age and ethnicity-matched healthy children. Temporal changes of gut microbiota in these patients with ALL were also examined at different time-points in relation to chemotherapy. RESULTS: Prior to commencement of chemotherapy, gut microbiota in children with ALL had larger inter-individual variability compared to healthy controls and was enriched with bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes phylum and Bacteroides genus. The relative abundance of Bacteroides decreased upon commencement of chemotherapy. Restitution of gut microbiota composition to resemble that of healthy controls occurred after cessation of chemotherapy. However, the microbiota composition (beta diversity) remained distinctive and a few bacteria were different in abundance among the patients with ALL compared to controls despite completion of chemotherapy and presumed restoration of normal health. CONCLUSION: Our findings in this pilot study is the first to suggest that gut microbiota profile in children with ALL remains marginally different from healthy controls even after cessation of chemotherapy. These persistent microbiota changes may have a role in the long-term wellbeing in childhood cancer survivors but the impact of these changes in subsequent health perturbations in these survivors remain unexplored.","['Chua, Ling Ling', 'Rajasuriar, Reena', 'Lim, Yvonne Ai Lian', 'Woo, Yin Ling', ""Loke, P'ng"", 'Ariffin, Hany']","['Chua LL', 'Rajasuriar R', 'Lim YAL', 'Woo YL', 'Loke P', 'Ariffin H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS (CERiA), University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. hany@ummc.edu.my.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. hany@ummc.edu.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200224,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteria/*classification/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Phylogeny', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*microbiology/pathology', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-6654-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-6654-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Feb 24;20(1):151. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-6654-5.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4607-8837'],"['W81XWH-16-1-0255/U.S. Department of Defense', 'P30 CA016087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PG346-2016A/Institut Pengurusan dan Pemantauan Penyelidikan, Universiti Malaya', 'RP049A-17HTM/Institut Pengurusan dan Pemantauan Penyelidikan, Universiti Malaya', 'HL084312, AI133977, AI130945/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7041273,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bacteroides', 'Bacteroidetes', 'Chemotherapy', 'Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Microbiome', 'Microbiota dysbiosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ibrutinib use in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has previously been associated with CNS-A. We provide a case report of a patient that presented with primary CNS-A on Ibrutinib therapy without any prior pulmonary or local paranasal signs of infection. CASE PRESENTATION: 74-year-old Caucasian male with CLL and no prior chemotherapy on ibrutinib for 6 months presented with three months of unsteady gait, occipital headache, and confusion. He has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis on chronic prednisone 5 mg daily and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He was found to have a ""brain abscess"" on imaging. Emergent craniotomy confirmed Aspergillus and patient was treated with Voriconazole for 6 months. At six-month follow up, repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed complete resolution of CNS lesion.

Micro-RNA-23a (miR-23a) is frequently deregulated in AML and has been linked to chemoresistance in solid cancers. We, therefore, studied its role in chemoresistance to cytarabine (AraC), which forms the backbone of all cytostatic AML treatments. Initially, we assessed AraC sensitivity in three AML cell lines following miR-23a overexpression/knockdown using MTT-cell viability and soft-agar colony-formation assays. Overexpression of miR-23a decreased the sensitivity to AraC, whereas its knockdown had the opposite effect. Analysis of clinical data revealed that high miR-23a expression correlated with relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML disease stages, the leukemic stem cell compartment, as well as with inferior overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in AraC-treated patients. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-23a targets and downregulates topoisomerase-2-beta (TOP2B), and that TOP2B knockdown mediates AraC chemoresistance as well. Likewise, low TOP2B expression also correlated with R/R-AML disease stages and inferior EFS/OS. In conclusion, we show that increased expression of miR-23a mediates chemoresistance to AraC in AML and that it correlates with an inferior outcome in AraC-treated AML patients. We further demonstrate that miR-23a causes the downregulation of TOP2B, which is likely to mediate its effects on AraC sensitivity.","['Hatzl, Stefan', 'Perfler, Bianca', 'Wurm, Sonja', 'Uhl, Barbara', 'Quehenberger, Franz', 'Ebner, Susanne', 'Troppmair, Jakob', 'Reinisch, Andreas', 'Wolfler, Albert', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Zebisch, Armin']","['Hatzl S', 'Perfler B', 'Wurm S', 'Uhl B', 'Quehenberger F', 'Ebner S', 'Troppmair J', 'Reinisch A', 'Wolfler A', 'Sill H', 'Zebisch A']","['Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Documentation, Medical University of Graz, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Daniel Swarovski Research Laboratory, Department of Visceral, Transplant and Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Daniel Swarovski Research Laboratory, Department of Visceral, Transplant and Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 38, 8036 Graz, Austria.', 'Otto-Loewi-Research Center for Vascular Biology, Immunology and Inflammation, Division of Pharmacology, Medical University of Graz, Universitatsplatz 4, 8010 Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200220,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:01,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020496 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020496 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Feb 20;12(2). pii: cancers12020496. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020496.,,"['P26619-B19/Austrian Science Fund', 'P 31430-B26/Austrian Science Fund', 'Joseph-Skoda Award/Austrian Society of Internal Medicine', 'NA/Leukamiehilfe Steiermark']",,PMC7072365,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytarabine', 'micro-RNA-23a', 'therapeutic resistance']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To avoid receptor interference and enable dual vector co-infection with MLV-RRV, we have developed another RRV based on gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) that also shows robust replicative spread in a wide variety of tumor cells. We evaluated the potential of GALV-based RRV as a cancer therapeutic agent by incorporating yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) and E. coli nitroreductase (NTR) prodrug activator genes into the vector. The expression of CD and NTR genes from GALV-RRV achieved highly efficient delivery of these prodrug activator genes to RG-2 glioma cells, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity after administering their respective prodrugs 5-fluorocytosine and CB1954 in vitro. In an immune-competent intracerebral RG-2 glioma model, GALV-mediated CD and NTR gene therapy both significantly suppressed tumor growth with CB1954 administration after a single injection of vector supernatant. However, NTR showed greater potency than CD, with control animals receiving GALV-NTR vector alone (i.e., without CB1954 prodrug) showing extensive tumor growth with a median survival time of 17.5 days, while animals receiving GALV-NTR and CB1954 showed significantly prolonged survival with a median survival time of 30 days. In conclusion, GALV-RRV enabled high-efficiency gene transfer and persistent expression of NTR, resulting in efficient cell killing, suppression of tumor growth, and prolonged survival upon CB1954 administration. This validates the use of therapeutic strategies employing this prodrug activator gene to arm GALV-RRV, and opens the door to the possibility of future combination gene therapy with CD-armed MLV-RRV, as the latter vector is currently being evaluated in clinical trials.","['Chen, Shih-Han', 'Sun, Jui-Ming', 'Chen, Bing-Mao', 'Lin, Sheng-Che', 'Chang, Hao-Fang', 'Collins, Sara', 'Chang, Deching', 'Wu, Shu-Fen', 'Lu, Yin-Che', 'Wang, Weijun', 'Chen, Thomas C', 'Kasahara, Noriyuki', 'Wang, Hsin-Ell', 'Tai, Chien-Kuo']","['Chen SH', 'Sun JM', 'Chen BM', 'Lin SC', 'Chang HF', 'Collins S', 'Chang D', 'Wu SF', 'Lu YC', 'Wang W', 'Chen TC', 'Kasahara N', 'Wang HE', 'Tai CK']","['Section of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital, Chia-Yi 600, Taiwan.', 'Section of Neurosurgery, Department of Surgery, Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital, Chia-Yi 600, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung 413, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi 621, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi 621, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi 621, Taiwan.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi 621, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi 621, Taiwan.', 'Department of Health and Nutrition, Chia Nan University of Pharmacy and Science, Tainan 717, Taiwan.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, National Chung Cheng University, Chia-Yi 621, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200220,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '7865D5D01M (tretazicar)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)', 'EC 1.7.- (NfsA protein, E coli)', 'EC 1.7.- (Nitroreductases)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aziridines/*pharmacology', 'Brain Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosine Deaminase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Flucytosine/*pharmacology', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glioma/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Nitroreductases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",2020/02/26 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21041433 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21041433 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Feb 20;21(4). pii: ijms21041433. doi: 10.3390/ijms21041433.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-8775-6115'],"['104-2320-B-194-004/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'R104-001/Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital']",,PMC7073086,,['NOTNLM'],"['E. coli nitroreductase gene', 'brain tumor', 'gene therapy', 'prodrug activator', 'retroviral replicating vector']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, dihalogenated nucleoside analogues were produced by thermostable nucleoside phosphorylases in transglycosylation reactions using uridine or thymidine as sugar donors. Prior to the enzymatic process, ideal maximum product yields were calculated after the determination of equilibrium constants through monitoring the equilibrium conversion in analytical-scale reactions. Equilibrium constants for dihalogenated nucleosides were comparable to known purine nucleosides, ranging between 0.071 and 0.081. To achieve 90% product yield in the enzymatic process, an approximately five-fold excess of sugar donor was needed. Nucleoside analogues were purified by semi-preparative HPLC, and yields of purified product were approximately 50% for all target compounds. To evaluate the impact of halogen atoms in positions 2 and 6 on the antiproliferative activity in leukemic cell lines, the cytotoxic potential of dihalogenated nucleoside analogues was studied in the leukemic cell line HL-60. Interestingly, the inhibition of HL-60 cells with dihalogenated nucleoside analogues was substantially lower than with monohalogenated cladribine, which is known to show high antiproliferative activity. Taken together, we demonstrate that thermodynamic calculations and small-scale experiments can be used to produce nucleoside analogues with high yields and purity on larger scales. The procedure can be used for the generation of new libraries of nucleoside analogues for screening experiments or to replace the chemical synthesis routes of marketed nucleoside drugs by enzymatic processes.","['Yehia, Heba', 'Westarp, Sarah', 'Rohrs, Viola', 'Kaspar, Felix', 'Giessmann, Robert T', 'Klare, Hendrik F T', 'Paulick, Katharina', 'Neubauer, Peter', 'Kurreck, Jens', 'Wagner, Anke']","['Yehia H', 'Westarp S', 'Rohrs V', 'Kaspar F', 'Giessmann RT', 'Klare HFT', 'Paulick K', 'Neubauer P', 'Kurreck J', 'Wagner A']","['Chair of Bioprocess Engineering, Faculty III Process Sciences, Institute of Biotechnology, Technische Universitat Berlin, Strasse des 17.

The objective of this work was to investigate substrate oxidation during submaximal exercise in survivors of childhood acute leukemia. METHODS: A total of 20 leukemia survivors and 20 healthy children were matched by sex, age, and Tanner stage. They all took a submaximal incremental exercise test to determine fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates. RESULTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was significantly lower in leukemia survivors, with lower relative VO2 peaks (p < 0.001), lower heart rate values (p = 0.02), and lower exercise power (p = 0.012), whereas rest metabolism and body mass index did not differ between the two groups. During exercise, upward of heart rate relative to VO2 peak was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in childhood leukemia survivors. We found lower carbohydrate and fat oxidation rates (p = 0.07) in leukemia survivors compared with healthy children, and also a significantly lower relative maximal fat oxidation rate (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION: Despite impaired physical fitness and metabolic response to exercise, childhood leukemia survivors remained sensitive to physical activity interventions, and could readily adapt to submaximal exercise intensity.","['Pegon, Charline', 'Rochette, Emmanuelle', 'Rouel, Nadege', 'Pereira, Bruno', 'Dore, Eric', 'Isfan, Florentina', 'Greze, Victoria', 'Merlin, Etienne', 'Kanold, Justyna', 'Duche, Pascale']","['Pegon C', 'Rochette E', 'Rouel N', 'Pereira B', 'Dore E', 'Isfan F', 'Greze V', 'Merlin E', 'Kanold J', 'Duche P']","['CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, CIC 1405, Unite CRECHE, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite de Toulon, Laboratoire IAPS, F-83041 Toulon, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, CIC 1405, Unite CRECHE, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Delegation de la Recherche Clinique et Innovations, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, CIC 1405, Unite CRECHE, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, CIC 1405, Unite CRECHE, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INRA, UMR 1019 UNH, ECREIN, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Pediatrie, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, INSERM, CIC 1405, Unite CRECHE, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Universite de Toulon, Laboratoire IAPS, F-83041 Toulon, France.', 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, Laboratoire des Adaptations Metaboliques en conditions Physiologiques et Physiopathologiques (AME2P), EA 3533, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200219,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,2020/02/26 06:00,2020/02/26 06:01,['2020/02/26 06:00'],"['2020/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9020562 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9020562 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Feb 19;9(2). pii: jcm9020562. doi: 10.3390/jcm9020562.,,"['Comite Departemental du Cantal, 2019/Ligue Contre le Cancer']",,PMC7073622,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'children', 'fat oxidation', 'metabolism', 'physical fitness']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The roles of NPM1 in different repair pathways remain however to be elucidated. NPM1 has been described to interact with APE1 (apurinic apyrimidinic endonuclease 1), a key enzyme of the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which could reflect a direct participation of NPM1 in this route. To gain insight into the possible role(s) of NPM1 in BER, we have explored the interplay between the subnuclear localization of both APE1 and NPM1, the in vitro interaction they establish, the effect of binding to abasic DNA on APE1 conformation, and the modulation by NPM1 of APE1 binding and catalysis on DNA. We have found that, upon oxidative damage, NPM1 is released from nucleoli and locates on patches throughout the chromatin, perhaps co-localizing with APE1, and that this traffic could be mediated by phosphorylation of NPM1 on T199. NPM1 and APE1 form a complex in vitro, involving, apart from the core domain, at least part of the linker region of NPM1, whereas the C-terminal domain is dispensable for binding, which explains that an AML leukemia-related NPM1 mutant with an unfolded C-terminal domain can bind APE1. APE1 interaction with abasic DNA stabilizes APE1 structure, as based on thermal unfolding. Moreover, our data suggest that NPM1, maybe by keeping APE1 in an ""open"" conformation, favours specific recognition of abasic sites on DNA, competing with off-target associations. Therefore, NPM1 might participate in BER favouring APE1 target selection as well as turnover from incised abasic DNA.","['Lopez, David J', 'de Blas, Ander', 'Hurtado, Mikel', 'Garcia-Alija, Mikel', 'Mentxaka, Jon', 'de la Arada, Igor', 'Urbaneja, Maria A', 'Alonso-Marino, Marian', 'Banuelos, Sonia']","['Lopez DJ', 'de Blas A', 'Hurtado M', 'Garcia-Alija M', 'Mentxaka J', 'de la Arada I', 'Urbaneja MA', 'Alonso-Marino M', 'Banuelos S']","['Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Biofisika Institute (UPV/EHU, CSIC) and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.

Although cephalostatin 1 is a highly effective anticancer drug, its availability limits its utilization. We previously reported the synthesis of two 12'alpha-hydroxy derivatives of cephalostatin 1 that induce cell death by activating the ER stress apoptosis signaling pathway. For the current work, we synthesized six C11-functionalized cephalostatin 1 analogues (CAs) to evaluate their biological activity. For the cytotoxic compounds, the induced apoptotic pathway was investigated. The C11-functionalized cephalostatin 1 analogues 5 and 6 (CA5 and CA6) were found to exhibit cytotoxic activity against K-562 leukemia cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells and DU-145 prostate cancer cells, while the remaining four analogues did not show anti-tumor activities against any of the cell lines. Our results indicated that CA5 and CA6 induced cell death via the atypical ER-dependent apoptosis pathway; they increased the expression of Smac/DIABLO, an inhibitor of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), which in turn facilitated the activation of different caspases including the ER-caspase 4 without cytochrome c release from mitochondria. CA5 and CA6 are promising anticancer agents due to their low GI50, the remarkable apoptosis pathway they induce which can overcome chemoresistance, and their very low toxicity to normal cells making them cephalostatin 1 utilizable alternatives.","['Nawasreh, Mansour M', 'Alzyoud, Elham I', 'Al-Mazaydeh, Zainab A', 'Rammaha, Majdoleen S', 'Yasin, Salem R', 'Tahtamouni, Lubna H']","['Nawasreh MM', 'Alzyoud EI', 'Al-Mazaydeh ZA', 'Rammaha MS', 'Yasin SR', 'Tahtamouni LH']","['Applied Sciences Department, Faculty of Engineering Technology, Al-Balqa Applied University, Amman 11134, Jordan.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, The Hashemite University, Zarqa 13115, Jordan; Department of Genetics, University of Szeged, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, The Hashemite University, Zarqa 13115, Jordan.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, The Hashemite University, Zarqa 13115, Jordan.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, The Hashemite University, Zarqa 13115, Jordan.', 'Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science, The Hashemite University, Zarqa 13115, Jordan; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, CO, USA.

Although categorized as favorable risk, long-term survival for these patients is only approximately 50% to 60%. Mutated (mut) or overexpressed KIT, a gene encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, has been found almost exclusively in CBF AML and may increase the risk of disease relapse. We tested the safety and clinical activity of dasatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, in combination with chemotherapy. Sixty-one adult patients with AML and CBF fusion transcripts (RUNX1/RUNX1T1 or CBFB/MYH11) were enrolled on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 10801. Patients received cytarabine/daunorubicin induction on days 1 to 7 and oral dasatinib 100 mg/d on days 8 to 21. Upon achieving complete remission, patients received consolidation with high-dose cytarabine followed by dasatinib 100 mg/d on days 6 to 26 for 4 courses, followed by dasatinib 100 mg/d for 12 months. Fifteen (25%) patients were older (aged >/=60 years); 67% were CBFB/MYH11-positive, and 19% harbored KITmut. There were no unexpected or dose-limiting toxicities. Fifty-five (90%) patients achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 45 months, only 16% have relapsed. The 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates were 75% and 77% (79% and 85% for younger patients [aged <60 years], and 60% and 51% for older patients). Patients with KITmut had comparable outcome to those with wild-type KIT (3-year rates: disease-free survival, 67% vs 75%; overall survival, 73% vs 76%), thereby raising the question of whether dasatinib may overcome the negative impact of these genetic lesions.

The genes of the KIR locus are organized into either KIR B haplotypes, containing 1 or more activating KIR genes or KIR A haplotypes, which lack those genes. Analysis of unrelated donor (URD) hematopoietic cell transplants (HCT), given to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients between 1988 and 2009, showed that KIR B haplotype donors were associated with better outcomes, primarily from relapse protection. Most of these transplants involved marrow grafts, fully myeloablative (MAC) preparative regimens, and significant HLA mismatch. Because the practice of HCT continues to evolve, with increasing use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC), peripheral blood stem cell grafts, and better HLA match, we evaluated the impact of URD KIR genotype on HCT outcome for AML in the modern era (2010-2016). This analysis combined data from a prospective trial testing URD selection based on KIR genotypes (n = 243) with that from a larger contemporaneous cohort of transplants (n = 2419). We found that KIR B haplotype donors conferred a significantly reduced risk of leukemia relapse and improved disease-free survival after RIC, but not MAC HCT. All genes defining KIR B haplotypes were associated with relapse protection, which was significant only in transplant recipients expressing the C1 epitope of HLA-C.

While there are a number of well-recognized prognostic biomarkers at diagnosis, the most powerful independent prognostic factor is the response of the leukemia to induction chemotherapy (Campana and Pui: Blood 129 (2017) 1913-1918). Given the potential for machine learning to improve precision medicine, we tested its capacity to monitor disease in children undergoing ALL treatment. Diagnostic and on-treatment bone marrow samples were labeled with an ALL-discriminating antibody combination and analyzed by imaging flow cytometry. Ignoring the fluorescent markers and using only features extracted from bright-field and dark-field cell images, a deep learning model was able to identify ALL cells at an accuracy of >88%. This antibody-free, single cell method is cheap, quick, and could be adapted to a simple, laser-free cytometer to allow automated, point-of-care testing to detect slow early responders. Adaptation to other types of leukemia is feasible, which would revolutionize residual disease monitoring. (c) 2020 The Authors.

Whereas several studies have evaluated NGAL levels in hematological malignancy, using peripheral blood (PB). Recently, bone marrow (BM) NGAL level was reported to be higher than PB NGAL level in individuals with hematological malignancy, suggesting that BM NGAL would reflect BM microenvironment better than PB NGAL. We measured BM NGAL levels in patients with hematological malignancy, comparing those with NGAL levels in normal BM. We evaluated the association of BM NGAL with hematological parameters including neutrophil counts. METHODS: BM samples were collected from 107 patients who underwent BM examination. Immunoassays were used to assess NGAL levels. Data on hematological parameters were collected from medical records. Intergroup comparisons were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis H test and Pearson chi-square test. Single and multiple regression analyses were performed to analyze the relationships. RESULTS: The independent factors that affected the BM NGAL level were neutrophil counts and BM band neutrophil%, while neutrophil count was the main influencing factor. The acute myeloid leukemia (n = 18) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 25) groups showed statistically lower BM NGAL levels than patients with normal BM. The myeloproliferative neoplasm group (n = 34) showed higher BM NGAL levels than patients with normal BM, but this difference was not statistically significant. Neutrophil counts and BM band neutrophil% showed intergroup patterns similar to those of BM NGAL levels. CONCLUSION: BM NGAL was related to neutrophil count and BM band neutrophil%, showing different levels according to hematological malignant disease entities.","['Cho, Chi-Hyun', 'Cha, Jaehyung', 'Chang, Eun-Ah', 'Nam, Myung-Hyun', 'Park, Seo-Jin', 'Sung, Hwa Jung', 'Lee, Se Ryeon']","['Cho CH', 'Cha J', 'Chang EA', 'Nam MH', 'Park SJ', 'Sung HJ', 'Lee SR']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan-si, Korea.', 'Medical Science Research Center, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan-si, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan-si, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan-si, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan-si, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan-si, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, College of Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Ansan-si, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200224,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis/blood', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood', 'Humans', 'Lipocalin-2/*analysis/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood', 'Neoplasms, Plasma Cell/blood', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/25 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/02/25 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.23253 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2020 Jun;34(6):e23253. doi: 10.1002/jcla.23253.

Therapeutic armamentarium of CLL has changed recently following the introduction of novel active agents. AREAS COVERED: This review presents the current state of knowledge about biologic drugs used in the treatment of patients with CLL. It also discusses the biologics under evaluation in clinical trials and their potential future perspectives. A literature review of the MEDLINE database for articles was conducted via PubMed. Publications from 2000 through October 2019 were scrutinized using the search terms monoclonal antibodies, alloHSCT, vaccines and CAR-T in conjunction with CLL. Conference proceedings from the previous five years of the ASH and EHA Annual Scientific Meetings were searched manually. Additional relevant publications were obtained by reviewing the references from the chosen articles. EXPERT OPINION: When used in combination with chemotherapy and, more recently, with the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are among the standard methods used for CLL treatment. Among the new mAbs, anti-ROR1 directed cirmtuzumab seems to have the most promising results. Adoptive immunotherapy with CAR-T is an area of intensive research, giving hope for achieving remission in patients with CLL refractory to all other methods of treatment.","['Hus, Iwona', 'Salomon-Perzynski, Aleksander', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Hus I', 'Salomon-Perzynski A', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine , Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine , Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital , Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200303,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Biological Products/*therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",2020/02/25 06:00,2021/01/13 06:00,['2020/02/25 06:00'],"['2020/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2020.1734557 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2020 Jul;20(7):799-812. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2020.1734557.

Over the years, the use of TG was also explored for other, mainly immune-mediated and inflammatory, diseases such as in the field of dermatology and rheumatology (e.g. psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)) and gastroenterology and hepatology (e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), autoimmune hepatitis).Areas covered: This review provides a comprehensive overview of all the clinical uses of TG and describes its mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic features, and toxicity.Expert opinion: Thioguanine has shown beneficial clinical effects in hematological (particularly leukemia) and several immune-inflammatory diseases including psoriasis, SLE, polycythemia vera, Churg-Strauss syndrome, IBD, collagenous sprue, refractory celiac disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. Thioguanine is not effective in treating solid-cancers. At relatively low dosages, i.e. 0.2- 0.3mg/kg/day or 20 mg/day, TG has a favorable risk-benefit ratio and is a safe and effective drug in the long-term treatment of amongst other IBD patients. Thioguanine toxicity, especially myelotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity, including nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver, is limited when dosed adequately. The occurrence of NRH appears dose-dependent and has been especially described during high dose TG above 40 mg/day.","['Bayoumy, Ahmed B', 'Simsek, Melek', 'Seinen, Margien L', 'Mulder, Chris J J', 'Ansari, Azhar', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'De Boer, Nanne K']","['Bayoumy AB', 'Simsek M', 'Seinen ML', 'Mulder CJJ', 'Ansari A', 'Peters GJ', 'De Boer NK']","['Amsterdam UMC, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, VU University Medical Center, AG&M Research Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Surrey and Sussex NHS, Easy Surrey Hospital, Surrey, UK.', 'Amsterdam UMC, VU University Medical Center, Laboratory Medical Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Amsterdam UMC, Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, VU University Medical Center, AG&M Research Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200224,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Thioguanine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",2020/02/25 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2020/02/25 06:00'],"['2020/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17425255.2020.1719996 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2020 Feb;16(2):111-123. doi: 10.1080/17425255.2020.1719996.

This study established the value of mutations based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) and multiparameter flow cytometric measurable residual disease (MFC-MRD) detection and compared the outcomes. From 2014 to 2018, 124 newly diagnosed bi CEBPA AML patients were treated. The median age was 37.5 (16-69) years. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were 33.0%, 64.7% and 84.3%, respectively. Patients without additional mutations and with GATA2 mutations were defined as 'NGS low risk', which was the only favourable independent factor for CIR and RFS of pretreatment parameters. Patients with sustained positive MRD after two consolidation cycles and MRD negative losses at any time were defined as 'MRD high risk', which was the only poor independent factor for CIR, RFS and OS, including pretreatment and post-treatment parameters. In CR2 and non-remission patients who underwent allo-HSCT, superior OS was achieved. We conclude that NGS low risk was a favourable factor in the analysis of pretreatment parameters. MRD risk stratification was an independent prognostic factor in pretreatment and post-treatment parameters. Relapsed patients still have a favourable outcome followed by allo-HSCT.","['Wang, Jing', 'Lu, RunQing', 'Wu, Ying', 'Jia, JinSong', 'Gong, Lizhong', 'Liu, XiaoHong', 'Lu, ShengYe', 'Wang, Yu', 'Yan,

In addition, Hhex regulates hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, emergency hematopoiesis, and acute myeloid leukemia initiation and maintenance. Hhex mediates its effects on HSCs and acute myeloid leukemia stem cells via repression of the Cdkn2a tumor suppressor locus. However, we report here that loss of Cdkn2a does not rescue the failure of lymphoid development caused by loss of Hhex. As loss of Hhex causes apoptosis of lymphoid progenitors associated with impaired Bcl2 expression and defective Stat5b signaling, we tested the effects of rescuing these pathways using transgenic mice. Expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl2, but not activated Stat5, rescued the development of T-, B-, and NK-cell lineages in the absence of Hhex. These results indicate that Bcl2 expression, but not Stat5b signaling or loss of Cdkn2a, can overcome the lymphoid deficiencies caused by the absence of Hhex, suggesting that the primary role of this transcription factor is to promote survival of lymphoid progenitors during early lymphoid development.","['Jackson, Jacob T', ""O'Donnell, Kristy"", 'Light, Amanda', 'Goh, Wilford', 'Huntington, Nicholas D', 'Tarlinton, David M', 'McCormack, Matthew P']","['Jackson JT', ""O'Donnell K"", 'Light A', 'Goh W', 'Huntington ND', 'Tarlinton DM', 'McCormack MP']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Immunology and Pathology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200304,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CDKN2A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Hhex protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5b protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics/immunology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*immunology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoid Progenitor Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/immunology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*immunology']",2020/02/25 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/25 06:00'],"['2019/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201948371 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2020 Jul;50(7):959-971. doi: 10.1002/eji.201948371.

We studied through flow cytometry the expression of CD146 on different T cells, and B-cell ALL blasts trying to correlate its expression with different prognostic factors of B-cell ALL and treatment outcomes. Patients and Methods. All pediatric patients with B-cell ALL were subjected to bone marrow examination and cytochemistry, flow cytometric immunophenotyping using monoclonal antibodies utilized for diagnosis of B-ALL including CD34, CD19, CD10, CD22, and intracellular IgM. The diagnosis was based on standard morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic followed by flow cytometric detection of CD146 expression on blast cells, CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells. Results: Significant accumulations of CD146(+)CD4(+) cells, CD146(+)CD8(+) cells, CD4(+), CD8(+), and lymphocytes in patients were compared to controls, the mean percentages of CD146(+)CD4(+) cells, CD146(+)CD8(+) cells, and CD146(+) blasts were significantly higher in patients than controls, and in addition, these cells were associated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. The median OS for patients with complete response was 22 +/- 1.633 (95%CI = 18.799-25.201), while for those without complete response, it was 13 +/- 3.928 (95%CI = 5.301-25.699), with log-rank = 5.71, P = 0.017.

A 23-year-old female presented to the emergency department (ED) with two days of worsening bilateral blurry vision and bitemporal headache. Her ocular exam was significant for bilateral intraretinal hemorrhages consistent with CRVO with chest radiograph demonstrating widened mediastinum with perihilar lymphadenopathy and serologic testing revealing ALL with blast crisis. The patient was subsequently admitted to the oncology service for induction chemotherapy. Patients with new headache and bilateral vision changes should prompt a thorough neurological and ophthalmologic exam to assess for underlying systemic pathologies. Concurrent bilateral CRVO is a rare but specific finding for systemic hyperviscosity syndrome, blood dyscrasia, polycythemia, or other serious illness.

Methods: Using a commercial assay, asparaginase activity was monitored following pegaspargase (2500 units/m (2)) in newly diagnosed children and young adults with B- and T-cell ALL from February 2013 to May 2017. The incidence of allergic reactions before and after initiation of premedication in May 2015 was compared. Results: One patient out of 59 (1.7%) had silent inactivation after the second dose. No patient had silent inactivation after the first pegaspargase dose and no standard risk B-cell ALL patients, who received only two pegaspargase doses in combination with oral dexamethasone, had silent inactivation. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 allergic reactions was 3.7% per dose with premedication (methylprednisolone, acetaminophen and diphenhydramine) versus 5.2% without. The incidence per patient with premedication given for most of the doses was 8.3% versus 17% without. These values are not statistically significant. Premedication did not affect pegaspargase activity. Conclusions: Due to the low incidence of silent inactivation with intravenous pegaspargase and the unlikely event patients receiving only two doses of pegasparaginase would receive erwinase for this possible transient silent inactivation, we recommend routine monitoring of pegaspargase activity only in patients scheduled to receive more than two doses.","['Losasso, Michael', 'Bostrom, Bruce', 'Messinger, Yoav']","['Losasso M', 'Bostrom B', 'Messinger Y']","['University of St. Thomas, 2115 Summit Avenue, St. Paul, Minnesota, 55105, USA.', ""Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Minnesota, 2525 Chicago Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55404, USA."", ""Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Minnesota, 2525 Chicago Avenue South, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55404, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190704,England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Premedication', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/25 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2020/02/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.19298.2 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2019 Jul 4;8:1007. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.19298.2. eCollection 2019.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-7974-1271', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7990-1802']",,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Losasso M et al.'],PMC7001754,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Allergy', '*Anaphylaxis', '*Pegasparginase Activity', '*Premedication', '*Silent Inactivation']",,,['No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.8281826.v1'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the significance of direct contact between HRS cells and TAMs has not been elucidated. HRS cells and TAMs are known to express PD-L1, which leads to PD-1(+) CD4(+) T cell exhaustion in cHL. Here, we found that PD-L1/L2 expression was elevated in monocytes co-cultured with HRS cells within 1 h, but not in monocytes cultured with supernatants of HRS cells. Immunofluorescence analysis of PD-L1/L2 revealed that their upregulation resulted in membrane transfer called ""trogocytosis"" from HRS cells to monocytes. PD-L1/L2 upregulation was not observed in monocytes co-cultured with PD-L1/L2-deficient HRS cells, validating the hypothesis that there is a direct transfer of PD-L1/L2 from HRS cells to monocytes. In the patients, both ligands (PD-L1/L2) were upregulated in TAMs in contact with HRS cells, but not in TAMs distant from HRS cells, suggesting that trogocytosis occurs in cHL patients. Taken together, trogocytosis may be one of the mechanisms that induces rapid upregulation of PD-L1/L2 in monocytes to evade antitumor immunity through the suppression of T cells as mediated by MHC antigen presentation.","['Kawashima, Masaharu', 'Carreras, Joaquim', 'Higuchi, Hiroshi', 'Kotaki, Ryutaro', 'Hoshina, Takahiro', 'Okuyama, Kazuki', 'Suzuki, Naoto', 'Kakizaki, Masatoshi', 'Miyatake,

Since that discovery, Western scientists, together with their Chinese counterparts, have begun to investigate how TCM compositions can be utilized to discover new agents, sometimes the actual TCM-based compound(s) but also by utilizing the pharmacophores from such preparations that have utility in human diseases. The examples in this review include artemisinin derivatives and their manifold bioactivities, indirubins and derivatives as antitumor agents, arsenicals predominately as treatment for leukemia, though extending into other cancer types. Finally, there are sections discussing the use of current computerized techniques that combine metabolomics, mass spectroscopy/HPLC, and network pharmacology with the aim of identifying the ""active principles"" in relevant TCM preparations and finally how high content screening can be utilized in conjunction with the other analytical techniques.","['Newman, David J']",['Newman DJ'],"['Newman Consulting LLC, Wayne, PA, United States.

Exclusion criteria were non-research articles, systematic reviews, conference abstracts, editorials, commentaries, correspondence, and case reports. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, data were extracted, appraised, and synthesized. Sixteen articles met the inclusion criteria. Sample sizes across studies ranged from 184 to 31,866 participants. The factors most associated with disparities in OS included: age at diagnosis (e.g., <1 year and/or >10 years old), differences in clinical prognosticators (e.g., white blood cell count at diagnosis, T-cell vs. precursor B-cell immunophenotype, central nervous system disease status, cytogenetic profile) and lower socioeconomic status.

In this retrospective study, we aimed to compare outcome in elderly patients treated with different post-remission modalities, including allogenic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), intensive chemotherapy, and standard-dose chemotherapy (repeated 1 + 5 regimen). We collected data of 441 patients >/= 60 years in first CR from a single institution. Median age was 67 years. Sixty-one (14%) patients received allo-HSCT, 51 (12%) auto-HSCT, 70 (16%) intensive chemotherapy with intermediate- or high-dose cytarabine (I/HDAC), and 190 (43%) 1 + 5 regimen. Median follow-up was 6.5 years. In multivariate analysis, allo-HSCT, cytogenetics, and PS had a significant impact on OS and LFS. In spite of a more favorable-risk profile, the patients who received I/HDAC had no significantly better LFS as compared with patients treated with 1 + 5 (median LFS 8.8 months vs 10.6 months, p = 0.96). In transplanted patients, median LFS was 13.3 months for auto-HSCT and 25.8 months for allo-HSCT. Pre-transplant chemotherapy with I/HDAC had no effect on the outcome. Toxicity was significantly increased for both transplanted and non-transplanted patients treated with I/HDAC, with more units of blood and platelet transfusion and more time spent in hospitalization, but no higher non-relapse mortality. This study shows that post-remission chemotherapy intensification is not associated with significantly better outcome as compared with standard-dose chemotherapy in elderly patients for whom, overall results remain disappointing.","['Bouchacourt, B', 'Hospital, M A', 'Zemmour, C', 'Rey, J', ""d'Incan, E"", 'Charbonnier, A', 'Mohty, B', 'Saillard, C', 'Bonnet, S', 'Collignon, A', 'Gelsi-Boyer, V', 'Mozziconacci, M J', 'Blaise, D', 'Vey, N']","['Bouchacourt B', 'Hospital MA', 'Zemmour C', 'Rey J', ""d'Incan E"", 'Charbonnier A', 'Mohty B', 'Saillard C', 'Bonnet S', 'Collignon A', 'Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Blaise D', 'Vey N']","['Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France. hospitalma@ipc.unicancer.fr.', 'Department of Clinical Research & Innovation, Biostatics & Methodology Unit, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Univ, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix-Marseille Univ, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200222,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'HDAC protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Transfusion', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/24 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03922-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03922-w [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):773-780. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03922-w.

Both kinds of drugs harbor their own advantages and disadvantages in the treatment of cancer, and the development of small molecules which could target at kinases and epigenetic targets simultaneously can avoid the defects of drugs which only targets at kinases or epigenetic proteins. In this study, a series of 4,5-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazolo [4,3-f]pteridine derivatives were designed and synthesized based on the structure of PLK1 inhibitor BI-2536. Subsequent targets affinity screen and antiproliferative activity test led to the discovery of the most potent dual PLK1/BRD4 inhibitor 9b with good potency for both PLK1 (IC50 = 22 nM) and BRD4 (IC50 = 109 nM) as well as favorable antiproliferative activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. 9b could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cell line MV 4-11 in a concentration dependent manner. It could also downregulate the transcription of several proliferation-related oncogenes, including c-MYC, MYCN and BCL-2. Finally, in a MV4-11 mouse xenograft model, 9b exhibited favorable in vivo antitumor activity with 66% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at a dose of 60 mg/kg while without obvious toxicity. This study thus provided us a start point for the development of new dual PLK1/BRD4 inhibitors as anticancer agents.","['Wang, Ning-Yu', 'Xu, Ying', 'Xiao, Kun-Jie', 'Zuo, Wei-Qiong', 'Zhu, Yong-Xia', 'Hu, Rong', 'Wang, Wan-Li', 'Shi, Yao-Jie', 'Yu, Luo-Ting', 'Liu, Zhi-Hao']","['Wang NY', 'Xu Y', 'Xiao KJ', 'Zuo WQ', 'Zhu YX', 'Hu R', 'Wang WL', 'Shi YJ', 'Yu LT', 'Liu ZH']","['School of Life Science and Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China.

We found that the expression of FAS-AS1 was downregulated in HQ-TK6 cells and workers exposed to benzene longer than 1.5 years via histone acetylation, and FAS-AS1 expression was negatively correlated with the time of benzene exposure. Restoration of FAS-AS1 in HQ-TK6 cells promoted apoptosis and inhibited tumorigenicity in female nude mice. Interestingly, treatment with a DNMT inhibitor (5-aza-2-deoxycytidine), histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A), or DNMT3b knockout led to increased FAS-AS1 through increased H3K27ac protein expression in HQ-TK6 cells, and DNMT3b knockout decreased H3K27ac and DNMT3b enrichment to the FAS-AS1 promoter region, which suggested that DNMT3b and/or histone acetylation involve FAS-AS1 expression. Importantly, restoration of FAS-AS1 resulted in reduced expression of DNMT3b and SIRT1 and increased expression of FAS in both HQ-TK6 cells and xenograft tissues. Moreover, the average DNMT3b expression in 17 paired workers exposed to benzene within 1.5 years was decreased, but that of the remaining 103 paired workers with longer exposure times was increased. Conversely, DNMT3b was negatively correlated with FAS-AS1 expression. Both FAS-AS1 and DNMT3b influenced the enrichment of H3K27ac in the FAS promoter region by regulating the expression of SIRT1, consequently upregulating FAS expression. Taken together, these observations demonstrate crosstalk between FAS-AS1 and DNMT3b via a mutual inhibition loop and indicate a new mechanism by which FAS-AS1 regulates the expression of FAS in benzene-related carcinogenesis.","['Yuan, Qian', 'Zhang, Haiqiao', 'Pan, Zhijie', 'Ling, Xiaoxuan', 'Wu, Minhua', 'Gui, Zhiming', 'Chen, Jialong', 'Peng, Jianming', 'Liu, Zhidong', 'Tan, Qiang', 'Huang, Dongsheng', 'Xiu, Liangchang', 'Chen, Wen', 'Shi, Zhizhen', 'Liu, Linhua']","['Yuan Q', 'Zhang H', 'Pan Z', 'Ling X', 'Wu M', 'Gui Z', 'Chen J', 'Peng J', 'Liu Z', 'Tan Q', 'Huang D', 'Xiu L', 'Chen W', 'Shi Z', 'Liu L']","['Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, 524001, PR China.', 'Department of Urology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, 524001, PR China.', 'Department of Occupational Health and Occupational Medicine, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Tropical Disease Research, School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, PR China.', 'Huizhou Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment, Huizhou, 516001, PR China.', 'Huizhou Hospital for Occupational Disease Prevention and Treatment, Huizhou, 516001, PR China.', 'Foshan Institute of Occupational Disease Prevention and Control, Foshan, 528000, PR China.', 'Guangdong Medical University Affiliated Longhua District Central Hospital, Shenzhen, PR China.', 'Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China; Department of Histology and Embryology, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang, 524001, PR China.', 'Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health Risk Assessment, Department of Toxicology, School of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.', 'Dongguan Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, School of Public Health, Guangdong Medical University, Dongguan, 523808, PR China.

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative therapy. However, patients may be at an increased risk for transplant-related toxicity (TRT) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) due to their underlying disease biology. We performed a retrospective case-control study of pediatric patients with BMF/MDS/AML with germline GATA2 mutations, comparing HSCT outcomes to randomly selected patients without germline GATA2 mutations and BMF/MDS (control A) and acute leukemia (control B). The 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates in the GATA2 cohort (65%, 51%) were similar to control A (58%, 49%) and B (45%, 43%) cohorts. In contrast, the 5-year event-free survival rate was significantly lower in the GATA2 cohort (7% +/- 6%, 28% +/- 10%, and 33% +/- 8% for GATA2, A, and B, respectively), due to an increased number of unique TRTs. Specifically, neurologic toxicities occurred significantly more frequently in GATA2 patients than in the control groups, and post-HSCT thrombotic events occurred only in the GATA2 cohort. There was no difference in TRM, infections, or graft-versus-host disease across groups. The higher incidence of thrombotic and neurologic events specific to GATA2 patients warrants further investigation and has potential treatment ramifications.","['Hofmann, Inga', 'Avagyan, Serine', 'Stetson, Alyssa', 'Guo, Dongjing', 'Al-Sayegh, Hasan', 'London, Wendy B', 'Lehmann, Leslie']","['Hofmann I', 'Avagyan S', 'Stetson A', 'Guo D', 'Al-Sayegh H', 'London WB', 'Lehmann L']","[""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts; Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.

We collected data on all patients who had undergone allo-HCT at our center (Copenhagen University Hospital) between 2000 and 2018. In total, 215 patients with MDS (n = 196) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 19) were included. Estimated 1-year overall survival (OS) was 70.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.2% to 77.0%), and the median survival was 7.7 years (95% CI, 4.7 to indeterminable). There was a significant improvement in OS over time (P = .011, comparing 2000 to 2010, 2010 to 2014, and 2014 to 2018). Treatment was standardized throughout the study period, allowing comparison between patients receiving nonmyeloablative (NMA, n = 124), standard myeloablative (SMA, n = 36), and fludarabine and treosulfan (FluTreo, n = 55) conditioning. FluTreo has myeloablative properties but lower toxicity and replaced standard myeloablative conditioning at our center in 2014. The FluTreo group was significantly older and had more comorbidities than the SMA group but similar disease severity. One-year OS was 84.0% (95% CI, 74.3% to 94.9%), 58.3% (95% CI, 44.3% to 76.9%), and 68.3% (95% CI, 60.2% to 77.5%) for FluTreo, SMA, and NMA, respectively (P = .04). In univariate analysis, Revised International Scoring System (IPSS-R) (high versus low), donor sex mismatch, and cytomegalovirus status mismatch were significant factors for OS. In multivariate analysis of OS including age, IPSS-R, and HCT specific comorbidity index, NMA was borderline inferior to FluTreo (P = .073) while SMA was significantly inferior to FluTreo with a hazard ratio of 6.89 (95% CI, 2.53 to 18.77, P < .001). The introduction of FluTreo allowed us to administer a myeloablative regimen to a broader patient group and shows promising results.","['Wedge, Eileen', 'Sengelov, Henrik', 'Hansen, Jakob Werner', 'Andersen, Niels Smedegaard', 'Schjodt, Ida', 'Petersen, Soren Lykke', 'Kornblit, Brian', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten', 'Friis, Lone Smidstrup']","['Wedge E', 'Sengelov H', 'Hansen JW', 'Andersen NS', 'Schjodt I', 'Petersen SL', 'Kornblit B', 'Gronbaek K', 'Friis LS']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen University Hospital), Copenhagen, Denmark; Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark; The Danish Stem Cell Center (Danstem), University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.

Current National Marrow Donor Program policy recommends 5 days of daily filgrastim, followed by either 1 or 2 days of apheresis for unrelated donors, depending on collection center choice. To date, there are no published studies comparing the differences in donor experience between 1 day and 2 days of apheresis. We examined 22,348 adult unrelated donor collections in 184 centers between 2006 and 2016. Of these 22,348 donors, 20,004 (89.5%) had collection on 1 day, and the other 2344 (9.5%) had collection over 2 days. Information on why donors underwent apheresis in 1 day or 2 days was not available. Donors who underwent apheresis in 1 day were more likely to be male (67% versus 46%; P < .001), younger (age <30 years, 48% versus 36%; P < .001), and have a higher body weight (83.0 kg versus 75.9 kg; P< .001) and body mass index (BMI; >30, 30% versus 22%; P < .001). Successful collection of the requested CD34(+) cell count was achieved on the first day in 82% of 1-day collections and in 16% of 2-day collections. Despite not administering filgrastim the evening after the first day of collection in patients who underwent 2 days of apheresis, the median concentration of CD34(+) cells/L in the product was higher on the second day of apheresis compared with the first day (23.8 x 10(6) CD34(+)/L on day 1 versus 28.7 x 10(6) CD34(+)/L on day 2; P< .001). Donors who underwent collection in 1 day were less likely to experience citrate toxicity (36% versus 52%; P< .001), hospitalization (1% versus 6%; P< .001), and other side effects related to apheresis (Modified Toxicity Criteria incidence: 20% versus 26%; P < .001). Female sex, older age, collection via central lines, and higher BMI were factors associated with greater likelihood for the development of toxicity, whereas less toxicity was noted in those with higher CD34(+) counts and more blood processed on the first day of collection. We conclude that although unrelated donors can be successfully collected in 1 day or 2 days, 1-day apheresis procedures were associated with less overall toxicity, and thus we recommend single-day collections, especially if the requested number of cells have been collected in 1 day.","['Hsu, Jack W', 'Shaw, Bronwen E', 'Kim, Soyoung', 'Logan, Brent R', 'Sees, Jennifer A', 'Confer, Dennis L', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'Shah, Nirali', 'Switzer, Galen E', 'Abidi, Muneer H', 'Ahmed, Ibrahim A', 'Anderlini, Paulo N', 'Bredeson, Christopher', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Dandoy, Christopher E', 'Diaz, Miguel Angel', 'Farhadfar, Nosha', 'Ganguly, Siddhartha', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Hematti, Peiman', 'Kamble, Rammurti T', 'Kasow, Kimberly A', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'Liesveld, Jane L', 'Murthy, Hemant S', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Schears, Raquel', 'Seo, Sachiko', 'Solh, Melhern', 'Spitzer, Thomas', 'Steinberg, Amir', 'Sugrue, Michele', 'Warkentin, Phyllis', 'Wingard, John R']","['Hsu JW', 'Shaw BE', 'Kim S', 'Logan BR', 'Sees JA', 'Confer DL', 'Pulsipher MA', 'Shah N', 'Switzer GE', 'Abidi MH', 'Ahmed IA', 'Anderlini PN', 'Bredeson C', 'Chhabra S', 'Dandoy CE', 'Diaz MA', 'Farhadfar N', 'Ganguly S', 'Gergis U', 'Hale GA', 'Hematti P', 'Kamble RT', 'Kasow KA', 'Lazarus HM', 'Liesveld JL', 'Murthy HS', 'Olsson RF', 'Savani BN', 'Schears R', 'Seo S', 'Solh M', 'Spitzer T', 'Steinberg A', 'Sugrue M', 'Warkentin P', 'Wingard JR']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.

In myeloid neoplasms (MNs), chromothripsis was linked to poor prognosis and specific genetic alterations (complex karyotype, 5q deletions, and loss of TP53). However, the clinicopathologic features of MNs with chromothripsis have not been thoroughly characterized. We identified chromothripsis in 11 cases of MNs (9 acute myeloid leukemia [AML] and 2 myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS] cases) and noted that all chromothripsis-positive AML cases were AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC). We performed a comparative clinicopathologic and genetic characterization of AML-MRC cases with and without chromothripsis. AML-MRC with chromothripsis is associated with lower white blood cell and platelet counts and higher degree of karyotypic complexity. Chromothripsis in AML-MRC most frequently involves chromosomes 8 and 11 with consequent amplification of either MYC or KMT2A. Comparative morphologic assessment of blast morphology revealed unique features characteristic of AML-MRC with chromothripsis: a variable degree of cytoplasmic vacuolization, granulation, and blebbing. These morphologic markers in the context of AML-MRC may prompt additional studies to identify cases with chromothripsis.","['Gao, Juehua', 'Chen, Yi-Hua', 'Mina, Alain', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Kim, Kwang-Youn', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Jennings, Lawrence', 'Sukhanova, Madina']","['Gao J', 'Chen YH', 'Mina A', 'Altman JK', 'Kim KY', 'Zhang Y', 'Lu X', 'Jennings L', 'Sukhanova M']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine - Biostatistics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.

Here we explore the association of pesticide exposure in pregnancy and early childhood with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) utilizing land use and pesticide use data in a sophisticated GIS tool. METHODS: We identified cancer cases less than 6 years of age from the California Cancer Registry and cancer-free controls from birth certificates. Analyses were restricted to those living in rural areas and born 1998-2011, resulting in 162 cases of childhood leukemia and 9,805 controls. Possible carcinogens were selected from the Environmental Protection Agency's classifications and pesticide use was collected from the California Department of Pesticide Regulation's (CDPR) Pesticide Use Reporting (PUR) system and linked to land-use surveys. Exposures for subjects were assessed using a 4000m buffer around the geocoded residential addresses at birth. Unconditional logistic and hierarchical regression models were used to assess individual pesticide and pesticide class associations. RESULTS: We observed elevated risks for ALL with exposure to any carcinogenic pesticide (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 2.83, 95% CI: 1.67-4.82), diuron (Single-pesticide model, adjusted (OR): 2.38, 95% CI: 1.57-3.60), phosmet (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.46-3.02), kresoxim-methyl (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.14-2.75), and propanil (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.44-4.63). Analyses based on chemical classes showed elevated risks for the group of 2,6-dinitroanilines (OR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.56-3.99), anilides (OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.38-3.36), and ureas (OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.42-3.34). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that in rural areas of California exposure to certain pesticides or pesticide classes during pregnancy due to residential proximity to agricultural applications may increase the risk of childhood ALL and AML. Future studies into the mechanisms of carcinogenicity of these pesticides may be beneficial.","['Park, Andrew S', 'Ritz, Beate', 'Yu, Fei', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Heck, Julia E']","['Park AS', 'Ritz B', 'Yu F', 'Cockburn M', 'Heck JE']","['Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, 650 Charles E.

In this study, we focused on the correlation between environmentally relevant levels of BPA exposure and histone modification during endometrial stromal cells decidualization. BPA exposure changed the morphology of decidualized endometrial stromal cells, with inhibition of mixed-lineage leukemia 1(MLL1) and induction of enhancer of zeste homolog2 (EZH2) during in vitro decidualization. The expression of HOXA10, PRL and IGFBP-1 was down-regulated upon BPA treatment. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR(ChIP-qPCR) was performed to evaluate the recruitment of histone-3, lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone-3, lysine-27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at the gene promoters. The decreased H3K4me3 and the increased H3K27me3 at HOXA10, PRL and IGFBP-1 promoter regions were consistent with the expression of MLL1 and EZH2 respectively. The effect of BPA on MLL1 and EZH2 could be abrogated by ICI 182,780.

While currently available therapies are effective in controlling HBV replication, they rarely achieve functional cure. Similarly, effective treatment options for HBV-related HCC (HBV-HCC) are limited and primarily applicable only for early stages of the disease. With the general success of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy against B-cell leukemia, adoptively transferring engineered autologous T cells specific for HBV or HCC antigens might represent a promising therapeutic approach for both chronic HBV infection and HBV-HCC. This review will describe the novel T cell-related immunotherapies being developed for both indications and discuss the approach of each strategy, their considerations and limitations when applied for treatment of chronic HBV infection (CHB) and HBV-HCC.","['Tan, Anthony T', 'Schreiber, Sophia']","['Tan AT', 'Schreiber S']","['Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme, DUKE-NUS Medical School, Singapore.

Verma Excellence Award for Young Pediatricians Delivered as Oration on 29th Sept. 2019.,443-450,10.1007/s12098-020-03234-x [doi],"Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is an effective therapy for children and adolescents with chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). For the majority of patients with CML in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), imatinib is the TKI of choice for reasons of cost, availability, and experience. Children are exposed to therapy for a greater proportion of their lifetime as compared to adults. The adverse effects of prolonged administration of TKI is a subject of ongoing research, as more experience is collected. Therapy with TKI is currently considered to be life-long. Trials on stopping treatment are ongoing to explore if it may be feasible in selected patients, as reported in adults. Growth-failure is a concerning adverse effect. Currently, it seems unclear if the final height attained is within the expected range of the mid-parenteral height and growth standards. Whether the children will achieve a normal height at the end of their growth potential or remain below the predicted range is critical to decide if therapeutic interventions (E.g., growth hormone therapy, or interruption in TKI) should be considered during the period of growth potential. Research on CML in children is at a relatively slow pace, largely due to the rarity of the disease. This provides a unique opportunity for research in population-dense LMICs, as several tertiary centers tend to have a sizable cohort of children and adolescents with CML on follow-up. This narrative summarises the challenges and opportunities in dealing with CML in children, particularly in reference to a center in LMIC.","['Bansal, Deepak']",['Bansal D'],"['Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Center, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. deepakbansaldr@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200221,India,Indian J Pediatr,Indian journal of pediatrics,0417442,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Awards and Prizes', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Pediatricians', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2020/02/23 06:00'],"['2019/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12098-020-03234-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12098-020-03234-x [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Pediatr. 2020 Jun;87(6):443-450. doi: 10.1007/s12098-020-03234-x.

The three-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were 56% for patients receiving both p/pDLI and intensified myeloablative conditioning (MAC) (intenseMAC) and 30% for those who received neither therapy per landmark analysis. Multivariable analyses were run separately for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and p/pDLI treatment was linked to significantly higher LFS than non-DLI for both AML and ALL patients without increasing the nonrelapse mortality. IntenseMAC was associated with significantly lower relapse and higher LFS than nonintensified MAC despite higher nonrelapse mortality rates in ALL, while there was no impact of intenseMAC observed in AML. p/pDLI achieved superior outcomes in both matched-sibling donor (MSD) and haploidentical donor transplantation, while intenseMAC only influenced MSD outcomes.

Excessive myelopoiesis can be driven by dyslipidemia and cholesterol accumulation in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and may involve increased signaling via Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Constitutively activating JAK2 mutants drive biased myelopoiesis and promote development of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) or clonal hematopoiesis, conditions associated with increased risk of ACD. JAK2 inhibitors have been developed as a therapy for MPNs. The potential for JAK2 inhibitors to protect against atherosclerosis has not been tested. We therefore assessed the impact of JAK2 inhibition on atherogenesis. METHODS: A selective JAK2 inhibitor TG101348 (fedratinib) or vehicle was given to high-fat high-cholesterol Western diet (WD)-fed wild-type (WT) or Apoe(-/-) mice. Hematopoietic cell profiles, cell proliferation, and atherosclerosis in WT or Apoe(-/-) mice were assessed. RESULTS: TG101348 selectively reversed neutrophilia, monocytosis, HSPC, and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (GMP) expansion in Apoe(-/-) mice with decreased cellular phosphorylated STAT5 and ERK1/2 and reduced cell cycling and BrdU incorporation in HSPCs, indicating inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling and cell proliferation. Ten-week WD feeding allowed the development of marked aortic atherosclerosis in Apoe(-/-) mice which was substantially reduced by TG101348. CONCLUSIONS: Selective JAK2 inhibition reduces atherogenesis by suppressing excessive myelopoiesis in hypercholesterolemic Apoe(-/-) mice. These findings suggest selective JAK2 inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach to decrease ACD risk in patients with increased myelopoiesis and leukocytosis.","['Tang, Yang', 'Liu, Wenli', 'Wang, Wei', 'Fidler, Trevor', 'Woods, Britany', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Tall, Alan R', 'Wang, Nan']","['Tang Y', 'Liu W', 'Wang W', 'Fidler T', 'Woods B', 'Levine RL', 'Tall AR', 'Wang N']","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', ""Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, People's Republic of China."", 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, 630 W. 168th Street, New York, NY, 10032, USA. nw30@cumc.columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,8712220,"['0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '6L1XP550I6 (Fedratinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Aortic Diseases/enzymology/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Atherosclerosis/enzymology/genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytosis/enzymology/prevention & control', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout, ApoE', 'Myelopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Plaque, Atherosclerotic', 'Pyrrolidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2020/02/23 06:00'],"['2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10557-020-06943-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10557-020-06943-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther. 2020 Apr;34(2):145-152. doi: 10.1007/s10557-020-06943-9.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9976-0859'],"['R01 HL118567/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001875/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL148071/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL137663/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7125070,['NIHMS1579518'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Atherosclerosis', '*JAK2 inhibitor', '*Myelopoiesis', '*TG101348 (Fedratinib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this hypothesis, 3705 PV/ET patients from three national registers, 118 of them presenting with SVT, were reviewed. After correction for age and sex, PV/ET patients with SVT showed an increased risk of death (HR 2.47, 95% CI 1.5-4.01, p < 0.001), venous thrombosis (IRR 3.4, 95%CI 2.1-5.5, p < 0.001), major bleeding (IRR 3.6, 95%CI 2.3-5.5, p < 0.001), and second cancer (IRR 2.37, 95%CI 1.4-4.1, p = 0.002). No case of acute leukemia was documented among patients with PV/ET presenting with SVT and seven of them (6%) progressed to myelofibrosis. SVT was not associated with lower risk of MF after correction by age and sex. Patients with SVT more frequently died from complications related to hepatic disease, major bleeding, or second cancer, resulting in a 5-year reduction of age- and sex-adjusted median survival. In conclusion, PV and ET patients presenting with SVT have shorter survival than patients with PV and ET of the same age and sex. This excess mortality is related to liver disease, major bleeding, and second cancer rather than to the natural evolution of the MPN.","['Alvarez-Larran, Alberto', 'Pereira, Arturo', 'Magaz, Marta', 'Hernandez-Boluda, Juan Carlos', 'Garrote, Marta', 'Cuevas, Beatriz', 'Ferrer-Marin, Francisca', 'Gomez-Casares, M Teresa', 'Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Mata-Vazquez, M Isabel', 'Turon, Fanny', 'Hernandez-Gea, Virginia', 'Arellano-Rodrigo, Eduardo', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Garcia-Pagan, Juan Carlos']","['Alvarez-Larran A', 'Pereira A', 'Magaz M', 'Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Garrote M', 'Cuevas B', 'Ferrer-Marin F', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Mata-Vazquez MI', 'Turon F', 'Hernandez-Gea V', 'Arellano-Rodrigo E', 'Cervantes F', 'Garcia-Pagan JC']","[""Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain. aalvar@clinic.cat."", 'Hemotherapy Department, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Hepatic Haemodynamic Lab, Liver Unit, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS and CIBERehd, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico-INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.', ""Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de Burgos, Burgos, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Morales-Messeguer, Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Dr Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Ramon y Cajal-IRYCIS, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Costa del Sol, Marbella, Spain.', 'Barcelona Hepatic Haemodynamic Lab, Liver Unit, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS and CIBERehd, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Barcelona Hepatic Haemodynamic Lab, Liver Unit, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS and CIBERehd, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hemostasis Department, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), Villarroel 170, 08036, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Barcelona Hepatic Haemodynamic Lab, Liver Unit, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS and CIBERehd, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200222,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemorrhage/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Liver Diseases/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mesenteric Veins', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications', 'Portal Vein', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Spain/epidemiology', '*Splanchnic Circulation', 'Splenic Vein', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications', 'Venous Thrombosis/*etiology']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03965-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03965-z [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):791-798. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03965-z.

Here, we show that -31-Kb CTCF binding site (-31CBS) serves as chromatin boundary that defines topologically associating domain (TAD) and enhancer/promoter interaction required for TAL1 activation. Deleted or inverted -31CBS impairs TAL1 expression in a context-dependent manner. Deletion of -31CBS reduces chromatin accessibility and blocks long-range interaction between the +51 erythroid enhancer and TAL1 promoter-1 leading to inhibition of TAL1 expression in erythroid cells, but not T-ALL cells. However, in TAL1-expressing T-ALL cells, the leukemia-prone TAL1 promoter-IV specifically interacts with the +19 stem cell enhancer located 19 Kb downstream of TAL1 and this interaction is disrupted by the -31CBS inversion in T-ALL cells. Inversion of -31CBS in Jurkat cells alters chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and CTCF-mediated TAD leading to inhibition of TAL1 expression and TAL1-driven leukemogenesis. Thus, our data reveal that -31CBS acts as critical regulator to define +19-enhancer and the leukemic prone promoter IV interaction for TAL1 activation in T-ALL. Manipulation of CTCF boundary can alter TAL1 TAD and oncogenic transcription networks in leukemogenesis.","['Li, Ying', 'Liao, Ziwei', 'Luo, Huacheng', 'Benyoucef, Aissa', 'Kang, Yuanyuan', 'Lai, Qian', 'Dovat, Sinisa', 'Miller, Barbara', 'Chepelev, Iouri', 'Li, Yangqiu', 'Zhao, Keji', 'Brand, Marjorie', 'Huang, Suming']","['Li Y', 'Liao Z', 'Luo H', 'Benyoucef A', 'Kang Y', 'Lai Q', 'Dovat S', 'Miller B', 'Chepelev I', 'Li Y', 'Zhao K', 'Brand M', 'Huang S']","['Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University Medical College, ShiPai, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'The Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.', ""Center for Autoimmune Genomics and Etiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA."", 'Institute of Hematology, Jinan University Medical College, ShiPai, Guangzhou, 510632, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.', 'The Sprott Center for Stem Cell Research, Regenerative Medicine Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario K1H 8L6, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (CCCTC-Binding Factor)', '0 (CTCF protein, human)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/genetics', 'CCCTC-Binding Factor/*genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genome, Human/genetics', 'Histone Code/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/05/23 06:00,['2020/02/23 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['5747515 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkaa098 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Apr 6;48(6):3119-3133. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa098.,,"['R01 CA204044/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK110108/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MOP-343603 /CIHR/Canada']","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

We previously unveiled a correlation between proportions of C-C motif chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7)(+) T cells in the apheresis and the risk of developing GVHD. We wanted to evaluate in vivo whether apheresis with low proportion of CCR7(+) cells or treatment with an anti-human CCR7 monoclonal antibody (mAb) were suitable strategies to prevent or treat acute GVHD in preclinical xenogeneic models. Therapeutic anti-CCR7 mAb was the most effective strategy in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings where antibody drastically reduced in vivo lymphoid organ infiltration of donor CCR7(+) T cells, extended lifespan and solved clinical signs. The antibody neutralized in vitro migration of naive and central memory T cells toward CCR7 ligands and depleted target CCR7(+) subsets through complement activation. Both mechanisms of action spared CCR7(-) subsets, including effector memory and effector memory CD45RA(+ )T cells which may mediate graft versus leukemia effect and immunity against infections. Accordingly, the numbers of donor CCR7(+) T cells in the apheresis were not associated to cytomegalovirus reactivation or the recurrence of the underlying disease.

We also investigated the ability of the IPSS and IPSS-R to capture severity of patient-reported fatigue at diagnostic workup. A sample of 927 newly diagnosed patients with MDS was consecutively enrolled in a large international observational study and all patients completed the FACIT-Fatigue questionnaire at baseline. Fatigue was compared with that of the GP (N = 1075) and a 3-point difference in mean scores was considered as clinically meaningful. Fatigue of MDS patients was on average 4.6 points below the mean of the GP (95% CI, -5.9 to -3.2, p < 0.001), reflecting clinically meaningful worse fatigue. Unlike the IPSS, the IPSS-R identified clearly distinct subgroups with regard to burden of fatigue.

Genomic analysis of matched diagnosis and relapse samples shows relapse often arising from minor diagnosis subclones. However, why therapy eradicates some subclones while others survive and progress to relapse remains obscure. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying these differing fates requires functional analysis of isolated subclones. Here, large-scale limiting dilution xenografting of diagnosis and relapse samples, combined with targeted sequencing, identified and isolated minor diagnosis subclones that initiate an evolutionary trajectory toward relapse [termed diagnosis Relapse Initiating clones (dRI)]. Compared with other diagnosis subclones, dRIs were drug-tolerant with distinct engraftment and metabolic properties. Transcriptionally, dRIs displayed enrichment for chromatin remodeling, mitochondrial metabolism, proteostasis programs, and an increase in stemness pathways. The isolation and characterization of dRI subclones reveals new avenues for eradicating dRI cells by targeting their distinct metabolic and transcriptional pathways before further evolution renders them fully therapy-resistant. SIGNIFICANCE: Isolation and characterization of subclones from diagnosis samples of patients with B-ALL who relapsed showed that relapse-fated subclones had increased drug tolerance and distinct metabolic and survival transcriptional programs compared with other diagnosis subclones. This study provides strategies to identify and target clinically relevant subclones before further evolution toward relapse.","['Dobson, Stephanie M', 'Garcia-Prat, Laura', 'Vanner, Robert J', 'Wintersinger, Jeffrey', 'Waanders, Esme', 'Gu, Zhaohui', 'McLeod, Jessica', 'Gan, Olga I', 'Grandal, Ildiko', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Edmonson, Michael N', 'Ma, Xiaotu', 'Fan, Yiping', 'Voisin, Veronique', 'Chan-Seng-Yue, Michelle', 'Xie, Stephanie Z', 'Hosseini, Mohsen', 'Abelson, Sagi', 'Gupta, Pankaj', 'Rusch, Michael', 'Shao, Ying', 'Olsen, Scott R', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Chan, Steven M', 'Bader, Gary', 'Easton, John', 'Guidos, Cynthia J', 'Danska, Jayne S', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Morris, Quaid', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Dick, John E']","['Dobson SM', 'Garcia-Prat L', 'Vanner RJ', 'Wintersinger J', 'Waanders E', 'Gu Z', 'McLeod J', 'Gan OI', 'Grandal I', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Edmonson MN', 'Ma X', 'Fan Y', 'Voisin V', 'Chan-Seng-Yue M', 'Xie SZ', 'Hosseini M', 'Abelson S', 'Gupta P', 'Rusch M', 'Shao Y', 'Olsen SR', 'Neale G', 'Chan SM', 'Bader G', 'Easton J', 'Guidos CJ', 'Danska JS', 'Zhang J', 'Minden MD', 'Morris Q', 'Mullighan CG', 'Dick JE']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto.

This lead to the development of the UCB transplantation program. Herein, we describe the experience generated during these 13 years. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donor selection, as well as UCB collection, processing, and banking were performed under good manufacturing practices and standard operating procedures. UCB units were thawed, processed, and released for transplantation based on HLA and nucleated cell content. RESULTS: From January 2005-December 2017, 1,298 UCB units were banked; 164 of them were released for transplantation, and 118 UCB transplants were performed. Ninety-four transplants were performed in pediatric patients and 24 in adults. Sixty percent of them corresponded to patients with leukemia, 19% were patients with marrow failure, and the rest had immunodeficiency, hemoglobinopathy, metabolic disorders, or solid tumors. Engraftment was observed in 67 patients (57% of transplanted patients) and 64% of them were still alive when writing this article. In contrast, only 13 of the 51 (25%) non-engrafting patients were alive. At the time of writing this article, the disease-free survival rate was 37%, and the overall survival rate was 47%, with survival periods of 161-3,721 days. CONCLUSION: The IMSS UCB banking and transplantation program has had a significant impact for many IMSS patients. The hematopoietic transplantation program at our institution has benefited from the use of UCB as a source of transplantable cells.","['Guerra-Marquez, Angel', 'Penaflor, Karina', 'Mayani, Hector']","['Guerra-Marquez A', 'Penaflor K', 'Mayani H']","['Banco de sangre del cordon umbilical, Centro Medico La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Banco de sangre del cordon umbilical, Centro Medico La Raza, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Enfermedades Oncologicas, Hospital de Oncologia, Centro Medico Nacional, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.

A phase I study established that midostaurin 75 mg orally twice daily for 14 days with standard dose azacitidine was safe and tolerable in elderly patients with AML. Herein, we report the phase II expansion cohort of previously untreated elderly or unfit patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Primary objectives were to further describe the toxicity profile and determine the response rate in untreated patients with AML. Patients received midostaurin 75 mg orally twice daily on days 8 to 21 in combination with intravenous azacitidine at 75 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 7. Plasma inhibitory activity assay for FLT3 was performed pretreatment and on day 8 and day 15 of each cycle. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients (median age, 74 years; range, 59-85 years) with FLT3 wild-type AML were accrued. Patients received a median of 2 cycles of therapy (range, 1-10 cycles). Seven (29%) of 24 evaluable patients achieved a clinical response (4 complete response; 1 complete response with incomplete count recovery; and 2 partial response). The median overall survival was 244 days (95% confidence interval, 203-467 days). Hematologic, infectious, and gastrointestinal toxicities were comparable to similar studies. Peripheral blood FLT3 wild-type phosphorylation declined to 8% to 55% of pretreatment by day 15 of cycle 1 (7 patients) and declined with subsequent cycles (< 10% baseline) in 2 patients who were analyzed after cycle 3. CONCLUSION: Multiple cycles of azacitidine and midostaurin were not well-tolerated, but persistent inhibition of FLT3 wild-type phosphorylation suggest intermittent dosing of midostaurin should be considered in future low-intensity regimens for FLT3-mutant AML.","['Tomlinson, Benjamin K', 'Gallogly, Molly M', 'Kane, Donna M', 'Metheny, Leland', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'William, Basem M', 'Craig, Michael D', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Cooper, Brenda W']","['Tomlinson BK', 'Gallogly MM', 'Kane DM', 'Metheny L', 'Lazarus HM', 'William BM', 'Craig MD', 'Levis MJ', 'Cooper BW']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown, WV.', 'Department of Oncology and Medicine, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Seidman Cancer Center, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, OH.

Understanding this complex process is essential for explaining the pathogenesis of leukemia as well as developing targeted therapies. Here, we provide an overview of the role of Ikaros tumor suppressor and its role in regulation of gene transcription in acute leukemia. Ikaros (IKZF1) is a DNA-binding protein that functions as a master regulator of hematopoiesis and the immune system, as well as a tumor suppressor in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Genetic alteration or functional inactivation of Ikaros results in the development of high-risk leukemia. Ikaros binds to the specific consensus binding motif at upstream regulatory elements of its target genes, recruits chromatin-remodeling complexes and activates or represses transcription via chromatin remodeling. Over the last twenty years, a large number of Ikaros target genes have been identified, and the role of Ikaros in the regulation of their expression provided insight into the mechanisms of Ikaros tumor suppressor function in leukemia. Here we summarize the role of Ikaros in the regulation of the expression of the genes whose function is critical for cellular proliferation, development, and progression of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Dhanyamraju, Pavan Kumar', 'Iyer, Soumya', 'Smink, Gayle', 'Bamme, Yevgeniya', 'Bhadauria, Preeti', 'Payne, Jonathon L', 'Dovat, Elanora', 'Klink, Morgann', 'Ding, Yali']","['Dhanyamraju PK', 'Iyer S', 'Smink G', 'Bamme Y', 'Bhadauria P', 'Payne JL', 'Dovat E', 'Klink M', 'Ding Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200218,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/12/01 06:00,['2020/02/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/01 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21041377 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21041377 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Feb 18;21(4). pii: ijms21041377. doi: 10.3390/ijms21041377.,,['F30 CA221109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7073093,,['NOTNLM'],"['Ikaros, tumor suppressor, gene transcription, leukemia']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same has not been true for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Hematologic toxicity has limited the potential of modern immunotherapies for AML at preclinical and clinical levels. Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin has demonstrated hematologic toxicity, but the challenge of preserving normal hematopoiesis has become more apparent with the development of increasingly potent immunotherapies. To date, no single surface molecule has been identified that is able to differentiate AML from Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPC). Attempts have been made to spare hematopoiesis by targeting molecules expressed only on later myeloid progenitors as well as AML or using toxins that selectively kill AML over HSPC. Other strategies include targeting aberrantly expressed lymphoid molecules or only targeting monocyte-associated proteins in AML with monocytic differentiation. Recently, some groups have accepted that stem cell transplantation is required to access potent AML immunotherapy and envision it as a rescue to avoid severe hematologic toxicity. Whether it will ever be possible to differentiate AML from HSPC using surface molecules is unclear. Unless true specific AML surface targets are discovered, stem cell transplantation could be required to harness the true potential of immunotherapy in AML.","['Abadir, Edward', 'Gasiorowski, Robin E', 'Silveira, Pablo A', 'Larsen, Stephen', 'Clark, Georgina J']","['Abadir E', 'Gasiorowski RE', 'Silveira PA', 'Larsen S', 'Clark GJ']","['Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord 2139, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown 2050, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, Camperdown 2039, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, Camperdown 2039, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Concord Repatriation and General Hospital, Concord 2039, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord 2139, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, Camperdown 2039, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown 2050, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, Camperdown 2039, NSW, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord 2139, NSW, Australia.', 'The University of Sydney, Camperdown 2039, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200218,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:01,['2020/02/23 06:00'],"['2020/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm9020554 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm9020554 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2020 Feb 18;9(2). pii: jcm9020554. doi: 10.3390/jcm9020554.,,"['543727/National Health and Medical Research Council', 'APP1134202/National Health and Medical Research Council']",,PMC7073661,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML immunotherapy', 'Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells', 'antibody drug conjugates', 'hematopoietic stem cell toxicity']",,,"['G.J.C. is a director of Dendrocyte Biotech Pty Ltd. and Kira Biotech Pty Ltd.', 'There are no other conflicts of interest to declare.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Thoroughbred racehorse is a valid animal model to investigate such changes for training schedule fine-tuning. As happens in human athletes, it is hypothesized that biochemical and immune response changes and related biomolecular variations could be induced by training programs. The aim of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the long-term metabolic and biomolecular modifications in young untrained Thoroughbred racehorses in the first 4-month timeframe training period. Twenty-nine clinically healthy, untrained, two-year-old Thoroughbred racehorses were followed during their incremental 4-month sprint exercise schedule. Blood collection was performed once a month, five times (T-30, T0, T30, T60, and T90). For each sample, lactate concentration, plasma cell volume (PCV), and hematobiochemical parameters (glucose, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin (Tbil), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin (Alb), total proteins (TPs), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca(2+)), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na(+)), potassium (K(-)), and chloride (Cl)) were determined. At T-30 and T90, serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), serum amyloid A (SAA), and real-time qPCR were performed on all samples to evaluate the expression of key genes and cytokines related to inflammatory and Th2 immunity responses: Interleukin-4 (IL-4), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), Octamer-Binding Transcription Factor 1 (OCT1), B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A). Statistical analysis was performed (ANOVA and t test, p < 0.05). Significant modifications were identified compared with T-30 for PCV, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, lactate, urea, creatinine, Tbil, ALP, LDH, Na(+), K(-), Ca(2+), SAA, TPs, SPE, IL-6, IL-4, Oct-1, and BCL11A.

This study showed that, at a non-toxic concentration, venetoclax at 10 microM significantly reversed multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by wild-type ABCG2, without significantly affecting MDR mediated by mutated ABCG2 (R482G and R482T) and ABCB1, while moderate or no reversal effects were observed at lower concentrations (0.5 to 1 microM). The results showed that venetoclax increased the intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents, which was the result of directly blocking the wild-type ABCG2 efflux function and inhibiting the ATPase activity of ABCG2.

It possesses a wide range of beneficial biological properties including anticancer activity. Resveratrol has been demonstrated to induce both autophagy and apoptosis in several human cancer cell lines. The aim of this study was to investigate whether resveratrol modulates autophagy and apoptosis in MOLT-4 human lymphoblastic leukemia and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Cell viability was evaluated by the neutral red uptake assay. Cell cycle distribution, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, changes of the mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular production of reactive oxygen species were evaluated by flow cytometry. LC3-I to LC3-II conversion was examined based on Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses. The level of p62/SQSTM1 protein and PARP1 cleavage were analyzed by Western blotting. The DNA degradation was assessed by gel electrophoresis. We found that resveratrol is able to modulate autophagy in MOLT-4 and HL-60 cells, as evidenced by the detection of an increased level of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 proteins. Moreover, resveratrol induced apoptosis in both cell lines which was associated with phosphatidylserine externalization, disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, PARP1 cleavage, chromatin condensation, and fragmentation of cell nuclei. The present study provides evidence that resveratrol can act as an autophagy modulator as well as an apoptosis inducer in MOLT-4 and HL-60 human leukemia cells. Our findings imply that resveratrol can be a promising chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of leukemia.","['Siedlecka-Kroplewska, K', 'Wozniak, M', 'Kmiec, Z']","['Siedlecka-Kroplewska K', 'Wozniak M', 'Kmiec Z']","['Department of Histology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland. ksiedlecka@gumed.edu.pl.', 'Department of Medical Chemistry, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Histology, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200219,Poland,J Physiol Pharmacol,Journal of physiology and pharmacology : an official journal of the Polish Physiological Society,9114501,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resveratrol/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Wine']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26402/jpp.2019.6.02 [doi]'],ppublish,J Physiol Pharmacol. 2019 Dec;70(6). doi: 10.26402/jpp.2019.6.02.

In these patients CVC are placed routinely either via the internal jugular vein (IJV) or the subclavian vein (SCV). Purpose of this study was to systematically analyze complications of CVC at different insertion sites in HCT recipients. In this retrospective analysis, all consecutive patients (n = 56) who received a CVC (n = 101) due to allogeneic HCT at our institution between January 2011 and June 2013 were included. Three-lumen standard, nontunneled CVCs were placed via either the IJV (n = 60; 59%) or the SCV (n = 41; 41%). Study endpoints were time to local inflammation at the insertion site, time to fever, time to a combined endpoint of inflammation and fever, central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), duration of catheterization, catheter lumen obstruction, deep-vein thrombosis, pneumothorax, and catheter-related death. The median duration of catheterization per CVC was almost identical for the IJV and SCV sites (18 days versus 17 days; P not significant). There were no differences in the frequency of CLABSI, deep-vein thrombosis, pneumothorax, and catheter lumen obstruction between IJV and SCV CVC insertion sites. None of the patients died due to a CVC-related cause. Local inflammation occurred less frequently (48% versus 71%; P = .025) and later (median time to local inflammation, 25 days versus 12 days; P = .01) in IJV CVCs versus SCV CVCs. There was a trend toward a median longer time to the occurrence of fever for IJV CVCs compared with SCV CVCs (20 days versus 13 days; P = .07). In the multivariate analysis, diagnosis of acute leukemia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.696; P = .036), SCV CVC (HR, 1.617; P = .039), and neutropenic CVC-days (HR, 2.477; P = .01) were identified as risk factors for the occurrence of local inflammation or fever. In contrast to earlier studies in patients without hematologic malignancies, these data demonstrate that CVCs placed in the SCV are not superior over IJV CVCs. Moreover, local inflammation occurred earlier and more frequently in patients with an SCV CVC.","['Heidenreich, Daniela', 'Hansen, Eleonore', 'Kreil, Sebastian', 'Nolte, Florian', 'Jawhar, Mohamad', 'Hecht de Gutierrez, Anna', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Klein, Stefan A']","['Heidenreich D', 'Hansen E', 'Kreil S', 'Nolte F', 'Jawhar M', 'Hecht de Gutierrez A', 'Hofmann WK', 'Klein SA']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany.

It regulates several cell functions, including adhesion and migration. Cortactin overexpression is associated with increased metastasis formation and worse outcome in different types of solid tumors, thus highlighting a critical role of cortactin in cancer progression. Mechanistically, this is due to increased invadopodia formation and matrix metalloproteinase secretion. Cortactin has been until recently considered absent in hematopoietic cells because these cells express the cortactin homolog hematopoietic cell-specific lyn substrate-1. However, many recent reports describe functional expression of cortactin in different hematopoietic cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. Of note, cortactin is strongly overexpressed in leukemic cell lines and primary patient-derived leukemic cells. In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, this is associated with poor prognosis and increased chemotaxis; in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, high cortactin levels correlate with treatment failure and relapse. Moreover, cortactin has been proposed as a diagnostic marker for non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas. This review summarizes current knowledge on cortactin expression in hematopoietic cells and discusses the functional implications for different hematological malignancies.","['Castellanos-Martinez, Ramon', 'Jimenez-Camacho, Karina E', 'Schnoor, Michael']","['Castellanos-Martinez R', 'Jimenez-Camacho KE', 'Schnoor M']","['Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Molecular Biomedicine, Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional (CINVESTAV-IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.

We compared the recently proposed American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) grading system to other grading scores in 2 populations of adults: patients (n = 53) with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated with 1928z CAR T-cells (clinicaltrials.gov #NCT01044069), and patients (n = 49) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with axicabtagene-ciloleucel (axi-cel) or tisagenlecleucel after US Food and Drug Administration approval. According to ASTCT grading, 82% of patients had CRS, 87% in the B-ALL and 77% in the DLBCL groups (axi-cel: 86%, tisagenlecleucel: 54%), whereas 50% of patients experienced ICANS, 55% in the B-ALL and 45% in the DLBCL groups (axi-cel: 55%, tisagenlecleucel: 15%). All grading systems agreed on CRS and ICANS diagnosis in 99% and 91% of cases, respectively. However, when analyzed grade by grade, only 25% and 54% of patients had the same grade in each system for CRS and ICANS, respectively, as different systems score symptoms differently (upgrading or downgrading their severity), leading to inconsistent final grades. Investigation of possible management implications in DLBCL patients showed that different recommendations on tocilizumab and steroids across current guidelines potentially result in either overtreating or delaying treatment. Moreover, because these guidelines are based on single products and different grading systems, they cannot be universally applied. To avoid discrepancies in assessing and managing toxicities of different products, we propose that unified grading be used across clinical trials and in practice and that paired management guidelines with product-specific indications be developed.","['Pennisi, Martina', 'Jain, Tania', 'Santomasso, Bianca D', 'Mead, Elena', 'Wudhikarn, Kitsada', 'Silverberg, Mari Lynne', 'Batlevi, Yakup', 'Shouval, Roni', 'Devlin, Sean M', 'Batlevi, Connie', 'Brentjens, Renier J', 'Dahi, Parastoo B', 'Diamonte, Claudia', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Halton, Elizabeth F', 'Maloy, Molly', 'Palomba, Maria Lia', 'Sanchez-Escamilla, Miriam', 'Sauter, Craig S', 'Scordo, Michael', 'Shah, Gunjan', 'Park, Jae H', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel']","['Pennisi M', 'Jain T', 'Santomasso BD', 'Mead E', 'Wudhikarn K', 'Silverberg ML', 'Batlevi Y', 'Shouval R', 'Devlin SM', 'Batlevi C', 'Brentjens RJ', 'Dahi PB', 'Diamonte C', 'Giralt S', 'Halton EF', 'Maloy M', 'Palomba ML', 'Sanchez-Escamilla M', 'Sauter CS', 'Scordo M', 'Shah G', 'Park JH', 'Perales MA']","['Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-Oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Instituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Neurology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine and.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Unit of Translational Hematology, Division of Hematology and Research, Department of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Lymphoma Service, Department of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;

Excess blood is spotted on Guthrie cards and archived by many states in biobanks for follow-up diagnoses and public health research. However, storage environment may vary across biobanks and across time within biobanks. With increased applications of DNA extracted from spots for genetic studies, identifying factors associated with genotyping success is critical to maximize DNA quality for future studies. METHOD: We evaluated 399 blood spots, which were part of a genome-wide association study of childhood leukemia risk in children with Down syndrome, archived at the Michigan Neonatal Biobank between 1992 and 2008. High quality DNA was defined as having post-quality control call rate >/= 99.0% based on the Illumina GenomeStudio 2.0 GenCall algorithm after processing the samples on the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array. Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to evaluate effects of storage environment and storage duration on DNA genotyping quality. RESULTS: Both storage environment and duration were associated with sample genotyping call rates (p-values < 0.001). Sample call rates were associated with storage duration independent of storage environment (p-trend = 0.006 for DBS archived in an uncontrolled environment and p-trend = 0.002 in a controlled environment). However, 95% of the total sample had high genotyping quality with a call rate >/= 95.0%, a standard threshold for acceptable sample quality in many genetic studies. CONCLUSION: Blood spot DNA quality was lower in samples archived in uncontrolled storage environments and for samples archived for longer durations. Still, regardless of storage environment or duration, neonatal biobanks including the Michigan Neonatal Biobanks can provide access to large collections of spots with DNA quality acceptable for most genotyping studies.","['Sok, Pagna', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Richard, Melissa A', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Ehli, Erik A', 'Kallsen, Noah A', 'Davies, Gareth E', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Brown, Austin L']","['Sok P', 'Lupo PJ', 'Richard MA', 'Rabin KR', 'Ehli EA', 'Kallsen NA', 'Davies GE', 'Scheurer ME', 'Brown AL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Section, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Section, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Section, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Section, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United States of America.', 'Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United States of America.', 'Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Section, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology-Oncology Section, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200221,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['DNA/*analysis', 'Dried Blood Spot Testing/*methods', 'Female', '*Genome, Human', 'Genome-Wide Association Study/*methods', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Neonatal Screening/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Specimen Handling']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/05/10 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0229352 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-32165 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Feb 21;15(2):e0229352. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0229352. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8210-4580', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0978-5863', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7865-3015']",['K07 CA218362/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7034898,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV infects cattle worldwide and causes serious problems for the cattle industry. In this study, we examined the prevalence of BLV infection and the distribution of BLV genotypes in cattle in the northern, central, and southern parts of Myanmar. The prevalence of BLV infection among Myanmar cattle (37.04%) in this study was markedly higher than the prevalence (9.1%) observed in our earlier study in which BLV was detected from the limited number of cattle only from a small area of Myanmar. Phylogenetic analysis of partial env-gp51 sequence of the isolated BLV strains revealed that there are at least three BLV genotypes (genotype-1, genotype-6, and genotype-10) in Myanmar, which have also been detected in the neighboring countries. We performed this study to estimate the BLV proviral load, which is a major diagnosis index for determining the virus transmission risk. The cattle of the three test regions with warm, wet, and humid climatic conditions (upper Sagaing, Yangon, and Kayin) exhibited a high mean proviral load, while cattle of three other regions with low annual rainfall and very high temperature (Mandalay, Magway, and upper Bago) exhibited a low mean proviral load. Further, the level of proviral load and the prevalence of BLV infection in Myanmar native cattle (N = 235) were lower than that in the hybrid cattle (Holstein Friesian x Myanmar native) (N = 62). We also observed that the cattle with high risk for BLV transmission, which have high proviral load, may enhance the BLV infection rate. Hence, to control BLV transmission, it is necessary to eliminate these cattle with high-risk for BLV transmission and to diagnose BLV provirus in cattle in the remaining regions/states of Myanmar sharing a boundary with neighboring countries.","['Moe, Kyaw Kyaw', 'Polat, Meripet', 'Borjigin, Liushiqi', 'Matsuura, Ryosuke', 'Hein, Si Thu', 'Moe, Hla Hla', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Moe KK', 'Polat M', 'Borjigin L', 'Matsuura R', 'Hein ST', 'Moe HH', 'Aida Y']","['Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, Wako, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Veterinary Science, Yezin, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, Wako, Saitama, Japan.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, Wako, Saitama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, Wako, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, University of Veterinary Science, Yezin, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar.', 'Department of Genetics and Animal Breeding, University of Veterinary Science, Yezin, Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar.', 'Nakamura Laboratory, Baton Zone Program, RIKEN Cluster for Science, Technology and Innovation Hub, Wako, Saitama, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Viral Infectious Diseases, Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Frontier Science, The University of Tokyo, Wako, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200221,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/*genetics', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Phylogeny', 'Prevalence', 'Temperature']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0229126 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-11083 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Feb 21;15(2):e0229126. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0229126. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7400-3587'],,,PMC7034883,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two commonly recognized complications associated with CAR T-cell therapies are cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). ICANS can occur in isolation or concomitantly with CRS following CAR T-cell therapy and may be due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the effects of elevated cytokine levels on the central nervous system. Presently, the optimum management of ICANS remains elusive, as there lacks consensus guidelines.

Results of MR monitoring are standardized according to the International Scale (IS), and specific time-dependent molecular milestones for definition of optimal response and treatment failure have been included in treatment recommendations. The common practice to use peripheral blood (PB) instead of bone marrow (BM) aspirate to monitor the MR monitoring in CML has been questioned. Some studies described differences between BCR-ABL1 levels in paired PB and BM specimens. Methods We examined 631 paired PB and BM samples from 283 CML patients in a retrospective single-center study using an IS normalized quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR assay for quantification of BCR-ABL1IS. Results A good overall concordance of BCR-ABL1IS results was found, a systematic tendency towards higher BCR-ABL1IS levels in PB was observed in samples of CML patients in a major MR. This difference was most pronounced in patients treated with imatinib for at least 1 year. Importantly, the difference resulted in a significantly lower rate of deep MR when BCR-ABL1IS was assessed in the PB compared to BM aspirates. Conclusions In summary, our data suggest that the classification of deep MR in patients with CML is more stringent in PB than in BM. Our study supports the current practice to primarily use PB for long-term molecular follow-up monitoring in CML.","['Greiner, Georg', 'Ratzinger, Franz', 'Gurbisz, Michael', 'Witzeneder, Nadine', 'Taghizadeh, Hossein', 'Mustafa, Sebastian G K', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner, Gerlinde', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Mannhalter, Christine', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Valent, Peter', 'Hoermann, Gregor']","['Greiner G', 'Ratzinger F', 'Gurbisz M', 'Witzeneder N', 'Taghizadeh H', 'Mustafa SGK', 'Mitterbauer-Hohendanner G', 'Esterbauer H', 'Mannhalter C', 'Sperr WR', 'Valent P', 'Hoermann G']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ihr Labor, Medical Diagnostic Laboratories, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Central Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratory Diagnostics, University Hospital Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/08/18 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/cclm-2019-1172 [doi]', 'cclm-2019-1172 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 2020 Jul 28;58(8):1214-1222. doi: 10.1515/cclm-2019-1172.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0917-4117'],"['F 4701/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4704/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']",,PMC7115836,['EMS87077'],['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*deep molecular response', '*quantitative PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A second random assignment (R-C) compared docetaxel-capecitabine with an anthracycline-based regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: R-C randomly assigned patients 1:1 between standard anthracycline-based regimens, with or without taxanes (control) and experimental docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenously plus oral capecitabine 825 mg/m(2) two times per day for 14 days (DC) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end points included overall survival and safety. RESULTS: Of 2,832 patients, 1,301 (45%) were randomly assigned, and 97% complied with R-C assignment. In the control arm, 29.6% only received taxanes (0.5% of N0 patients). DFS events (n = 148) were much less than required (n = 422) as a result of a lower-than-expected accrual and event rate. At 5 years of median follow-up, DFS was not different between DC (n = 652) and control (n = 649; 90.7% [95% CI, 88% to 92.8%] v 88.8% [95% CI, 85.9% to 91.1%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.15]; P = .26). Overall survival (HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.53]) and DFS in the clinical high and genomic high-risk subgroup (86.1% v 88.1%; HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.58 to 1.21]) were similar in both arms. DC led to more grade 1 neuropathy (27.1% v 11.2%) and more grade 2 hand/foot syndrome (28.5% v 3.3%) and diarrhea (13.7% v 5.8%). Serious cardiac events occurred in 9 patients (control, n = 4; DC, n = 5). Fifty-three patients developed second cancers (control, n = 32; DC, n = 21; leukemia: 2 v 1). Five treatment-related deaths occurred (control, 2 [0.3%]; DC, 3 [0.5%]). CONCLUSION: Although underpowered, this second randomization in MINDACT did not show any improvement in outcome or safety with the use of DC compared with anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","['Delaloge, Suzette', 'Piccart, Martine', 'Rutgers, Emiel', 'Litiere, Saskia', ""van 't Veer, Laura J"", 'van den Berkmortel, Franchette', 'Brain, Etienne', 'Dudek-Peric, Aleksandra', 'Gil-Gil, Miguel', 'Gomez, Patricia', 'Hilbers, Florentine S', 'Khalil, Zaman', 'Knox, Susan', 'Kuemmel, Sherko', 'Kunz, Georg', 'Lesur, Anne', 'Pierga, Jean-Yves', 'Ravdin, Peter', 'Rubio, Isabel T', 'Saghatchian, Mahasti', 'Smilde, Tineke J', 'Thompson, Alastair M', 'Viale, Giuseppe', 'Zoppoli, Gabriele', 'Vuylsteke, Peter', 'Tryfonidis, Konstantinos', 'Poncet, Coralie', 'Bogaerts, Jan', 'Cardoso, Fatima']","['Delaloge S', 'Piccart M', 'Rutgers E', 'Litiere S', ""van 't Veer LJ"", 'van den Berkmortel F', 'Brain E', 'Dudek-Peric A', 'Gil-Gil M', 'Gomez P', 'Hilbers FS', 'Khalil Z', 'Knox S', 'Kuemmel S', 'Kunz G', 'Lesur A', 'Pierga JY', 'Ravdin P', 'Rubio IT', 'Saghatchian M', 'Smilde TJ', 'Thompson AM', 'Viale G', 'Zoppoli G', 'Vuylsteke P', 'Tryfonidis K', 'Poncet C', 'Bogaerts J', 'Cardoso F']","['Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Unicancer Breast Group, Paris, France.', 'Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Zuyderland Medisch Centrum, Heerlen-Geleen, the Netherlands.', 'Institut Curie-Hopital Rene Huguenin, Saint-Cloud, France.', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Brussels, Belgium.', ""Institut Catala D'Oncologia-Institut d'Investigacio Biomedica de Bellvitge, L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Hospital General Vall D'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Breast International Group, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Europa Donna-The European Breast Cancer Coalition, Milan, Italy.', 'Breast Unit Kliniken Essen-Mitte, Westdeutsche Studiengruppe, Monchengladbach, Germany.', 'St Johannes Hospital, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Institut de Cancerologie de Lorraine, Vandoeuvre-Les-Nancy, France.', 'Institut Curie-Hopital Rene Huguenin, Saint-Cloud, France.', 'Institut Curie Paris Sciences et Lettres, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'The University of Texas Health Sciences Center, San Antonio, TX.', 'Clinica Universidad de Navarra-Site Madrid, Madrid, Spain.', 'Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', ""Jeroen Bosch Ziekenhuis, 's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands."", 'Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'University of Milan and European Institute of Oncology-Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Milan, Italy.', 'University of Genoa and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Namur, Belgium.', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Brussels, Belgium.', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Brussels, Belgium.', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Champalimaud Clinical Center/Champalimaud Foundation, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200221,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Capecitabine/administration & dosage', 'Docetaxel/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.01371 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2020 Apr 10;38(11):1186-1197. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.01371.

However, experimental studies found that they are associated with worse outcomes in B-CLL. METHODS: A prospective case study was conducted on 135 B-CLL patients that were compared to thirty healthy controls. The patients were followed up for 40 months and quantitative measurements of Lnc-IRF2-3 and Lnc-ZNF667-AS1 were measured and compared between the two groups as well as high-risk and low low-risk B-CLL. RESULTS: Lnc-IRF2-3 and Lnc-ZNF667-AS1 had a high specificity (94% and 85%) and sensitivity (85%, 87%), respectively, to differentiate B-CLL from healthy controls. Furthermore, they showed high expression levels in high-risk CLL groups. For survival analysis, there was a negative correlation between overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) and both biomarkers. However, it was not evident in multivariate Cox regression analysis; in patients with Lnc-IRF2-3 expression level, >67 had a significant decrease in OS and PFS. However, there is no significant effect for high expression levels of Lnc-ZNF667-AS1 on OS (P = .16) or PFS (P = .48).

This genetic abnormality is also rarely reported in Philadelphia-like B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (B-ALL). PDGFRB rearrangement was initially thought to only occur in cases with 5q31-33 rearrangement as determined with conventional cytogenetics; however, there are reported cases with cryptic rearrangements. We aim to develop a broader strategy for screening of PDGFRB rearrangements of patients with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) for PDGFRB rearrangement in 197 patients, including 70 with B-ALL, 10 with myeloid neoplasms with 5q31-33 rearrangements, and 117 with eosinophilia (>/=0.5 x 10(9) /l in peripheral blood or >/=5% in bone marrow), and identified PDGFRB rearrangement in four of 197 (2.0%) cases. In an attempt to identify clinicopathological and genetic features that may have a stronger association with PDGFRB rearrangement, we analysed 13 patients with confirmed PDGFRB rearrangements, including 10 with myeloid neoplasms and three with B-ALL. Among the 10 patients with myeloid neoplasms, eosinophilia was present in eight, monocytosis in two, 5q31-33 rearrangement in seven, and abnormal bone marrow morphology in all. All patients with myeloid neoplasms showed an excellent response to imatinib, including a patient in blast crisis. The three B-ALL patients presented de novo, showed no eosinophilia, had a complex karyotype including 5q31-33 rearrangement, and had clinically aggressive courses with ultimate patient demise.

Simple sequence-based methods to detect nucleotide substitution variants have error rates (about 10-3) that limit sensitive detection. We developed and characterized the performance of MASQ (multiplex accurate sensitive quantitation), a method with an error rate below 10-6. MASQ counts variant templates accurately in the presence of millions of host genomes by using tags to identify each template and demanding consensus over multiple reads. Since the MASQ protocol multiplexes 50 target loci, we can both integrate signal from multiple variants and capture subclonal response to treatment. Compared to existing methods for variant detection, MASQ achieves an excellent combination of sensitivity, specificity and yield. We tested MASQ in a pilot study in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who entered complete remission. We detect leukemic variants in the blood and bone marrow samples of all five patients, after induction therapy, at levels ranging from 10-2 to nearly 10-6. We observe evidence of sub-clonal structure and find higher target variant frequencies in patients who go on to relapse, demonstrating the potential for MASQ to quantify residual disease in AML.","['Moffitt, Andrea B', 'Spector, Mona S', 'Andrews, Peter', 'Kendall, Jude', 'Alexander, Joan', 'Stepansky, Asya', 'Ma, BeiCong', 'Kolitz, Jonathan', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Krasnitz, Alex', 'Wigler, Michael', 'Levy, Dan', 'Wang, Zihua']","['Moffitt AB', 'Spector MS', 'Andrews P', 'Kendall J', 'Alexander J', 'Stepansky A', 'Ma B', 'Kolitz J', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Allen SL', 'Krasnitz A', 'Wigler M', 'Levy D', 'Wang Z']","['Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549, USA.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030, USA.', 'Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY 11724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['5742832 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkaa090 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Apr 17;48(7):e40. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa090.,,"['P30 CA045508/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA148056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

While this approach is high-throughput, it is relatively low in resolution and unable to measure phenotypic changes or processes occurring in subcellular compartments. We integrated automated microscopy with newly developed informatics workflow that enabled the quantitation of multiple fluorescent markers from specific subnuclear regions throughout a population of cells. Telomeres protect chromosome termini and prevent cellular aging. Cancer cells lengthen telomeres by synthesizing new TTAGGG repeats by the enzyme telomerase, while others activate recombination-dependent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). A key feature of the ALT pathway is the specific clustering of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies at telomeres. These ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) common in tumors of mesenchymal origin have gained in diagnostic use in the past decade. Here we applied recent improvements in automated microscopy and developed novel informatics workflows for quantitation of multiple fluorescent markers from specific subnuclear regions at the single cell level. Key to this workflow are customized machine learning algorithms within HCS Studio Cell Analysis which automatically identify and segment cells into defined regions of interest based on fluorescent markers, measure marker intensities and compute marker colocalizations in specific segmented regions. These multiparametric cellular assays assess cell cycle dynamics as well as the interactome of APBs, are amenable to adherent cells and histological sections, and are adaptable for use with additional markers. In the future we anticipate exploiting these algorithms for a wide range of research questions related to telomere biology with potential to facilitate clinical development of ALT detection assays to benefit patients with these often-poor prognosis tumors.

From a clinical perspective, this view is supported by the remarkable therapeutic efficacy of BcR signaling inhibitors, even among heavily pre-treated, relapsed/refractory patients. This clinical development complements immunogenetic evidence for antigen drive in the natural history of these tumors. Indeed, BcR IG gene repertoire biases have been documented in different B cell lymphoma subtypes, alluding to selection of B cell progenitors that express particular BcR IG. Moreover, distinct entities display imprints of somatic hypermutation within the clonotypic BcR IG gene following patterns that strengthen the argument for antigen selection. Of note, at least in certain B cell lymphomas, the BcR IG genes are intraclonally diversified, likely in a context of ongoing interactions with antigen(s). Moreover, BcR IG gene repertoire profiling suggests that unique immune pathways lead to distinct B cell lymphomas through targeting cells at different stages in the B cell differentiation trajectory (e.g., germinal center B cells in follicular lymphoma, FL). Regarding the implicated antigens, although their precise nature remains to be fully elucidated, immunogenetic analysis has offered important hints by revealing similarities between the BcR IG of particular lymphomas and B cell clones with known antigenic specificity: this has paved the way to functional studies that identified relevant antigenic determinants of classes of structurally similar epitopes. Finally, in certain tumors, most notably chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), immunogenetic analysis has also proven instrumental in accurate patient risk stratification since cases with differing BcR IG gene sequence features follow distinct disease courses and respond differently to particular treatment modalities. Overall, delving into the BcR IG gene sequences emerges as key to understanding B cell lymphoma pathophysiology, refining prognostication and assisting in making educated treatment choices.","['Gemenetzi, Katerina', 'Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Zaragoza-Infante, Laura', 'Sofou, Electra', 'Papaioannou, Maria', 'Chatzidimitriou, Anastasia', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Gemenetzi K', 'Agathangelidis A', 'Zaragoza-Infante L', 'Sofou E', 'Papaioannou M', 'Chatzidimitriou A', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Hematology Department, University General Hospital of Thessaloniki AHEPA, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200131,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:01,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00067 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 31;10:67. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00067. eCollection 2020.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Gemenetzi, Agathangelidis, Zaragoza-Infante, Sofou,', 'Papaioannou, Chatzidimitriou and Stamatopoulos.']",PMC7006488,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', 'germinal center (GC)', 'immunogenetics', 'mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)', 'ontogeny', 'patient prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found higher numbers of programmed death-1 (PD-1) + exhausted T cells in peripheral blood (PB) from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. To investigate the leukemic BM influence on immunosuppression, we further compared the distributions of PD-1 and T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3) and the exhausted T cell phenotype in PB and BM from AML patients and characterized their relationship with clinical outcome. Methods: PB and BM samples from 15 patients with newly diagnosed AML were collected and analyzed for the expression of PD-1, Tim-3, CD244, and CD57 on CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells by multicolor flow cytometry. Results: The proportions of PD-1 + CD3+ and PD-1 + CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in BM compared with PB. Similarly, higher PD-1 + CD244 + CD3+ and PD-1 + CD244 + CD8+ T cells were found in BM, and an increased tendency for PD-1 + CD244 + CD4+ T cells was also detected in this group. In contrast, increased Tim-3 + CD4+/Tim-3 + CD244 + CD4+ T cells were predominant in BM compared with PB, but there was no statistically significant difference in Tim-3 + CD8+ T cells. Moreover, PD-1 and Tim-3 double-positive CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in the BM group. In addition, a higher proportion of PD-1 + Tim-3 + CD3+ T cells in the BM and PD-1 + Tim-3 + CD4+ T cells in PB was detected in non-complete remission (NCR) compared with complete remission (CR) patients after first-cycle chemotherapy. Conclusions: Upregulation of PD-1 and Tim-3 and the exhausted phenotype of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the BM of AML patients may contribute to mediating the leukemic immunosuppressive microenvironment, and increased PD-1 + Tim-3+ CD8+ T cells may be related to T cell dysfunction in AML, which may influence clinical outcome.","['Tan, Jiaxiong', 'Yu, Zhi', 'Huang, Jingying', 'Chen, Youchun', 'Huang, Shuxin', 'Yao, Danlin', 'Xu, Ling', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Tan J', 'Yu Z', 'Huang J', 'Chen Y', 'Huang S', 'Yao D', 'Xu L', 'Lu Y', 'Chen S', 'Li Y']","['1Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '1Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '1Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '1Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '1Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548', '2Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.grid.258164.c0000 0004 1790 3548']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200213,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:01,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-020-0185-8 [doi]', '185 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2020 Feb 13;8:6. doi: 10.1186/s40364-020-0185-8. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0974-4036'],,['(c) The Author(s). 2020.'],PMC7020501,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PD-1', 'T cell exhaustion', 'T cell subset', 'Tim-3']",,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many are chemo- and radiotherapy resistant, thus conventional treatments fail to increase overall survival. Natural Killer (NK) cells exert anti-tumor activity upon detection of a complex array of tumor ligands, but this has not been thoroughly explored in the context of sarcoma immunotherapy. In this study, we investigated the NK cell receptor/ligand immune profile of primary human sarcoma explants. Analysis of tumors from 32 sarcoma patients identified the proliferative marker PCNA and DNAM-1 ligands CD112 and/or CD155 as commonly expressed antigens that could be efficiently targeted by genetically modified (GM) NK cells. Despite the strong expression of CD112 and CD155 on sarcoma cells, characterization of freshly dissociated sarcomas revealed a general decrease in tumor-infiltrating NK cells compared to the periphery, suggesting a defect in the endogenous NK cell response. We also applied a functional screening approach to identify relevant NK cell receptor/ligand interactions that induce efficient anti-tumor responses using a panel NK-92 cell lines GM to over-express 12 different activating receptors. Using GM NK-92 cells against primary sarcoma explants (n = 12) revealed that DNAM-1 over-expression on NK-92 cells led to efficient degranulation against all tested explants (n = 12). Additionally, NKG2D over-expression showed enhanced responses against 10 out of 12 explants. These results show that DNAM-1(+) or NKG2D(+) GM NK-92 cells may be an efficient approach in targeting sarcomas. The degranulation capacity of GM NK-92 cell lines was also tested against various established tumor cell lines, including neuroblastoma, Schwannoma, melanoma, myeloma, leukemia, prostate, pancreatic, colon, and lung cancer. Enhanced degranulation of DNAM-1(+) or NKG2D(+) GM NK-92 cells was observed against the majority of tumor cell lines tested. In conclusion, DNAM-1 or NKG2D over-expression elicited a dynamic increase in NK cell degranulation against all sarcoma explants and cancer cell lines tested, including those that failed to induce a notable response in WT NK-92 cells. These results support the broad therapeutic potential of DNAM-1(+) or NKG2D(+) GM NK-92 cells and GM human NK cells for the treatment of sarcomas and other malignancies.","['Sayitoglu, Ece Canan', 'Georgoudaki, Anna-Maria', 'Chrobok, Michael', 'Ozkazanc, Didem', 'Josey, Benjamin J', 'Arif, Muhammad', 'Kusser, Kim', 'Hartman, Michelle', 'Chinn, Tamara M', 'Potens, Renee', 'Pamukcu, Cevriye', 'Krueger, Robin', 'Zhang, Cheng', 'Mardinoglu, Adil', 'Alici, Evren', 'Temple, Harry Thomas', 'Sutlu, Tolga', 'Duru, Adil Doganay']","['Sayitoglu EC', 'Georgoudaki AM', 'Chrobok M', 'Ozkazanc D', 'Josey BJ', 'Arif M', 'Kusser K', 'Hartman M', 'Chinn TM', 'Potens R', 'Pamukcu C', 'Krueger R', 'Zhang C', 'Mardinoglu A', 'Alici E', 'Temple HT', 'Sutlu T', 'Duru AD']","['Dr. Kiran C.

The potential interactions between imatinib and coadministered drugs in this ""special"" population also remains largely unexplored. This study implements a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling approach to investigate optimal dosing regimens and potential drug interactions with imatinib in the paediatric population. A PBPK model for imatinib was developed in the Simcyp Simulator (version 17) utilizing in silico, in vitro drug metabolism, and in vivo pharmacokinetic data and verified using an independent set of published clinical pharmacokinetic data. The model was then extrapolated to children and adolescents (aged 2-18 years) by incorporating developmental changes in organ size and maturation of drug-metabolising enzymes and plasma protein responsible for imatinib disposition. The PBPK model described imatinib pharmacokinetics in adult and paediatric populations and predicted drug interaction with carbamazepine, a cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and 2C8 inducer, with a good accuracy (evaluated by visual inspections of the simulation results and predicted pharmacokinetic parameters that were within 1.25-fold of the clinically observed values). The PBPK simulation suggests that the optimal dosing regimen range for imatinib is 230-340 mg/m(2)/d in paediatrics, which is supported by the recommended initial dose for treatment of childhood CML. The simulations also highlighted that children and adults being treated with imatinib have similar vulnerability to CYP modulations. A PBPK model for imatinib was successfully developed with an excellent performance in predicting imatinib pharmacokinetics across age groups. This PBPK model is beneficial to guide optimal dosing regimens for imatinib and predict drug interactions with CYP modulators in the paediatric population.","['Adiwidjaja, Jeffry', 'Boddy, Alan V', 'McLachlan, Andrew J']","['Adiwidjaja J', 'Boddy AV', 'McLachlan AJ']","['Sydney Pharmacy School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'University of South Australia Cancer Research Institute, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Sydney Pharmacy School, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200130,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:01,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.01672 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Jan 30;10:1672. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.01672. eCollection 2019.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Adiwidjaja, Boddy and McLachlan.']",PMC7002565,,['NOTNLM'],"['drug interactions', 'imatinib', 'paediatrics', 'physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)', 'simulation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By screening 79 commercially available natural products, we found that the natural compound deguelin exhibited a profound anti-tumor effect on NSCLC via directly down-regulating of EGFR-signaling pathway. Deguelin potently inhibited in vitro EGFR kinase activity of wild type (WT), exon 19 deletion, and L858R/T790M-mutated EGFR. The in silico docking study indicated that deguelin was docked into the ATP-binding pocket of EGFRs. By suppression of EGFR signaling, deguelin inhibited anchorage-dependent, and independent growth of NSCLC cell lines, and significantly delayed tumorigenesis in vivo. Further study showed that deguelin inhibited EGFR and downstream kinase Akt, which resulted in the activation of GSK3beta and eventually enhanced Mcl-1 phosphorylation at S159. Moreover, deguelin promoted the interaction between Mcl-1 and E3 ligase SCF(FBW7), which enhanced FBW7-mediated Mcl-1 ubiquitination and degradation. Additionally, phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by GSK3beta is a prerequisite for FBW7-mediated Mcl-1 destruction. Depletion or pharmacological inactivation of GSK3beta compromised deguelin-induced Mcl-1 ubiquitination and reduction. Taken together, our data indicate that enhancement of ubiquitination-dependent Mcl-1 turnover might be a promising approach for cancer treatment.","['Gao, Feng', 'Yu, Xinfang', 'Li, Ming', 'Zhou, Li', 'Liu, Wenbin', 'Li, Wei', 'Liu, Haidan']","['Gao F', 'Yu X', 'Li M', 'Zhou L', 'Liu W', 'Li W', 'Liu H']","['Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, 410011, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the optimal dose of thiotepa, administered as part of the thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (TBF) conditioning regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation in adults with AML in CR. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective multicenter analysis, we identified 240 patients allotransplanted from matched related or unrelated donors or T replete haplo-identical donors. We compared the transplantation outcomes of patients who received 5 mg/kg thiotepa and 2 days of intravenous busulfan at 6.4 mg/kg (T1B2F) versus those who received 10 mg/kg thiotepa with 2 days of intravenous busulfan at 6.4 mg/kg (T2B2F). The median follow-up was 20 months. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the incidence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) grade II to IV was significantly lower in the T1B2F group (19%) versus 32% in the T2B2F group (P = .029). This result was confirmed on multivariate analysis; acute GVHD was higher for patients receiving T2B2F (hazard ratio, 2.22; P = .024). No significant change in non-relapse mortality, progression-free survival, or overall survival was observed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: T2B2F is associated with a higher incidence of acute GVHD compared with T1B2F. These results suggest that a lower dose-intensity of thiotepa and busulfan in the TBF regimen may yield better results in patients with AML in CR.","['El-Cheikh, Jean', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Al-Chami, Farouk', 'Bazarbachi, Ali', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Carella, Angelo Michele', 'Castagna, Luca', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Iori, Anna Paola', 'La Nasa, Giorgio', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['El-Cheikh J', 'Labopin M', 'Al-Chami F', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Angelucci E', 'Santarone S', 'Bonifazi F', 'Carella AM', 'Castagna L', 'Bruno B', 'Iori AP', 'La Nasa G', 'Savani B', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.

Also, gastric cancer is the second fatal carcinoma. B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 gene family plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis by inhibiting the apoptosis process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 129 patients with breast cancer and 132 controls as well as 136 patients with gastric cancer and 50 controls were enrolled. We used Real time PCR to determine the genotype of the samples. Finally, we analyzed the diagram based on high temperature melting curve diagram using the MICPCR software, followed by bioinformatics prediction of rs1016860 functions. RESULTS: rs1016860 of BCL2 gene with CC, CT, and TT genotypes were observed in this region. The association of Estrogen receptor and Progesterone receptor, cancer stage and grade of cancer in the patients with genotypes was significant in breast cancer. The association of the status of primary tumor in the patients with genotypes is significant in gastric cancer (Chi-Square p < 0.05 and p = 0.000 did not follow the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). DISCUSSION: It was predicted that the TT genotype could be dangerous in breast cancer and gastric cancer; it is expected via bioinformatics that this SNP could lead to signaling pathways of cancer progression, by altering the binding potential of miR-629-5p to BCL2 3'UTR.","['Hashemi Doulabi, Mahsa Sadat', 'Ghaedi, Kamran', 'Ranji, Najmeh', 'Khazaei Koohpar, Zeinab']","['Hashemi Doulabi MS', 'Ghaedi K', 'Ranji N', 'Khazaei Koohpar Z']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Faculty of Biological Science and Technology, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran; Department of Cellular Biotechnology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Biotechnology, ACECR, Isfahan, Iran.

It plays an important role in B-cell development and function and is an attractive target for antibody-directed immunotherapies against B-cell malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in humans. With the rapid development of next-generation immunotherapies aimed at improving therapeutic efficacy, there is a pressing need for a clinically relevant, immune-competent, spontaneous animal model to derisk these new approaches and inform human immunotherapy clinical trials. Pet dogs develop spontaneous B-cell malignancies, including B-NHL and leukemias that share comparable oncogenic pathways and similar immunosuppressive features to human B-cell malignancies. Despite treatment with multiagent chemotherapy, durable remissions in canine B-NHL are rare and most dogs succumb to their disease within 1 year of diagnosis. Here we report the development and validation of an anti-canine CD19-targeting monoclonal antibody and its single-chain derivatives, which enable next-generation CD19-targeted immunotherapies to be developed and evaluated in client-owned dogs with spontaneous B-NHL. These future in vivo studies aim to provide important information regarding the safety and therapeutic efficacy of CD19-targeted mono- and combination therapies and identify correlative biomarkers of response that will help to inform human clinical trial design. In addition, development of canine CD19-targeted immunotherapies aims to provide better therapeutic options for pet dogs diagnosed with B-cell malignancies.","['Haran, Kumudhini Preethi', 'Lockhart, Alexandra', 'Xiong, Ailian', 'Radaelli, Enrico', 'Savickas, Patrick J', 'Posey, Avery', 'Mason, Nicola J']","['Haran KP', 'Lockhart A', 'Xiong A', 'Radaelli E', 'Savickas PJ', 'Posey A', 'Mason NJ']","['Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Advanced Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathobiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapy, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Corporal Michael J.

METHODS: From 1991 to 2018, 43 allogeneic SCT recipients were enrolled in the study to investigate the demographic characteristics, survival outcomes and prognostic factors. RESULTS: With the median follow-up of 7.1 years, the estimated 10-year OS, FFS, GFFS were 86.0%, 60.5%, and 51.2%, respectively. Matched related donors (MRD, n = 28) showed better 10-year OS than unrelated donors (n = 15) (96.4% vs. 66.7%; P = 0.006). Engraftment failure was seen in 13 patients (30.2%). Donor-type aplasia was seen in 13.8% (4/29) after fludarabine (Flu)-based conditioning (Flu-group), while in 42.6% (6/14) after cyclophosphamide (Cy)-based regimen (Cy-group) (P = 0.035). Six patients died. The 10-year OS in Cy-group was 92.9% (n = 14, all MRD), while that of Flu-group was 82.1% (n = 29; P = 0.367). But Flu-group tended to have better FFS and GFFS than Cy-group, although Flu-group had less MRDs (41.4% vs. 100%; P = 0.019), and higher proportion of previous immunosuppressive treatment (IST; 62% vs. 21.4%, P = 0.012). In MRD transplants, OS was similar between Flu-group (100%, n = 14) and Cy-group (92.9%, n = 14), while FFS (100.0% vs. 42.9%; P = 0.001) and GFFS (85.7% vs. 35.7%; P = 0.006) were significantly better in Flu-group. Stem cell sources, irradiation in the conditioning, and method of GvHD prophylaxis did not significantly influence the outcome. CONCLUSION: This study reviewed SCT outcomes for pediatric AA with changes of transplant strategies over the last 25 years. The FFS and GFFS were higher in Flu-group than in Cy-group, especially in matched related transplantation. Graft failure including donor-type aplasia remains troublesome even with Flu-based conditioning. Further refinement of transplant strategies to ensure better quality-of-life should be pursued.","['Im, Seung Hwan', 'Kim, Bo Ram', 'Park, Soo Min', 'Yoon, Bo Ae', 'Hwang, Tai Ju', 'Baek, Hee Jo', 'Kook, Hoon']","['Im SH', 'Kim BR', 'Park SM', 'Yoon BA', 'Hwang TJ', 'Baek HJ', 'Kook H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University Medical School, Hwasun, Korea.', 'Environmental Health Center for Childhood Leukemia and Cancer, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Korea. hoonkook@chonnam.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200224,Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['35.e46 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e46 [doi]']",epublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2020 Feb 24;35(7):e46. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e46.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9529-0255', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1262-0031', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1943-0636', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3028-7335', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1752-1967', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2301-9823', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9135-5821']",,['(c) 2020 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.'],PMC7036341,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aplastic Anemia', 'Children', 'Donor-Type Aplasia', 'Engraftment Failure', 'Fludarabine', 'Survival']",,,['The authors have no potential conflicts of interest to disclose.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the first analysis of the prospective PRO study within the Swedish acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) registries. METHODS: PRO was requested 6 months after diagnosis. The EORTC Quality of life Questionnaire Core 30-item, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), and questions from a Swedish National Cancer Questionnaire were used. RESULTS: An invitation letter was sent to 398 patients; 255 (64%) responded, 60% web-based, and 40% on paper. The ALL cohort had lower physical, role and social functioning, higher symptom burden, and more financial difficulties compared to the AML cohort. A PHQ-8 score >/= 10p, which indicates depression, was reported in 18% of the patients; 33% of these patients reported being prescribed antidepressants. The patients' overall experience of care was satisfying, but more psychological and practical support was desired. There was no difference in survival between patients who reported their PRO and those who did not. Follow-up at 2 and 4 years is ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: PRO collected in a registry-based setting is feasible, but the selection of time points and questionnaires are delicate in a diverse patient population.","['Lennmyr, Emma Bergfelt', 'Karlsson, Karin', 'Abrahamsson, Marie', 'Ebrahim, Fereshte', 'Lubking, Anna', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Hallbook, Helene']","['Lennmyr EB', 'Karlsson K', 'Abrahamsson M', 'Ebrahim F', 'Lubking A', 'Hoglund M', 'Juliusson G', 'Hallbook H']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiophysics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Regional Cancer Center, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Regional Cancer Center, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiophysics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiophysics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200305,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Depression/epidemiology/etiology', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Public Health Surveillance', '*Quality of Life', 'Registries', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13399 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Jun;104(6):571-580. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13399.

After exploring global gene-expression profiles of progressive (n = 22) vs. progression-free (n = 28) T-LBL patients, 43 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified. Then an eleven-gene-based classifier was established using LASSO Cox regression based on NanoString quantification. In the training cohort (n = 169), high-risk patients stratified using the classifier had significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS: hazards ratio 4.123, 95% CI 2.565-6.628; p < 0.001), disease-free survival (DFS: HR 3.148, 95% CI 1.857-5.339; p < 0.001), and overall survival (OS: HR 3.790, 95% CI 2.237-6.423; p < 0.001) compared with low-risk patients. The prognostic accuracy of the classifier was validated in the internal testing (n = 84) and independent validation cohorts (n = 360). A prognostic nomogram consisting of five independent variables including the classifier, lactate dehydrogenase levels, ECOG-PS, central nervous system involvement, and NOTCH1/FBXW7 status showed significantly greater prognostic accuracy than each single variable alone. The addition of a five-miRNA-based signature further enhanced the accuracy of this nomogram. Furthermore, patients with a nomogram score >/=154.2 significantly benefited from the BFM protocol. In conclusion, our nomogram comprising the 11-gene-based classifier may make contributions to individual prognosis prediction and treatment decision-making.","['Tian, Xiao-Peng', 'Xie, Dan', 'Huang,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) induce prolonged remission in CML, and therapy discontinuation is an accepted approach to patients with reduction in Bcr-abl transcripts of four logs or greater. Half such individuals sustain a therapy free remission, but molecular mechanisms predicting relapse are undefined. We found relative calpain inhibition in CML cells with stabilization of calpain substrates, including betacatenin and Xiap1. Since the Survivin gene is activated by betacatenin, this identified two apoptosis-resistance mechanisms. We found that Survivin impaired apoptosis in leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and Xiap1 in CML granulocytes. Consistent with this, we determined treatment with an inhibitor of Survivin, but not Xiap1, prevented relapse during TKI treatment and after therapy discontinuation in a murine CML model. By transcriptome profiling, we identified activation of innate immune response pathways in murine CML bone marrow progenitors. This was increased by TKI treatment alone, but normalized with addition of a Survivin inhibitor. We found that activation of the innate immune response induced rapid blast crisis in untreated CML mice, and chronic phase relapse during a TKI discontinuation attempt. These results suggest that extrinsic stress exerts adverse effects on CML-LSCs.","['Huang, Weiqi', 'Liu, Bin', 'Eklund, Elizabeth A']","['Huang W', 'Liu B', 'Eklund EA']","['The Feinberg School, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Jesse Brown Veterans Health Administration Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'The Feinberg School, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'The Feinberg School, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA. e-eklund@northwestern.edu.', 'Jesse Brown Veterans Health Administration Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA. e-eklund@northwestern.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200220,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Birc5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Blast Crisis', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Recurrence', 'Survivin/antagonists & inhibitors']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0771-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0771-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Sep;34(9):2364-2374. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0771-7.

We here report KDM4D histone demethylase as a key regulator of adipogenesis in C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal stem cells. The depletion of KDM4D results in impaired differentiation, which can be rescued by exogenous KDM4D, PPARgamma, and C/EBPalpha, but not by C/EBPbeta. In addition, KDM4D interacts physically and functionally with both NFIB and MLL1 complex to regulate C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma expression upon adipogenic hormonal induction. Although KDM4D is dispensable for the binding of both NFIB and MLL1 complex to the target promoters, the demethylation of tri-methylated H3K9 by KDM4D is required for NFIB and MLL1 complex to deposit tri-methylated H3K4 and activate PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha expression. Taken together, our data provide a molecular framework for lineage-specific transcription factor and histone modifiers to cooperate in adipogenic differentiation, in which KDM4D removes repressive histone marks at genes with a bivalent chromatin domain and allows NFIB and MLL1 complex to promote the expression of key adipogenic regulators.","['Choi, Jang Hyun', 'Lee, Hansol']","['Choi JH', 'Lee H']","['Department of Biological Sciences, College of Natural Science, Inha University, 100 Inha-ro, Michuhol-gu, Incheon, 22212, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Natural Science, Inha University, 100 Inha-ro, Michuhol-gu, Incheon, 22212, Korea. hlee@inha.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200220,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (NFI Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfib protein, mouse)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM4D protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['*Adipogenesis', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'NFI Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'PPAR gamma/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-60049-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-60049-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 20;10(1):3050. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-60049-8.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3280-1991'],,,PMC7033117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This poor patient survival is at least partly caused by glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), which are slowly-dividing and therefore therapy-resistant. GSCs are localized in protective hypoxic peri-arteriolar niches where these aforementioned stemness properties are maintained. We previously showed that hypoxic peri-arteriolar GSC niches in human glioblastoma are functionally similar to hypoxic peri-arteriolar hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches in human bone marrow. GSCs and HSCs express the receptor C-X-C receptor type 4 (CXCR4), which binds to the chemoattractant stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), which is highly expressed in GSC niches in glioblastoma and HSC niches in bone marrow. This receptor-ligand interaction retains the GSCs/HSCs in their niches and thereby maintains their slowly-dividing state. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leukemic cells use the SDF-1alpha-CXCR4 interaction to migrate to HSC niches and become slowly-dividing and therapy-resistant leukemic stem cells (LSCs). In this communication, we aim to elucidate how disruption of the SDF-1alpha-CXCR4 interaction using the FDA-approved CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor (AMD3100) may be used to force slowly-dividing cancer stem cells out of their niches in glioblastoma and AML. Ultimately, this strategy aims to induce GSC and LSC differentiation and their sensitization to therapy.","['Hira, Vashendriya V V', 'Van Noorden, Cornelis J F', 'Molenaar, Remco J']","['Hira VVV', 'Van Noorden CJF', 'Molenaar RJ']","['Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC at the Academic Medical Center, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetic Toxicology and Cancer Biology, National Institute of Biology, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC at the Academic Medical Center, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,Switzerland,Biology (Basel),Biology,101587988,,,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:01,['2020/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:01 [medline]']","['biology9020031 [pii]', '10.3390/biology9020031 [doi]']",epublish,Biology (Basel). 2020 Feb 17;9(2). pii: biology9020031. doi: 10.3390/biology9020031.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6191-0505'],['UVA 2014-6839 and UVA 2016. 1-10460/KWF Kankerbestrijding'],,PMC7168055,,['NOTNLM'],"['C-X-C receptor type 4', 'Glioblastoma', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'glioblastoma stem cells', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'niches', 'plerixafor', 'stromal-derived factor-1alpha']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis of patients varies even in the same risk groups. Searching for novel prognostic markers is warranted. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for chemoresistance and relapse in leukemia. Recently, expressions of 17 genes related to stemness of LSCs were found to be associated with prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia patients. However, the clinical impact of LSC genes expressions in MDS, a disorder arising from hematopoietic stem cells, remains unclear. We analyzed expression profile of the 17 stemness-related genes in primary MDS patients and identified expression of 4 genes (LAPTM4B, NGFRAP1, EMP1, and CPXM1) were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS). We constructed an LSC4 scoring system based on the weighted sums of the expression of 4 genes and explored its clinical implications in MDS patients. Higher LSC4 scores were associated with higher revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) scores, complex cytogenetics, and mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53. High-score patients had significantly shorter OS and leukemia-free survival (LFS), which was also confirmed in 2 independent validation cohorts. Subgroup analysis revealed the prognostic significance of LSC4 scores for OS remained valid across IPSS-R lower- and higher-risk groups. Furthermore, higher LSC4 score was an independent adverse risk factor for OS and LFS in multivariate analysis. In summary, LSC4 score can independently predict prognosis in MDS patients irrespective of IPSS-R risks and may be used to guide the treatment of MDS patients, especially lower-risk group in whom usually only supportive treatment is given.","['Wang, Yu-Hung', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Yao, Chi-Yuan', 'Hsu, Chia-Lang', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Tsai, Cheng-Hong', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Wang YH', 'Lin CC', 'Yao CY', 'Hsu CL', 'Hou HA', 'Tsai CH', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF']","['Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (LAPTM4B protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cells']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31470-1 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001185 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 25;4(4):644-654. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001185.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7042996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical significance of FOXN3 and its potential role in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) remain largely unknown. METHODS: A total of 117 de novo AML patients newly diagnosed between December 2015 and January 2018 were included in this study. The expression of FOXN3 and its clinical significance were analysed in these AML patients. RESULTS: The expression of FOXN3 was significantly downregulated in AML. In addition, lower FOXN3 expression was associated with older age and higher white blood cell counts. Moreover, a close correlation was observed between lower FOXN3 expression and a lower complete remission (CR) rate and shorter overall survival (OS), which was further analysed by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that FOXN3 is a novel biomarker in AML and that lower FOXN3 expression predicts poor chemotherapy response and prognosis in AML.","['Zhang, Jinjing', 'Wang, Yue', 'Mo, Wenbin', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Li, Yan']","['Zhang J', 'Wang Y', 'Mo W', 'Zhang R', 'Li Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200220,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (FOXN3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Survival Rate']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13162 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Jun;42(3):270-276. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13162.

Mediator release potency was investigated in passively sensitized rat basophil leukaemia (RBL) 2H3-cells. IgE binding to synthetic overlapping peptides of Pis s 1 was detected on multipeptide microarrays. RESULTS: 19 pea-sensitized children were included, 14 with doctors' diagnosed allergy and 5 with tolerance to pea (median age 3.5 and 4.5 years, respectively). 11/14 (78%) pea-allergic and 1/5 (20%) tolerant children were sensitized to Pis s 1. Under the reducing conditions of immunoblot analysis, IgE binding to rPA1 was negligible, sensitization to rPA2 and nsLTP undetectable. Compared to pea total protein extract, rPis s 1 displayed on average 58% IgE binding capacity and a 20-fold higher mediator release potency. Selected Pis s 1-related peptides displayed IgE binding in pea-allergic but not in pea-tolerant children. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In this study group, Pis s 1 is a major immunodominant allergen in pea-allergic children. Evidence for sensitization to nsLTP and 2S albumins was low but requires further verification with regard to conformational epitopes. Recombinant Pis s 1 and related peptides which were exclusively recognized by pea-allergic children may improve in vitro diagnosis of pea allergy once verified in prospective studies with larger study groups.","['Popp, Jasmin', 'Trendelenburg, Valerie', 'Niggemann, Bodo', 'Randow, Stefanie', 'Volker, Elke', 'Vogel, Lothar', 'Reuter, Andreas', 'Spiric, Jelena', 'Schiller, Dirk', 'Beyer, Kirsten', 'Holzhauser, Thomas']","['Popp J', 'Trendelenburg V', 'Niggemann B', 'Randow S', 'Volker E', 'Vogel L', 'Reuter A', 'Spiric J', 'Schiller D', 'Beyer K', 'Holzhauser T']","['Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Immunology and Intensive Care Medicine, Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200309,England,Clin Exp Allergy,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,8906443,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Allergens/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Food Hypersensitivity/diagnosis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Peas/genetics/immunology', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/immunology', 'Rats']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/08/13 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cea.13590 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Allergy. 2020 May;50(5):625-635. doi: 10.1111/cea.13590.

While typically well-tolerated, clinical experience with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (particularly those of the second and third generations) has highlighted unanticipated associations with serious non-cancer adverse effects on various organs, particularly the cardiovascular system. RECENT FINDINGS: Herein, we review the current literature surrounding the major cardiovascular toxicities of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myelogenous leukemia, discuss potential mechanisms underpinning their development, and suggest future research directions to uncover novel ways to reduce cardiovascular events in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. As a whole, while cardiovascular toxicities are well-documented, the mechanistic basis of these clinical observations remains poorly defined. In turn, to provide safe and effective treatment to all patients, it is necessary to close the knowledge gap regarding mechanisms that drive toxicity and elucidate the complex interactions that predispose specific individuals to these toxicities.","['Gustafson, Dakota', 'Fish, Jason E', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Aghel, Nazanin']","['Gustafson D', 'Fish JE', 'Lipton JH', 'Aghel N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Toronto General Hospital Research Institute University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. jeff.lipton@uhn.ca.', 'Division of Cardiology, Juravinski Cancer Centre, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada. aghel@hhsc.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*chemically induced/enzymology/physiopathology/prevention & control', 'Cardiovascular System/*drug effects/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00560-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00560-x [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Feb;15(1):20-30. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00560-x.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Biomarker', '*Cardiovascular', '*Endothelial', '*Endothelium', '*Inflammation', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluated the applicability of panel-based RNA sequencing and array CGH within the diagnostic workflow of the German study group of the international AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017 trial. In a consecutive cohort of 117 children with B cell precursor (BCP) ALL, array analysis identified twelve cases with an IKZF1(plus) profile of gene deletions and one case of masked hypodiploidy. Genetic markers BCR-ABL1 (n = 1), ETV6-RUNX1 (n = 25), and rearrangements involving KMT2A (n = 3) or TCF3 (n = 3) were assessed by established conventional techniques such as karyotyping, FISH, and RT-PCR. Comparison of these results with RNA sequencing analysis revealed overall consistency in n=115/117 cases, albeit with one undetected AFF1-KMT2A fusion in RNA sequencing and one undetected ETV6-RUNX1 fusion in conventional analyses. The combined application of RNA sequencing, FISH, and CGH+SNP array reliably detected all genetic markers necessary for risk stratification and will be used as the diagnostic standard workflow for BCP-ALL patients enrolled in the AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017 study. Prospectively, consistent collection of genome-wide CGH+SNP array as well as RNA sequencing data will be a valuable source to elucidate new prognostic lesions beyond established markers of pediatric ALL. In this respect, RNA sequencing identified various gene fusions in up to half of the IKZF1(plus) (n = 6/12) and B-other (n = 19/36) cases but not in cases with hyperdiploid karyotypes (n = 35). Among these fusions, this study reports several previously undescribed in frame PAX5 fusions, including PAX5-MYO1G and PAX5-NCOA6.","['Schieck, Maximilian', 'Lentes, Jana', 'Thomay, Kathrin', 'Hofmann, Winfried', 'Behrens, Yvonne Lisa', 'Hagedorn, Maike', 'Ebersold, Juliane', 'Davenport, Colin F', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Buchmann, Swantje', 'Alten, Julia', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Bergmann, Anke Katharina', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Steinemann, Doris', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Gohring, Gudrun']","['Schieck M', 'Lentes J', 'Thomay K', 'Hofmann W', 'Behrens YL', 'Hagedorn M', 'Ebersold J', 'Davenport CF', 'Fazio G', 'Moricke A', 'Buchmann S', 'Alten J', 'Cario G', 'Schrappe M', 'Bergmann AK', 'Stanulla M', 'Steinemann D', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Gohring G']","['Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany. schieck.maximilian@mh-hannover.de.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Research Core Unit Genomics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Clinic, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, Pediatric Clinic, University of Milano-Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200220,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'AIEOP acute lymphoblastic leukemia protocol']",IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', '*Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Risk Factors', '*Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcriptome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Workflow']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03953-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03953-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):809-818. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03953-3.

Prednisolone is a corticosteroid and one of the most important agents in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The mechanics of GC resistance are largely unknown and intense ongoing research focuses on this topic. AIM: The aim of the present study is to review some aspects of GC resistance in ALL, and in particular of Prednisolone, with emphasis on previous and present knowledge on gene expression and signaling pathways playing a role in the phenomenon. METHODS: An electronic literature search was conducted by the authors from 1994 to June 2019. Original articles and systematic reviews selected, and the titles and abstracts of papers screened to determine whether they met the eligibility criteria, and full texts of the selected articles were retrieved. RESULTS: Identification of gene targets responsible for glucocorticoid resistance may allow discovery of drugs, which in combination with glucocorticoids may increase the effectiveness of anti-leukemia therapies. The inherent plasticity of clinically evolving cancer justifies approaches to characterize and prevent undesirable activation of early oncogenic pathways. CONCLUSION: Study of the pattern of intracellular signal pathway activation by anticancer drugs can lead to development of efficient treatment strategies by reducing detrimental secondary effects.","['Lambrou, George I', 'Adamaki, Maria', 'Hatziagapiou, Kyriaki', 'Vlahopoulos, Spiros']","['Lambrou GI', 'Adamaki M', 'Hatziagapiou K', 'Vlahopoulos S']","['First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Choremeio Research Laboratory, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Choremeio Research Laboratory, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Choremeio Research Laboratory, Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Choremeio Research Laboratory, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Drug Res Rev,Current drug research reviews,101735701,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Prednisolone/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/10/15 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['CDRR-EPUB-104688 [pii]', '10.2174/2589977512666200220122650 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Drug Res Rev. 2020;12(2):131-149. doi: 10.2174/2589977512666200220122650.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Glucocorticoids', 'RelA', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'gene expression', 'glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis resistance', 'prednisolone']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data from the Cancer Genome Atlas-acute myeloid leukemia (TCGA-LAML) and the therapeutically applicable research to generate effective treatments (TARGET)-AML were used to assess the prognostic value of PLA2G4A in NPM1-WT AML cases. Results showed that non-M3 AML cases had significantly increased PLA2G4A expression compared with normal peripheral blood samples. Patients with high PLA2G4A expression (separated by median gene expression) had a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) compared with the group with low PLA2G4A expression, in both TCGA-LAML and TARGET-AML. Multivariate analysis showed that high PLA2G4A expression was independently associated with shorter OS in 97 non-M3/NPM1-WT AML cases in TCGA-LAML (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.946, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.094-3.462, q = 0.036). The prognostic value was validated based on 120 primary non-M3/NPM1-WT AML cases in TARGET-AML (HR: 1.518, 95% CI: 1.037-2.223, q = 0.048). Therefore, PLA2G4A expression might serve as an independent prognostic marker in OS in patients with non-M3/NPM1 WT AML. Bioinformatic analysis identified that several proteins physically interacted with PLA2G4A, some of which have well-characterized oncogenic properties in AML, such as RUVBL2, cytoskeleton regulatory protein 1 (CAP1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and MYCBP. Therefore, we hypothesized that PLA2G4A upregulation has multiple effects on the malignant phenotype of AML cells together with its partners. Future molecular studies are required to explore the detailed regulatory network involved.","['Bai, Hansong', 'Zhou, Mingxiu', 'Zeng, Ming', 'Han, Liying']","['Bai H', 'Zhou M', 'Zeng M', 'Han L']","['School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', 'School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', 'School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University, Luzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200220,United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYCBP protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group IV Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (PLA2G4A protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RUVBL2 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Group IV Phospholipases A2/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/04/16 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/dna.2019.5187 [doi]'],ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 2020 Apr;39(4):700-708. doi: 10.1089/dna.2019.5187.

Golgi protein 73 (GP73) is a serum biomarker for liver diseases, including chronic hepatitis B. Here, we determine the effect of HBV infection on GP73 production and characterized the role of GP73 in HBV replication. Initially, we show that GP73 is highly produced in the sera of HBV-positive patients with chronic liver diseases and in HBV-stimulated leukocytes. In addition, HBV stimulation promotes GP73 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from healthy donors and in macrophages derived from human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1). Notably, the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but not HBV replication, is required for the activation of GP73 expression. Moreover, in HepG2 cells and Huh7 cells, GP73 facilitates HBV replication and represses nuclear factor kappa B p50 expression, which in turn represses HBV replication and GP73 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that GP73 facilitates HBV replication by repressing the innate immune response and the nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway. Taken together, we revealed a distinct positive feedback mechanism between HBV replication and GP73 production and suggest that GP73 acts as a potential antiviral target for HBV infection.","['Liu, Long', 'Zhu, Jianyong', 'Yang, Jing', 'Li, Xiaohua', 'Yuan, Jie', 'Wu, Jianguo', 'Liu, Zhixin']","['Liu L', 'Zhu J', 'Yang J', 'Li X', 'Yuan J', 'Wu J', 'Liu Z']","['School of Basic Medical Sciences, Department of Respiratory, Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Department of Respiratory, Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Department of Respiratory, Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'Department of Emergency, Dongfeng Maojian Hospital, Sinopharm Group Corporation, Shiyan, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Department of Respiratory, Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology and College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Medical Microbiology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Department of Respiratory, Department of Infectious Diseases, Renmin Hospital, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Virology and College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200220,United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,,IM,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.25718 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Med Virol. 2020 Feb 20. doi: 10.1002/jmv.25718.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8326-2895', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7253-7438']","['81902066/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81471942/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81730061/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'Q20192104/Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Provincial Department of Education', 'Q20192105/Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Provincial Department of Education', '2018CFB093/Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation', '2018CFB185/Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation', '2017QDJZR08/Cultivating Project for Young Scholar at Hubei University of Medicine', '2016QDJZR03/Cultivating Project for Young Scholar at Hubei University of Medicine']","['(c) 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Golgi protein 73', 'acute viral infection', 'chronic viral infection', 'hepatitis B virus', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'nuclear factor-kappa B p50']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine liver iron content (LIC) by MRI in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed treatment and to compare those values with serum iron parameters. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 patients between the ages of 7 and 18 who had completed ALL treatment were included in the study. Serum iron parameters (serum iron, serum ferritin [SF], and total iron-binding capacity) and liver function tests were studied. R2 MRI was performed for determining LIC. Results: Normal LIC was detected in 22 (63.4%) of the cases. Seven (23.3%) had mild and 1 (3.3%) had moderate liver iron deposition. In contrast, severe iron overload was not detected in any of the cases. LIC levels were correlated with the numbers of packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions (r=0.637, p<0.001), pRBC transfusion volume (r=0.449, p<0.013), SF levels (r=0.561, p=0.001), and transferrin saturation (r=0.353, p=0.044). In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of pRBC transfusions and SF levels (r=0.595, p<0.001). Conclusion: We showed that the frequency of liver iron deposition was low and clinically less significant after the end of treatment in childhood ALL patients. LIC was demonstrated to be related to SF and transfusion history. These findings support that SF and transfusion history may be used as references for monitoring iron accumulation or identifying cases for further examinations such as MRI.","['Acar, Sezer', 'Gozmen, Salih', 'Bayraktaroglu, Selen', 'Acar, Sultan O.', 'Tahta, Neryal', 'Aydinok, Yesim', 'Vergin, Raziye C.']","['Acar S', 'Gozmen S', 'Bayraktaroglu S', 'Acar SO', 'Tahta N', 'Aydinok Y', 'Vergin RC']","['Dr. Behcet Uz Child Disease and Pediatric Surgery Training and Research Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Izmir, Turkey', 'Dr. Behcet Uz Child Disease and Pediatric Surgery Training and Research Hospital, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Dr. Behcet Uz Child Disease and Pediatric Surgery Training and Research Hospital, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Dr. Behcet Uz Child Disease and Pediatric Surgery Training and Research Hospital, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Izmir, Turkey', 'Dr. Behcet Uz Child Disease and Pediatric Surgery Training and Research Hospital, Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Izmir, Turkey']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200220,Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Biomarkers)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Biomarkers', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Overload/diagnosis/etiology/metabolism', 'Liver/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Function Tests', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*metabolism/pathology/therapy']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2019.0364 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2020 Nov 19;37(4):263-270. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2020.2019.0364.

The Japan Ewing Sarcoma Study Group was established to improve the prognosis of ESFT in Japan. The aim of this phase II trial was to determine the efficacy and safety of multimodal treatment for nonmetastatic ESFT. PROCEDURE: Patients with ESFT aged < 30 years were eligible for participation. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VDC) alternating with ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) repeating every 21 days for 52 weeks. Local treatment included surgery and/or radiation therapy (0-55.8 Gy) based on the margin of resection and histologic response. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) at three years. The study was designed to test whether the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval for PFS would exceed the threshold of 60%. The planned sample size was 53 patients, allowing for 10% of patients being ineligible. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients screened for entry, seven were deemed ineligible. Forty-six patients were considered as the per-protocol set and were used for the efficacy analysis. Three-year PFS was 71.7% (0.59-0.81). Estimated five-year PFS and overall survival were both 69.6%. Although no previously unknown adverse event was reported, three patients developed secondary malignancies (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and osteosarcoma, one patient each).

The aim of our study was to establish a 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) dose-concentration-response relationship through exploration of pharmacogenetic factors involved in the thiopurine-induced toxicities in Chinese paediatric patients afflicted by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from ALL children treated with 6-MP. We determined the metabolite steady-state concentrations of 6-MP in red blood cells (RBCs) by using high-performance liquid chromatography. Pharmacogenetic analysis was carried out on patients' genomic DNA using the MassArray genotyping platform. RESULTS: Sixty children afflicted by ALL who received 6-MP treatment were enrolled in this study. The median concentration of 6-thioguanine in patients afflicted by leukopenia was 235.83 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs, which was significantly higher than for patients unafflicted by leukopenia (178.90 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs; P = 0.029). We determined the population special target 6-thioguanine threshold to have equalled 197.50 pmol/8 x 10(8) RBCs to predict leukopenia risk in Chinese paediatric patients afflicted by ALL. Among 36 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms, our results indicated that NUDT15 (rs116855232) and IMPDH1 (rs2278293) were correlated with a 5.50-fold and 5.80-fold higher risk of leukopenia, respectively. MTHFR rs1801133 variants were found to have had a 4.46-fold significantly higher risk of hepatotoxicity vs wild-type genotype. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the idea that predetermination of genotypes and monitoring of thiopurine metabolism for Chinese paediatric patients afflicted by ALL is necessary to effectively predict the efficacy of treatments and to minimize the adverse effects of 6-MP maintenance therapy.","['Zhou, Yue', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhai, Xiao-Ying', 'Wen, Li', 'Tang, Fang', 'Yang, Fan', 'Liu, Xi-Ting', 'Dong, Lei', 'Zhi, Li-Juan', 'Shi, Hai-Yan', 'Hao, Guo-Xiang', 'Zheng, Yi', 'Jacqz-Aigrain, Evelyne', 'Wang, Tian-You', 'Zhao, Wei']","['Zhou Y', 'Wang L', 'Zhai XY', 'Wen L', 'Tang F', 'Yang F', 'Liu XT', 'Dong L', 'Zhi LJ', 'Shi HY', 'Hao GX', 'Zheng Y', 'Jacqz-Aigrain E', 'Wang TY', 'Zhao W']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Hebei Province affiliated to Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China."", ""Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Hebei Province affiliated to Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China."", ""Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Hebei Province affiliated to Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China."", 'Big data Center, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, the First Hospital Affiliated with Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Children's Hospital of Hebei Province affiliated to Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China."", ""Department of Paediatric Haematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of Hebei Province affiliated to Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, China."", 'Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, the First Hospital Affiliated with Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics (Capital Medical University), Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.', ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, the First Hospital Affiliated with Shandong First Medical University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200303,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'China', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Thioguanine']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14258 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2020 Aug;86(8):1519-1527. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14258.

METHODS: Data from both studies were pooled (n = 123) to develop a population PK model. Covariates included demographics, disease state, liver and kidney function, prior treatment, and antidrug antibodies (ADAs). Exposure-response and exposure-safety were analysed separately by study. A 1-compartment model with linear elimination from the central compartment and 2 clearance (CL) rates was developed. RESULTS: Moxetumomab pasudotox was cleared more rapidly after cycle 1, day 1 (CL1 = 24.7 L/h) than subsequently (CL2 = 3.76 L/h), with high interindividual variability (116 and 109%, respectively). In Study 1053, patients with ADA titres >10 240 showed ~4-fold increase in CL. Higher exposures (>/=median) were related to higher response rates, capillary leak syndrome and increased creatinine (Study 1053 only), or grade >/=3 adverse events (Study 1001 only). Clinical benefits were still observed in patients with lower exposure or high ADA titres. CONCLUSION: Despite a high incidence of immunogenicity with increased clearance, moxetumomab pasudotox demonstrated efficacy in hairy cell leukaemia.","['Kuruvilla, Denison', 'Chia, Yen Lin', 'Balic, Kemal', 'Yao, Nai Shun', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Li, Xia', 'Standifer, Nathan', 'Liang, Meina', 'Tseng, Chih-Ming', 'Faggioni, Raffaella', 'Roskos, Lorin']","['Kuruvilla D', 'Chia YL', 'Balic K', 'Yao NS', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I', 'Li X', 'Standifer N', 'Liang M', 'Tseng CM', 'Faggioni R', 'Roskos L']","['AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200316,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '2NDX4B6N8F (immunotoxin HA22)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'Exotoxins', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Hairy Cell']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/07/27 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14250 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2020 Jul;86(7):1367-1376. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14250.

Indications for treatment were hematological relapse (n = 17), MRD positivity (n = 2), inability to continue intensive chemotherapy (n = 1), and bridging to a second alloSCT (n = 1). Blinatumomab was given as first salvage in 11 patients and after at least one prior salvage treatment in eight.Complete response (CR) was newly achieved in 47% and was maintained in 75% of patients with baseline CR. At a median follow-up of 12.4 months, 13 patients were alive, and 11 in CR. Median leukemia-free survival was 8.7 months, and median overall survival was 15.2 months. Median leukemia-free survival and overall survival were not reached in patients proceeding to alloSCT compared to 5.1 and 15.2 months, respectively, for patients who did not receive stem cell transplantation.Treatment was well tolerated with neurological events reported in two patients (10%) and GI events in three patients (14%).

Although the etiology of PH in MF is unclear, early predictors may be detected by echocardiogram. The goals of our study were to evaluate the prevalence of PH as determined by echocardiography in a cohort of MF patients and to identify clinical risk factors for PH. We performed a retrospective review of MF patients from October 2015 to May 2017 at MD Anderson Cancer Center in the ambulatory clinic, and those with echocardiogram were included. Clinical, echocardiographic, and laboratory data were reviewed. Patients with and without PH were compared using a chi-square or Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression was performed with an outcome variable of PH. There were 143 patients with MF who underwent echocardiogram, and 20 (14%) had echocardiographic findings consistent with PH. Older age, male gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, dyspnea, hematocrit, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and N-terminal prohormone BNP (NT-proBNP) were significantly different between those without PH and those with PH (p < 0.05). Female gender was protective (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.049-0.90, p = 0.035), and NT-proBNP was a significant clinical predictor of PH (OR 1.07, CI 1.02 = 1.12, p = 0.006). PH in MF is lower than previously reported in our MF cohort, but many patients had cardiac comorbidities. PH due to left-sided heart disease may be underestimated in MF. Evaluation of respiratory symptoms and elevated NT-proBNP should prompt a baseline echocardiogram. Early detection of PH with a multidisciplinary approach may allow treatment of reversible etiologies.","['Lopez-Mattei, Juan', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Fellman, Bryan', 'Iliescu, Cezar', 'Bhatti, Karan', 'Hassan, Saamir A', 'Kim, Peter', 'Gray, Brian A', 'Palaskas, Nicolas L', 'Grosu, Horiana B', 'Mamas, Mamas A', 'Faiz, Saadia A']","['Lopez-Mattei J', 'Verstovsek S', 'Fellman B', 'Iliescu C', 'Bhatti K', 'Hassan SA', 'Kim P', 'Gray BA', 'Palaskas NL', 'Grosu HB', 'Mamas MA', 'Faiz SA']","['Department of Cardiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Divisions of Critical Care, Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Cardiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Research Group, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. safaiz@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200219,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Disease/epidemiology', 'Dyspnea/epidemiology', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/epidemiology', 'Hypertension/epidemiology', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/blood/diagnostic imaging/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/blood', 'Peptide Fragments/blood', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03962-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03962-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):781-789. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03962-2.

While several musculoskeletal manifestations have been described in ATLL, skeletal muscle involvement is unusual, with only four cases reported in the English-language literature. We present a rare case of ATLL manifesting as an intra-muscular calf mass in a 58-year-old man who immigrated to the USA from West Africa. While skeletal muscle involvement by lymphoma is uncommon, it remains important to consider within the differential diagnosis when there are suggestive imaging findings because it entails important technical biopsy considerations as well as treatment implications. This case report also raises awareness of ATLL presenting outside of typical HTLV-1 endemic areas, related to current population migration patterns. ATLL should therefore be considered in patients with appropriate risk factors.","['Gorelik, Natalia', 'T Hoda, Syed', 'Petchprapa, Catherine', 'Liu, Cynthia', 'Adler, Ronald']","['Gorelik N', 'T Hoda S', 'Petchprapa C', 'Liu C', 'Adler R']","['Department of Radiology, McGill University Health Center, 1001 Decarie Blvd, Montreal, QC, H4A 3J1, Canada. natalia.gorelik@mail.mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Radiology, NYU Langone Medical Center, 333 E 38th St, 6th Floor, New York, NY, 10016, USA. natalia.gorelik@mail.mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU Langone Medical Center, 550 1st Avenue, Suite TH461, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, NYU Langone Medical Center, 333 E 38th St, 6th Floor, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, NYU Langone Medical Center, 550 1st Avenue, Suite TH461, New York, NY, 10016, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, NYU Langone Medical Center, 333 E 38th St, 6th Floor, New York, NY, 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200219,Germany,Skeletal Radiol,Skeletal radiology,7701953,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,"['Biopsy, Large-Core Needle', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', '*Leg', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Radiopharmaceuticals', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00256-020-03392-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00256-020-03392-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Skeletal Radiol. 2020 Jul;49(7):1167-1174. doi: 10.1007/s00256-020-03392-1.

Here, we report cancer outcomes in individuals with germline mutations in telomerase and other telomere-maintenance genes. Among 180 individuals evaluated in a hospital-based setting, 12.8% had cancer. Solid tumors were rare (2.8%); nearly all were young male DKC1 mutation carriers, and they were generally resectable with good short-term outcomes. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was most common, followed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML); they accounted for 75% of cancers. Age over 50 years was the biggest risk factor, and MDS/AML usually manifested with marrow hypoplasia and monosomy 7, but the somatic mutation landscape was indistinct from unselected patients. One- and 2-year survival were 61% and 39%, respectively, and two-thirds of MDS/AML patients died of pulmonary fibrosis and/or hepatopulmonary syndrome. In one-half of the cases, MDS/AML patients showed a recurrent peripheral blood pattern of acquired, granulocyte-specific telomere shortening. This attrition was absent in age-matched mutation carriers who did not have MDS/AML. We tested whether adult short telomere patients without MDS/AML also had evidence of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential-related mutations and found that 30% were affected. These patients also primarily suffered morbidity from pulmonary fibrosis during follow-up. Our data show that the Mendelian short telomere syndromes are associated with a relatively narrow cancer spectrum, primarily MDS and AML. They suggest that short telomere length is sufficient to drive premature age-related clonal hematopoiesis in these inherited disorders.","['Schratz, Kristen E', 'Haley, Lisa', 'Danoff, Sonye K', 'Blackford, Amanda L', 'DeZern, Amy E', 'Gocke, Christopher D', 'Duffield, Amy S', 'Armanios, Mary']","['Schratz KE', 'Haley L', 'Danoff SK', 'Blackford AL', 'DeZern AE', 'Gocke CD', 'Duffield AS', 'Armanios M']","['Department of Oncology.', 'Telomere Center at Johns Hopkins.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Johns Hopkins Genomics.', 'Department of Medicine.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Medicine.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Johns Hopkins Genomics.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Telomere Center at Johns Hopkins.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DKC1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Female', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Syndrome', 'Telomere/*genetics', 'Telomere Shortening/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)61993-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003264 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 May 28;135(22):1946-1956. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003264.,,"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA225027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL119476/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007525/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7256360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Randomized clinical trials clearly demonstrated improved progression-free survival with targeted therapy over chemoimmunotherapy in first-line and treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL. Comparative trials of venetoclax-based vs other targeted therapies have not been conducted. Differentiating features and considerations with targeted therapies include goals of treatment and therapeutic approach as well as side effect and toxicity profiles. With targeted therapy options for first-line and relapsed CLL, it is ever more important to develop sound rationale and strategy for selecting first-line and treatment of relapsed disease and for long-term management of the disease, including therapeutic sequencing. Fixed-duration therapy with a treatment-free remission is a particularly appealing prospect, since it avoids continuous exposure to treatment and potential for toxicity. We discuss rationale and practical application of venetoclax in first-line and treatment of relapsed and refractory CLL. Venetoclax is highly active at achieving deep remission for most treated patients with CLL, including those with high-risk disease such as del(17p) CLL.","['Wierda, William G', 'Tambaro, Francesco Paolo']","['Wierda WG', 'Tambaro FP']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Unita Operativa di Trapianto di Midollo Osseo e Servizio Trasfusionale, Azienda Ospedaliera di Rilievo Nazionale Santobono-Pausilipon, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62075-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002841 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Apr 23;135(17):1421-1427. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002841.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because preclinical studies showed that ibrutinib could improve CAR T cell-antitumor efficacy and reduce cytokine release syndrome (CRS), we conducted a pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering ibrutinib concurrently with CD19 CAR T-cell immunotherapy. Nineteen CLL patients were included. The median number of prior therapies was 5, and 17 patients (89%) had high-risk cytogenetics (17p deletion and/or complex karyotype). Ibrutinib was scheduled to begin >/=2 weeks before leukapheresis and continue for >/=3 months after CAR T-cell infusion. CD19 CAR T-cell therapy with concurrent ibrutinib was well tolerated; 13 patients (68%) received ibrutinib as planned without dose reduction. The 4-week overall response rate using 2018 International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) criteria was 83%, and 61% achieved a minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative marrow response by IGH sequencing. In this subset, the 1-year overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) probabilities were 86% and 59%, respectively. Compared with CLL patients treated with CAR T cells without ibrutinib, CAR T cells with concurrent ibrutinib were associated with lower CRS severity and lower serum concentrations of CRS-associated cytokines, despite equivalent in vivo CAR T-cell expansion. The 1-year PFS probabilities in all evaluable patients were 38% and 50% after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, with and without concurrent ibrutinib, respectively (P = .91). CD19 CAR T cells with concurrent ibrutinib for R/R CLL were well tolerated, with low CRS severity, and led to high rates of MRD-negative response by IGH sequencing.","['Gauthier, Jordan', 'Hirayama, Alexandre V', 'Purushe, Janaki', 'Hay, Kevin A', 'Lymp, James', 'Li, Daniel H', 'Yeung, Cecilia C S', 'Sheih, Alyssa', 'Pender, Barbara S', 'Hawkins, Reed M', 'Vakil, Aesha', 'Phi, Tinh-Doan', 'Steinmetz, Rachel N', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Riddell, Stanley R', 'Maloney, David G', 'Turtle, Cameron J']","['Gauthier J', 'Hirayama AV', 'Purushe J', 'Hay KA', 'Lymp J', 'Li DH', 'Yeung CCS', 'Sheih A', 'Pender BS', 'Hawkins RM', 'Vakil A', 'Phi TD', 'Steinmetz RN', 'Shadman M', 'Riddell SR', 'Maloney DG', 'Turtle CJ']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Integrated Immunotherapy Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Integrated Immunotherapy Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Juno Therapeutics, a Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Integrated Immunotherapy Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Integrated Immunotherapy Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Integrated Immunotherapy Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Salvage Therapy']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62046-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002936 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 May 7;135(19):1650-1660. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002936.,,"['P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '75N92019D00018/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK056465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7205814,,,,['Blood. 2020 May 7;135(19):1611-1612.

Median follow-up for overall survival (OS) was 4.8 years. Complete remissions (CR) were achieved in 92% with ATO/ATRA and 82% with CTX/ATRA; induction death rates were 8% and 18%, respectively. For analysis of postremission outcomes we combined the ATO/ATRA and CTX/ATRA/ATO groups (ATO/ATRA +/- CTX). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was significantly lower after ATO/ATRA +/- CTX compared with CTX/ATRA (P < 0.001). The same held true when restricting the analysis according to the treatment period after the year 2000.

Using whole-exome and/or RNA sequencing of patients at chronic phase (CP, n = 49), myeloid blast crisis (MBC, n = 19), and lymphoid blast crisis (LBC, n = 20), we found 25 focal gene deletions and 14 fusions in 24 patients in BC. Deletions predominated in LBC (83% of structural variants). Transcriptional analysis identified the upregulation of genes involved in V(D)J recombination, including RAG1/2 and DNTT in LBC. RAG recombination is a reported mediator of IKZF1 deletion. We investigated the extent of RAG-mediated genomic lesions in BC. Molecular hallmarks of RAG activity; DNTT-mediated nucleotide insertions and a RAG-binding motif at structural variants were exclusively found in patients with high RAG expression. Structural variants in 65% of patients in LBC displayed these hallmarks compared with only 5% in MBC. RAG-mediated events included focal deletion and novel fusion of genes associated with hematologic cancer: IKZF1, RUNX1, CDKN2A/B, and RB1. Importantly, 8/8 patients with elevated DNTT at CP diagnosis progressed to LBC by 12 months, potentially enabling early prediction of LBC. This work confirms the central mutagenic role of RAG in LBC and describes potential clinical utility in CML management.","['Thomson, Daniel W', 'Shahrin, Nur Hezrin', 'Wang, Paul P S', 'Wadham, Carol', 'Shanmuganathan, Naranie', 'Scott, Hamish S', 'Dinger, Marcel E', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Schreiber, Andreas W', 'Branford, Susan']","['Thomson DW', 'Shahrin NH', 'Wang PPS', 'Wadham C', 'Shanmuganathan N', 'Scott HS', 'Dinger ME', 'Hughes TP', 'Schreiber AW', 'Branford S']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales, Kensington Campus, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Genomics Facility, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Adelaide, SA, Australia. susan.branford@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Pharmacy and Medical Science, Division of Health Sciences, University of South Australia, Adelaide, SA, Australia. susan.branford@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia. susan.branford@sa.gov.au.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia. susan.branford@sa.gov.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200219,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Recombination, Genetic']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/11/04 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0751-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0751-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Aug;34(8):2051-2063. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0751-y.

Here, we demonstrated that pulmonary ILC3s descended from ILC precursors that populated a niche defined by fibroblasts in the developing lung. Alveolar fibroblasts produced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), which instructed expansion and maturation of pulmonary ILC precursors. Conditional ablation of IGF1 in alveolar fibroblasts or deletion of the IGF-1 receptor from ILC precursors interrupted ILC3 biogenesis and rendered newborn mice susceptible to pneumonia. Premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, characterized by interrupted postnatal alveolar development and increased morbidity to respiratory infections, had reduced IGF1 concentrations and pulmonary ILC3 numbers. These findings indicate that the newborn period is a critical window in pulmonary immunity development, and disrupted lung development in prematurely born infants may have enduring effects on host resistance to respiratory infections.","['Oherle, Katherine', 'Acker, Elizabeth', 'Bonfield, Madeline', 'Wang, Timothy', 'Gray, Jerilyn', 'Lang, Ian', 'Bridges, James', 'Lewkowich, Ian', 'Xu, Yan', 'Ahlfeld, Shawn', 'Zacharias, William', 'Alenghat, Theresa', 'Deshmukh, Hitesh']","['Oherle K', 'Acker E', 'Bonfield M', 'Wang T', 'Gray J', 'Lang I', 'Bridges J', 'Lewkowich I', 'Xu Y', 'Ahlfeld S', 'Zacharias W', 'Alenghat T', 'Deshmukh H']","[""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Immunology Graduate Program, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Division of Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Division of Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Center for Inflammation and Tolerance, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA."", ""Division of Neonatology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Division of Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Center for Inflammation and Tolerance, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45219, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH 45267, USA.

STAT proteins control fundamental cellular processes including survival, proliferation and differentiation. Inappropriate activation of STATs might contribute to cellular transformation and leukaemogenesis. About 70% of all solid and haematological tumours exhibit aberrant STAT3 expression and/or activation, highlighting its essential role in tumourigenesis. Aberrant STAT3 activation has been found in several solid tumours and haematologic malignancies. Importantly, constitutive activation of STAT proteins has been found in several leukaemias including acute myeloid leukaemia, acute promyelocytic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Constitutively activated STAT3 plays an important role in CLL biology. CLL cells harbour constitutive phosphorylation on S727 and acetylation on K685 and transient phosphorylation on Y705 residues. Moreover, STAT3 messenger RNA expression is significantly higher in CLL cells compared to healthy B-lymphocytes. Interestingly, STAT3 inhibition was disclosed as an important by-product of ibrutinib treatment in CLL patients. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is to describe the consequences of STAT3 dysregulation in CLL cells. Here, we discuss aberrantly modified processes by STAT3 activation in CLL cells such as proliferation, apoptosis, B cell receptor signalling, cytokine secretion, immune checkpoint regulation, microRNA regulation, free fatty acid metabolism and electron transport chain in the mitochondria.","['Boudny, M', 'Trbusek, M']","['Boudny M', 'Trbusek M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['121259 [pii]', '10.14735/amko202032 [doi]']",ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2020 Winter;33(1):32-38. doi: 10.14735/amko202032.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['STAT', 'STAT3', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'constitutive activation', 'ibrutinib', 'leukaemia', 'microenvironment', 'therapy']",,,,,,,,,D&#367;le&#382;ita role STAT3 v biologii chronicke lymfocytarni leukemie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mdm2 and MdmX are homologous proteins from the Mdm (Murine Double Minute) protein family, which play a critical role in p53 inactivation and degradation. The two proteins interact with one another via the intrinsic RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domains to achieve the negative regulation of p53. The downregulation of p53 is accomplished by Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation through the ubiquitin proteolytic system and by Mdm2 and MdmX mediated inhibition of p53 transactivation. To investigate the role of the RING domain of Mdm2 and MdmX, an analysis of the distinct functionalities of individual RING domains of the Mdm proteins on p53 regulation was conducted in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cell line. Mdm2 RING domain was observed mainly localized in the cell nucleus, contrasting the localization of MdmX RING domain in the cytoplasm. Mdm2 RING was found to possess an endogenous E3 ligase activity, whereas MdmX RING did not. Both Mdm2 and MdmX RING domains were able to dimerize with endogenous full-length Mdm2 and MdmX protein and affect their cellular function. The results showed that overexpression of the Mdm2 or MdmX RING domains interfered with the endogenous full-length Mdm2 and MdmX activity and resulted in p53 stabilization and p53 target gene activation. However, both Mdm RING domains showed oncogenic activity in a colony formation assay, suggesting that the Mdm RING domains possess p53-independent oncogenic properties. This study highlights the distinct structural and functional traits of the RING domain of Mdm2 and MdmX and characterized their role in cellular responses through interfering with p53 dependent signaling pathway.","['Egorova, Olga', 'Lau, Heather Hc', 'McGraphery, Kate', 'Sheng, Yi']","['Egorova O', 'Lau HH', 'McGraphery K', 'Sheng Y']","['Department of Biology, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, York University, 4700 Keele Street, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200215,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'Proteolysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics', 'Ubiquitin/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics', 'Ubiquitination/genetics']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21041309 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21041309 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Feb 15;21(4). pii: ijms21041309. doi: 10.3390/ijms21041309.,,"['1199807/Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada', 'LLSC2012_YiSHENG/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada']",,PMC7072982,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mdm2', 'MdmX', 'RING domain', 'the ubiquitin proteolytic system']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTC is the most common type of differentiated thyroid cancer and usually shows good prognosis. However, some PTC is driven to advanced stage by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-mediated drug resistance, which is particularly noticeable in pediatric patients. There are limited options for systemic treatment, necessitating development of new clinical approaches. Here, we aimed to clarify genetic differences due to age of patients with PTC, and thereby aid in developing novel therapeutics. Patients with biochemically and histologically confirmed PTC were included in this study. PTC cells were acquired from young and older patients showing drug resistance, and were compared via microarray analysis. Cellular proliferation and other properties were determined after treatments with lenvatinib and sorafenib. In vivo, tumor volume and other properties were examined using a mouse xenograft model. Lenvatinib-treated group showed obvious suppression of markers of anti-apoptosis, EMT, and the FGFR signaling pathway, compared with control and Sorafenib-treated group. In the xenograft models, lenvatinib treatment induced significant tumor shrinkage and blocked the proto-oncogene Bcl-2 (B cell lymphoma/leukemia gene-2) and FGFR signaling pathway, along with reduced levels of EMT markers, compared with control and Sorafenib-treated group. Our findings clarify the age-dependent characteristics of pediatric PTC, giving insights into the relationship between young age and poor prognosis. Furthermore, it provides a basis for developing novel therapeutics tailored to the age at diagnosis.","['Kim, Seok-Mo', 'Kim, Soo Young', 'Park, Cheong Soo', 'Chang, Hang-Seok', 'Park, Ki Cheong']","['Kim SM', 'Kim SY', 'Park CS', 'Chang HS', 'Park KC']","['Thyroid Cancer Center, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 120-752, Korea.', 'Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 211, Eonjuro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 135-720, Korea.', 'Thyroid Cancer Center, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 120-752, Korea.', 'Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 211, Eonjuro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 135-720, Korea.', 'Thyroid Cancer Center, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 120-752, Korea.', 'Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 211, Eonjuro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 135-720, Korea.', 'Thyroid Cancer Center, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul 120-752, Korea.', 'Gangnam Severance Hospital, Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 211, Eonjuro, Gangnam-gu, Seoul 135-720, Korea.', 'Department of Surgery, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 50-1, Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 120-752, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200214,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/23 06:01,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2020/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020448 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020448 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Feb 14;12(2). pii: cancers12020448. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020448.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8070-0573', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3435-3985']","['HI18C1188/a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea', 'Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health &', 'Welfare, Republic of Korea', 'NRF-2017R1D1A1B03029716/the Basic Science Research Program through the National', 'Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education']",,PMC7072359,,['NOTNLM'],"['EMT', 'FGFR', 'Lenvatinib', 'Sorafenib', 'papillary thyroid carcinoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) the CXCR4 is downregulated, thereby promoting the mobilization of progenitor cells into blood, the receptor is highly expressed in breast cancer cells, favoring the migratory capacity of these cells. Recently, the LIM and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) has been described as a novel CXCR4 binding partner and as a promoter of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In this study, we uncovered a direct binding of LASP1, phosphorylated at S146, to both CXCR4 and AKT1, as shown by immunoprecipitation assays, pull-down experiments, and immunohistochemistry data. In contrast, phosphorylation of LASP1 at Y171 abrogated these interactions, suggesting that both LASP1 phospho-forms interact. Finally, findings demonstrating different phosphorylation patterns of LASP1 in breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia may have implications for CXCR4 function and tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.","['Butt, Elke', 'Stempfle, Katrin', 'Lister, Lorenz', 'Wolf, Felix', 'Kraft, Marcella', 'Herrmann, Andreas B', 'Viciano, Cristina Perpina', 'Weber, Christian', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Ernst, Thomas', 'Hoffmann, Carsten', 'Zernecke, Alma', 'Frietsch, Jochen J']","['Butt E', 'Stempfle K', 'Lister L', 'Wolf F', 'Kraft M', 'Herrmann AB', 'Viciano CP', 'Weber C', 'Hochhaus A', 'Ernst T', 'Hoffmann C', 'Zernecke A', 'Frietsch JJ']","['Institute of Experimental Biomedicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Biomedicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Biomedicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Biomedicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB-Center for Molecular Biomedicine, University Hospital Jena, Hans-Knoll-Strasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Biomedicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Biomedicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB-Center for Molecular Biomedicine, University Hospital Jena, Hans-Knoll-Strasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Rudolf Virchow Center for Experimental Biomedicine, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 5, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, LMU Munich, 80336 Munich, Germany.', 'Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht, Department of Biochemistry, Maastricht University, 6229 ER Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'DZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), partner site Munich Heart Alliance, 80802 Munich, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Cell Biology, CMB-Center for Molecular Biomedicine, University Hospital Jena, Hans-Knoll-Strasse 2, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Rudolf Virchow Center for Experimental Biomedicine, University of Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Str. 5, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Biomedicine, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Josef-Schneider-Strasse 2, 97080 Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und internistische Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Am Klinikum 1, 07747 Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200214,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (LASP1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",2020/02/23 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9020444 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9020444 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Feb 14;9(2). pii: cells9020444. doi: 10.3390/cells9020444.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3633-9535', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4610-8714', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1476-8059']",,,PMC7072741,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AKT1', '*CML', '*CXCR4', '*LASP1', '*breast cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Clinical and pathological data of the 6 patients with coexistence of T-LBL/MS and LCH were analyzed, who were diagnosed at the Foshan Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the Friendship Hospital of Capital Medical University, from December 2013 to April 2019. The hematoxylin and eosin stain, immunohitochemistry (EnVision) and in situ hybridization were used. Related literatures were reviewed. Results: Four patients were T-LBL combined with LCH, 1 was T-LBL/MS combined with LCH, and 1 was MS combined with LCH. There were 2 male and 4 female patients, with age ranged from 5 to 77 years old (median, 59 years old). Three patients represented with only multiple lymph node swelling. The other 3 displayed both multiple lymph node swelling, and skin/liver or spleen lesions. Lymph node structure was destroyed in 5 cases, while 3 cases had several residual atrophic follicles. Histologically, there were two types of tumor cells: one type of the abnormal lymphoid-cells exhibited small to medium-sized blast cells, typically showing a nested distribution, and these cells were mainly identified in residual follicles and paracortical areas; the other type of histiocytoid cells had a large cell size and abundant pale or dichromatic cytoplasm. Their nuclei were irregularly shaped, showing folded appearance and nuclear grooves. These cells were mainly present in marginal sinus, medullary sinus and interstitial area between follicles. Eosinophil infiltration in the background was not evident in any of the cases. The lymphoid-cells of medium size showed TdT+/CD99+/CD7+, with variable expression of CD34/MPO/CD2/CD3. Ki-67 index was mostly 30%-50%. However, the histiocytoid cells showed phenotype of CD1a+/S-100+/Langerin+/-, while CD163/CD68 were positive in some degree. These cells did not express any T or B cell markers. The Ki-67 index mostly ranged between 10%-20%. None of the cases had Epstin-Barr viral infection. Among the 6 patients, 4 patients were followed up (6-63 months, median time, 18.5 months), of whom 1 patient died of the disease and 3 patients were alive at the end of follow-up. Conclusions: T-LBL/MS combined with LCH is a rare mixed type of immature hematopoietic disease, and mainly occurs in lymph node and skin. The clinical course is overall aggressive. Therefore, it is helpful to recognize and identify the two pathologic components in the same tissue for accurate diagnosis and proper treatment.","['Liu, F', 'Rao, H L', 'Guo, N', 'Guo, L', 'Lyu, J', 'Hu, W W', 'Zhou, X G']","['Liu F', 'Rao HL', 'Guo N', 'Guo L', 'Lyu J', 'Hu WW', 'Zhou XG']","['Department of Pathology, Foshan Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Foshan 528000, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Foshan Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Foshan 528000, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Foshan Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Foshan 528000, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Foshan Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Foshan 528000, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100050, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/23 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2020.02.009 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 8;49(2):149-155. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0529-5807.2020.02.009.,,"['2016AB001661/Medical Science and Technology Project of Foshan', 'SINF,02210501/Sister Institution Network Fund of the University of Texas MD', 'Anderson Cancer Center']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Histiocytosis, Langerhans-cell', 'Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia-lymphoma', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outpatient induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) may confer similar benefits. This possibility prompted a pilot study to explore the safety and feasibility of intensive outpatient initial or salvage induction chemotherapy administration for adults with AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients with no significant organ dysfunction and a treatment-related mortality (TRM) score corresponding to a day 28 mortality rate of <5% to 10% were eligible for study. Patients were treated as outpatients with daily evaluation by providers and only admitted to the hospital if mandated by complications. Twenty patients were consented, and 17 were treated. Eight patients received initial induction chemotherapy and 9 received salvage induction chemotherapy. Fourteen patients completed induction chemotherapy administration in the outpatient setting (82.4%; exact 95% confidence interval [CI], 55.8-95.3). Three patients were admitted during the course of chemotherapy administration, 2 for neutropenic fever and 1 for grade 3 mucositis.

The primary objective was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of AZA given before standard HiDAC/mito. In a dose escalation scheme, 46 patients (median age, 66 years) received AZA at 37.5, 50, or 75 mg/m2 subcutaneously or IV once daily on days 1 to 5 followed by HiDAC (3000 mg/m2) and mitoxantrone (30 mg/m2) once each on days 6 and 10 (the HiDAC/mito dose was reduced 33% in elderly subjects). Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred (both in the same patient): acute liver failure and kidney injury at the 50 mg/m2 dose. The 30-day induction death rate was 2.2% (1 of 46). The overall response rate, including complete remission and complete remission with incomplete count recovery, was 61% (28 of 46). Previously untreated patients aged >/=60 years with therapy-related AML and de novo AML were more likely to respond than untreated patients with AML progressing from an antecedent hematologic disorder (myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia). Patients with favorable European Leukemia Network risk (P = .008), NPM1 mutations (P = .007), or IDH2 mutations (P = .03) were more likely to respond, and those with TP53 mutations (P = .03) were less likely to respond. The recommended phase 2 dose of AZA is 75 mg/m2 per day on days 1 to 5 followed by HiDAC (3000 mg/m2) and mitoxantrone (30 mg/m2) once each on days 6 and 10.

METHODS: The methodology followed that of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Medline, LILACS (the Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), and Embase were searched in April 2019, and data extraction and rating of methodologic study quality (according to the National Institutes of Health quality score assessment) were performed independently by reviewers. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting on 3,509 patients from 1994 to 2018. Most of the studies (74%) were of poor quality in methodology and reporting. Different cancer diagnoses were included in 52% of studies, whereas acute leukemia was the exclusive focus in 41%. The majority of the articles (70%) were from institutions in the Southeast Region of Brazil, mainly the state of Sao Paulo (74%); no publications were from the North Region of the country. Twelve studies addressed nutritional status and body composition, reporting an abundance of malnourished patients in the Brazilian population of children and adolescents with cancer. Six studies on micronutrients pointed to possible deficiencies in this population, with a yet unclear but promising role for supplementation during treatment. CONCLUSION: Evidence indicates that there is great interest in the impact of nutrition on childhood cancer treatment and clinical outcomes in Brazil. However, there is a need to focus on high-quality research, particularly with multicentric/national studies. This will help establish research priorities and better planned clinical interventions, adapted to each region of the country.","['Viani, Karina', 'Albuquerque, Luiza', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Ladas, Elena J']","['Viani K', 'Albuquerque L', 'Barr RD', 'Ladas EJ']","['Instituto de Tratamento do Cancer Infantil, Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Instituto de Tratamento do Cancer Infantil, Instituto da Crianca, Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplantation, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,JCO Glob Oncol,JCO global oncology,101760170,['0 (Micronutrients)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Caribbean Region', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Micronutrients', '*Nutritional Status', 'United States']",2020/02/20 06:00,2021/07/29 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JGO.19.00285 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Glob Oncol. 2020 Feb;6:242-259. doi: 10.1200/JGO.19.00285.,,,,PMC7051796,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is believed that in the general population, this risk can be predicted with carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess CIMT and to investigate the effects of blood pressure (BP) and lipid profile values on CIMT in childhood ALL survivors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised 81 childhood ALL survivors aged 5-25 years. The control group consisted of 52 ageand sex-comparable healthy children. Carotid intima-media thickness measurement, 24-hour BP monitoring and lipid profiles were evaluated in patients and controls. RESULTS: Despite significantly higher proportion of subjects with arterial hypertension (AH) (30/81 vs 10/52; p = 0.0315), the mean values of CIMT were not statistically different in childhood ALL survivors as compared to controls (0.4303 +/-0.03 vs 0.4291 +/-0.03; p = 0.81 and 1.096 +/-0.74 vs 1.027 +/-0.55; p = 0.56, respectively). Carotid intima-media thickness values were not statistically higher in ALL survivors with AH as compared to ALL survivors with normal BP (0.433 +/-0.03 vs 0.428 +/-0.03; p = 0.82). A significant positive correlation between 24-hour systolic BP standard deviation score (SDS) and CIMT-SDS in childhood ALL survivors was found (r = 0.29, p = 0.009), whereas such correlation was not observed in healthy controls (r = 0.12, p = 0.39). A significant correlation between z-score body mass index (BMI) and CIMT was found in controls (r = 0.29, p = 0.031) but not in childhood ALL survivors (r = -0.05, p = 0.64). No significant correlations between CIMT and other measured variables were found. Carotid intima-media thickness did not significantly correlate with time since ALL diagnosis (r = 0.09, p = 0.39). CONCLUSIONS: Carotid intima-media thickness measurement shows limited feasibility and diagnostic accuracy for early assessment of vascular alteration in childhood ALL survivors. Other tests are needed to predict cardiovascular risk in childhood ALL survivors at the early stage of the follow-up.","['Ociepa, Tomasz', 'Posio, Wioletta', 'Sawicki, Marcin', 'Urasinski, Tomasz']","['Ociepa T', 'Posio W', 'Sawicki M', 'Urasinski T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hemato-Oncology and Gastroenterology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hemato-Oncology and Gastroenterology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/complications', '*Carotid Intima-Media Thickness', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/20 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/115082 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2020 Feb;29(2):243-249. doi: 10.17219/acem/115082.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'arterial hypertension', 'cardiovascular risk', 'carotid intima-media thickness', 'children']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study using the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database. METHODS: Information for the diagnostic codes HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) was retrieved from the national public registry since 1997--2015. RESULTS: From a total of 66 462 136 nationwide hospital admissions recorded during the study period, 135 included HTLV diagnosis, being HTLV-1 in 115 (85.2%) and HTLV-2 in 20 (14.8%). The overall hospital admission rate because of HTLV was 2.03 per million, without significant yearly changes. First admissions represented 104 (77%) whereas 31 (23%) were re-admissions. The median in-hospital stay for HTLV patients was 9 days. In-hospital death occurred in 11 (8.1%). The median age of individuals with HTLV admission was 48 years and 60 (44.4%) were women. HTLV was recorded as the main diagnosis in 20%. The most frequent clinical conditions recorded alongside HTLV diagnosis were myelopathy (61; 45.2%), leukemia/lymphoma (30; 22.2%), solid organ transplantation (14; 10.4%) and child delivery (7; 5.2%). CONCLUSION: The rate of HTLV diagnosis in hospitalized patients in Spain is low, roughly of two per million admissions. Despite continuous large immigrant flows from HTLV-1 endemic areas, no significant rising in hospitalizations because of HTLV-1 associated illnesses were noticed during the last two decades. Classical clinical complications of HTLV-1 infection, such as myelopathy and lymphoma account for more than two-thirds of cases.","['Ramos, Jose-Manuel', 'de Mendoza, Carmen', 'Aguilera, Antonio', 'Barreiro, Pablo', 'Benito, Rafael', 'Eiros, Jose M', 'Soriano, Vicente']","['Ramos JM', 'de Mendoza C', 'Aguilera A', 'Barreiro P', 'Benito R', 'Eiros JM', 'Soriano V']","['Internal Medicine Department, General University Hospital of Alicante & Miguel Hernandez University of Elche, Alicante.', 'Laboratory of Internal Medicine, Puerta de Hierro Research Institute & University Hospital.', 'Pharmaceutical & Health Science Department.

It is clear that risk is increased for patients treated with radiation and chemotherapy at younger ages. Radiation is associated with modest risk, whereas chemotherapy, particularly the combination of an alkylating agent and an anthracycline, carries higher risk and radiation and chemotherapy combined increase the risk markedly. Recently, treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but not pegylated G-CSF, has been identified as a factor associated with increased t-MDS/AML risk. Two newly identified associations may link homologous DNA repair gene deficiency and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor treatment to increased t-MDS/AML risk. When predisposing factors, such as young age, are combined with an increasing number of potentially leukemogenic treatments that may not confer large risk singly, the risk of t-MDS/AML appears to increase. Patient and treatment factors combine to form a biological cascade that can trigger a myelodysplastic event. Patients with breast cancer are often exposed to many of these risk factors in the course of their treatment, and triple-negative patients, who are often younger and/or BRCA positive, are often exposed to all of them. It is important going forward to identify effective therapies without these adverse associated effects and choose existing therapies that minimize the risk of t-MDS/AML without sacrificing therapeutic gain. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Breast cancer is far more curable than in the past but requires multimodality treatment. Great care must be taken to use the least leukemogenic treatment programs that do not sacrifice efficacy. Elimination of radiation and anthracycline/alkylating agent regimens will be helpful where possible, particularly in younger patients and possibly those with homologous repair deficiency (HRD). Use of colony-stimulating factors should be limited to those who truly require them for safe chemotherapy administration. Further study of a possible leukemogenic association with HRD and the various forms of colony-stimulating factors is badly needed.","['Kaplan, Henry G', 'Calip, Gregory S', 'Malmgren, Judith A']","['Kaplan HG', 'Calip GS', 'Malmgren JA']","['Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Center for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomic Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Healthstat Consulting Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200219,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Anthracyclines/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', '*Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/epidemiology', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/genetics']",2020/02/20 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0099 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2020 May;25(5):391-397. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0099.

Calotropis gigantea is a medicinal plant belonging to the family of Apocynaceae in the plant kingdom and subfamily Asclepiadaceae usually bearing multiple medicinal properties to cure a variety of diseases. BACKGROUND: The Peptide Mass Fingerprinting (PMF) identifies the proteins from a reference protein database by comparing the amino acid sequence that is previously stored in the database and identified. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study is to identify the peptides having anti-cancerous properties by in silico peptide mass fingerprinting. METHODS: The calculation of in silico peptide masses is done through the ExPASy PeptideMass and these masses are used to identify the peptides from the MASCOT online server. Anticancer probability is calculated by iACP server, docking of active peptides is done by CABS-dock the server. RESULTS: The anti-cancer peptides are identified with the MASCOT peptide mass fingerprinting server, the identified peptides are screened and only the anti-cancer are selected. De-novo peptide structure prediction is used for 3D structure prediction by PEP-FOLD 3 server. The docking results confirm strong bonding with the interacting amino acids of the receptor protein of breast cancer BRCA1 which shows the best peptide binding to the active chain, the human leukemia protein docking with peptides shows the accurate binding. CONCLUSION: These peptides are stable and functional and are the best way for the treatment of cancer and many other deadly diseases.","['Rehman, Saad Ur', 'Rizwan, Muhammad', 'Khan, Sajid', 'Mehmood, Azhar', 'Munir, Anum']","['Rehman SU', 'Rizwan M', 'Khan S', 'Mehmood A', 'Munir A']","['Department of Bioinformatics, Govt.

Several studies have been published since then, in patients treated with frontline imatinib, or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in first or second line but also on second attempt of TKI discontinuation. Our objective was to estimate, through meta-analyses of the literature data, the probability of molecular recurrence (MolRec) in the time periods of 0-6, 6-12, 12-18 and 18-24 months after a first and second TKI discontinuation and the probability of re-acquisition of DMR after MolRec. The Medline and Scopus databases were searched up to April 2019. The studies were selected by three independent reviewers. Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted using the MetaXL software. The probability of MolRec in the time periods 0-6, 6-12, 12-18 and 18-24 months after the first attempt was respectively 35%, 8%, 3% and 3%, whereas the probability of MolRec in the time periods 0-6, 6-12 and 12-18 after the second attempt was 48%, 27% and 12% respectively. Re-acquisition of a DMR was observed in 90% of patients. Most of the MolRec occur during the first six months in case of a first attempt, whereas the second MolRec occurs over a larger window of time.","['Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Astrugue, Cyril', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Benard, Antoine']","['Dulucq S', 'Astrugue C', 'Etienne G', 'Mahon FX', 'Benard A']","['Laboratory of Hematology, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM, U1218, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""Pole de sante publique, Unite d'Epidemiologie Clinique (USMR) & CIC-EC 14-01, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", 'ISPED, INSERM, U1219 - Bordeaux Population Health Research Centre, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM, U1218, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'INSERM, U1218, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', ""Pole de sante publique, Unite d'Epidemiologie Clinique (USMR) & CIC-EC 14-01, CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France."", 'ISPED, INSERM, U1219 - Bordeaux Population Health Research Centre, University of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20200219,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/20 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16408 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 May;189(3):452-468. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16408.

It is a recognized model of intercellular communication that plays an essential role in embryonic as well as in adult immune cell development and homeostasis. Four members belong to the family of Notch receptors (Notch1-4), and each of them plays nonredundant functions at several developmental stages. Canonical and noncanonical pathways of Notch signaling are multifaceted drivers of immune cells biology. In fact, increasing evidence highlighted Notch as an important modulator of immune responses, also in cancer microenvironment. In these contexts, multiple transduction signals, including canonical and alternative NF-kappaB pathways, play a relevant role. In this chapter, we will first describe the critical role of Notch and NF-kappaB signals in lymphoid lineages developing in thymus: natural killer T cells, thymocytes, and thymic T regulatory cells. We will address also the role played by ligand expressing cells. Given the importance of Notch/NF-kappaB cross talk, its role in T-cell leukemia development and progression will be discussed.","['Tsaouli, G', 'Barbarulo, A', 'Vacca, A', 'Screpanti, I', 'Felli, M P']","['Tsaouli G', 'Barbarulo A', 'Vacca A', 'Screpanti I', 'Felli MP']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy. isabella.screpanti@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy. mariapia.felli@uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Lineage', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",2020/02/20 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-36422-9_10 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2020;1227:145-164. doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-36422-9_10.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Innate immune cells', 'NF-kappaB', 'Notch', 'T-cell leukemogenesis', 'T-cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed at identifying cellular responses and repair mechanisms for CNDAG prodrugs, 2-amino-9-(2-C-cyano-2-deoxy-1-beta-D-arabino-pentofuranosyl)-6-methoxy purine (6-OMe) and 9-(2-C-cyano-2-deoxy-1-beta-D-arabino-pentofuranosyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (6-NH2). Each compound is a substrate for adenosine deaminase, the action of which generates CNDAG. METHODS: Growth inhibition assay, clonogenic survival assay, immunoblotting, and cytogenetic analyses (chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges) were used to investigate the impact of CNDAG on cell lines. RESULTS: The 6-NH2 derivative was selectively potent in T cell malignant cell lines. Both prodrugs caused increased phosphorylation of ATM and its downstream substrates Chk1, Chk2, SMC1, NBS1, and H2AX, indicating activation of ATM-dependent DNA damage response pathways. In contrast, there was no increase in phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, which participates in repair of double-strand breaks by non-homologous end-joining. Deficiency in ATM, RAD51D, XRCC3, BRCA2, and XPF, but not DNA-PK or p53, conferred significant clonogenic sensitivity to CNDAG or the prodrugs. Moreover, hamster cells lacking XPF acquired remarkably more chromosomal aberrations after incubation for two cell cycle times with CNDAG 6-NH2, compared to the wild type. Furthermore, CNDAG 6-NH2 induced greater levels of sister chromatid exchanges in wild-type cells exposed for two cycles than those for one cycle, consistent with increased double-strand breaks after a second S phase. CONCLUSION: CNDAG-induced double-strand breaks are repaired mainly through homologous recombination.","['Liu, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Yingjun', 'Nowak, Billie', 'Ichikawa, Satoshi', 'Ohtawa, Masaki', 'Matsuda, Akira', 'Plunkett, William']","['Liu X', 'Jiang Y', 'Nowak B', 'Ichikawa S', 'Ohtawa M', 'Matsuda A', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS). The final primary endpoint analysis after 37.1 months median follow up failed to show the non-inferiority of BR as compared with FCR. With extended median follow up of 58.2 months, median PFS was 42.3 months in BR-treated patients versus 57.6 months for FCR-treated patients (Hazard Ratio [HR] 1.593; 95% CI 1.271-1.996; p < 0.0001).

No statistically significant difference was found in the time to secondary malignancy between the 2 groups (at 5 years, 86.6% free from secondary malignancies in the BR group vs 83.8% in the FCR group [HR 0.801; 95% CI 0.507-1.267; p = 0.344]). In patients >65 years secondary neoplasia occurred more frequently after FCR treatment [28 of 86 (32.6%) patients] as compared with BR [18 of 107 (16.8%) patients; p = 0.011]. Health-related quality of life was similar in both treatments. Despite the improved PFS for FCR, OS did not differ. These results also suggest an increase in secondary neoplasia associated with FCR in elderly fit CLL patients.","['Kutsch, Nadine', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Robrecht, Sandra', 'Franklin, Jeremy', 'Zhang,

Along this line, comparisons between the spectrum of alterations in relapses that arise in different upfront treatment protocols may provide valuable information on the association between the tumor genome, protocol components and outcome. Here, we performed a comprehensive characterization of relapsed BCP-ALL cases that developed in the context of 3 completed Dutch upfront studies, ALL8, ALL9, and ALL10. In total, 123 pediatric BCP-ALL relapses and 77 paired samples from primary diagnosis were analyzed for alterations in 22 recurrently affected genes. We found pronounced differences in relapse alterations between the 3 studies. Specifically, CREBBP mutations were observed predominantly in relapses after treatment with ALL8 and ALL10 which, in the latter group, were all detected in medium risk-treated patients. IKZF1 alterations were enriched 2.2-fold (p = 0.01) and 2.9-fold (p < 0.001) in ALL8 and ALL9 relapses compared to diagnosis, respectively, whereas no significant enrichment was found for relapses that were observed after treatment with ALL10. Furthermore, IKZF1 deletions were more frequently preserved from a major clone at diagnosis in relapses after ALL9 compared to relapses after ALL8 and ALL10 (p = 0.03). These data are in line with previous studies showing that the prognostic value of IKZF1 deletions differs between upfront protocols and is particularly strong in the ALL9 regimen. In conclusion, our data reveal a correlation between upfront treatment and the genetic composition of relapsed BCP-ALL.","['Yu, Jiangyan', 'Waanders, Esme', 'van Reijmersdal, Simon V', 'Antic, Zeljko', 'van Bosbeek, Charlotte M', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'de Groot, Hester', 'Fiocco, Marta', 'Geurts van Kessel, Ad', 'van Leeuwen, Frank N', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Hoogerbrugge, Peter M', 'Kuiper, Roland P']","['Yu J', 'Waanders E', 'van Reijmersdal SV', 'Antic Z', 'van Bosbeek CM', 'Sonneveld E', 'de Groot H', 'Fiocco M', 'Geurts van Kessel A', 'van Leeuwen FN', 'Pieters R', 'Hoogerbrugge PM', 'Kuiper RP']","['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Medical Statistics, Department of Biomedical Data Science, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Mathematical Institute, Leiden University, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Radboud university medical center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200122,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,2020/02/20 06:00,2020/02/20 06:01,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000318 [doi]', 'HemaSphere-2019-0152 [pii]']",epublish,Hemasphere. 2020 Jan 22;4(1):e318. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000318. eCollection 2020 Feb.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 the Author(s).

AML summarizes several disease entities with a variety of genetic subtypes. A comprehensive model spanning from signal activation patterns in major genetic subtypes of pediatric AML (pedAML) to outcome prediction and pre-clinical response to signaling inhibitors has not yet been provided. We established a high-throughput flow-cytometry based method to assess activation of hallmark phospho-proteins (phospho-flow) in 166 bone-marrow derived pedAML samples under basal and cytokine stimulated conditions. We correlated levels of activated phospho-proteins at diagnosis with relapse incidence in intermediate (IR) and high risk (HR) subtypes. In parallel, we screened a set of signaling inhibitors for their efficacy against primary AML blasts in a flow-cytometry based ex vivo cytotoxicity assay and validated the results in a murine xenograft model. Certain phospho-signal patterns differ between genetic subtypes of pedAML. Some are consistently seen through all AML subtypes such as pSTAT5. In IR/HR subtypes high levels of GM-CSF stimulated pSTAT5 and low levels of unstimulated pJNK correlated with increased relapse risk overall. Combination of GM-CSF/pSTAT5(high) and basal/pJNK(low) separated three risk groups among IR/HR subtypes. Out of 10 tested signaling inhibitors, midostaurin most effectively affected AML blasts and simultaneously blocked phosphorylation of multiple proteins, including STAT5. In a mouse xenograft model of KMT2A-rearranged pedAML, midostaurin significantly prolonged disease latency. Our study demonstrates the applicability of phospho-flow for relapse-risk assessment in pedAML, whereas functional phenotype-driven ex vivo testing of signaling inhibitors may allow individualized therapy.","['Schumich, Angela', 'Prchal-Murphy, Michaela', 'Maurer-Granofszky, Margarita', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic, Andrea', 'Muhlegger, Nora', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Fajmann, Sabine', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Nebral, Karin', 'von Neuhoff, Nils', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Boztug, Heidrun', 'Rasche, Mareike', 'Dolezal, Marlies', 'Walter, Christiane', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Sexl, Veronika', 'Dworzak, Michael N']","['Schumich A', 'Prchal-Murphy M', 'Maurer-Granofszky M', 'Hoelbl-Kovacic A', 'Muhlegger N', 'Potschger U', 'Fajmann S', 'Haas OA', 'Nebral K', 'von Neuhoff N', 'Zimmermann M', 'Boztug H', 'Rasche M', 'Dolezal M', 'Walter C', 'Reinhardt D', 'Sexl V', 'Dworzak MN']","[""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department for Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department for Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Platform, Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department for Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department for Pediatrics III, University Hospital of Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', ""CCRI, Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191216,United States,Hemasphere,HemaSphere,101740619,,,,2020/02/20 06:00,2020/02/20 06:01,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1097/HS9.0000000000000312 [doi]', 'HemaSphere-2019-0138 [pii]']",epublish,Hemasphere. 2019 Dec 16;4(1):e312. doi: 10.1097/HS9.0000000000000312. eCollection 2020 Feb.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Several comparative and noncomparative trials of this type have been carried out during the last two decades, enrolling thousands of patients. Almost without exception, the new strategy improved patients' outcomes compared with traditional adult treatments in B-lineage and T-lineage Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-negative B-ALL, while the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) led to comparative progress in Ph+ ALL, a former high-risk subset more typically observed in older age groups. At present, highly effective pediatric-based regimens warrant 5-year survival rates of 60-70% in AYA patients. In view of these data, the same approach was progressively extended to older patients, improving the results up to 55 years of age. Issues of treatment compliance and drug-related toxicity have thus far prevented a comparable therapeutic advancement in patients aged >55 years. This critical review updates and summarizes with pertinent examples this global, positive therapeutic change, and examines how to promote further progress with new targeted therapies that include novel immuno-therapeutics and other agents developed against the many molecular dysfunctions detectable in various ALL subsets. Substantial progress is expected to occur soon, bringing AYA survival figures very close to that of children, and also to improve the outcome of ALL at all ages.","['Carobolante, Francesca', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Skert, Cristina', 'Bassan, Renato']","['Carobolante F', 'Chiaretti S', 'Skert C', 'Bassan R']","[""UOC Ematologia, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Venezia, Mestre, Italy."", ""Division of Hematology, 'Sapienza' University, Rome, Italy."", ""UOC Ematologia, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Venezia, Mestre, Italy."", ""UOC Ematologia, Ospedale dell'Angelo, Via Paccagnella 11, Venezia, Mestre, 30174, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200203,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,2020/02/20 06:00,2020/02/20 06:01,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620720903531 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620720903531 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Feb 3;11:2040620720903531. doi: 10.1177/2040620720903531. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8214-2894'],,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']",PMC6997963,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'adolescent and young adults', 'therapy']",,,"['Conflict of interest statement: F.

Nevertheless, NPM1 is overexpressed in various hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. NPM1 overexpression is considered a prognostic marker of recurrence and progression of cancer. Thus, NPM1 abnormalities play a critical role in several types of hematologic malignancies. This has led to intense interest in the development of an NPM1 targeting strategy for cancer therapy. The aim of this review is to summarize present knowledge on NPM1 origin, pathogenesis, and therapeutic interventions in hematologic malignancies.","['Chen, Yingyu', 'Hu, Jianda']","['Chen Y', 'Hu J']","['Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No.29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200203,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,2020/02/20 06:00,2020/02/20 06:01,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719899818 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719899818 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2020 Feb 3;11:2040620719899818. doi: 10.1177/2040620719899818. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1243-3607'],,"['(c) The Author(s), 2020.']",PMC6997955,,['NOTNLM'],"['Nucleophosmin1', 'hematologic malignancy', 'mutation', 'overexpression', 'therapy']",,,"['Conflict of interest statement: The author(s) declare no conflicts of interest in', 'preparing this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chemistry involves transcription of a novel 8.5 kb mRNA with a b3a2 and/ or b2a2 junction. Though there is an improvement in survival using the TKIs, there are causes for the treatment failures. Thus, the study focuses on the causes underlying the failed response. This study comprises BCR-ABL expression in correlation with age, gender and transcript type and disease monitoring in follow-up samples. Eighty-seven chronic phase CML patients were enrolled in the study. Out of these 24 patients were followed further. Quantitative Real time PCR was performed to assess the BCR-ABL expression followed by gel electrophoresis of PCR products. The results were expressed as CN/microg RNA. The results obtained were correlated with SPSS 16.0 software. We found three different types of the expression that includes b2a2, b3a2 and co-expression (b2a2 + b3a2). Higher incidence of b2a2 with a relatively equal incidence of co-expression was observed. The BCR-ABL expression was higher in males, in young patients and in those exhibiting co-expression of the transcripts. Greater relapse was seen in females and in older patients. The patients with co-expression of transcripts exhibited the highest expression; however these patients showed the best treatment response suggest the co-expression is the favourable parameter for CML patients. The transcript type and BCR-ABL expression are well correlated and hence can be considered as a prognostic as well as the predictive indicator considering the BCR-ABL expression for CML patients.","['Upadhyay, Vinal', 'Raval, Apexa', 'Shah, Kanisha', 'Shah, Franky D', 'Rawal, Rakesh']","['Upadhyay V', 'Raval A', 'Shah K', 'Shah FD', 'Rawal R']","['1Stem Cell Biology Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, NCH Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad, Gujarat 380016 India.grid.418345.f0000 0000 9141 8226', '1Stem Cell Biology Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, NCH Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad, Gujarat 380016 India.grid.418345.f0000 0000 9141 8226', '1Stem Cell Biology Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, NCH Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad, Gujarat 380016 India.grid.418345.f0000 0000 9141 8226', '1Stem Cell Biology Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, NCH Campus, Asarwa, Ahmedabad, Gujarat 380016 India.grid.418345.f0000 0000 9141 8226', '2Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacogenomics Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, The Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat India.grid.418345.f0000 0000 9141 8226', '3Gujarat University, Ahmedabad, Gujarat India.grid.411877.c0000 0001 2152 424X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180728,India,Indian J Clin Biochem,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,8708303,,,,2020/02/20 06:00,2020/02/20 06:01,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2018/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12291-018-0779-1 [doi]', '779 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Clin Biochem. 2020 Jan;35(1):88-94. doi: 10.1007/s12291-018-0779-1.

METHODS: Rat dental pulp was stimulated with 10 g/L lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish a model of rat pulpitis at different stages of inflammation. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression changes of EZH2 during the progression of pulp inflammation. Immunofluorescence double staining was used to detect the expression of EZH2, CD68 and their colocalization. To screen the appropriate concentration of EZH2 recombinant protein to stimulate hDPCs and human leukaemia-derived monocytic cell line (THP-1) cells, the effects of different concentrations (1, 10, 20, 40, and 100 mug/L) of EZH2 recombinant protein on proliferation of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) and human monocyte cell line THP-1 were detected by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8). Transwell migration assay was used to detect the effect of supernatants of hDPCs treated with EZH2 recombinant protein on the migration of THP-1 cells. RESULTS: HE staining results showed that in the model of rat pulp inflammation induced by LPS, with the prolongation of LPS stimulation, the inflammation response of pulp gradually increased. Immunohistochemical results showed that EZH2 expression decreased within 8 h of LPS-induced dental pulp inflammation; but after 1, 3, and 7 d of stimulation, EZH2 expression gradually increased with the extension of the stimulation time. As for the normal rat dental pulp tissue, the positive expression of EZH2 was scattered in the odontoblast cell layer and the pulp proper. Compared with the control group, LPS stimulated the expression of EZH2 and CD68 in the infected dental pulp, and the colocalization of EZH2 and CD68 could be detected in macrophages. The results of CCK-8 suggested that the appropriate concentration of EZH2 recombinant protein to stimulate hDPCs and THP-1 cells was 20 mug/L. Transwell cell migration assay confirmed that compared with the supernatant of EZH2 untreated HDPCs group, the supernatant of EZH2double ended arrowtreated hDPCs significantly promoted macrophage chemotaxis. CONCLUSION: EZH2 is involved in the development of pulpitis and promotes the chemotaxis of macrophages, which suggests that EZH2 may play an important regulatory role in the development of pulp inflammation.","['Chen, Y Y', 'Hu, Z Q', 'Hui, T Q', 'Liu, H']","['Chen YY', 'Hu ZQ', 'Hui TQ', 'Liu H']","['Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology & Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology & Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology & Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & National Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology & Beijing Key Laboratory of Digital Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Beijing da xue xue bao.

Eight hundred patients with untreated-stage Binet A disease were enrolled as intent-to-treat population and assessed for four prognostic markers: lymphocyte doubling time <12 months, serum thymidine kinase >10 U/L, unmutated IGHV genes, and unfavorable cytogenetics (del(11q)/del(17p)/trisomy 12). Two hundred and one patients with >/=2 risk features were classified as high-risk CLL and 1:1 randomized to receive either immediate therapy with 6xFCR (Hi-FCR, 100 patients), or to be observed according to standard of care (Hi-W&W, 101 patients). The overall response rate after early FCR was 92.7%. Common adverse events were hematological toxicities and infections (61.0%/41.5% of patients, respectively). After median observation time of 55.6 (0-99.2) months, event-free survival was significantly prolonged in Hi-FCR compared with Hi-W&W patients (median not reached vs. 18.5 months, p < 0.001). There was no significant overall survival benefit for high-risk patients receiving early FCR therapy (5-year OS 82.9% in Hi-FCR vs. 79.9% in Hi-W&W, p = 0.864). In conclusion, although FCR is efficient to induce remissions in the Binet A high-risk CLL, our data do not provide evidence that alters the current standard of care ""watch and wait"" for these

UTX is one of the major components of MLL3- and MLL4-containing (MlLL3/4) complexes and likely has functions within the complexes. Although UTX is frequently mutated in various types of cancer and is thought to play a crucial role as a tumor suppressor, the importance of UTX interaction with MLL3/4 complexes in cancer formation is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the ability of cancer-derived UTX mutant proteins to interact with ASH2L, which is a common core component of all the MLL complexes, and MLL3/4-specific components PTIP and PA1, and found that several single-amino acid substitution mutations in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) affect UTX interaction with these components. Interaction-compromised mutants G137V and D336G and a TPR-deleted mutant Delta80-397 were preferentially localized to the cytoplasm, suggesting that UTX is retained in the nucleus by MLL3/4 complexes through their interaction with the TPR. Intriguingly, WT UTX suppressed colony formation in soft agar, whereas G137V failed. This suggests that interaction of UTX with MLL3/4 complex plays a crucial role in their tumor suppressor function. Preferential cytoplasmic localization was also observed for endogenous proteins of G137V and another mutant G137VDelta138 in HCT116 created by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. Interestingly, expression levels of these mutants were low and MG312 stabilized both endogenous as well as exogenous G137V proteins. These results reveal a novel mechanism of UTX regulation and reinforce the importance of UTX interaction with MLL3/4 complexes in cancer formation.","['Kato, Hiroyuki', 'Asamitsu, Kaori', 'Sun, Wendi', 'Kitajima, Shojiro', 'Yoshizawa-Sugata, Naoko', 'Okamoto, Takashi', 'Masai, Hisao', 'Poellinger, Lorenz']","['Kato H', 'Asamitsu K', 'Sun W', 'Kitajima S', 'Yoshizawa-Sugata N', 'Okamoto T', 'Masai H', 'Poellinger L']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore. csihkato@gmail.com.', 'Department of Genome Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 2-1-6 Kamikitazawa, Setagaya, Tokyo, 156-8506, Japan. csihkato@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, 467-860, Japan. csihkato@gmail.com.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, 467-860, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore.', 'The Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, Kakuganji 246-2, Mizukami, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, 997-0052, Japan.', 'Department of Genome Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 2-1-6 Kamikitazawa, Setagaya, Tokyo, 156-8506, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, 467-860, Japan.', 'Department of Genome Medicine, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, 2-1-6 Kamikitazawa, Setagaya, Tokyo, 156-8506, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, 14 Medical Drive, Singapore, 117599, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, SE-171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200218,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (ASH2L protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAGR1 protein, human)', '0 (PAXIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6B protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Histone Demethylases/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Tetratricopeptide Repeat/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2020/02/20 06:00,2020/11/28 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-1218-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-1218-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Apr;39(16):3322-3335. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-1218-3.

These SEs have been identified as promising therapeutic targets, and have given rise to a new class of drugs, including BET protein inhibitors, which center on targeting SE activity. NR4A nuclear receptors are tumor suppressors of AML that function in part through transcriptional repression of the MYC-driven oncogenic program via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here we show that NR4A1, and the NR4A inducing drug dihydroergotamine (DHE), regulate overlapping gene expression programs in AML and repress transcription of a subset of SE-associated leukemic oncogenes, including MYC. NR4As interact with an AML-selective SE cluster that governs MYC transcription and decommissions its activation status by dismissing essential SE-bound coactivators including BRD4, Mediator and p300, leading to loss of p300-dependent H3K27 acetylation and Pol 2-dependent eRNA transcription. DHE shows similar efficacy to the BET inhibitor JQ1 at repressing SE-dependent MYC expression and AML growth in mouse xenografts. Thus, DHE induction of NR4As provides an alternative strategy to BET inhibitors to target MYC dependencies via suppression of the AML-selective SE governing MYC expression.","['Call, S Greg', 'Duren, Ryan P', 'Panigrahi, Anil K', 'Nguyen, Loc', 'Freire, Pablo R', 'Grimm, Sandra L', 'Coarfa, Cristian', 'Conneely, Orla M']","['Call SG', 'Duren RP', 'Panigrahi AK', 'Nguyen L', 'Freire PR', 'Grimm SL', 'Coarfa C', 'Conneely OM']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology PhD Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences PhD Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology PhD Program, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Precision Environmental Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Precision Environmental Health, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. orlac@bcm.edu.', 'Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. orlac@bcm.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200218,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '436O5HM03C (Dihydroergotamine)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics', 'Dihydroergotamine/pharmacology', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/agonists/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2020/02/20 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59469-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59469-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 18;10(1):2851. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59469-3.,,"['R01 CA160747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES030285/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7029036,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUNX1 and the AML1-ETO fusion protein are coexpressed in t(8;21) AML cells and antagonize each other's gene-regulatory functions. AML1-ETO represses transcription of RUNX1 target genes by competitively displacing RUNX1 and recruiting corepressors such as histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3). Recent studies have shown that AML1-ETO and RUNX1 co-occupy the binding sites of AML1-ETO-activated genes. How this joined binding allows RUNX1 to antagonize AML1-ETO-mediated transcriptional activation is unclear. Here we show that RUNX1 functions as a bona fide repressor of transcription activated by AML1-ETO. Mechanistically, we show that RUNX1 is a component of the HDAC3 corepressor complex and that HDAC3 preferentially binds to RUNX1 rather than to AML1-ETO in t(8;21) AML cells. Studying the regulation of interleukin-8 (IL8), a newly identified AML1-ETO-activated gene, we demonstrate that RUNX1 and HDAC3 collaboratively repress AML1-ETO-dependent transcription, a finding further supported by results of genome-wide analyses of AML1-ETO-activated genes. These and other results from the genome-wide studies also have important implications for the mechanistic understanding of gene-specific coactivator and corepressor functions across the AML1-ETO/RUNX1 cistrome.","['Guo, Chun', 'Li, Jian', 'Steinauer, Nickolas', 'Wong, Madeline', 'Wu, Brent', 'Dickson, Alexandria', 'Kalkum, Markus', 'Zhang, Jinsong']","['Guo C', 'Li J', 'Steinauer N', 'Wong M', 'Wu B', 'Dickson A', 'Kalkum M', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Therapy, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University, School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104.

The sensitive and accurate detection of cellular TdT activity, particularly at the single-cell level, is highly significant for leukemia-associated biomedical and biological studies. Nevertheless, owing to the limited sensitivity of the existing TdT assays, the quantification of TdT activity at the single-cell level remains a big challenge. Herein, a simple but ultrasensitive method for assaying TdT activity is proposed based on terminal extension actuated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TEA-LAMP). By using the TdT-induced extension product as an actuator, TdT activity is amplified twice by terminal extension and LAMP in an exponential manner and finally converted to a remarkably amplified fluorescent signal. In this study, as low as 2 x 10(-8) U/muL TdT can be clearly detectable with the elegant TEA-LAMP strategy. Such an ultrahigh sensitivity enables the direct determination of TdT activity in individual single cells. In the meantime, by employing TdT as a co-factor, this strategy can also be applied to detecting other enzymes that can catalyze the DNA terminal hydroxylation. This work not only reports the up-to-now most sensitive TdT detection strategy at a single-cell level but also opens the new gate for versatile enzyme activity detection.","['Tian, Weimin', 'Wang, Gaoting', 'Liu, Xiaoling', 'Ren, Wei', 'Liu, Chenghui', 'Li, Zhengping']","['Tian W', 'Wang G', 'Liu X', 'Ren W', 'Liu C', 'Li Z']","[""Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, Shaanxi Province, PR China."", ""Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, Shaanxi Province, PR China."", ""Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, Shaanxi Province, PR China."", ""Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, Shaanxi Province, PR China."", ""Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science of Shaanxi Province, Key Laboratory of Applied Surface and Colloid Chemistry, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, Shaanxi Province, PR China.

NANOG is a transcription factor highly expressed in pig pre-implantation embryos, indicating that it is a conserved pluripotency-associated factor. However, pig NANOG reporter PSCs have yet to be established, and the regulation of pluripotency by NANOG is not fully understood in this animal. METHODS: In this study, pig NANOG tdTomato knock-in reporter positive PC-iPS cells were established using CRISPR/Cas9. The resulting cell line was treated with several cytokines and their corresponding inhibitors to identify pathways that regulate NANOG expression. The pathways examined were LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor)/IL6 (interleukin 6)-STAT3, FGF (fibroblast growth factor)/ERK, IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1)/PIP3 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT, Activin A/SMAD, and BMP4 (bone morphogenetic proteins)/SMAD. RESULTS: Our experiments showed that the Activin A/SMAD pathway is directly associated with activation of NANOG expression in the pig, as is also the case in mice and humans. Activin A directly regulates the expression of pig NANOG via SMAD2/3; inhibition of this pathway by SB431542 resulted in inhibition of NANOG expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Activin A plays an important regulatory role in NANOG-mediated pluripotency in pig iPS cells. Activin A treatment may be therefore an effective method for de novo derivation of authentic embryonic stem cells (ESCs) from pig pre-implantation embryos.","['Xu, Junjun', 'Zheng, Zheng', 'Du, Xuguang', 'Shi, Bingbo', 'Wang, Jichang', 'Gao, Dengfeng', 'Zhu, Qianqian', 'Chen, Xinze', 'Han, Jianyong']","['Xu J', 'Zheng Z', 'Du X', 'Shi B', 'Wang J', 'Gao D', 'Zhu Q', 'Chen X', 'Han J']","['State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'Center for Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering, Key Laboratory for Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering, Ministry of Education, Sun Yat-senUniversity, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510080, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China. hanjy@cau.edu.cn.', 'College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, 100193, China. hanjy@cau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200218,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,"['0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (activin A)', '104625-48-1 (Activins)']",IM,"['Activins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Swine']",2020/02/20 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-020-1588-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-020-1588-z [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2020 Feb 18;11(1):67. doi: 10.1186/s13287-020-1588-z.,,,,PMC7029561,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Activin A', '*CRISPR/Cas9', '*Cytokine screen', '*NANOG reporter', '*Pluripotency']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several case-control studies have investigated this association; however, no conclusions could be drawn. A comprehensive updated meta-analysis is established to explain these contradictions and clarify the overall impact of this variant on the susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Electronic searches were conducted to select published studies prior to June 2018. Pooled odds ratios and stratification analysis were performed under different genetic comparison models, age, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Totally, 66 case-control studies including 9619 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases and 17,396 controls were selected. Our analyses showed that methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism was protective mainly in Asian and European countries, under all genetic models and regardless of age, but leukemogenic in mixed population. CONCLUSION: Thus, C677T polymorphism may be a promising acute lymphoblastic leukemia biomarker, but they should be interpreted with caution considering other factors such as folic acid intake, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.","['Frikha, Rim']",['Frikha R'],"['Faculty of Medicine, University of Sfax, Sfax-Tunisia.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Hedi Chaker University Teaching Hospital, Sfax-Tunisia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20200218,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Adult', 'Asians', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",2020/02/20 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219900914 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Oct;26(7):1598-1610. doi: 10.1177/1078155219900914.

The biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate, and ongoing pregnancy rate in fertile women were 20.12%, 18.34%, and 17.75%, respectively, which were significantly higher compared with unexplained infertile women (7.14%, 5.36%, and 4.17%, respectively). Endometrial thickness (ET), endometrial volume (EV), VI, FI, and VFI measured by ultrasound, and the integrin alphavbeta3, VEGF, TNF-alpha, and LIF levels in uterine fluid were all significantly higher in pregnant women as compared with nonpregnant women.

Integrin alphavbeta3 had the best predictive value for endometrial receptivity among biomarkers in the uterine fluid (AUC = 0.921, sensitivity 96.7%, and specificity 89.5%). Women with unexplained infertility present declined endometrial receptivity.

In this review, we provide an overview of previously U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved non-chemotherapy drugs under investigation for the treatment of AML.","['Wojcicki, Anna V', 'Kadapakkam, Meena', 'Frymoyer, Adam', 'Lacayo, Norman', 'Chae, Hee-Don', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Wojcicki AV', 'Kadapakkam M', 'Frymoyer A', 'Lacayo N', 'Chae HD', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200213,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/02/20 06:00,2020/02/20 06:01,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2020/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020441 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020441 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Feb 13;12(2). pii: cancers12020441. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020441.,,"['6587-20/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society', 'N/A/CURE Childhood Cancer', 'N/A/Stanford SPARK', 'MMSAP/American Society of Hematology']",,PMC7072462,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'mechanism of action', 'targeted therapies']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many plant leaf extracts from the various species of Malva genus have been reported to possess anti-cancer properties, however, studies on M. pseudolavatera Webb & Berthel. leaves have documented anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects with no emphasis on their possible anti-cancer potential. The present study explores the anti-cancer properties of Malva pseudolavatera Webb & Berthel. leaf extract on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines in vitro and deciphers the underlying molecular mechanism. Treatment of AML cell lines with M. pseudolavatera methanolic leaf extract showed a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic hallmarks such as an increase in phosphatidylserine on the outer membrane leaflet and membrane leakage in addition to DNA fragmentation. The pro-apoptotic effect was induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as an upregulation of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, andrelease of cytochrome-c from the mitochondria. Major compounds of the extract included methyl linolenate, phytol, gamma-sitosterol, and stigmasterol as revealed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and amino acids, amino acid derivatives, tiliroside, 13-hydroxyperoxyoctadecadienoic, and quercitrin as detected by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.","['El Khoury, Marianne', 'Haykal, Tony', 'Hodroj, Mohammad H', 'Najem, Sonia Abou', 'Sarkis, Rita', 'Taleb, Robin I', 'Rizk, Sandra']","['El Khoury M', 'Haykal T', 'Hodroj MH', 'Najem SA', 'Sarkis R', 'Taleb RI', 'Rizk S']","['Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos 1401, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos 1401, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos 1401, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos 1401, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory of Regenerative Hematopoiesis, Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research (ISREC) & Institute of Bioengineering (IBI), School of Life Sciences, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos 1401, Lebanon.', 'Department of Natural Sciences, Lebanese American University, Byblos 1401, Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200213,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/02/20 06:00,2020/02/20 06:01,['2020/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020435 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020435 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Feb 13;12(2). pii: cancers12020435. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020435.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-4261-3828', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4405-5703']",['SRDC/LEBANESE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY'],,PMC7072199,,['NOTNLM'],"['Berthel.', 'Malva pseudolavatera Webb &amp', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'reactive oxygen species']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PBX3 has frequently been reported as having a role in the development and maintenance of a malignant phenotype, and high levels of PBX3 tumor expression have been linked to shorter overall survival in cancer.

METHODS: A seven-color antibody panel including CD10, CD19, CD45, CD38, CD34, CD58, and CD81 was generated to assess the feasibility of a single tube panel and provide an algorithmic approach to distinguish hematogones from B-ALL. Fifty-three cases were analyzed, and results were correlated with histology and ancillary studies. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) for CD81 and CD58 when comparing hematogones and B-ALL populations (P < .001). B-ALL cases had a mean (SD) MFI of 24.6 (27.5; range, 2-125) for CD81 and 135.6 (72.6; range, 48-328) for CD58. Hematogones cases had a mean (SD) MFI of 70.2 (19.2; range, 42-123) for CD81 and 38.8 (9.4; range, 23-58) for CD58. CONCLUSIONS: The flow cytometry panel with the above markers and utilization of the proposed algorithmic approach provide differentiation of hematogones from B-ALL. This includes rare cases of hematogones and B-ALL overlap where additional ancillary studies are necessary.","['Don, Michelle D', 'Lim, Washington', 'Lo, Amanda', 'Cox, Brian', 'Huang, Qin', 'Kitahara, Sumire', 'Lopategui, Jean', 'Alkan, Serhan']","['Don MD', 'Lim W', 'Lo A', 'Cox B', 'Huang Q', 'Kitahara S', 'Lopategui J', 'Alkan S']","['Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/19 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['5739957 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqaa007 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2020 May 5;153(6):790-798. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqaa007.,,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2020.

Here, modeling of BETi-persister/resistance (BETi-P/R) in human postmyeloproliferative neoplasm (post-MPN) secondary AML (sAML) cells demonstrated accessible and active chromatin in specific superenhancers/enhancers, which was associated with increased levels of nuclear beta-catenin, TCF7L2, JMJD6, and c-Myc in BETi-P/R sAML cells. Following BETi treatment, c-Myc levels were rapidly restored in BETi-P/R sAML cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of TCF7L2 or JMJD6 reversed BETi-P/R, whereas ectopic overexpression conferred BETi-P/R in sAML cells, confirming the mechanistic role of the beta-catenin-TCF7L2-JMJD6-c-Myc axis in BETi resistance. Patient-derived, post-MPN, CD34+ sAML blasts exhibiting relative resistance to BETi, as compared with sensitive sAML blasts, displayed higher messenger RNA and protein expression of TCF7L2, JMJD6, and c-Myc and following BETi washout exhibited rapid restoration of c-Myc and JMJD6. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of TCF7L2 and JMJD6 depleted their levels, inducing loss of viability of the sAML blasts. Disruption of colocalization of nuclear beta-catenin with TBL1 and TCF7L2 by the small-molecule inhibitor BC2059 combined with depletion of BRD4 by BET proteolysis-targeting chimera reduced c-Myc levels and exerted synergistic lethality in BETi-P/R sAML cells. This combination also reduced leukemia burden and improved survival of mice engrafted with BETi-P/R sAML cells or patient-derived AML blasts innately resistant to BETi. Therefore, multitargeted disruption of the beta-catenin-TCF7L2-JMJD6-c-Myc axis overcomes adaptive and innate BETi resistance, exhibiting preclinical efficacy against human post-MPN sAML cells.","['Saenz, Dyana T', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Mill, Christopher P', 'Perera, Dimuthu', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Lara, Bernardo H', 'Karkhanis, Vrajesh', 'Sharma, Sunil', 'Horrigan, Stephen K', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Masarova, Lucia', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Bhaskara, Srividya', 'Lin, Charles Y', 'Green, Michael R', 'Coarfa, Cristian', 'Crews, Craig M', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Bhalla, Kapil N']","['Saenz DT', 'Fiskus W', 'Mill CP', 'Perera D', 'Manshouri T', 'Lara BH', 'Karkhanis V', 'Sharma S', 'Horrigan SK', 'Bose P', 'Kadia TM', 'Masarova L', 'DiNardo CD', 'Borthakur G', 'Khoury JD', 'Takahashi K', 'Bhaskara S', 'Lin CY', 'Green MR', 'Coarfa C', 'Crews CM', 'Verstovsek S', 'Bhalla KN']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, AZ.', 'Iterion Therapeutics, Houston, TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology and.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, and.', 'Department of Chemistry and Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (JMJD6 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2020/02/19 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62118-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019002922 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Apr 9;135(15):1255-1269. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019002922.,,"['R01 CA188520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES030285/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7146021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) may have lower rates of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) versus other central lines. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the CLABSI rate in the first month of therapy after initiating a policy to place PICCs in new patients with severe neutropenia (SN) and Mediports in those with moderate-to-no neutropenia. We also examined thrombosis rates. DESIGN/METHOD: We prospectively gathered data on new patients for 2.5 years following the policy change and retrospectively for the 2 years prior and compared rates of CLABSIs and thrombosis. RESULTS: CLABSIs decreased in SN patients from 7.52/1000 to 3.11/1000 line days (P=0.33). The CLABSI rate for all patients with SN who had a Mediport was 13.39/1000 versus 4.08/1000 line days for those that received PICCs (P=0.15). The thrombosis rate for Mediport patients was 3.13 clots/1000 versus 7.65/1000 line days for PICC patients, but the difference was not significant (P= 0.11). CONCLUSION: The differences observed suggest that placing PICCs versus Mediports in new ALL patients with SN may result in a lower incidence of CLABSIs in the first month of therapy without a significant increase in thrombosis.","['Berger, Rebecca', 'Messina, Allison F', 'Chandler, Nicole M', 'Amankwah, Ernest K', 'Shaw, Peter H']","['Berger R', 'Messina AF', 'Chandler NM', 'Amankwah EK', 'Shaw PH']","['Cancer and Blood Disorders Institute.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases.', ""Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, St. Petersburg, FL."", 'Cancer and Blood Disorders Institute.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Cancer and Blood Disorders Institute.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bacteremia/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Baltimore/epidemiology', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Central Venous Catheters/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Health Policy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/19 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001748 [doi]', '00043426-202010000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2020 Oct;42(7):433-437. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001748.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the LAM97 protocol (n=34), patients received, as consolidation, autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), depending on the availability or not of a matched sibling donor. In the LAM08 protocol (n=37), patients were stratified into risk groups, autologous HSCT was abandoned, and allogeneic HSCT was limited to intermediate-risk patients with matched sibling donor and to all patients who fulfilled the high-risk criteria. Complete remission was achieved in 91% and 92% of patients in LAM97 and LAM08, respectively. Deaths in complete remission were 9.6% and 17.6%, respectively.

Although she entered remission after induction therapy, she relapsed 15 months after maintenance therapy cessation. Since further investigation revealed EBF1-PDGFRB fusion, her condition was treated as BCR-ABL1-like acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She was started on a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, and chemotherapy and underwent umbilical cord blood transplantation following reduced intensity conditioning. She has remained in complete remission for 36 months after cord blood transplantation. This case demonstrates the successful use of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to treat BCP-ALL with a fusion transcript and highlights the need for a standardized treatment protocol.","['Sakurai, Yukari', 'Sarashina, Takeo', 'Toriumi, Naohisa', 'Hatakeyama, Naoki', 'Kanayama, Takuyo', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Osumi, Tomoo', 'Ohki, Kentaro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Azuma, Hiroshi']","['Sakurai Y', 'Sarashina T', 'Toriumi N', 'Hatakeyama N', 'Kanayama T', 'Imamura T', 'Osumi T', 'Ohki K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Azuma H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido Prefecture.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido Prefecture.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido Prefecture.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido Prefecture.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto.', ""Children's Cancer Center."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido Prefecture.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (EBF1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (PDGFRB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",2020/02/19 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001743 [doi]', '00043426-202101000-00034 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2021 Jan;43(1):e105-e108. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001743.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted MRI separates tissue microcapillary perfusion and diffusivity and may have potential for helping to assess prognosis in infiltrated marrow disease apart from solid tumor. Thus, a study of overall survival would contribute to clarifying the value of IVIM for assessing long-term prognosis in AML. Purpose To determine whether the IVIM-derived parameters of infiltrated bone marrow may be associated with OS in newly diagnosed AML. Materials and Methods This prospective study enrolled participants with newly diagnosed AML between July 2014 to March 2016 consecutively. Participants underwent MRI of the lumbar spine by using an IVIM sequence. Participant clinical characteristics and OS were collected. The median of follow-up period was 20 months (range, 1-56 months). The IVIM parameters (pseudoperfusion fraction, f; diffusion coefficient, D; and pseudodiffusion coefficient, D*) were obtained. A nonparametric log-rank test was used to identify the threshold of IVIM parameters for OS. Univariable Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to investigate prognostic significance of possible indicators. Results Fifty-three participants (mean age, 42 years +/- 17; 30 men) were evaluated. Nonparametric log-rank test results showed that the thresholds of f and D values for OS were 31.0% and 0.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec, respectively. Univariable analyses indicated that high f value (>31.0%) and low D value (</=0.2 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec) were associated with shorter OS (P = .003 and .01, respectively). An f value greater than 31.0% (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.0, 5.6; P = .046) was associated with OS, independent of clinical confounders (age, karyotype, and white blood cell counts) in a multivariable analysis. Conclusion Pseudoperfusion fraction and diffusion coefficient from intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted MRI may be viable prognosis predictors of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.

However, it has also been observed to bind the transcription start site of actively expressed genes. To address this paradox, we characterized the protein interactome of KAP1 in the human K562 erythro-leukaemia cell line. We found that the regulator can associate with a wide range of nucleic acid binding proteins, nucleosome remodellers, chromatin modifiers and other transcription modulators. We further determined that KAP1 is recruited at actively transcribed polymerase II promoters, where its depletion resulted in pleomorphic effects, whether expression of these genes was normally constitutive or inducible, consistent with the breadth of possible KAP1 interactors.

PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective review of children undergoing alloHCT for AML and MDS over a 10-year period (2008-2018) at our institution, comparing the outcomes of recipients of either a myeloablative busulfan- or reduced toxicity mel/thio-based conditioning regimen. RESULTS: A total of 49 patients underwent alloHCT for AML/MDS (mel/thio, N = 21; busulfan, N = 28). Mel/thio recipients were selected due to pretransplant comorbidities. Recipients of mel/thio were more likely to have t-AML, and less likely to have MRD <0.1% at the time of alloHCT (57.1% vs 82.1%). Graft failure was more common in busulfan recipients; engraftment kinetics were similar between groups. Sinusoidal obstructive syndrome was diagnosed in 21% of busulfan and no mel/thio recipients (P = .03). One patient in each group died from TRM. Relapse incidence was comparable (mel/thio-29% vs busulfan-32%); however, relapse occurred significantly later in recipients of mel/thio conditioning (median d + 396 vs d + 137; P = .01). As a result, there was a trend toward improved OS at 1 and 3 years in mel/thio recipients (95% vs 74%, P = .06; and 75% vs 50%, P = .11; respectively). CONCLUSION: In our single institution, when compared to myeloablative busulfan-based conditioning, use of a mel/thio-based reduced toxicity regimen resulted in comparable outcomes, despite higher risk patient and disease characteristics. Mel/thio recipients had both more comorbidities and higher risk disease profile, which did not translate into higher rates of either TRM or relapse.","['Oshrine, Benjamin', 'Adams, Lauren', 'Nguyen, Anh Thy H', 'Amankwah, Ernest', 'Shyr, David', 'Hale, Gregory', 'Petrovic, Aleksandra']","['Oshrine B', 'Adams L', 'Nguyen ATH', 'Amankwah E', 'Shyr D', 'Hale G', 'Petrovic A']","[""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Saint Petersburg, Florida."", ""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Saint Petersburg, Florida."", ""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Saint Petersburg, Florida."", ""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Saint Petersburg, Florida."", ""Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Palo Alto, CA, USA."", ""Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital, Saint Petersburg, Florida."", ""Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20200218,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Melphalan/*therapeutic use', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2020/02/19 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13672 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Jun;24(4):e13672. doi: 10.1111/petr.13672.

Study objectives were to examine self-reported adherence to 6-MP and related barriers to adherence, mapped to the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) model for behavior change. PROCEDURE: Forty-nine parents (median, 39 years old; 76% females) and 15 patients (median, 17 years old, 20% females) completed the study survey. RESULTS: Suboptimal adherence was reported in 43% of parents and 73% of patients. Most parents and patients (80% and 90%, respectively) reported >/=1 adherence barrier. Parents reported difficulty helping their child meet others with ALL (43%), contacting community organizations (39%), and meeting other parents (37%). Patients reported difficulty finding out what their medications are (40%), finding out what 6-MP does (47%), and meeting other patients (40%). Using the COM-B, we found that parents and patients endorsed barriers in multiple components, especially physical (55%, 67%) and social opportunity (56%, 47%), highlighting that barriers to adherence may be multifaceted. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that parents and patients with ALL face various prevalent barriers to medication adherence and provide insight into the development of behavioral interventions focused on promoting adherence, which is essential to prevent relapse and optimize health outcomes in ALL.","['Heneghan, Mallorie B', 'Hussain, Tasmeen', 'Barrera, Leonardo', 'Cai, Stephanie W', 'Haugen, Maureen', 'Duff, Ashley', 'Shoop, Jenny', 'Morgan, Elaine', 'Rossoff, Jenna', 'Weinstein, Joanna', 'Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Cella, David', 'Badawy, Sherif M']","['Heneghan MB', 'Hussain T', 'Barrera L', 'Cai SW', 'Haugen M', 'Duff A', 'Shoop J', 'Morgan E', 'Rossoff J', 'Weinstein J', 'Hijiya N', 'Cella D', 'Badawy SM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.', ""Division of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ann and Robert H.

The results of the present study showed that the abrogation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway using pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 exerted a cytotoxic effect against CML-derived K562 cells through both the induction of p21-mediated G2/M arrest and the stimulation of apoptosis. Notably, the apoptotic effect of the inhibitor was further confirmed by the molecular analysis showing that BKM120 significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. To the best of our knowledge, the involvement of autophagy in resistance to BKM120 has not been yet described and our study suggests for the first time that the elevation of autophagy-related genes might serve as a compensatory pathway to cease the anti-leukemic effect of BKM120 in K562; since we found a reinforced anti-survival event when the cells were treated with BKM120 in combination with autophagy inhibitor. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the abrogation of PI3K using BKM120 might be a befitting approach in CML treatment, either as a single agent or in a combined-modal strategy; however, further evaluations including clinical trials and in vivo investigations are demanded to ascertain the safety and the efficacy of the inhibitor in treatment strategies.","['Shiri Heris, Reza', 'Safaroghli-Azar, Ava', 'Yousefi, Amir-Mohammad', 'Hamidpour, Mohsen', 'Bashash, Davood']","['Shiri Heris R', 'Safaroghli-Azar A', 'Yousefi AM', 'Hamidpour M', 'Bashash D']","['Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1971653312, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1971653312, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1971653312, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1971653312, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Blood Banking, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 1971653312, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200228,England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,"['0 (Aminopyridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (NVP-BKM120)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Aminopyridines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2020/02/19 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbin.11322 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2020 May;44(5):1212-1223. doi: 10.1002/cbin.11322.

We show an increased proliferation and prosurvival role of DPEP1 in B cell ALL cells via regulation of phosphCREB and p53, which may be the biological basis of the clinical correlation we report. Our data implicate DPEP1 expression in the biology of common B cell ALL in adults. We report clinical correlates and provide a potential biological basis for these correlations.

This study focussed on the prediction of response to standard induction therapy and outcome of patients with AML using a combined strategy of mutational profiling by next-generation sequencing (NGS, n = 190) and ex vivo PharmaFlow testing (n = 74) for the 10 most widely used drugs for AML induction therapy, in a cohort of adult patients uniformly treated according to Spanish PETHEMA guidelines. We identified an adverse mutational profile (EZH2, KMT2A, U2AF1 and/or TP53 mutations) that carries a greater risk of death [hazard ratio (HR): 3.29, P < 0.0001]. A high correlation was found between the ex vivo PharmaFlow results and clinical induction response (69%). Clinical correlation analysis showed that the pattern of multiresistance revealed by ex vivo PharmaFlow identified patients with a high risk of death (HR: 2.58). Patients with mutation status also ran a high risk (HR 4.19), and the risk was increased further in patients with both adverse profiles (HR 4.82). We have developed a new score based on NGS and ex vivo drug testing for AML patients that improves upon current prognostic risk stratification and allows clinicians to tailor treatments to minimise drug resistance.","['Onecha, Esther', 'Ruiz-Heredia, Yanira', 'Martinez-Cuadron, David', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Pilar', 'Linares, Maria', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Perez-Oteyza, Jaime', 'Magro, Elena', 'Herrera, Pilar', 'Rojas, Jose Luis', 'Gorrochategui, Julian', 'Villoria, Jesus', 'Boluda, Blanca', 'Sargas, Claudia', 'Ballesteros, Joan', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Ayala, Rosa']","['Onecha E', 'Ruiz-Heredia Y', 'Martinez-Cuadron D', 'Barragan E', 'Martinez-Sanchez P', 'Linares M', 'Rapado I', 'Perez-Oteyza J', 'Magro E', 'Herrera P', 'Rojas JL', 'Gorrochategui J', 'Villoria J', 'Boluda B', 'Sargas C', 'Ballesteros J', 'Montesinos P', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Ayala R']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Sanchinarro, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Medicxact, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Madrid, Spain.', 'Vivia Biotech, Tres Cantos, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari i Politecnic La Fe, Valencia, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Complutense University, Madrid, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200218,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/19 06:00,2021/01/13 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/11/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16432 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 May;189(4):672-683. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16432.

RESULTS: Sixty-five (9.8%) patients experienced cardiac events, including atrial arrhythmia (N = 39), acute heart failure (N = 9), acute coronary syndrome (N = 7), and new onset hypertension (N = 9), with a few instances of bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia, pericardial effusion, and pericarditis. Our multivariable regression analysis identified age (older), creatinine (higher), and history of coronary artery disease to significantly correlate with risk of cardiac event (P = .005, P = .039, and P = .038, respectively). A subgroup analysis of those patients experiencing a cardiac event found pre-transplant atrial dilation by trans-thoracic echocardiogram to correlate with increased risk of atrial arrhythmia (33.8% vs. 9.7%; P = .03). Patients developing a CE had an increased risk of death within 1 year (11% vs. 32%; P < .001). CONCLUSION: We review our results in context of other important HSCT cardiac studies to illuminate the most relevant factors of medical history, laboratory data, and cardiac measurements that will identify patients at higher risk, allowing for intervention to improve HSCT outcomes.","['Baker, Julie Kay', 'Shank-Coviello, Jessica', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Dixon, Jane', 'McCorkle, Ruth', 'Sarpong, Daniel', 'Medoff, Erin', 'Cooper, Dennis', 'Seropian, Stuart', 'Dai, Feng']","['Baker JK', 'Shank-Coviello J', 'Zhou B', 'Dixon J', 'McCorkle R', 'Sarpong D', 'Medoff E', 'Cooper D', 'Seropian S', 'Dai F']","['Department of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT.

The synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A) is known to the specific binding site of LEV. Numerous studies have documented that SV2A is a membrane protein specifically expressed in nervous system. Interestingly, our previous research showed that SV2A also existed in human CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that LEV was associated with decreased risk of AS by regulating monocytes chemotaxis and adhesion. We showed that SV2A protein were detected in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells. LEV (300 muM) inhibited the chemotaxis and adhesion of THP-1 cells after transfection with plasmids expressing SV2A(WT), but not SV2A(R383Q) which was a known functional mutation site of human SV2A. Furthermore, RT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated that LEV (300 muM) decreased the expression level of chemokine-related receptors (CX3CL1, CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5),and reduced levels of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) in THP-1 cells with SV2A(WT) expressing plasmids. Taken together, these findings indicated that LEV has an inhibitory effect on THP-1 monocyte adhesion and chemotaxis, suggesting that SV2A may serve as a novel therapeutic target to prevent AS.","['Zhang, Yue', 'Hu, Min', 'Tang, Yue-Yu', 'Zhang, Bei', 'Han, Yin-Yin', 'Huang, Zheng-Yu', 'Chen, Chen', 'Li, Gang']","['Zhang Y', 'Hu M', 'Tang YY', 'Zhang B', 'Han YY', 'Huang ZY', 'Chen C', 'Li G']","['Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.', 'Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.', 'Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.', 'Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.', 'Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.', 'Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.', 'Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.', 'Department of Neurology, East Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Tongji University School of Medicine, China.

The toxicity profile of imatinib has been well characterized with most patients experiencing a grade 1 or 2 adverse event. These side effects are usually mild, and most patients can continue treatment without interruption. Around 30% of patients on imatinib experience skin toxicity, with 5% being high grade. This rash is typically hypopigmented, which is explained by imatinib's effect on melanocytes. DISCUSSION: Although there have been several case reports describing hyperpigmentation of the oral mucosa or nails, very few have described skin hyperpigmentation. We previously reported the first two cases of imatinib-related squamous cell carcinoma in patients undergoing treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In this paper, we present a case of a patient on imatinib for management of gastrointestinal stromal tumor who experienced extensive skin hyperpigmentation and review the literature.","['Rehman, Hasan', 'Hakim, Nausheen', 'Sugarman, Ryan', 'Seetharamu, Nagashree', 'Saif, Muhammad W']","['Rehman H', 'Hakim N', 'Sugarman R', 'Seetharamu N', 'Saif MW']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Northwell Cancer Institute, Lake Success, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Northwell Cancer Institute, Lake Success, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Northwell Cancer Institute, Lake Success, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Northwell Cancer Institute, Lake Success, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Northwell Cancer Institute, Lake Success, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200218,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hyperpigmentation/*chemically induced', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2020/02/19 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220903364 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Sep;26(6):1511-1515. doi: 10.1177/1078155220903364.

SUBJECTS: Thirty-seven prospective patients aged >/=19 years with acute leukemia undergoing chemotherapy were enrolled. Oral and clinical investigations were performed at baseline and on Day 14 after starting chemotherapy. The presence and severity of cancer-induced oral mucositis were demonstrated using the World Health Organization (WHO) scoring system. RESULTS: On Day 14, we found that oral mucositis had developed in eight patients (21.6%). Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients was a predictor of increased WHO scores (beta = 1.937, p < .001). Regarding oral sites, ventral tongue (beta = 1.670), soft palate (beta = 1.242), and buccal mucosa (beta = 0.593) were predictors for increased scores. In addition, the increase in WHO scores was positively correlated with the number of oral lesions (r = .521), the difficulty in eating (r = .250), and the overall oral health (r = .534; all p < .05). CONCLUSION: The main factors affecting the severity of CIOM symptoms were the treatment with HSCT and the location of oral lesions. The incidence of CIOM and WHO scores were not significantly different between the subgroups of disease. Our findings will help clinicians investigate the oral findings after chemotherapy in adult patients with acute leukemia.","['Lee, Yeon-Hee', 'Hong, Junshik', 'Kim, Inho', 'Choi, Youngnim', 'Park, Hee-Kyung']","['Lee YH', 'Hong J', 'Kim I', 'Choi Y', 'Park HK']","['Department of Orofacial Pain and Oral Medicine, Kyung Hee University Dental Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Microbiology, School of Dentistry and Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Oral Medicine and Oral Diagnosis, Dental Research Institute, Seoul National University Dental Hospital, Seoul National University School of Dentistry, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20191209,United States,Clin Exp Dent Res,Clinical and experimental dental research,101692332,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oral Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prospective Studies', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Stomatitis/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology']",2020/02/19 06:00,2021/06/17 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cre2.253 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Dent Res. 2020 Feb;6(1):90-99. doi: 10.1002/cre2.253.

It was previously reported that expression of the long noncoding RNA LOC285758 is positively associated with AML cell proliferation, but the underlying mechanisms have not previously been reported. Here, we report that LOC285758 expression is higher in clinical AML blood samples and cultured AML cells. miR-204-5p was confirmed to be a target gene of LOC285758 by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assay. LOC285758 overexpression promoted AML cell viability and invasion abilities, which were effectively inhibited by miR-204-5p overexpression; moreover, miR-204-5p overexpression also regulated the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Twist1. The data also showed that increased LOC285758 expression could effectively suppress the earlier effects of miR-204-5p on AML cells.

We evaluated waning immunity to 14 pneumococcal serotypes, pertussis toxin (PT), tetanus toxoid (TT) and varicella, and immunogenicity of postchemotherapy diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, polio, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTaP-IPV-Hib) and pneumococcal vaccination among previously vaccinated children treated for ALL. METHODS: This was a multicenter trial of children with ALL enrolled 4-12 months postchemotherapy completion. Exclusion criteria included: infant ALL, relapsed ALL, and stem cell transplant recipients. Immunocompetent children were recruited as controls. Postchemotherapy participants received DTaP-IPV-Hib and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) concurrently, followed by 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) 2 months later. Serology was measured at baseline, 2 and 12 months postvaccination. Adverse events were captured via surveys. RESULTS: At enrollment, postchemotherapy participants (n = 74) were less likely than controls (n = 78) to be age-appropriately immunized with DTaP (41% vs 89%, P < .001) and PCV (59% vs 79%, P = .008). Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) to TT, PT, PCV serotypes, and varicella were lower in postchemotherapy participants than controls after adjusting for previous vaccine doses (P < .001). Two months postvaccination, GMCs to TT, PT, and PCV serotypes increased from baseline (P < .001 for all antigens) and remained elevated at 12 months postvaccination. Antibody levels to PPV23 serotypes also increased postvaccination (P < .001). No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Children treated for ALL had lower antibody levels than controls against pneumococcal serotypes, tetanus, pertussis, and varicella despite previous vaccination. Postchemotherapy vaccination with DTaP-IPV-Hib, PCV13, and PPV23 was immunogenic and well tolerated. Children with ALL would benefit from systematic revaccination postchemotherapy.

We treated primary murine T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) alone and in combination with the pan-PI3 kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 and observed a robust response to DEX that was modestly enhanced by GDC-0941. Continuous in vivo treatment invariably resulted in outgrowth of drug-resistant clones, ~30% of which showed markedly reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein expression. A similar proportion of relapsed human T-ALLs also exhibited low GR protein levels. De novo or preexisting mutations in the gene encoding GR (Nr3c1) occurred in relapsed clones derived from multiple independent parental leukemias. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing confirmed that loss of GR expression confers DEX resistance. Exposing drug-sensitive T-ALLs to DEX in vivo altered transcript levels of multiple genes, and this response was attenuated in relapsed T-ALLs. These data implicate reduced GR protein expression as a frequent cause of glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL.","['Wandler, Anica M', 'Huang, Benjamin J', 'Craig, Jeffrey W', 'Hayes, Kathryn', 'Yan, Hannah', 'Meyer, Lauren K', 'Scacchetti, Alessandro', 'Monsalve, Gabriela', 'Dail, Monique', 'Li, Qing', 'Wong, Jasmine C', 'Weinberg, Olga', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Jonsson, Philip', 'Yamamoto, Keith', 'Sampath, Deepak', 'Nakitandwe, Joy', 'Downing, James R', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Shannon, Kevin']","['Wandler AM', 'Huang BJ', 'Craig JW', 'Hayes K', 'Yan H', 'Meyer LK', 'Scacchetti A', 'Monsalve G', 'Dail M', 'Li Q', 'Wong JC', 'Weinberg O', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Kogan SC', 'Jonsson P', 'Yamamoto K', 'Sampath D', 'Nakitandwe J', 'Downing JR', 'Zhang J', 'Aster JC', 'Taylor BS', 'Shannon K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Marie-Josee and Henry R.

We analyzed the impact on the outcomes of deep targeted mutational screening in 280 MDS patients with -7/del(7q) as isolated cytogenetic abnormality (86 with del(7q) and 194 with -7). Patients with del(7q) or -7 had similar demographic and disease-related characteristics. Somatic mutations were detected in 79% (93/117) of patients (82% in -7 and 73% in del(7q) group). Median number of mutations per patient was 2 (range 0-8). There was no difference in mutation frequency between the two groups. Patients harbouring >/=2 mutations had a worse outcome than patients with <2 or no mutations (leukaemic transformation at 24 months, 38% and 20%, respectively, p = 0.044). Untreated patients with del(7q) had better overall survival (OS) compared with -7 (median OS, 34 vs 17 months, p = 0.034). In multivariable analysis, blast count, TP53 mutations and number of mutations were independent predictors of OS, whereas the cytogenetic subgroups did not retain prognostic relevance.

However, their specific roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) pathogenesis remain unknown. Here, the expression, methylation or mutation of EZH2 and TET2 was determined and further correlated with the levels of the chromosome instability (CIN) genes MAD2 and CDC20. We down-regulated EZH2 and TET2 in AML cell lines and assessed the effect on CIN using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Our results showed that TET2, EZH2, MAD2 and CDC20 were aberrantly expressed in AML patients. The expression level of MAD2 or CDC20 was positively correlated with that of TET2 or EZH2. Hypermethylation of the TET2 gene down-regulated its transcription. Down-regulation of EZH2 or TET2 expression inhibited apoptosis, affected MAD2 and CDC20 expression, and promoted CIN in AML cells. Decitabine treatment restored TET2 methylation and EZH2 transcription and ameliorated CIN in AML. Therefore, TET2 and EZH2 play a tumor-inhibiting role in AML that affects CIN via MAD2 and CDC20.","['Wang, Jingyi', 'He, Na', 'Wang, Ruiqing', 'Tian, Tian', 'Han, Fengjiao', 'Zhong, Chaoqin', 'Zhang, Chen', 'Hua, Mingqiang', 'Ji, Chunyan', 'Ma, Daoxin']","['Wang J', 'He N', 'Wang R', 'Tian T', 'Han F', 'Zhong C', 'Zhang C', 'Hua M', 'Ji C', 'Ma D']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, 250012, P.R.

Here we show that Foxm1 is required for survival, quiescence and self-renewal of MLL-AF9 (MA9)-transformed leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in vivo. Mechanistically, Foxm1 upregulation activates the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways by directly binding to beta-catenin and stabilizing beta-catenin protein through inhibiting its degradation, thereby preserving LSC quiescence, and promoting LSC self-renewal in MLL-rearranged AML. More importantly, inhibition of FOXM1 markedly suppresses leukemogenic potential and induces apoptosis of primary LSCs from MLL-rearranged AML patients in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mice. Thus, our study shows a critical role and mechanisms of Foxm1 in MA9-LSCs, and indicates that FOXM1 is a potential therapeutic target for selectively eliminating LSCs in MLL-rearranged AML.","['Sheng, Yue', 'Yu, Chunjie', 'Liu, Yin', 'Hu, Chao', 'Ma, Rui', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Ji, Peng', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Mizukawa, Benjamin', 'Huang, Yong', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Qian, Zhijian']","['Sheng Y', 'Yu C', 'Liu Y', 'Hu C', 'Ma R', 'Lu X', 'Ji P', 'Chen J', 'Mizukawa B', 'Huang Y', 'Licht JD', 'Qian Z']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Institute for Tuberculosis Research, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, IL, USA.', 'Department of System Biology, City of Hope, CA, USA.', ""Cancer & Blood Diseases Institute, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottestville, VA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. zhijian.qian@medicine.ufl.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. zhijian.qian@medicine.ufl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200217,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (Foxm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'RNA-Seq', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2020/02/19 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-14590-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-14590-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 17;11(1):928. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14590-9.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8849-3625', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3749-2902', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3312-2982', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3942-1369']","['R01 DK107615/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL131444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7026046,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Medical records were retrieved and abstracted for cases enrolled in a Los Angeles County case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Cases were linked to the Los Angeles County cancer registry (CSP), the California state hospitalization discharge database (OSHPD), and the SEER-Medicare database. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) of cancer treatment in linked databases, compared with medical record abstraction. RESULTS: We successfully retrieved medical records for 918 of 1,004 participating NHL cases and abstracted treatment for 698. We linked 59% of cases (96% of cases >65 years old) to SEER-Medicare and 96% to OSHPD. Chemotherapy was the most common treatment and best captured, with the highest sensitivity in SEER-Medicare (80%) and CSP (74%); combining all three data sources together increased sensitivity (92%), at reduced specificity (56%). Sensitivity for radiotherapy was moderate: 77% with aggregated data. Sensitivity of BMT was low in the CSP (42%), but high for the administrative databases, especially OSHPD (98%). Sensitivity for surgery reached 83% when considering all three datasets in aggregate, but PPV was 60%. In general, sensitivity and PPV for chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma were low. CONCLUSIONS: Chemotherapy was accurately captured by all data sources. Hospitalization data yielded the highest performance values for BMTs. Performance measures for radiotherapy and surgery were moderate. IMPACT: Various administrative databases can supplement epidemiologic studies, depending on treatment type and NHL subtype of interest.","['Zhong, Charlie', 'Seibold, Petra', 'Chao, Chun R', 'Cozen, Wendy', 'Song, Joo Y', 'Weisenburger, Dennis', 'Bernstein, Leslie', 'Wang, Sophia S']","['Zhong C', 'Seibold P', 'Chao CR', 'Cozen W', 'Song JY', 'Weisenburger D', 'Bernstein L', 'Wang SS']","['Division of Health Analytics, Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, City of Hope and the Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California. czhong@coh.org.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope and the Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Research & Evaluation, Kaiser Permanente Southern California, Pasadena, California.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope and the Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California.', 'Division of Health Analytics, Department of Computational and Quantitative Medicine, City of Hope and the Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20200217,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Administrative Claims, Healthcare/statistics & numerical data', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Data Mining/*methods', 'Drug Therapy/statistics & numerical data', 'Electronic Health Records/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Los Angeles/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Medicare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Discharge/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiotherapy/statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program/statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Surgical Procedures, Operative/statistics & numerical data', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/19 06:00,2021/07/08 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-19-1504 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-1504 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2020 May;29(5):936-941. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-1504.

We aimed to describe chronic health conditions and all-cause and cause-specific mortality among survivors of early-adolescent and young adult cancer. METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a retrospective cohort study with longitudinal follow-up of 5-year survivors diagnosed with cancer before the age of 21 years at 27 academic institutions in the USA and Canada between 1970 and 1999. We evaluated outcomes among survivors of early-adolescent and young adult cancer (aged 15-20 years at diagnosis) and survivors diagnosed at age younger than 15 years (matched on primary cancer diagnosis, including leukaemia, lymphoma, CNS tumours, neuroblastoma, Wilms tumour, soft-tissue sarcomas, and bone cancer) by comparing both groups to siblings of the same age. Mortality was ascertained with the National Death Index. Chronic health conditions were classified with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated with age-specific, sex-specific, and calendar year-specific US rates. Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for chronic health conditions and 95% CIs. FINDINGS: Among 5804 early-adolescent and young adult survivors (median age 42 years, IQR 34-50) the SMR compared to the general population for all-cause mortality was 5.9 (95% CI 5.5-6.2) and among 5804 childhood cancer survivors (median age 34 years; 27-42), it was 6.2 (5.8-6.6). Early-adolescent and young adult survivors had lower SMRs for death from health-related causes (ie, conditions that exclude recurrence or progression of the primary cancer and external causes, but include the late effects of cancer therapy) than did childhood cancer survivors (SMR 4.8 [95% CI 4.4-5.1] vs 6.8 [6.2-7.4]), which was primarily evident more than 20 years after cancer diagnosis. Early-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors and childhood cancer survivors were both at greater risk of developing severe and disabling, life-threatening, or fatal (grade 3-5) health conditions than siblings of the same age (HR 4.2 [95% CI 3.7-4.8] for early adolescent and young adult cancer survivors and 5.6 [4.9-6.3] for childhood cancer survivors), and at increased risk of developing grade 3-5 cardiac (4.3 [3.5-5.4] and 5.6 [4.5-7.1]), endocrine (3.9 [2.9-5.1] and 6.4 [5.1-8.0]), and musculoskeletal conditions (6.5 [3.9-11.1] and 8.0 [4.6-14.0]) when compared with siblings of the same age, although all these risks were lower for early-adolescent and young adult survivors than for childhood cancer survivors. INTERPRETATION: Early-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors had higher risks of mortality and severe and life threatening chronic health conditions than the general population. However, early-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors had lower non-recurrent, health-related SMRs and relative risks of developing grade 3-5 chronic health conditions than childhood cancer survivors, by comparison with siblings of the same age, which were most notable more than 20 years after their original cancer. These results highlight the need for long-term screening of both childhood and early-adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.

It is important to better understand the use of antimicrobial agents and antibiotic resistance for appropriate treatment and prevention of drug resistance. However, very few multi-centre analyses have focused on the use of antimicrobial agents and antibiotic resistance have been carried out in Japan. This study aimed to describe the characteristics of the use of antimicrobial agents and antibiotic resistance in patients with haematological malignancies. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using administrative claims data and antimicrobial susceptibility data in Japan. We included patients diagnosed with haematological malignancies, who were hospitalized in a haematology ward between 1 April 2015 and 30 September 2017 in 37 hospitals. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics, antimicrobial utilization, bacterial infections, and antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: In total, 8064 patients were included. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (50.0%) was the most common malignancy. The broad-spectrum antibiotics displayed a following antimicrobial use density (AUD): cefepime (156.7), carbapenems (104.8), and piperacillin/tazobactam (28.4). In particular, patients with lymphoid leukaemia, myeloid leukaemia, or myelodysplastic syndromes presented a higher AUD than those with Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. The most frequent bacterial species in our study cohort was Escherichia coli (9.4%), and this trend was also observed in blood specimens. Fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli (3.6%) was the most frequently observed antibiotic-resistant strain, while other antibiotic-resistant strains were rare. CONCLUSIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotics were common in patients with haematological malignancies in Japan; however, antibiotic-resistant bacteria including carbapenem-resistant or multidrug-resistant bacteria were infrequent. Our results provide nationwide, cross-sectional insight into the use of antimicrobial agents, prevalence of bacteria, and antibiotic resistance, demonstrating differences in antimicrobial utilization among different haematological diseases.","['Mimura, Wataru', 'Fukuda, Haruhisa', 'Akazawa, Manabu']","['Mimura W', 'Fukuda H', 'Akazawa M']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Health Care Administration and Management, Kyushu University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Meiji Pharmaceutical University, Kiyose, Tokyo, Japan. makazawa@my-pharm.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,England,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,Annals of clinical microbiology and antimicrobials,101152152,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Carbapenems)', '157044-21-8 (Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Infections/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Carbapenems/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cefepime/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Drug Resistance, Bacterial', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperacillin, Tazobactam Drug Combination/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/19 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12941-020-00348-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12941-020-00348-0 [pii]']",epublish,Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob. 2020 Feb 17;19(1):7. doi: 10.1186/s12941-020-00348-0.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4112-6035'],"['JP17H04144/JPSP KAKENHI', '19K22781/Grant-in-Aid for Challenging (Exploratory)']",,PMC7027235,,['NOTNLM'],"['Antibiotic resistance', 'Antimicrobial use density', 'Antimicrobial utilization', 'Haematological malignancies', 'Japan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed whole exome sequencing to identify the causative variants. Sanger sequencing was used to perform segregation analyses on remaining family members. RESULTS: We identified and classified a pathogenic GFI1 variant and a likely pathogenic variant in MYO6 which together explain the complex phenotypes seen in this family. CONCLUSIONS: We present a case illustrating the benefits of a broad screening approach that allows identification of oligogenic determinants of complex human phenotypes which may have been missed if the screening was limited to a targeted gene panel with the assumption of a syndromic disorder. This is important for correct genetic diagnosis of families and disentangling the range and severity of phenotypes associated with high impact variants.","['Venugopal, Parvathy', 'Gagliardi, Lucia',

Herein, whether venetoclax sensitivity could be enhanced or restored in combination with bortezomib or S63845, a novel MCL1-selective inhibitor, was examined in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), including bortezomib-resistant HMCLs. METHODS: By MTS assay, half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 ) and hence sensitivity/resistance to venetoclax, bortezomib and S63845 were determined. KEY FINDINGS: Venetoclax (IC50 >/=100 nm), bortezomib (IC50 >/=50 nm) and S63845 (IC50 >/=100 nm) resistance was observed in nine (75%), three (25%) and six (50%) HMCLs, respectively. Moreover, venetoclax sensitivity was independent of bortezomib (R(2) = 0.1107) or S63845 (R(2) = 0.0213) sensitivity. Venetoclax sensitivity correlated with high mRNA ratio of BCL2/MCL1 (P = 0.0091), BCL2/BCL2L1 (P = 0.0182) and low MCL1 expression (P = 0.0091). In HMCLs sensitive to both venetoclax and bortezomib/S63845, venetoclax combined with S63845 showed stronger synergistic effect than combined with bortezomib. Moreover, in venetoclax-resistant HMCLs, S63845, but not bortezomib, significantly restored venetoclax sensitivity. Conversely, bortezomib combined with S63845 did not result in augmented bortezomib sensitivity or abolishment of bortezomib resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of t(11;14), combination of venetoclax with S63845 is a promising strategy in enhancing venetoclax sensitivity or overcoming venetoclax resistance in myeloma therapy, hence warrant future clinical studies.","['Wong, Kwan Yeung', 'Chim, Chor Sang']","['Wong KY', 'Chim CS']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Thiophenes/*therapeutic use', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2020/02/18 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2019/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jphp.13240 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2020 May;72(5):728-737. doi: 10.1111/jphp.13240.

Moreover, transformation to more severe secondary myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukaemia can occur. The aim of this study was to identify gene mutations that could be used together with clinical data as prognostic markers to guide treatment decisions in PV patients. A well-characterized WHO-defined cohort of PV patients was used. Clinical data and blood values were evaluated and a myeloid sequencing panel was used to screen for additional mutations other than the diagnostic JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations. In 78% of the PV patients, at least one mutation additional to JAK2 V617F was detected. Additional mutations in genes coding for epigenetic modifiers, like TET2, DNMT3A and ASXL1, were most frequent. When correlated to overall survival, mutations in ASXL1 were significantly associated with inferior survival. In an attempt to obtain prognostic guidance in a larger number of patients, the presence of ASXL1 mutations was combined with age and vascular complications prior to diagnosis. Based on these data we were able to define three risk groups that predicted survival.","['Andreasson, Bjorn', 'Pettersson, Helna', 'Wasslavik, Carina', 'Johansson, Peter', 'Palmqvist, Lars', 'Asp, Julia']","['Andreasson B', 'Pettersson H', 'Wasslavik C', 'Johansson P', 'Palmqvist L', 'Asp J']","['Hematology Section, Department of Medicine, NU Hospital Group, Uddevalla, Sweden.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Medicine, NU Hospital Group, Uddevalla, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Haematology and Coagulation Section, Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, the Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200217,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Comorbidity', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/genetics/*mortality', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Thromboembolism/epidemiology']",2020/02/18 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16450 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jun;189(5):913-919. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16450.

Because distance is a key component when calculating the magnetic field generated by power lines, distance from lines and calculated fields based on lines tend to be highly correlated. Socioeconomic status (SES) and dwelling type are also associated with magnetic field exposure. We used exposure data from two large studies of childhood leukemia and other cancers, in the US and the UK, to describe a relationship between distance and magnetic fields across the population within 100 meters (m) of power lines as a whole and evaluate potential modifiers such as SES and type of dwelling. There were 387 subjects living within 100 m of an overhead power line. There was no significant difference in mean calculated fields or distance to 200+ kV lines within 100 m by study. Within the range where the power-line field is expected to be significant compared to other sources, which we take as 100 m, distance to high-voltage lines predicted magnetic field (MF) variation in both studies better than other functions of distance tested in both linear and logistic regression. There were no differences between high and low SES or dwelling types (single-family home versus other). In conclusion, we found that calculated fields do appear to diminish linearly with increasing distance from overhead power lines, up to 100 m, particularly those 200+ kV and above. These results are stronger in the UK study. Within 100 m, distance to high-voltage lines continues to be highly correlated with calculated MFs and each can be a proxy for the other.","['Amoon, A T', 'Swanson, J', 'Vergara, X', 'Kheifets, L']","['Amoon AT', 'Swanson J', 'Vergara X', 'Kheifets L']","['UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA 90024, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Electric Power Supplies/*adverse effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2020/02/18 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1361-6498/ab7730 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2020 Jun;40(2):431-443. doi: 10.1088/1361-6498/ab7730.

With the popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerable attention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence, these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However, the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to the non-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between the malignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper discusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deep learning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. The proposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNet(theta) is a 2-module framework that utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a Kernel SVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier uses features through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by the auxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolved quantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGB images. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiers for decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted class labels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently released public dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish the validity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-level variability. A weighted F1 score of 94.8% is obtained that is best so far on this challenging dataset.","['Gehlot, Shiv', 'Gupta, Anubha', 'Gupta, Ritu']","['Gehlot S', 'Gupta A', 'Gupta R']","['SBILab, Department of ECE, IIIT-Delhi, New Delhi, 110020, India.', 'SBILab, Department of ECE, IIIT-Delhi, New Delhi, 110020, India.

Due to our study, isoquinoline-based tetracyclic scaffold was identified as the key structural element for their anti-LSD1 activity, subtle changes of substituents attached to the core structure led to dramatic changes of the activity. Among these protoberberine alkaloids, epiberberine potently inhibited LSD1 (IC50 = 0.14 +/- 0.01 muM) and was highly selective to LSD1 over MAO-A/B. Furthermore, epiberberine could induce the expression of CD86, CD11b and CD14 in THP-1 and HL-60 cells, confirming its cellular activity of inducing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells differentiation. Moreover, epiberberine prolonged the survival of THP-1 cells bearing mice and inhibited the growth of AML cells in vivo without obvious global toxicity. These findings give the potential application of epiberberine in AML treatment, and the isoquinoline-based tetracyclic scaffold could be used for further development of LSD1 inhibitors.","['Li, Zhong-Rui', 'Suo, Feng-Zhi', 'Guo, Yan-Jia', 'Cheng, Hai-Fang', 'Niu, Sheng-Hui', 'Shen, Dan-Dan', 'Zhao, Li-Juan', 'Liu, Zhen-Zhen', 'Maa, Mamun', 'Yu, Bin', 'Zheng, Yi-Chao', 'Liu, Hong-Min']","['Li ZR', 'Suo FZ', 'Guo YJ', 'Cheng HF', 'Niu SH', 'Shen DD', 'Zhao LJ', 'Liu ZZ', 'Maa M', 'Yu B', 'Zheng YC', 'Liu HM']","['School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'Henan Institute of Product Quality Inspection and Supervision, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of New Drug Research and Safety Evaluation, Henan Province, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; Key Laboratory of Advanced Drug Preparation Technologies, Ministry of Education of China, Zhengzhou 450001, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing 210009, PR China.

Herein, we studied the underlying mechanism(s) of action of arctigenin on acidity-tolerant prostate cancer PC-3AcT cells in the lactic acid-containing medium. At concentration showing no toxicity on normal prostate epithelial RWPE-1 and HPrEC cells, arctigenin alone or in combination with docetaxel induced significant cytotoxicity in PC-3AcT cells compared to parental PC-3 cells. With arctigenin treatment, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, annexin V-PE positive fractions, sub-G0/G1 peak in cell cycle analysis, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and cell communication network factor 1 (CCN1) levels were increased, while cellular ATP content and phospho (p)-Akt level were decreased. Pretreatment with ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine effectively reversed the series of phenomena caused by arctigenin, suggesting that ROS served as upstream molecules of arctigenin-driven cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, arctigenin increased the levels of p-receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (p-RIP3) and p-mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (p-MLKL) as necroptosis mediators, and pretreatment with necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 restored their levels and cell viability. Treatment of spheroids with arctigenin resulted in necroptotic cell death, which was prevented by N-acetylcysteine. The siRNA-based knockdown of CCN1 suppressed the levels of MLKL, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation (Mcl-1) with increased cleavage of Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and caspase-3. Collectively, these results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying arctigenin-induced cytotoxicity, and support arctigenin as a potential therapeutic agent for targeting non-Warburg phenotype through induction of necroptosis via ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage and CCN1 upregulation.","['Lee, Yoon-Jin', 'Nam, Hae-Seon', 'Cho, Moon-Kyun', 'Lee, Sang-Han']","['Lee YJ', 'Nam HS', 'Cho MK', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, 31, Soonchunhyang 6-gil, Dongnam-gu, Cheonan, 31151, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, 31151, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, 31151, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, 31151, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, 31, Soonchunhyang 6-gil, Dongnam-gu, Cheonan, 31151, Republic of Korea. m1037624@sch.ac.kr.', 'Division of Molecular Cancer Research, Soonchunhyang Medical Research Institute, College of Medicine, Soonchunhyang University, Cheonan, 31151, Republic of Korea. m1037624@sch.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (CCND1 protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'U76MR9VS6M (arctigenin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Cyclin D1', 'Docetaxel/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Lignans/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Necroptosis', 'PC-3 Cells', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', '*Up-Regulation']",2020/02/18 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2019/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-020-03699-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-020-03699-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2020 Apr;467(1-2):45-56. doi: 10.1007/s11010-020-03699-6.

Transformation to acute myeloid leukemia occurs in up to 20% of patients with myelofibrosis, while cases of myeloid sarcoma have been reported very unfrequently. In this manuscript, we report the case of a 60-year-old man with a history of primary myelofibrosis who underwent splenectomy because of drug-refractory massive splenomegaly, systemic symptoms and anemia. At the opening of the peritoneal cavity, the spleen resulted massively enlarged and tenaciously entrapped by a pervasive neoplastic-like tissue. The extensive involvement of the abdomen fatally complicated the surgical procedure. At postmortem examination, the spleen showed a diffuse infiltration of immature cells that were also found in the peritoneum, bowel, liver, lungs and myocardium. After immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, flow cytometric and molecular characterization of neoplastic population, a diagnosis of disseminated myeloid sarcoma of the spleen was made. This case report highlights a very unusual case of myeloid sarcoma originating from the spleen in a patient with myelofibrosis who had no evidence of bone marrow or peripheral blood involvement by leukemic cells. Molecular characterization showed that leukemic cells originated from the founding clone of the chronic phase. The sarcoma could not be suspected based on clinical findings and was diagnosed only at the time of surgical procedure and autopsy. This case suggests that leukemic transformation of myelofibrosis can originate outside the bone marrow and, presumably rarely, present as a granulocytic sarcoma.","['Coltro, Giacomo', 'Mannelli, Francesco', 'Vergoni, Federica', 'Santi, Raffaella', 'Massi, Daniela', 'Siliani, Luisa Margherita', 'Marzullo, Antonella', 'Bonifacio, Stefania', 'Pelo, Elisabetta', 'Pacilli, Annalisa', 'Paoli, Chiara', 'Franci, Annalisa', 'Calabresi, Laura', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro Maria', 'Guglielmelli, Paola']","['Coltro G', 'Mannelli F', 'Vergoni F', 'Santi R', 'Massi D', 'Siliani LM', 'Marzullo A', 'Bonifacio S', 'Pelo E', 'Pacilli A', 'Paoli C', 'Franci A', 'Calabresi L', 'Bosi A', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Guglielmelli P']","['CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, DenoThe Excellence Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Istologia Patologica e Diagnostica Molecolare, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Istologia Patologica e Diagnostica Molecolare, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Istologia Patologica e Diagnostica Molecolare, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, Division of Pathology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Oncological and Robotic Surgery, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Genetic Diagnosis, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Genetic Diagnosis, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Division of Genetic Diagnosis, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, DenoThe Excellence Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, DenoThe Excellence Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, DenoThe Excellence Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, DenoThe Excellence Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, DenoThe Excellence Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Careggi, 50134, Florence, Italy. paola.guglielmelli@unifi.it.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, DenoThe Excellence Center, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. paola.guglielmelli@unifi.it.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20200217,Italy,Clin Exp Med,Clinical and experimental medicine,100973405,,IM,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/etiology/*pathology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/*pathology/surgery']",2020/02/18 06:00,2021/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10238-020-00616-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s10238-020-00616-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Med. 2020 May;20(2):313-320. doi: 10.1007/s10238-020-00616-5.

A primary cause of treatment failure of ALL is acquired resistance to glucocorticoids. Recently, traditional Chinese medicines were effectively used to treat solid tumors. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether Huai Qi Huang (HQH), a traditional Chinese medicine, increased the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of ALL, and if so, to determine the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Various concentrations of HQH were used to treat Jurkat and Nalm-6 cells for 24 to 72 hours. Subsequently, cells were co-treated with HQH and the glucocorticoid receptor agonist, dexamethasone (DEX), or a MEK inhibitor (PD98059) to verify the synergistic effects on apoptosis in Jurkat and Nalm-6 cells for 24 hours. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to measure cell viability and apoptosis, respectively. Protein and mRNA expression levels were assessed using western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS The results revealed that cell survival was reduced and apoptosis was increased as the HQH concentration was increased, and this was accompanied with increases in the levels of BAX, cleaved-caspase-3 and glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRalpha) and decreases in the levels of Bcl-2 and phospho-ERK (pERK). Glucocorticoid receptor ss (GRss) and total ERK (t-ERK) had no significant changes. Combined treatment with HQH and DEX or PD98059 increased apoptosis in Jurkat and Nalm-6 cells, and concurrently increased BAX, cleaved-caspase-3, GILZ, NFKBIA, and GRalpha and decreased Bcl-2 and pERK. CONCLUSIONS HQH enhanced the sensitivity of ALL cells to glucocorticoids by increasing the expression of GRalpha and inhibiting the MEK/ERK pathway, thus providing a rational foundation for the treatment of ALL with HQH.","['Xu, Wenfu', 'Wang, Zhujun', 'Li, Kun', 'Jin, Runming']","['Xu W', 'Wang Z', 'Li K', 'Jin R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (glucocorticoid receptor alpha)', '0 (huai qi huang)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2020/02/18 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['921649 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.921649 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 Feb 17;26:e921649. doi: 10.12659/MSM.921649.,,,,PMC7043341,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present the first retrospective analysis mapping its incidence and therapeutic outcomes in patients diagnosed and treated from 2000 to 2017 in the Czech Republic. The cohort comprised 14 patients (10 males, 4 females) with a median age at diagnosis of 39 years (range, 5-68 years). Initially, skin involvement was noted in 10 (71%) patients and bone marrow infiltration was present in 9 (64%). The first complete remission was achieved in 6/14 (43%) patients after acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma induction therapy and in 3/14 (21%) patients after acute myeloid leukemia regimen. Nine patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, with two patients achieving the first complete remission only after allogeneic transplantation. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation had longer overall survival than those treated without transplantation (the median survival over the period 16.4 vs. 8.1 months). Relapse of the disease was a significant predictor of mortality (p=0.05). Over the study period, patients' survival ranged from 3.3 to 44.2 months, with a median overall survival of 13 months. Our results revealed an effectivity of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation on complete remission achievement in refractory/relapsed disease.

We analysed the IGHV mutational status in 759 untreated CLL patients (cohort 1). BL-CLL (n = 36, 5%) showed a time to first treatment (TFT) similar to that of M-CLL (n = 338) and significantly longer than that of UM-CLL (n = 385), despite the enrichment in subset #2 cases. In fact, CLLs belonging to subset #2 (n = 15/759, 2%) were significantly more frequent among BL-CLLs (n = 5/36, 14%), with a brief TFT. TFT of BL-CLL remained comparable to that of M-CLL also considering the 327 CLL patients evaluated at diagnosis. These findings were then validated in an independent cohort 2 of 759 newly diagnosed CLL patients (BL-CLL: n = 11, 1.4%) and in all newly diagnosed patients from cohorts 1 and 2 (n = 1 086, 84% stage A; BL-CLL: n = 47, 4.3%). BL-CLL at diagnosis showed a biological profile comparable to that of M-CLL with a low frequency of unfavourable prognostic markers, except for a significant enrichment in subset #2. Our data suggest that the prognosis of BL-CLL is good and similar to that of M-CLL, with the exception of subset #2 cases.","['Raponi, Sara', 'Ilari, Caterina', 'Della Starza, Irene', 'Cappelli, Luca V', 'Cafforio, Luciana', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Arena, Valentina', 'Mariglia, Paola', 'Mauro, Francesca R', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Cutrona, Giovanna', 'Moia, Riccardo', 'Favini, Chiara', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Foa, Robin']","['Raponi S', 'Ilari C', 'Della Starza I', 'Cappelli LV', 'Cafforio L', 'Piciocchi A', 'Arena V', 'Mariglia P', 'Mauro FR', 'Gentile M', 'Cutrona G', 'Moia R', 'Favini C', 'Morabito F', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Guarini A', 'Del Giudice I', 'Foa R']","['Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology Unit, Department of Haemato-Oncology, Ospedale Annunziata, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Aprigliano, Biotechnology Research Unit, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Molecular Pathology Unit, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Aprigliano, Biotechnology Research Unit, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Haematology Department and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Cancer Care Center, Augusta Victoria Hospital, East Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Haematology, Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland and Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational Medicine, Amedeo Avogadro University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Haematology, Department of Translational and Precision Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200216,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', '*Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Time-to-Treatment']",2020/02/18 06:00,2021/01/28 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2019/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16434 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jun;189(5):853-859. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16434.

However it has a devastating affects on adults, where multi-agent chemotherapy is the standard of care with allogeneic stem cell transplantation for those who are eligible. New treatments are required to extend remission and prevent relapse to improve patient survival rates. We used serum profiling to compare samples from presentation adult B-ALL patients with age- and sex-matched healthy volunteer (HV) sera and identified 69 differentially recognised antigens (P </= 0.02). BMX, DCTPP1 and VGLL4 showed no differences in transcription between patients and healthy donors but were each found to be present at higher levels in B-ALL patient samples than HVs by ICC. BMX plays a crucial role in the Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) pathway which is bound by the BTK inhibitor, ibrutinib, suggesting adult B-ALL would also be a worthy target patient group for future clinical trials. We have shown the utility of proto-array analysis of B-ALL patient sera, predominantly from young adults, to help characterise the B-ALL immunome and identified a new target patient population for existing small molecule therapy.","['Jordaens, Stephanie', 'Cooksey, Leah', 'Bonney, Stephanie', 'Orchard, Laurence', 'Coutinho, Matthew', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Orchard, Kim', 'Guinn, Barbara-Ann']","['Jordaens S', 'Cooksey L', 'Bonney S', 'Orchard L', 'Coutinho M', 'Van Tendeloo V', 'Mills KI', 'Orchard K', 'Guinn BA']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, University of Antwerp, Antwerpen, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute, Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, University of Antwerp, Antwerpen, Belgium.', 'Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust and University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, UK.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Somers Cancer Sciences Building, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200216,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/18 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2019/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16407 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 May;189(3):500-512. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16407.

Height is largely determined by genetic factors, but how these genetic factors may contribute to NHL risk is unknown. We investigated the relationship between genetic determinants of height and NHL risk using data from eight genome-wide association studies (GWAS) comprising 10,629 NHL cases, including 3,857 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 2,847 follicular lymphoma (FL), 3,100 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 825 marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) cases, and 9,505 controls of European ancestry. We evaluated genetically predicted height by constructing polygenic risk scores using 833 height-associated SNPs. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for association between genetically determined height and the risk of four NHL subtypes in each GWAS and then used fixed-effect meta-analysis to combine subtype results across studies. We found suggestive evidence between taller genetically determined height and increased CLL risk (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.00-1.17, p = 0.049), which was slightly stronger among women (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.31, p = 0.036). No significant associations were observed with DLBCL, FL, or MZL. Our findings suggest that there may be some shared genetic factors between CLL and height, but other endogenous or environmental factors may underlie reported epidemiologic height associations with other subtypes.","['Moore, Amy', 'Kane, Eleanor', 'Wang, Zhaoming', 'Panagiotou, Orestis A', 'Teras, Lauren R', 'Monnereau, Alain', 'Wong Doo, Nicole', 'Machiela, Mitchell J', 'Skibola, Christine F',

A linear accelerator-based technique was used at our treatment centre between June, 2004 and August, 2015. Patients were treated supine with extended source-to-surface distance (SSD) lateral fields, and prescription dose was 12 Gy delivered in six fractions, two fractions per day. Dose was prescribed to midplane at the level of the umbilicus and monitor units were calculated manually based on measured beam data. Dose variation within 10% of the prescribed midplane dose is considered acceptable for TBI treatment. This was achieved in our clinic by using compensators to account for missing tissue in the head and neck and lower leg regions. Lung attenuators were routinely used to correct for internal inhomogeneity, which resulted from low density lung tissue. The purpose of this study was to determine whether dose variation was within acceptable limits for these patients as part of a quality assurance process. Following chart review, 129 patients who received six-fraction TBI from 2004 to 2015 were included in this study. Patients receiving single fraction treatment were excluded. Metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFET) dosimetry was used to measure surface dose at four or five locations during patients' first fraction of TBI. Dosimetry was repeated during the second fraction for any site with variation greater than 10%. Statistical analysis was carried out on patient data, diagnosis and dosimetry measurements. Of the 129 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 50 were diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, 30 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 11 with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The rest of the patients were diagnosed with lymphoma or myelodysplastic syndromes. The mean percent variation in dosimetry measurements taken at the specific locations ranged between 3.5% and 8.3%. The highest variation was found in measurements performed on the cheek. A high percentage of all dosimetry readings (85.5%) was within the acceptable range of +10% from the expected value. The highest number of individual readings taken at a specific location that fell outside this range were found at the cheek. We conclude that the linear accelerator delivered TBI at our centre meets the acceptable limits of dose variation over an 11-year period.","['Sengupta, Arpita', 'Wilke, Derek R', 'Cherpak, Amanda', 'Chytyk-Praznik, Krista', 'Schella, Jason', 'Yewondwossen, Mammo', 'Allan, James', 'Mulroy, Liam']","['Sengupta A', 'Wilke DR', 'Cherpak A', 'Chytyk-Praznik K', 'Schella J', 'Yewondwossen M', 'Allan J', 'Mulroy L']","['Radiation Oncology, Nova Scotia Cancer Centre, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, CAN.', 'Radiation Oncology, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University, Halifax, CAN.', 'Radiation Oncology, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University, Halifax, CAN.', 'Radiation Oncology, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University, Halifax, CAN.', 'Radiation Oncology, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University, Halifax, CAN.', 'Radiation Oncology, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University, Halifax, CAN.', 'Medical Physics, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University, Halifax, CAN.', 'Radiation Oncology, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Dalhousie University, Halifax, CAN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200206,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/02/18 06:01,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.6900 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Feb 6;12(2):e6900. doi: 10.7759/cureus.6900.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Sengupta et al.']",PMC7003717,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow transplantation', 'clinical dosimetry data', 'quality assurance', 'total body irradiation']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The condition often occurs in response to chemotherapeutic agents in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, cases of NEH are reported in patients with other malignancies and in those with non-malignant conditions. NEH is thought to result from the infiltration of neutrophils into the eccrine glands, resulting in erythematous papules and plaques on the skin. NEH is self-limiting and may resolve with cessation of the causative agent but can be treated symptomatically with steroids and analgesia. We report a case of NEH in a 52-year-old AML patient following the first cycle of chemotherapy. Following diagnosis, the patient was treated with a topical steroid and there was no recurrence. Alongside this, we uniquely present both clinical and histological images.","['Patel, Chantal', 'Jones, Elizabeth', 'Mudaliar, Vivek', 'Paul, Manju', 'Ismail, Amir']","['Patel C', 'Jones E', 'Mudaliar V', 'Paul M', 'Ismail A']","['Surgery, University Hospitals of North Midlands, Newcastle-under-Lyme, GBR.', 'Surgery, University Hospitals of North Midlands, Newcastle-under-Lyme, GBR.', 'Dermatopathology, University Hospitals of North Midlands, Newcastle-under-Lyme, GBR.', 'Dermatology, University Hospitals of North Midlands, Newcastle-under-Lyme, GBR.', 'Plastic Surgery, University Hospitals of North Midlands, Newcastle-under-Lyme, GBR.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200112,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/02/18 06:01,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.6635 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2020 Jan 12;12(1):e6635. doi: 10.7759/cureus.6635.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020, Patel et al.']",PMC7011575,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'eccrine squamous syringometaplasia', 'neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis']",,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inflammation in depression is a potential target for the development of novel treatment strategies. The present study presents a clinical case in which a patient with an underlying inflammatory condition acutely developed a severe depressive episode resulting in a sudden, dramatic change in their clinical picture. This case, with no similar case reports being in the literature thus far, at least to the best of our knowledge, highlights the increasing consideration that there may be a causative role between neuro-inflammation and depression. This study reports the case of a 40-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and no previous psychiatric history, who developed an acute onset of a severe depressive episode in the context of the immune-mediated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, which the patient had undergone, for the treatment of his ALL. The rapid onset of depression could be explained by the neuroinflammatory processes occurring in GVHD. This provides a clinical example for the possible role of the immune system in depression, and clinicians should be aware of this association.","['Tsamakis, Konstantinos', 'Mueller, Christoph', 'Tsirigotis, Panagiotis', 'Tsiptsios, Dimitrios', 'Tsamakis, Charalampos', 'Charakopoulos, Emmanouil', 'Charalampous, Chistophis', 'Spandidos, Demetrios A', 'Douzenis, Athanasios', 'Papageorgiou, Charalabos', 'Liappas, Ioannis', 'Rizos, Emmanouil']","['Tsamakis K', 'Mueller C', 'Tsirigotis P', 'Tsiptsios D', 'Tsamakis C', 'Charakopoulos E', 'Charalampous C', 'Spandidos DA', 'Douzenis A', 'Papageorgiou C', 'Liappas I', 'Rizos E']","[""Second Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University General Hospital 'Attikon', 12462 Athens, Greece."", ""King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London SE5 8AF, London, UK."", 'South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.', ""Haematology Clinic, School of Medicine, University General Hospital 'Attikon', 12462 Athens, Greece."", 'South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, Sunderland SR47TP, UK.', ""Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University General Hospital 'Attikon', 12462 Athens."", ""Second Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University General Hospital 'Attikon', 12462 Athens, Greece."", ""Second Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University General Hospital 'Attikon', 12462 Athens, Greece."", 'Laboratory of Clinical Virology, Medical School, University of Crete, 71003 Heraklion, Greece.', ""Second Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University General Hospital 'Attikon', 12462 Athens, Greece."", 'First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, 11528 Athens, Greece.', 'First Department of Psychiatry, Athens University Medical School, Eginition Hospital, 11528 Athens, Greece.', ""Second Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University General Hospital 'Attikon', 12462 Athens, Greece.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191219,England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,,2020/02/18 06:00,2020/02/18 06:01,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2019/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2019.1970 [doi]', 'MCO-0-0-1970 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2020 Mar;12(3):208-211. doi: 10.3892/mco.2019.1970.

Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major component of green tea, has been shown to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammation and anti-viral infection. In previous study, gallic acid (GA), a part of EGCG, has shown anti-allergic inflammatory effect. To improve on preliminary evidence that GA has allergy mitigating effect, we designed SG-SP1 based on GA, and aimed to assess the effects of SG-SP1 on mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation using various animal and in vitro models. Methods: For in vitro experiments, various types of IgE-stimulated mast cells (RBL-2H3: mast cell-like basophilic leukemia cells, and primary cultured peritoneal and bone marrow-derived mast cells) were used to determine the role of SG-SP1 (0.1-1 nM). Immunoglobulin (Ig) E-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and ovalbumin-induced systemic anaphylaxis, standard animal models for immediate-type hypersensitivity were also used. Results: For in vitro, SG-SP1 reduced degranulation of mast cells by down-regulating intracellular calcium levels in a concentration-dependent manner. SG-SP1 decreased expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines in activated mast cells. This suppressive effect was associated with inhibition of the phosphorylation of Lyn, Syk and Akt, and the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappaB. Due to the strong inhibitory effect of SG-SP1 on Lyn, the known upstream signaling to FcepsilonRI-dependent pathway, we confirmed the direct binding of SG-SP1 to FcepsilonRI, a high affinity IgE receptor by surface plasmon resonance experiment. Oral administration of SG-SP1 hindered allergic symptoms of both anaphylaxis models evidenced by reduction of hypothermia, serum IgE, ear thickness, and tissue pigmentation.

Therefore, the inactivation of beta-catenin in LSC may have a potential to eliminate the LSC. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of enhancement of the beta-catenin expression and subsequently used a drug to inactivate beta-catenin expression in T-ALL. Western blot (WB) analysis revealed an increased level of beta-catenin in the leukemic cells, but not in the pre-leukemic cells. Furthermore, the WB analysis of the thymic cells from different stages of leukemia development showed that increased expression of beta-catenin was not via the pS9-GSK3beta signaling, but was dependent on the pT308-Akt activation. Miltefosine (Hexadecylphosphocholine) is the first oral anti-Leishmania drug, which is a phospholipid agent and has been shown to inhibit the PI3K/Akt activity. Treatment of the Pten(Delta/Delta) leukemic mice with Miltefosine for different durations demonstrated that the pT308-Akt and the beta-catenin expressions were inhibited in the leukemia blast cells. Miltefosine treatment also suppressed the TGFbeta1/Smad3 signaling pathway. Analysis of TGFbeta1 in the sorted subpopulations of the blast cells showed that TGFbeta1 was secreted by the CD3(+)CD4(-) subpopulation and may exert effects on the subpopulations of both CD3(+)CD4(+) and CD3(+)CD4(-) leukemia blast cells. When a TGFbetaR1 inhibitor, SB431542 was injected into the Pten(Delta/Delta) leukemic mice, the Smad3 and beta-catenin expressions were down-regulated. On the basis of the results, we conclude that Miltefosine can suppress leukemia by degrading beta-catenin through repression of the pT308-Akt and TGFbeta1/Smad3 signaling pathways. This study demonstrates a possibility to inhibit Pten loss-associated leukemia genesis via targeting Akt and Smad3.","['Zhang, Yanmei', 'Lee, Sauhar', 'Xu, Wei']","['Zhang Y', 'Lee S', 'Xu W']","['School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', ""School of Biosciences, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Taylor's University, Lakeside Campus, Subang Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia."", 'ZJU-UoE Institute, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Haining, China.

COTI-2 also showed superior activity against tumor cells, in vitro and in vivo. As a high efficacy and low toxicity agent, it currently candidates in a phase I clinical study of gynecological malignancies and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, its effect in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is not clear. This study investigates the effect of COTI-2 on T-ALL Jurkat cells in vitro and in vivo. Jurkat cells were exposure to COTI-2 at different concentration and time. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry to examine the sensitivity of Jurkat cell lines treated with either COTI-2 alone or in combination with MiR-203 mimic or inhibitor in vitro. An orthotopic mouse model was used to examine the sensitivity of Jurkat cells treated with COTI-2 in vivo. Western blotting and RT-qPCR were performed to dissect molecular mechanisms. The results showed that COTI-2 promotes apoptosis of Jurkat cells in dose-and time-dependent way. Enforced expression of miR-203 promotes COTI-2-mediated cell apoptosis, whereas miR-203 silencing attenuates COTI-2-mediated cell apoptosis in Jurkat cells in vitro. COTI-2 is also effective against growth of Jurkat cells in vivo. Mechanistically, COTI-2 induced miR-203 upregulation and inhibited caspase-3/9 activaty leading to inhibition of cell apoptosis. Taken together, COTI-2 inhibits tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in Jurkat cells likely through miR-203-dependent mechanisms. COTI-2 may be a potential approach for T-ALL treatment.","['Guo, Yingmeng', 'Zhu, Xia', 'Sun, Xuerong']","['Guo Y', 'Zhu X', 'Sun X']","['Department of Pediatric Medicine, Linyi Central Hospital, Yishui, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Linyi Central Hospital, Yishui, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Clinical Laboratory, Qingdao Women and Children's Hospital, Qingdao, Shandong, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (COTI-2 compound)', '0 (MIRN203 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)']",IM,"['Aminoquinolines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Densitometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Thiosemicarbazones/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2020/02/18 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/18 06:00'],"['2020/02/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/21655979.2020.1729927 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioengineered. 2020 Dec;11(1):201-208. doi: 10.1080/21655979.2020.1729927.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-7312-3664', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2768-4740']",,,PMC7039633,,['NOTNLM'],"['*COTI-2', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*apoptosis', '*caspase-3/9', '*miR-203']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review summarizes the current standard of care of LGL leukemia, updates from clinical trials, and our congruent improved understanding of LGL pathogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: Various clinical reports have identified associations between stem, bone marrow, and solid organ transplants and incidence of LGL leukemia. There is also a potential for underdiagnosis of LGL leukemia within the rheumatoid arthritis patient population, emphasizing our need for continued study. Preliminary results from the BNZ-1 clinical trial, which targets IL-15 along with IL-2 and IL-9 signaling pathways, show some evidence of clinical response. With advances in our understanding of LGL pathogenesis from both the bench and the clinic, exciting avenues for investigations lie ahead for LGL leukemia.","['Cheon, HeeJin', 'Dziewulska, Karolina H', 'Moosic, Katharine B', 'Olson, Kristine C', 'Gru, Alejandro A', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Cheon H', 'Dziewulska KH', 'Moosic KB', 'Olson KC', 'Gru AA', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia Cancer Center, PO Box 800334, Charlottesville, VA, 22908-0334, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia Cancer Center, PO Box 800334, Charlottesville, VA, 22908-0334, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia Cancer Center, PO Box 800334, Charlottesville, VA, 22908-0334, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia Cancer Center, PO Box 800334, Charlottesville, VA, 22908-0334, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia Cancer Center, PO Box 800334, Charlottesville, VA, 22908-0334, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia Cancer Center, PO Box 800334, Charlottesville, VA, 22908-0334, USA.

Those patients with WT1 levels below ten copies have a good outcome. However, some of these patients relapse. To further characterize this group of cases, we applied a new and sensitive digital (ddPCR) WT1 method. A consecutive series of 49 patients with treated myeloid malignancies and with an ELN WT1 quantitation of < 10 copies were included in the study. All cases (47 AML and 2 MDS) have received intensive chemotherapy or HCT. One to four micrograms of total RNA were retrotranscribed to obtain >/= 10,000 ABL1 copies using the ELN protocol. Only those cases with a good quality cDNA were used in the ddPCR WT1 test. The ddPCR Gene Expression WT1 Assay of Bio-Rad(c) was used to perform the PCR amplification, and the microdroplets were quantified in the Bio-Rad's QX200 droplet reader. Eighteen patients showed a negative WT1 ddPCR assay (0 copies/mul), whereas 31 cases were positive (results ranged from 1 to 15.2 copies/mul). Survival analysis showed statistically significant differences in terms of OS between both groups, 83 +/- 8% vs. 46 +/- 9% (p = 0.024). A statistically significant correlation was also found between ddPCRWT1 results and CD123+ cell number detected by flow cytometry (p = 0.024).

BBR can induce apoptosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells through the MDM2/p53 pathway. However, the effects of BBR on those ALL patients with p53 deficiency remain unclear. RESULTS: We found that BBR reduced ALL cell viability and induced apoptosis in p53-null EU-4 and p53-mutant EU-6 cells by downregulating X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), which is increased in ALL tissues and cells. BBR-induced cell apoptosis was attenuated by inhibition of XIAP that was controlled by PIM-2. Mechanistic studies showed that BBR treatment induced an enhancement of miR-24-3p. PIM-2 is a direct target of miR-24-3p. Blockade of PIM-2 or miR-24-3p reversed BBR-induced cell apoptosis. In vivo studies, BBR remarkably alleviated leukemia conditions in a EU4 xenograft mouse model, whereas inhibition of miR-24-3p significantly reversed the effects of BBR in the leukemia condition. CONCLUSIONS: miR-24-3p/PIM-2/XIAP signaling contributes to BBR-mediated leukemia mitigation in p53-defect ALL, which should be further developed as a treatment strategy in ALL patients with p53 deficiency. METHODS: Cell viability and apoptosis were determined using CCK-8 and TUNEL assays, respectively. The dual-luciferase reporter gene system was used to determine the interaction between miR-24-3p and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of PIM-2.","['Liu, Jian', 'Chen, Zhiwei', 'Cui, Yunping', 'Wei, Huixia', 'Zhu, Zhenjing', 'Mao, Fengxia', 'Wang, Yingchao', 'Liu, Yufeng']","['Liu J', 'Chen Z', 'Cui Y', 'Wei H', 'Zhu Z', 'Mao F', 'Wang Y', 'Liu Y']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450052, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200213,United States,Aging (Albany NY),Aging,101508617,"['0 (MIRN24 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Berberine/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*metabolism']",2020/02/18 06:00,2021/02/20 06:00,['2020/02/17 06:00'],"['2019/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['102813 [pii]', '10.18632/aging.102813 [doi]']",ppublish,Aging (Albany NY). 2020 Feb 13;12(4):3298-3311. doi: 10.18632/aging.102813.

A reliable prognostic assessment is critical for treatment strategies. However, the current prognostic evaluation system of AML is insufficient. METHODS: Genome-wide univariate Cox regression analysis was performed on three independent AML datasets to screen for the prognostic-related genes. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to verify the efficacy of FHL1 in evaluating overall survival in 1298 de novo AML patients, 648 non-acute promyelocytic leukaemia AML patients and 407 cytogenetically normal AML patients; the data for some of these patients were also used for EFS and RFS validation. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to validate FHL1 as an independent prognostic indicator. WGCNA, GSEA, and gene correlation analysis were applied to explore the mechanism of FHL1 in AML. The synergistic cytocidal effect of FHL1 knockdown was verified in in vitro experiments. FINDINGS: Comprehensive genome-wide analyses and large-sample validation showed that FHL1 is a powerful prognostic candidate for overall survival, event-free survival, and relapse-free survival in AML and is independent of prognosis-related clinical factors and genetic abnormalities. The molecular mechanism may occur through regulation of FHL1 in leukaemia stem cells, tumour-associated signalling pathways, and transmembrane transport of chemotherapeutic drugs. FHL1-targeted intervention enhances the sensitivity of AML cells to cytarabine. INTERPRETATION: FHL1 may serve as an evaluation factor for clinical strategy selection, and its targeted intervention may be beneficial for chemotherapy in AML patients.","['Fu, Yue', 'Xu, Man', 'Cui, Zelong', 'Yang, Zongcheng', 'Zhang, Zhiyong', 'Yin, Xiaolin', 'Huang, Xiangnan', 'Zhou, Minran', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Fu Y', 'Xu M', 'Cui Z', 'Yang Z', 'Zhang Z', 'Yin X', 'Huang X', 'Zhou M', 'Wang X', 'Chen C']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; School of Medicine, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China; Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Immunohematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'School of Stomatology, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', ""School of Computer Science and Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao, Shandong, China; Fintech Institute of the People's Bank of China, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.

This study was performed through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database. We retrospectively reviewed all patients reported to the CIBMTR registry from 2002 to 2014 who underwent HCT for CML and were alive 30 days postrelapse. A total of 215 HCT recipients relapsed and were analyzed in the following groups: (1) TKI alone (n = 128), (2) TKI with DLI (n = 48), and (3) DLI without TKI (n = 39). In multivariate analysis, disease status prior to HCT had a significant effect on overall survival (OS). Patients who received a DLI alone compared with a TKI with a DLI had inferior survival (hazard ratio, 2.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.24; P= .009). Those who received a TKI alone had similar survival compared with those who received a TKI with a DLI (P = .81).

However, the role of the trans-regulation of 3' UTRs during heart dysfunction remains elusive. Compared with administration of angiogenic factor with G-patch and forkhead-associate domains 1 (Aggf1), ectopic expression of Aggf1 with its 3' UTR significantly suppressed cardiac dysfunction in angiotensin II-infused mice, with upregulated expression of both Aggf1 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1). Along their 3' UTRs, Mcl1 and Aggf1 mRNAs share binding sites for the same miRNAs, including miR-105, miR-101, and miR-93. We demonstrated that the protein-coding Mcl1 and Aggf1 mRNAs communicate and co-regulate each other's expression through competition for these three miRNAs that target both transcripts via their 3' UTRs. Our results indicate that Aggf1 3' UTR, as a trans-regulatory element, accelerates the cardioprotective role of Aggf1 in response to hypertensive conditions by elevating Mcl1 expression. Our work broadens the scope of gene therapy targets and provides a new insight into gene therapy strategies involving 3' UTRs.","['Ding, Lexi', 'Lu, Shan', 'Zhou, Yu', 'Lyu, Dayin', 'Ouyang, Changhan', 'Ma, Zejun', 'Lu, Qiulun']","['Ding L', 'Lu S', 'Zhou Y', 'Lyu D', 'Ouyang C', 'Ma Z', 'Lu Q']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Medicine, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Medicine, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Hubei Key Laboratory of Diabetes and Angiopathy, Hubei University of Science and Technology, Xianning 437100, China.', 'NHC Key Laboratory of Hormones and Development (Tianjin Medical University), Tianjin Key Laboratory of Metabolic Diseases, Tianjin Medical University Chu Hsien-I Memorial Hospital and Tianjin Institute of Endocrinology, Tianjin 300134, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Medicine, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.

Our previous studies revealed that silica dust exposure contributed to autophagy in pulmonary macrophages in vivo, while the specific regulatory mechanism is still unclear. This study aimed to figure out the regulatory mechanism as well as the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of experimental silicosis. We used 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and ABT-737 to suppress the expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), two critical initiators of autophagy, and detected and evaluated the autophagy in NR8383 cells with or without silica dust exposure. We found that exposure of silica dust increased autophagy in NR8383 cells and elevated the expression of Beclin1 and PIK3C3, but it reduced the expression of Bcl-2. The relationship among Beclin1, PIK3C3, and Bcl-2 were then investigated using immunoprecipitation analysis, and we found that suppression of PIK3C3 and/or Bcl-2 using 3-MA and/or ABT-737 could alter the autophagy induced by silica dust in NR8383 cells, and the complexes of Beclin1/PIK3C3 and Beclin1/Bcl-2 were both downregulated, which may be that inhibition of PIK3C3 and Bcl-2 altered the affinity of Beclin1 with PIK3C3 and Bcl-2 and lead to the silence of PIK3C3 signaling. These findings indicate that silica dust exposure induces autophagy via changing the connectivity of Beclin1 from Bcl-2 to PIK3C3.","['Yang, Pan', 'Song, Ruirui', 'Li, Ning', 'Sun, Kun', 'Shi, Fan', 'Liu, Heliang', 'Shen, Fuhai', 'Jiang, Shoufang', 'Zhang, Lin', 'Jin, Yulan']","['Yang P', 'Song R', 'Li N', 'Sun K', 'Shi F', 'Liu H', 'Shen F', 'Jiang S', 'Zhang L', 'Jin Y']","['School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'Health Education Department, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Tianjin, China.', 'School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Birth Regulation and Control Technology of National Health Commission of China, Shandong Provincial Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'School of Public Health, North China University of Science and Technology, Hebei, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200215,United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Bcl2 protein, rat)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Dust)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Air Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Beclin-1/*metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Dust/analysis', 'Humans', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Nitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon Dioxide/*toxicity', 'Silicosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology']",2020/02/16 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.22910 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2020 Jul;35(7):758-767. doi: 10.1002/tox.22910.

Termed NUT carcinomas (NCs), they were defined by a t(15;19) chromosomal rearrangement that was found to result in a BRD4-NUTM1 gene fusion. However, the use of DNA and RNA-based next-generation sequencing has recently revealed a multitude of new NUTM1 fusion partners in a diverse array of neoplasms including sarcoma-like tumors, poromas, and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) that we propose to call NUTM1-rearranged neoplasms (NRNs). Intriguingly, the nosology of NRNs often correlates with the functional classification of the fusion partner, suggesting different oncogenic mechanisms within each NRN division. Indeed, whereas NCs are characterized by their aggressiveness and intransigence to standard therapeutic measures, the more positive clinical outcomes seen in some sarcoma and ALL NRNs may reflect these mechanistic differences. Here we provide a broad overview of the molecular, nosological, and clinical features in these newly discovered neoplastic entities. We describe how aberrant expression of NUTM1 due to fusion with an N-terminal DNA/chromatin-binding protein can generate a potentially powerful chromatin modifier that can give rise to oncogenic transformation in numerous cellular contexts. We also conclude that classification, clinical behavior, and therapeutic options may be best defined by the NUTM1 fusion partner rather than by tumor morphology or immunohistochemical profile.","['McEvoy, Christopher R', 'Fox, Stephen B', 'Prall, Owen W J']","['McEvoy CR', 'Fox SB', 'Prall OWJ']","['Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200225,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (NUTM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Carcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Gene Fusion', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Sarcoma/*genetics/pathology']",2020/02/16 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22838 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2020 Jun;59(6):375-385. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22838.

Extracellular signals, released by cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME), including cancer cells themselves, as well as infiltrating immune cells, stromal cells, and other components of the extracellular matrix, all can contribute to reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor growth/survival. Most recently, attention has centered on contributions in the TME made by the pro-inflammatory interleukin 17 (IL-17) and the T cells (Th17) and non-T cells which produce this cytokine, as well as the target cells (IL-17 receptor positive, IL-17R(+)) signaled by IL-17. The IL-17 family itself comprises at least six members, IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (also called IL-25), and IL-17F, all of which are known to be secreted as disulfide-linked homo- or heterodimers. These in turn bind to IL-17R, a type I cell surface receptor, of which at least five variants have been described to date, IL-17RA to IL-17RE.

Since 2017, eight novel agents have been introduced, 6 of which are oral: midostaurin, enasidenib, ivosidenib, gilteritinib, glasdegib, and venetoclax. With an increase in oral medications (OMs), patients face associated side effects that accompany OMs, which often decreases adherence. We aimed to identify and summarize adherence to OMs in this population. METHODS: Our mixed method design used focus groups (FG) and patient surveys. After IRB approval, 11 patients and 4 caregivers participated in 4 FGs. Themes from the FGs were used to develop a 37-item OMs adherence needs assessment. Participants were recruited and consented at three cancer centers to complete surveys (online, at the clinic, hospital, or from home). RESULTS: A total of 100 patients completed OMs survey. The number of pills to be taken was the most frequent and troublesome challenge. The most frequently reported interventions that would improve patient adherence were smaller pills, easier packaging, and scheduling assistance. Nearly 33% of patients indicated they skip OMs dose altogether when they forget to take it. Younger patients (< 65 years) were more accepting of taking oral compared with intravenous medications (p = .03). CONCLUSION: This study represents the first assessment of OMs adherence in adults with AML. Findings provide the basis for further exploration of interventions to enhance and increase adherence to OMs regimens.","['Bryant, Ashley Leak', 'LeBlanc, Thomas W', 'Albrecht, Tara', 'Chan, Ya-Ning', 'Richardson, Jaime', 'Foster, Matthew', 'Dang, Malisa', 'Dudley, William', 'Owenby, Susie', 'Wujcik, Debra']","['Bryant AL', 'LeBlanc TW', 'Albrecht T', 'Chan YN', 'Richardson J', 'Foster M', 'Dang M', 'Dudley W', 'Owenby S', 'Wujcik D']","['The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Carrington Hall, CB #7460, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-7460, USA. ashley_bryant@unc.edu.', 'Medicine and Population Health, Duke University School of Medicine and the Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Duke University School of Nursing, Durham, NC, USA.', 'The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Carrington Hall, CB #7460, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-7460, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA.', 'Piedmont Research Strategies, Greensboro, NC, USA.', 'Carevive Systems, Inc., North Miami, FL, 33181, USA.', 'Carevive Systems, Inc., North Miami, FL, 33181, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200214,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Caregivers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Medication Adherence', 'Middle Aged']",2020/02/16 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-020-05349-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-020-05349-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2020 Nov;28(11):5157-5164. doi: 10.1007/s00520-020-05349-5.

Since no targeted therapy is available to restore p53 function, it is of great interest to test whether other pathways activated by TP53 mutations can be therapeutically targeted. Here, we showed HIF-1alpha target genes are enriched in TP53-mutated versus TP53-wild-type AML. To determine the role of this activation, we tested efficacy of HIF-1alpha inhibitor echinomycin in TP53-mutated AML samples in vitro and in vivo. Echinomycin was broadly effective against a panel of primary AML blast cells, with low nanomolar IC50s and, based on colony-forming unit assay, was tenfold more effective in eliminating AML stem cells. Echinomycin selectively eliminated CD34(+)CD38(-) AML cells. To test the therapeutic efficacy of echinomycin, we established a xenograft model of TP53-mutated AML. Echinomycin was broadly effective against xenografts from multiple AML samples in vivo, and more effective than cytarabine + daunorubicin chemotherapy. Importantly, while cytarabine + daunorubicin enriched for AML stem cells, echinomycin nearly eliminated this population. Using TP53-mutated AML cell line THP1 and patient-derived AML cells, we tested a new echinomycin formulation with longer half-life and significantly improved therapeutic effect. Our data suggest a novel approach to treat AML with TP53 mutations.","['Wang, Yin', 'Liu, Yan', 'Bailey, Christopher', 'Zhang, Huixia', 'He, Miao', 'Sun, Duxin', 'Zhang, Peng', 'Parkin, Brian', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Zheng, Pan', 'Malek, Sami N', 'Liu, Yang']","['Wang Y', 'Liu Y', 'Bailey C', 'Zhang H', 'He M', 'Sun D', 'Zhang P', 'Parkin B', 'Baer MR', 'Zheng P', 'Malek SN', 'Liu Y']","['Division of Immunotherapy, Institute of Human Virology, Department of Surgery and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA. yin.wang@ihv.umaryland.edu.', 'Division of Immunotherapy, Institute of Human Virology, Department of Surgery and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'Division of Immunotherapy, Institute of Human Virology, Department of Surgery and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'Graduate Program of Integrated Biomedical Research, George Washington University School of Medicine, Washington, DC, 20052, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, USA.', 'Division of Immunotherapy, Institute of Human Virology, Department of Surgery and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'Division of Immunotherapy, Institute of Human Virology, Department of Surgery and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA.', 'OncoImmune, Inc., Rockville, MD, 20853, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Immunotherapy, Institute of Human Virology, Department of Surgery and Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, 21201, USA. yaliu@ihv.umaryland.edu.', 'OncoImmune, Inc., Rockville, MD, 20853, USA. yaliu@ihv.umaryland.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200215,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '512-64-1 (Echinomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Echinomycin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2020/02/16 06:00,2020/11/21 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-1201-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-1201-z [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Apr;39(14):3015-3027. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-1201-z.

Many gene expression-based models of risk have been developed, but each model uses a different combination of genes and often involves assaying many genes making them difficult to implement. We organized the Multiple Myeloma DREAM Challenge, a crowdsourced effort to develop models of rapid progression in newly diagnosed myeloma patients and to benchmark these against previously published models. This effort lead to more robust predictors and found that incorporating specific demographic and clinical features improved gene expression-based models of high risk. Furthermore, post-challenge analysis identified a novel expression-based risk marker, PHF19, which has recently been found to have an important biological role in multiple myeloma. Lastly, we show that a simple four feature predictor composed of age, ISS, and expression of PHF19 and MMSET performs similarly to more complex models with many more gene expression features included.","['Mason, Mike J', 'Schinke, Carolina', 'Eng, Christine L P', 'Towfic, Fadi', 'Gruber, Fred', 'Dervan, Andrew', 'White, Brian S', 'Pratapa, Aditya', 'Guan, Yuanfang', 'Chen, Hongjie', 'Cui,

Fluidity in MPAL classification systems further complicates understanding its biology and outcomes; this includes uncertainty surrounding the impact of shifting diagnostic requirements even between iterations of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Our primary objective was to address these knowledge gaps. To do so, we analyzed clinicopathologic features, therapy, MRD, and survival in a centrally-reviewed, multicenter cohort of MPAL uniformly diagnosed by the WHO classification and treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) regimens. ALL induction therapy achieved an EOI MRD negative (<0.01%) remission in most patients (70%). EOI MRD positivity was predictive of 5-year EFS (HR = 6.00, p < 0.001) and OS (HR = 9.57, p = 0.003). Patients who cleared MRD by EOC had worse survival compared with those EOI MRD negative. In contrast to adults with MPAL, ALL therapy without transplantation was adequate to treat most pediatric patients. Earlier MRD clearance was associated with better treatment success and survival. Prospective trials are now necessary to validate and refine MRD thresholds within the pediatric MPAL population and to identify salvage strategies for those with poor predicted survival.","['Oberley, Matthew J', 'Raikar, Sunil S', 'Wertheim, Gerald B', 'Malvar, Jemily', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Punia, Jyotinder N', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Cahen, Viviane C', 'Schore, Reuven J', 'Luca, Dragos C', 'Guinipero, Terri', 'Woods, William G', ""O'Gorman, Maurice R G"", 'Orgel, Etan']","['Oberley MJ', 'Raikar SS', 'Wertheim GB', 'Malvar J', 'Sposto R', 'Rabin KR', 'Punia JN', 'Seif AE', 'Cahen VC', 'Schore RJ', 'Luca DC', 'Guinipero T', 'Woods WG', ""O'Gorman MRG"", 'Orgel E']","[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Caris Life Sciences, Irving, TX, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania & the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Department of Pathology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine & Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, USA."", ""Children's National Medical Center & George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA."", ""Children's National Medical Center & George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University & Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, GA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. eorgel@chla.usc.edu."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. eorgel@chla.usc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200214,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*mortality', 'Leukemia/classification/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/epidemiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology']",2020/02/16 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0741-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0741-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jul;34(7):1741-1750. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0741-0.

MEDI2228, more effectively than its anti-tubulin MMAF-ADC homolog, induces cytotoxicity against MM cells regardless of drug resistance, BCMA levels, p53 status, and the protection conferred by bone marrow stromal cells and IL-6. Distinctly, prior to apoptosis, MEDI2228 activates DDRs in MM cells via phosphorylation of ATM/ATR kinases, CHK1/2, CDK1/2, and H2AX, associated with expression of DDR-related genes. Significantly, MEDI2228 synergizes with DDR inhibitors (DDRi s) targeting ATM/ATR/WEE1 checkpoints to induce MM cell lethality. Moreover, suboptimal doses of MEDI2228 and bortezomib (btz) synergistically trigger apoptosis of even drug-resistant MM cells partly via modulation of RAD51 and accumulation of impaired DNA. Such combination further induces superior in vivo efficacy than monotherapy via increased nuclear gammaH2AX-expressing foci, irreversible DNA damages, and tumor cell death, leading to significantly prolonged host survival. These results indicate leveraging MEDI2228 with DDRi s or btz as novel combination strategies, further supporting ongoing clinical development of MEDI2228 in patients with relapsed and refractory MM.","['Xing, Lijie', 'Lin, Liang', 'Yu, Tengteng', 'Li, Yuyin', 'Cho, Shih-Feng', 'Liu, Jiye', 'Wen, Kenneth', 'Hsieh, Phillip A', 'Kinneer, Krista', 'Munshi, Nikhil', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Tai, Yu-Tzu']","['Xing L', 'Lin L', 'Yu T', 'Li Y', 'Cho SF', 'Liu J', 'Wen K', 'Hsieh PA', 'Kinneer K', 'Munshi N', 'Anderson KC', 'Tai YT']","['Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, 250021, Shandong, PR China.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'School of Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Key Lab of Industrial Fermentation Microbiology of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin, 300457, PR China.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Oncology Discovery, AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.

To overcome these hurdles, novel therapies need to be investigated. One promising target is Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a key regulator of the cell cycle. In this study, the Plk family expression is investigated in primary peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from ten pediatric B-ALL patients. For the first time, short interfering RiboNucleic Neutrals (siRNNs) that enter cells without a transfection reagent are used to target Plk1 mRNA in primary cells from pediatric B-ALL patients. Our results show that the expression of Plk1 and Plk4 is significantly higher in pediatric B-ALL patients compared to healthy donors. Moreover, treatment of primary peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from pediatric B-ALL patients, cultured ex vivo, with Plk1-targeting siRNNs results in cleavage of Plk1 mRNA. Importantly, the Plk1 knockdown is specific and does not affect other Plk members in contrast to many small molecule Plk1 inhibitors. Thus, Plk1 is a potential therapeutic target in pediatric B-ALL and selective targeting of Plk1 can be achieved by the use of siRNNs.","['Goroshchuk, Oksana', 'Vidarsdottir, Linda', 'Bjorklund, Ann-Charlotte', 'Hamil, Alexander S', 'Kolosenko, Iryna', 'Dowdy, Steven F', 'Palm-Apergi, Caroline']","['Goroshchuk O', 'Vidarsdottir L', 'Bjorklund AC', 'Hamil AS', 'Kolosenko I', 'Dowdy SF', 'Palm-Apergi C']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cellular & Molecular Medicine, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cellular & Molecular Medicine, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, California, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Research Center, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. caroline.palm.apergi@ki.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200214,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger']",2020/02/16 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59653-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59653-5 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 14;10(1):2688. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59653-5.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6027-1350'],['T32 CA067754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7021816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we examined the therapeutic effects of Tris DBA on glomerular cell proliferation, renal inflammation, and immune cells. Treatment of accelerated and severe lupus nephritis (ASLN) mice with Tris DBA resulted in improved renal function, albuminuria, and pathology, including measurements of glomerular cell proliferation, cellular crescents, neutrophils, fibrinoid necrosis, and tubulointerstitial inflammation in the kidneys as well as scoring for glomerulonephritis activity. The treated ASLN mice also showed significantly decreased glomerular IgG, IgM, and C3 deposits. Furthermore, the compound was able to 1) inhibit bone marrow-derived dendritic cell-mediated T cell functions and reduce serum anti-dsDNA autoantibody levels; 2) differentially regulate autophagy and both the priming and activation signals of the NLRP3 inflammasome; and 3) suppress the phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Tris DBA improved ASLN in mice through immunoregulation by blunting the MAPK (ERK, JNK)-mediated priming signal of the NLRP3 inflammasome and by regulating the autophagy/NLRP3 inflammasome axis. These results suggest that the pure compound may be a drug candidate for treating the accelerated and deteriorated type of lupus nephritis.","['Wu, Chung-Yao', 'Hua, Kuo-Feng', 'Chu, Ching-Liang', 'Yang, Shin-Ruen', 'Arbiser, Jack L', 'Yang, Sung-Sen', 'Lin, Yu-Chuan', 'Liu, Feng-Cheng', 'Yang, Shun-Min', 'Ka, Shuk-Man', 'Chen, Ann']","['Wu CY', 'Hua KF', 'Chu CL', 'Yang SR', 'Arbiser JL', 'Yang SS', 'Lin YC', 'Liu FC', 'Yang SM', 'Ka SM', 'Chen A']","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Animal Science, National Ilan University, Yilan, Taiwan 260.', 'Graduate Institute of Immunology, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan 106; shukmanka@gmail.com annchen31717@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114.', 'Department of Dermatology, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322.', 'Atlanta Veterans Administration Medical Center, Decatur, GA 30033.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114; shukmanka@gmail.com annchen31717@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114.', 'Division of Rheumatology/Immunology and Allergy, Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114.', 'Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan 114.', 'Graduate Institute of Aerospace and Undersea Medicine, Academy of Medicine, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114; and.', 'Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114; shukmanka@gmail.com annchen31717@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan 114.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200214,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (Nlrp3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Communication/drug effects/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammasomes/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Kidney Glomerulus/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lupus Nephritis/diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/*immunology']",2020/02/16 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801610 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801610 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2020 Mar 15;204(6):1448-1461. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801610.

DDX41/Abstrakt is a metazoan-specific spliceosomal DEAD-box RNA helicase that is recurrently mutated in inherited myelodysplastic syndromes and in relapsing cases of AML. The genetic properties and genomic impacts of disease-causing missense mutations in DDX41 and other spliceosomal proteins have been uncertain. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans DDX41 ortholog, SACY-1 Biochemical analyses defined SACY-1 as a component of the C. elegans spliceosome, and genetic analyses revealed synthetic lethal interactions with spliceosomal components. We used the auxin-inducible degradation system to analyze the consequence of SACY-1 depletion on the transcriptome using RNA sequencing. SACY-1 depletion impacts the transcriptome through splicing-dependent and splicing-independent mechanisms. Altered 3' splice site usage represents the predominant splicing defect observed upon SACY-1 depletion, consistent with a role for SACY-1 in the second step of splicing. Missplicing events appear more prevalent in the soma than the germline, suggesting that surveillance mechanisms protect the germline from aberrant splicing. The transcriptome changes observed after SACY-1 depletion suggest that disruption of the spliceosome induces a stress response, which could contribute to the cellular phenotypes conferred by sacy-1 mutant alleles. Multiple sacy-1 /ddx41 missense mutations, including the R525H human oncogenic variant, confer antimorphic activity, suggesting that their incorporation into the spliceosome is detrimental. Antagonistic variants that perturb the function of the spliceosome may be relevant to the disease-causing mutations, including DDX41, affecting highly conserved components of the spliceosome in humans.","['Tsukamoto, Tatsuya', 'Gearhart, Micah D', 'Kim, Seongseop', 'Mekonnen, Gemechu', 'Spike, Caroline A', 'Greenstein, David']","['Tsukamoto T', 'Gearhart MD', 'Kim S', 'Mekonnen G', 'Spike CA', 'Greenstein D']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455 green959@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200214,United States,Genetics,Genetics,0374636,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splice Sites)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SACY-1 protein, C elegans)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/*genetics', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'RNA Splice Sites', 'Spliceosomes/*genetics']",2020/02/16 06:00,2021/04/22 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['genetics.119.302973 [pii]', '10.1534/genetics.119.302973 [doi]']",ppublish,Genetics. 2020 Apr;214(4):869-893. doi: 10.1534/genetics.119.302973.

Currently available therapeutic options raise problems concerning the balance of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks. Our purpose is to characterize a series of cases of CVT and concomitant hematological malignancy, focusing on predisposing factors and treatment strategies. METHODS: We performed a descriptive retrospective analysis of the cases of CVT and hematological neoplasms diagnosed in a tertiary center from 2006 to 2015. RESULTS: From the 111 CVT cases diagnosed, only 7 coexisted with hematological malignancy (lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndromes). These included 4 women; median age was 44 years old. Median follow-up time was 72 days. The hematological condition was already known in 5 cases. Besides malignancy, we identified other prothrombotic conditions in all cases. Several anticoagulant strategies were used during the acute phase, after which 5 patients remained on warfarin indefinitely. One patient died due to cerebral hemorrhage during the acute phase. In the remaining 6 patients, there was no recurrence of CVT or other complications of anticoagulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although these results reiterate the role of hematological malignancy as predisposing factor to CVT, in all cases other factors contributed to CVT etiology, potentiating the risk. We report 1 death directly attributable to a fatal hemorrhagic complication of anticoagulation, evidencing the delicate balance of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk. Nevertheless, most patients benefited of long-term anticoagulation, which proved a reasonable option. A multidisciplinary approach is paramount in making decisions regarding the time and type of anticoagulation.","['Pinto, Maria Joao', 'Medeiros, Pedro Bettencourt', 'Principe, Fernando', 'Carvalho, Marta']","['Pinto MJ', 'Medeiros PB', 'Principe F', 'Carvalho M']","['Department of Neurology, Centro Hospitalar Universitario de Sao Joao, E.P.E., Porto, Portugal; Department of Clinical Neurosciences and Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.

Although it has been suggested that NPM1 mutation induces chemosensitivity in leukemic cells, the underlying cause for the better survival of NPM1 mutated patients is still not clear. Mutant NPM1 AML has a unique microRNA and their target gene (mRNA) signature compared to wild-type NPM1. Dynamic regulation of miRNA-mRNA has been reported to influence the prognostic outcome. In the present study, in silico expression data of miRNA and mRNA in AML patients was retrieved from genome data commons, and differentially expressed miRNA and mRNA among NPM1 mutated (n = 21) and NPM1 wild-type (n = 162) cases were identified to establish a dynamic association at the molecular level. In vitro experiments using high-throughput RNA sequencing were performed on human AML cells carrying NPM1 mutated and wild-type allele. The comparison of in vitro transcriptomics data with in silico miRNA-mRNA expression network data revealed downregulation of SMC1A. On establishing miRNA-mRNA interactive pairs, it has been observed that hsa-mir-215-5p (logFC: 0.957; p = 0.0189) is involved in the downregulation of SMC1A (logFC: -0.481; p = 0.0464) in NPM1 mutated AML. We demonstrated that transient expression of NPM1 mutation upregulates miR-215-5p, which results in downregulation of SMC1A. We have also shown using a rescue experiment that neutralizing miR-215-5p reverses the effect of NPM1 mutation on SMC1A. Using the leukemic blasts from AML patients, we observed higher expression of miR-215-5p and lower expression of SMC1A in NPM1 mutated patients compared to wild-type cases. The overall survival of AML patients was significantly inferior in SMC1A high expressers compared to low expressers (20.3% vs. 58.5%, p = 0.018). The data suggest that dynamic miR-215-SMC1A regulation is potentially modulated by NPM1 mutation, which might serve as an explanation for the better outcome in NPM1 mutated AML.","['Gadewal, Nikhil', 'Kumar, Rohit', 'Aher, Swapnil', 'Gardane, Anagha', 'Gaur, Tarang', 'Varma, Ashok K', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Hasan, Syed K']","['Gadewal N', 'Kumar R', 'Aher S', 'Gardane A', 'Gaur T', 'Varma AK', 'Khattry N', 'Hasan SK']","['Bioinformatics Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC)Navi MumbaiIndia.', 'Cell and Tumor Biology Group, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in CancerNavi MumbaiIndia.', 'Cell and Tumor Biology Group, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in CancerNavi MumbaiIndia.', 'Cell and Tumor Biology Group, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in CancerNavi MumbaiIndia.', 'Cell and Tumor Biology Group, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in CancerNavi MumbaiIndia.', 'Bioinformatics Centre, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer (ACTREC)Navi MumbaiIndia.', 'Adult Hemato-lymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial HospitalMumbaiIndia.', 'Cell and Tumor Biology Group, Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in CancerNavi MumbaiIndia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200214,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (structural maintenance of chromosome protein 1)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*genetics', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics']",2020/02/16 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/096504020X15816752427321 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Res. 2020 May 29;28(3):321-330. doi: 10.3727/096504020X15816752427321.

Although HTLV-2 is not usually pathogenic, it is widely distributed among native Indian populations in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon region of the country. Presently, HTLV spreads mainly by the sexual route and from mother to child, and virus persistence is an active biological factor aiding its transmission. Recently, the use of illicit drugs has been shown to be an additional risk factor, showing the influence of new habits on the epidemiology of HTLV in the region. Despite the detection of the virus in several different populations in the Amazon region of Brazil for almost 30 years, the exact prevalence of HTLV-1/2 is not well defined. The original biases in sampling and the selection of epidemiologically unsuitable populations were commonly repeated in most prevalence studies, generating unreliable and conflicting figures that do not represent the actual prevalence of HTLV. The improvements in clinical and laboratory facilities have resulted in the description of several clinical manifestations that were previously unknown in the region. The extent of the spread of the virus must be defined in this region, which is the largest geographical area of the country. As prophylaxis advances toward the use of vaccines against HTLV-1, it is important to determine who is at risk of being infected and developing a disease to successfully implement preventive measures, particularly as proposals are made to eradicate the virus among humans.","['Ishak, Ricardo', 'de Oliveira Guimaraes Ishak, Marluisa', 'Vallinoto, Antonio Carlos R']","['Ishak R', 'de Oliveira Guimaraes Ishak M', 'Vallinoto ACR']","['Laboratorio de Virologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Para, Rua Augusto Correa no.1, Belem, Para, 66075-110, Brazil. rishak@ufpa.br.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Para, Rua Augusto Correa no.1, Belem, Para, 66075-110, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Virologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal do Para, Rua Augusto Correa no.1, Belem, Para, 66075-110, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200214,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,,IM,"['Brazil/epidemiology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/prevention & control/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/classification/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Phylogeny', 'Prevalence']",2020/02/16 06:00,2021/03/11 06:00,['2020/02/16 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-020-0512-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-020-0512-z [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2020 Feb 14;17(1):4. doi: 10.1186/s12977-020-0512-z.,,,,PMC7023703,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Amazon region', '*Brazil', '*Epidemiology', '*HTLV-1/2', '*Prevalence']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data suggests a decrease in cancer cell proliferation occurring after exposure to normobaric hyperoxia. Those changes are associated with fractal dimension. The purpose of this research was to study the impact of hyperoxia on apoptosis and morphology of leukemia cell lines. Two hematopoietic lymphoid cancer cell lines (a T-lymphoblastoid line, JURKAT and a B lymphoid line, CCRF-SB) were tested under conditions of normobaric hyperoxia (FiO2 > 60%, +/- 18h) and compared to a standard group (FiO2 = 21%). We tested for apoptosis using a caspase-3 assay. Cell morphology was evaluated by cytospin, microphotography after coloration, and analysis by a fractal dimension calculation software. Our results showed that exposure of cell cultures to transient normobaric hyperoxia induced apoptosis (elevated caspase-3) as well as significant and precocious modifications in cell complexity, as highlighted by increased fractal dimensions in both cell lines. These features are associated with changes in structure (pycnotic nucleus and apoptosis) recorded by microscopic analysis. Such morphological alterations could be due to several molecular mechanisms and rearrangements in the cancer cell, leading to cell cycle inhibition and apoptosis as shown by caspase-3 activity.

The inhibition of the FGFR signaling pathway and activation of the WNT pathway by small molecule inhibitors (known as 2i) improves blastocyst development. However, studies on the effects of MLL1 combined with GSK3 and MAP2K inhibition (3i) on the development of embryos have not been reported. Our results show that 3i improves bovine and mouse IVF development only when added at the appropriate time point and affects ICM-related gene (OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG) expression in a concentration-dependent manner. 3i increases the expression of blastocyst-related genes such as PRDM14, KLF4 and KLF17 and decreases the expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferase genes DNMT3L and DNMT1 in bovines, but increases Prdm14, Stella, Klf2 and Klf4 expression and significantly decreases Dnmt3l, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt1 expression in mice. The analysis of transcription data showed that the expression of DNMTs increases slightly later than that of PRDM14 during embryo development, which indicates that PRDM14 is the upstream regulator. 3i upregulates PRDM14 and then downregulates DNMTs to affect IVF embryo development. When 3i-treated mouse embryos were transplanted, the morphology and body weight of the offspring were not significantly different from those of the control group. These offspring were as fertile as normal mice. 3i improves the development of bovine and mouse IVF embryos but does not affect the quality of the embryos. The application of 3i provides a new method for improving IVF embryo production in domestic animals.","['Han, Xuejie', 'Xiang, Jinzhu', 'Li, Chen', 'Wang, Jing', 'Wang, Chen', 'Zhang, Yuanyuan', 'Li, Zihong', 'Lu, Zhenyu', 'Yue, Yongli', 'Li, Xueling']","['Han X', 'Xiang J', 'Li C', 'Wang J', 'Wang C', 'Zhang Y', 'Li Z', 'Lu Z', 'Yue Y', 'Li X']","['State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestocks, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of addition of bortezomib to ATO in the treatment of relapsed APL based on our previously reported preclinical data demonstrating synergy between these agents. This was an open label, nonrandomized, phase II, single-center study. We enrolled 22 consecutive patients with relapsed APL. The median age was 26.5 years (interquartile range 17.5 to 41.5). The median time from initial diagnosis to relapse was 23.1 months (interquartile range 15.6 to 43.8). All patients achieved hematological remission at a median time of 45 days (range 40-63). Nineteen patients were in molecular remission at the end of induction. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in eight instances with one patient requiring discontinuation of therapy for grade 3 neuropathy. Twelve (54.5%) patients underwent autologous transplantation (auto-SCT) in molecular remission while the rest opted for maintenance therapy. The median follow-up was 48 months (range 28-56.3). Of the patients undergoing auto-SCT, all except one was alive and relapse free at last follow-up. Of the patients who opted for maintenance therapy, three developed a second relapse. For treatment of APL relapsing after upfront ATO therapy, addition of bortezomib to a standard ATO-based salvage regimen is safe and effective.

Current understanding of proteasome inhibitor resistance is limited to cell-autonomous mechanisms; whether non-autonomous mechanisms can be implicated in the development of proteasome inhibitor resistance is unclear. Here, we show that proteasome inhibitor tolerance can be transmitted non-autonomously through exosome-mediated intercellular interactions. We revealed that reversible proteasome inhibitor resistance can be transmitted from cells under therapy stress to naive sensitive cells through exosome-mediated cell cycle arrest and enhanced stemness in mixed-lineage leukemia cells. Integrated multi-omics analysis using the Tied Diffusion through Interacting Events algorithm identified several candidate exosomal proteins that may serve as predictors for proteasome inhibitor resistance and potential therapeutic targets for treating refractory mixed-lineage leukemia. Furthermore, inhibiting the secretion of exosomes is a promising strategy for reversing proteasome inhibitor resistance in vivo, which provides a novel proof of principle for the treatment of other refractory or relapsed cancers.","['Ge, Maolin', 'Qiao, Zhi', 'Kong, Yan', 'Lu, Hui', 'Liu, Han']","['Ge M', 'Qiao Z', 'Kong Y', 'Lu H', 'Liu H']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'SJTU-Yale Joint Center for Biostatistics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'SJTU-Yale Joint Center for Biostatistics, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui Jin Hospital, School of Medicine and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200310,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exosomes/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*drug effects', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14351 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2020 Apr;111(4):1279-1290. doi: 10.1111/cas.14351.

No data were available about the real-world burden of SHM. METHODS: All 2631 patients with CLL in the Cancer registry of Norway registered 2003-2012 were included. RESULTS: After median follow-up of 6.6 years, 103 patients (4%) developed SHM. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was most common (n = 65; 63%). Median survival was 9.3 years (95% CI; 8.9-9.8) in non-SHM patients and 1.7 years in DLBCL, 0.8 years in Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 12), and 2.8 years in myeloid neoplasia (n = 15; 95% CI: 0.3-2.6, 0.6-2.9, and 0.4-5.3, respectively; P < .001).

The Methods, Models, and Forecasts of Sepsis, 2012-2018.",302-318,10.1097/CCM.0000000000004225 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of sepsis, age, and comorbidities on death following an acute inpatient admission and to model and forecast inpatient and skilled nursing facility costs for Medicare beneficiaries during and subsequent to an acute inpatient sepsis admission. DESIGN: Analysis of paid Medicare claims via the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services DataLink Project (CMS) and leveraging the CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category risk adjustment model. SETTING: All U.S. acute care hospitals, excepting federal hospitals (Veterans Administration and Defense Health Agency). PATIENTS: All Part A/B (fee-for-service) Medicare beneficiaries with an acute inpatient admission in 2017 and who had no inpatient sepsis admission in the prior year. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Logistic regression models to determine covariate risk contribution to death following an acute inpatient admission; conventional regression to predict Medicare beneficiary sepsis costs. Using the Hierarchical Condition Category risk adjustment model to illuminate influence of illness on outcome of inpatient admissions, representative odds ratios (with 95% CIs) for death within 6 months of an admission (referenced to beneficiaries admitted but without the characteristic) are as follows: septic shock, 7.27 (7.19-7.35); metastatic cancer and acute leukemia (Hierarchical Condition Category 8), 6.76 (6.71-6.82); all sepsis, 2.63 (2.62-2.65); respiratory arrest (Hierarchical Condition Category 83), 2.55 (2.35-2.77); end-stage liver disease (Hierarchical Condition Category 27), 2.53 (2.49-2.56); and severe sepsis without shock, 2.48 (2.45-2.51). Models of the cost of sepsis care for Medicare beneficiaries forecast arise approximately 13% over 2 years owing the rising enrollments in Medicare offset by the cost of care per admission. CONCLUSIONS: A sepsis inpatient admission is associated with marked increase in risk of death that is comparable to the risks associated with inpatient admissions for other common and serious chronic illnesses. The aggregate costs of sepsis care for Medicare beneficiaries will continue to increase.","['Buchman, Timothy G', 'Simpson, Steven Q', 'Sciarretta, Kimberly L', 'Finne, Kristen P', 'Sowers, Nicole', 'Collier, Michael', 'Chavan, Saurabh', 'Oke, Ibijoke', 'Pennini, Meghan E', 'Santhosh, Aathira', 'Wax, Marie', 'Woodbury, Robyn', 'Chu, Steve', 'Merkeley, Tyler G', 'Disbrow, Gary L', 'Bright, Rick A', 'MaCurdy, Thomas E', 'Kelman, Jeffrey A']","['Buchman TG', 'Simpson SQ', 'Sciarretta KL', 'Finne KP', 'Sowers N', 'Collier M', 'Chavan S', 'Oke I', 'Pennini ME', 'Santhosh A', 'Wax M', 'Woodbury R', 'Chu S', 'Merkeley TG', 'Disbrow GL', 'Bright RA', 'MaCurdy TE', 'Kelman JA']","['Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Emory Critical Care Center, Emory University, Atlanta, GA.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas, Kansas City, KS.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Acumen, LLC, Burlingame, CA.', 'Acumen, LLC, Burlingame, CA.', 'Acumen, LLC, Burlingame, CA.', 'Acumen, LLC, Burlingame, CA.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Acumen, LLC, Burlingame, CA.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Baltimore, MD.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.', 'Acumen, LLC, Burlingame, CA.', 'Department of Economics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Hoover Institution, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S.', 'Comorbidity', 'Fee-for-Service Plans/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Expenditures/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Medicare/*statistics & numerical data', 'Medicare Part C/economics', 'Models, Statistical', 'Quality of Life', 'Sepsis/*mortality', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Shock, Septic/mortality', 'United States/epidemiology']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CCM.0000000000004225 [doi]', '00003246-202003000-00004 [pii]']",ppublish,Crit Care Med. 2020 Mar;48(3):302-318. doi: 10.1097/CCM.0000000000004225.,,,,PMC7017950,,,,['Crit Care Med. 2020 Mar;48(3):424-426.

The sub-classification of B-ALL is based on genomic architecture. Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of SNP-microarrays to detect genomic changes in B-ALL which cannot be observed by conventional cytogenetic methods. In current clinical trials, B-ALL patients at high risk of relapse are mainly identified by adverse cancer genomics and/or poor response to early therapy. To test the hypothesis that inclusion of SNP-microarrays in frontline diagnostics could more efficiently and accurately identify adverse genomic factors than conventional techniques, we evaluated the Australian high-risk B-ALL cohort enrolled on AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009 study (n=33). SNP-microarray analysis identified additional aberrations in 97% of patients (32/33) compared to conventional techniques. This changed the genomic risk category of 24% (8/33) of patients. Additionally, 27% (9/33) of patients exhibited a 'hyperdiploid' genome, which is generally associated with a good genomic risk and favourable outcomes. An enrichment of IKZF1 deletions was observed with one third of the cohort affected. Our findings suggest the current classification system could be improved and highlights the need to use more sensitive techniques such as SNP-microarray for cytogenomic risk stratification in B-ALL.","['Berry, Nadine K', 'Scott, Rodney J', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Law, Tamara', 'Trahair, Toby N', 'Dalla-Pozza, Luce', 'Ritchie, Petra', 'Barbaric, Draga', 'Enjeti, Anoop K']","['Berry NK', 'Scott RJ', 'Sutton R', 'Law T', 'Trahair TN', 'Dalla-Pozza L', 'Ritchie P', 'Barbaric D', 'Enjeti AK']","['Department of Haematology, Calvary Mater Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia; School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia; Department of Molecular Medicine, NSW Health Pathology-Hunter, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.

Some factors influencing the possibility of TFR have been described but better tools are needed for individual prediction of long-term TFR. Herein, two multiplex panels were utilised to analyse a total of 162 different plasma proteins from 56 patients included in the TKI stopping trial EURO-SKI (Saussele et al., 2018). The purpose was to identify possible plasma protein markers for prediction of successful TKI discontinuation and to evaluate effects of TKI discontinuation on plasma protein profiles. No protein biomarkers sampled before TKI discontinuation could separate relapse cases from non-relapse cases but some plasma proteins differed between patients who relapsed and those who remained in TFR when followed over time after TKI cessation. In conclusion, the plasma protein markers in this study could not predict relapse after TKI discontinuation but may be of use to understand the mechanisms involved in maintenance of TFR.","['Soderlund, Stina', 'Persson, Inger', 'Ilander, Mette', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Hjorth-Hansen, Henrik', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Richter, Johan', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla']","['Soderlund S', 'Persson I', 'Ilander M', 'Guilhot J', 'Hjorth-Hansen H', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Richter J', 'Saussele S', 'Mustjoki S', 'Olsson-Stromberg U']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; Section of Hematology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.

Following bsAb mediated engagement with target cells, T cells get activated and kill target cells while inducing cytokine release, which at higher levels may lead to life-threatening cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Clinical evidence suggests that CRS can be mitigated by implementing a stepwise dosing strategy. Here, we developed a mechanism-based minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (mPBPK/PD) model using reported preclinical and clinical data from blinatumomab. The mPBPK/PD model reasonably captured blinatumomab PK and B cell depletion profiles in blood and in various tissue sites of action (i.e., red marrow perivascular niche, spleen, and lymph nodes) in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using interleukin 6 (IL-6) as an example, our model quantitatively characterized the mitigation of cytokine release by a blinatumomab 5-15-60 microg/m(2)/day stepwise dosing regimen comparing to a 60 microg/m(2)/day flat dose in NHL patients. Furthermore, by only modifying the system parameters specific for ALL patients, the mPBPK/PD model successfully predicted the mitigation of IL-6 release by a blinatumomab 5-15 microg/m(2)/day stepwise dosing regimen comparing to a 15 microg/m(2)/day flat dose. Our work provided a case example to show how mPBPK/PD model can be used to support the discovery and clinical development of T cell-redirecting bsAbs.","['Jiang, Xiling', 'Chen, Xi', 'Jaiprasart, Pharavee', 'Carpenter, Thomas J', 'Zhou, Rebecca', 'Wang, Weirong']","['Jiang X', 'Chen X', 'Jaiprasart P', 'Carpenter TJ', 'Zhou R', 'Wang W']","['Janssen Research & Development Inc, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development Inc, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development Inc, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development Inc, Spring House, PA, USA.', 'Biology Department, Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, PA, USA.', 'Janssen Research & Development Inc, Spring House, PA, USA.

However, some cases are still at high risk of death, especially early death, and acquiring a better understanding of the clinical and biological factors involving APL is needed to correctly identify and treat such cases. The early suspected diagnosis and prompt initiation of the target therapy are important for better response rates. The follow-up and outcomes, using real-life data from 44 consecutive APL patients, were studied between 2001 and 2013. The overall survival rate was 82.7% and early death was 16%. Almost all patient deaths were due to severe bleeding, which was confirmed by multivariate analysis, as the most important prognostic factor leading to death.

DESIGN & METHODS: The study was conducted using a quasi-experimental method with a pretest-posttest control group design. The study sample was composed of children between 7 and 12 years old (N = 78) who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and were undergoing intrathecal chemotherapy in a hospital in Turkey. The study was conducted with children who received services at this hospital. The results were obtained from 74 children (i.e. 36 in the control group, 38 in the clown group). The data were collected with a questionnaire developed by the researchers, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the Faces Pain Rating Scale (FACES). VAS and FACES were used to measure pain and anxiety levels. Therapeutic clowning was applied to children in the intervention group. Analyses included percentage distributions, mean, chi-square, t-test, variance, and correlation analysis. RESULTS: Results showed that children in the clown group had significantly lower pain and anxiety than children in the control group (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: According to the results, therapeutic clowning was effective in relieving the pain and anxiety of children between the ages of 7 and 12 years who undergone intrathecal chemotherapy. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Due to its positive effects, therapeutic clowning could be explore for use in other areas of paediatric nursing for the children between the ages of 7 and 12 years as a complementary treatment.","['Kurudirek, Fatma', 'Arikan, Duygu']","['Kurudirek F', 'Arikan D']","['Department of Child Health and Diseases Nursing, Ataturk University Faculty of Nursing, Erzurum, Turkey.

To receive a dose of TNC >/=3.2 x 10(6)/kg or CD34+ cells >/=2.7 x 10(6)/kg significantly shortened the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment and reduced the blood product requirements in the 30-day period after transplantation. Overall, TNC and CD34+ cell doses had no effect on acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence, whereas patients receiving higher CD3+ and CD8+ cell doses seemed to have less chronic GVHD. No effect on non-relapse mortality, progression-free survival and overall survival was observed at different cell dose thresholds. These data suggest that in HLA haploidentical BM transplant with PT-CY, appropriate cell doses are relevant to the engraftment. The association between low CD3+/CD8+ cells and chronic GVHD deserves further investigation.","['Teofili, Luciana', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Valentini, Caterina Giovanna', 'Metafuni, Elisabetta', 'Bellesi, Silvia', 'Orlando, Nicoletta', 'Bianchi, Maria', 'Giammarco, Sabrina', 'Sica, Simona', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea']","['Teofili L', 'Chiusolo P', 'Valentini CG', 'Metafuni E', 'Bellesi S', 'Orlando N', 'Bianchi M', 'Giammarco S', 'Sica S', 'Bacigalupo A']","['Fondazione Policlinico A.

The importance of extra (trisomic) genetic material is emphasized in DS, with less emphasis to the allelic composition of candidate trisomic genes in defining the trisomic gene-phenotype relationship in DS. Allelic differences in non-trisomic genes have been shown to be important moderators of cardiac, leukemia, and developmental phenotypes associated with DS. Trisomic mouse models provide an in vivo genetic platform for examining the gene-phenotype relationship, including the influence of allelic variants, on DS-like phenotypes. DS mouse models have differing trisomic genetic makeup, and optimal development, viability and translational value of these mouse models may require a non-inbred genetic background with heterogeneity at many loci. Additionally, understanding the contribution of specific genes or regions to DS phenotypes often requires the utilization of genetically manipulated mice that may be established on a different inbred background than the trisomic mice. The impact of allelic differences of trisomic and background genes in human and model systems may offer insight into the variability in occurrence and severity of trisomic phenotypes.","['Roper, Randall J', 'Hawley, Laura', 'Goodlett, Charles R']","['Roper RJ', 'Hawley L', 'Goodlett CR']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, Indianapolis, IN, United States.

A substantial proportion of patients develop hypersensitivity reactions with anti-ASNase neutralising antibodies, resulting in allergic reactions or silent inactivation (SI), and characterised by inactivation and rapid clearance of ASNase. We report results of a prospective, real-time therapeutic drug monitoring of pegylated Escherichia coli (PEG-)ASNase and Erwinia ASNase in children treated for ALL and NHL in Belgium. Erwinia ASNase was given as second-line after hypersensitivity to PEG-ASNase. In total, 286 children were enrolled in the PEG-ASNase cohort. Allergy was seen in 11.2% and SI in 5.2% of patients. Of the 42 patients treated with Erwinia ASNase, 7.1% experienced allergy and 2.4% SI. The median trough PEG-ASNase activity was high in all patients without hypersensitivity. After Erwinia administration significantly more day 3 samples had activities <100 IU/l (62.5% vs. 10% at day 2 (D2)). The median D2 activity was significantly higher for intramuscular (IM; 347 IU/l) than for intravenous Erwinia administrations (159 IU/l). This prospective, multicentre study shows that monitoring of ASNase activity during treatment of children with ALL and NHL is feasible and informative. Treatment with Erwinia ASNase warrants close monitoring and optimally adherence to a 2-day interval of IM administrations.","['Mondelaers, Veerle', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Brichard, Benedicte', 'van der Werff Ten Bosch, Jutte', 'Norga, Koenraad', 'Francotte, Nadine', 'Piette, Caroline', 'Vandemeulebroecke, Katrien', 'Verbeke, Charlotte', 'Schmidt, Susanne', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Lammens, Tim', 'De Moerloose, Barbara']","['Mondelaers V', 'Ferster A', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Brichard B', 'van der Werff Ten Bosch J', 'Norga K', 'Francotte N', 'Piette C', 'Vandemeulebroecke K', 'Verbeke C', 'Schmidt S', 'Benoit Y', 'Lammens T', 'De Moerloose B']","['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Hopital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola (HUDERF-UKZKF), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc (UCL), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, CHC- Hospital of Hope, Montegnee, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, CHR Citadelle, Liege, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital and Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200214,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/*metabolism', 'Belgium', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erwinia/*metabolism', 'Escherichia coli', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",2020/02/15 06:00,2021/03/03 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16495 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Jul;190(1):105-114. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16495.

Recapitulating TLR stimulation in vitro by treating CLL cells with the TLR9 ligand CpG can induce metabolic activation and protection from apoptosis. We hypothesized that interfering with TLR signalling may be beneficial for treating CLL, and we tested in preclinical studies the effect of a specific interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) inhibitory small molecule on primary leukaemic cells isolated from the peripheral blood of patients. We observed that IRAK4, an upstream kinase of the TLR pathway, is expressed in patients with CLL, and lower IRAK4 mRNA levels associate with a better outcome. The specific IRAK4 inhibitor disrupted TLR signalling as assessed by reduction of the specific biomarkers NFKBIZ and interleukin-6 mRNAs, and restrained the protective effect of in vitro TLR stimulation on cell viability. To note, IRAK4 inhibitor induced p53 and triggered apoptosis. Co-treatment of CLL cells with increasing concentrations of IRAK4i and the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib demonstrated a synergistic effect. Our results suggest that targetting IRAK4 may represent a novel approach in CLL and may be combined with other signalling inhibitors.","['Delvecchio, Vincenza Simona', 'Sana, Ilenia', 'Mantione, Maria Elena', 'Vilia, Maria Giovanna', 'Ranghetti, Pamela', 'Rovida, Alessandra', 'Angelillo, Piera', 'Scarfo, Lydia', 'Ghia, Paolo', 'Muzio, Marta']","['Delvecchio VS', 'Sana I', 'Mantione ME', 'Vilia MG', 'Ranghetti P', 'Rovida A', 'Angelillo P', 'Scarfo L', 'Ghia P', 'Muzio M']","['Cell signalling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Cell signalling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'Cell signalling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Cell signalling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'B-Cell Neoplasia Unit and Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'B-Cell Neoplasia Unit and Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'B-Cell Neoplasia Unit and Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'B-Cell Neoplasia Unit and Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.', 'B-Cell Neoplasia Unit and Strategic Research Program on CLL, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Cell signalling Unit, Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200214,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*drug effects']",2020/02/15 06:00,2021/02/02 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16386 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 May;189(3):475-488. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16386.

It requires substantial time and specialized training. A dual-layer paper microfluidic chip was developed as a quicker, low-cost, and field-deployable alternative to detect ROR1+ (receptor tyrosine-like orphan receptor one) cancer cells from the undiluted and untreated buffy coat blood samples. The first capture layer consisted of a GF/D glass fiber substrate, preloaded with cancer specific anti-ROR1 conjugated fluorescent particles to its center for cancer cell capture and direct smartphone fluorescence imaging. The second flow layer was comprised of a grade 1 cellulose chromatography paper with wax-printed four channels for wicking and capillary flow-based detection. The flow velocity was used as measure of antigen concentration in the buffy coat sample. In this manner, intact cells and their antigens were separated and independently analyzed by both imaging and flow velocity analyses. A custom-made smartphone-based fluorescence microscope and automated image processing and particle counter software were developed to enumerate particles on paper, with the limit of detection of 1 cell/muL. Flow velocity analysis showed even greater sensitivity, with the limit of detection of 0.1 cells/muL in the first 6 s of assay. Comparison with capillary flow model revealed great alignment with experimental data and greater correlation to viscosity than interfacial tension.

The diagnostic workup of AL is based on several clinical and laboratory findings, including flow cytometric immunophenotyping. However, the role of this assay in the diagnosis of AL has not been systematically investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy and utility of flow cytometric immunophenotyping in the identification, characterization, and staging of AL. METHODS: We performed a systematic selection and classification of the literature since 1980, focused on flow cytometric immunophenotyping of AL. We applied a 6-variables model to cover both the technical capabilities and the clinical value of flow cytometric immunophenotyping in the diagnosis of AL. RESULTS: Using 3 key words (acute leukemia, immunophenotyping, flow cytometry), we screened the literature from January 1985 to April 2015 in PubMed and Embase databases and found 1010 articles. A total of 363 were selected and submitted to the expert panel, which selected a final data set of 248 articles to be analyzed.

A restrictive RBC transfusion approach is assumed to be safe for most individuals with AL. The aim of this audit was to assess RBC transfusion appropriateness in AL patients at an academic center. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: RBC transfusions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia patients of all ages between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019, were analyzed for adherence to evidence-based criteria. Transfusion appropriateness was compared among ordering specialties, patient locations, and hematologic diagnoses. Pretransfusion hemoglobin was compared between categories. Overtransfusion rates were also analyzed. Descriptive statistics and categorical and numerical tests were employed to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 510 RBC transfusions were received by 133 AL patients in the departments of internal medicine, hematology, and pediatrics. Overall, 84.5% were appropriate according to established criteria. Internal medicine was the ordering department with the highest rate of appropriateness (88.1%). The outpatient clinic was the location with the highest adherence (85.9%), whereas the intensive care unit had the lowest (70%; p = 0.03). The reasons for most appropriate and inappropriate transfusions were asymptomatic anemia with a hemoglobin below (60.6%) or above (69.6%) 7 g/dL in patients without cardiac disease, respectively. Overtransfusion was present in 22% of episodes. CONCLUSION: RBC transfusion in AL patients reflected good adherence to guidelines. However, continuing education in transfusion medicine and prospective chart auditing are needed to improve adherence to established guidelines.","['Jaime-Perez, Jose Carlos', 'Garcia-Salas, Gerardo', 'Ancer-Rodriguez, Jesus', 'Gomez-Almaguer, David']","['Jaime-Perez JC', 'Garcia-Salas G', 'Ancer-Rodriguez J', 'Gomez-Almaguer D']","['Department of Hematology, Facultad de Medicina y Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Facultad de Medicina y Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Pathology, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.', 'Department of Hematology, Facultad de Medicina y Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose Eleuterio Gonzalez, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Monterrey, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200214,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Anemia/blood', 'Erythrocyte Transfusion/*methods/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Guideline Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Heart Diseases/blood', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Tertiary Healthcare']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15700 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2020 Apr;60(4):724-730. doi: 10.1111/trf.15700.

However, only few studies to date have focused on bone marrow samples or a specific subtype of AML. In the present study, we used gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry of plasma and bone marrow supernatants to compare the metabolic characteristics of patients with AML with maturation (AML-M2). This approach identified significantly altered metabolites. We next performed pathway analysis and determined relative mRNA expression by qRT-PCR. Our results show that lysine, methionine and serine were significantly decreased in AML-M2 patients compared with healthy control. Moreover, plasma abundance of lysine was negatively associated with patients' risk stratification. Taurine had higher plasma abundance in AML-M2 patients and plasma level of taurine was positively related with AML-M2 risk status, while the expression level of taurine transporter showed a negative correlation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed these four metabolites had high diagnostic value with lysine showing the highest sensitivity and specificity. These results suggest that plasma abundances of lysine and taurine may serve as potential metabolic biomarkers for the prognosis of patients with AML-M2.","['Zhou, Xuan', 'Zheng, Meihong', 'Wang, Qien', 'Aa, Jiye', 'Cao, Bei', 'Li, Juan']","['Zhou X', 'Zheng M', 'Wang Q', 'Aa J', 'Cao B', 'Li J']","['Phase I Clinical Trials Unit, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Zhongshan Road 321#, Gulou district, Nanjing, 210008, China.', 'Phase I Clinical Trials Unit, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Zhongshan Road 321#, Gulou district, Nanjing, 210008, China.', 'Phase I Clinical Trials Unit, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Zhongshan Road 321#, Gulou district, Nanjing, 210008, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjia Avenue, Gulou District, Nanjing, 210008, China. jiyea@cpu.edu.cn.', 'Phase I Clinical Trials Unit, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Zhongshan Road 321#, Gulou district, Nanjing, 210008, China. cb_cpu@163.com.', 'Phase I Clinical Trials Unit, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Zhongshan Road 321#, Gulou district, Nanjing, 210008, China. juanli2003@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200213,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysine/*blood', 'Male', '*Metabolomics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Taurine/*blood', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/09/30 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-020-02836-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-020-02836-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2020 Jun;111(6):761-770. doi: 10.1007/s12185-020-02836-7.

Lurbinectedin, a selective inhibitor of active transcription of protein-coding genes, is currently in phase II/III clinical trials for solid tumors such as small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the activity of Lurbinectedin on circulating mononuclear cells from CLL patients and to determine whether Lurbinectedin could affect the cross-talk between B-CLL cells and the tumor microenvironment. We found that Lurbinectedin induced a dose- and time-dependent death in all cell types evaluated, with B cells, monocytes and monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (Mo-MDSC) being the most susceptible populations. At sub-apoptotic doses, Lurbinectedin decreased the expression of CCR7 in B-CLL cells and impaired their migration towards CCL19 and CCL21. Furthermore, low concentrations of Lurbinectedin stimulated the synthesis of pro-IL1beta in monocytes and nurse-like cells, without inducing the inflammasome activation. Altogether, these results indicate that Lurbinectedin might have antitumor activity in CLL due to its direct action on leukemic cells in combination with its effects on the tumor microenvironment. Our findings encourage further investigation of Lurbinectedin as a potential therapy for CLL.","['Risnik, Denise', 'Colado, Ana', 'Podaza, Enrique', 'Almejun, Maria Belen', 'Elias, Esteban Enrique', 'Bezares, Raimundo Fernando', 'Fernandez-Grecco, Horacio', 'Seija, Noe', 'Oppezzo, Pablo', 'Borge, Mercedes', 'Gamberale, Romina', 'Giordano, Mirta']","['Risnik D', 'Colado A', 'Podaza E', 'Almejun MB', 'Elias EE', 'Bezares RF', 'Fernandez-Grecco H', 'Seija N', 'Oppezzo P', 'Borge M', 'Gamberale R', 'Giordano M']","['Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina. risnikd@upmc.edu.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Agudos Dr. Teodoro Alvarez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Sanatorio Julio Mendez, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Leucemia Linfocitica Cronica, Institut Pasteur Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Laboratorio de Leucemia Linfocitica Cronica, Institut Pasteur Montevideo, Montevideo, Uruguay.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Inmunologia Oncologica, Instituto de Medicina Experimental (IMEX), CONICET-Academia Nacional de Medicina (ANM), Pacheco de Melo 3081, 1425, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200213,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (CCL19 protein, human)', '0 (CCL21 protein, human)', '0 (CCR7 protein, human)', '0 (Carbolines)', '0 (Chemokine CCL19)', '0 (Chemokine CCL21)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (PM 01183)', '0 (Receptors, CCR7)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Carbolines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Chemokine CCL19/immunology/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL21/immunology/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/immunology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Receptors, CCR7/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*drug effects/immunology']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/05/10 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-020-02513-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-020-02513-y [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2020 May;69(5):813-824. doi: 10.1007/s00262-020-02513-y.

Somatic point mutations in IDH1/2 that are found in rare distinct subsets of cancers confer a gain of function in cancer cells which results in the accumulation and secretion in vast excess of the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). Overproduction of D-2HG interferes with cellular metabolism and epigenetic regulation, contributing to oncogenesis. High levels of D-2HG inhibit alphaKG-dependent dioxygenases including histone, DNA and RNA demethylases, resulting in histone, DNA and RNA hypermethylation and cell differentiation blockade. In addition, D-2HG is a biomarker suitable for the detection of IDH1/2 mutations at diagnosis, and is also predictive of clinical response. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ivosidenib, a mutant-IDH1 enzyme inhibitor, for patients with relapsed or refractory IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 2018, and also as front-line therapy for newly diagnosed elderly patients 75 years or older or who are ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy in 2019.

The fusion of PML and RARalpha genes is responsible for over 98% of cases of APL. In this work, we found that a Ru(ii) arene complex, [(eta(6)-p-bip)Ru(en)Cl][PF6] (Ru-1), can selectively react with PML, leading to zinc-release and protein unfolding. Consequently, the degradation of the fusion protein PML-RARalpha occurs, which causes the differentiation of APL cells. In addition, Ru-1 can also bind to DNA and trigger apoptosis of APL cells. Therefore, Ru-1 acts as a dual functional agent that inhibits the growth of APL cells and induces cell differentiation. In contrast, the other non-selective Ru(ii) compound, though also highly reactive to PML, does not exhibit anti-APL activity. The selectivity of Ru-1 to PML suggests a new strategy for the development of anti-APL drugs using ruthenium agents.","['Huang, Hai', 'Cao, Kaiming', 'Kong, Yaqiong', 'Yuan, Siming', 'Liu, Hongke', 'Wang, Yucai', 'Liu, Yangzhong']","['Huang H', 'Cao K', 'Kong Y', 'Yuan S', 'Liu H', 'Wang Y', 'Liu Y']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Soft Matter Chemistry , Department of Chemistry , University of Science and Technology of China , Hefei , Anhui 230026 , China .

A previous model estimated the potential cost-savings over the next 2 years after the loss of patent exclusivity for imatinib in the United States in 2016 and its availability in a generic form. Payers have indeed realized meaningful savings, but it took 2 years for the prices of generic imatinib to decline substantially. Objective: To quantify the cost-savings for a US health plan from the passive substitution of generic imatinib and the impact of step-edit therapy with the use of generic imatinib before coverage of a second-generation TKI. Methods: We updated the previously published model utilizing hypothetical 1-million-member commercial and Medicare plans to include current TKI use and pricing combined with recent epidemiologic data. Regression models were used to project utilization to 5 years after the loss of imatinib's patent exclusivity. We compared generic imatinib costs with a scenario in which generic imatinib was not available. The impact of a step-edit therapy restriction was explored for patients with incident CML. The analyses were repeated for the entire US population based on national census data. Results: The 1-million-member commercial plan saved $0.5 million (3%) from pharmacy spending on TKIs in year 1 and $3.9 million (19%) in year 2 after the loss of patent exclusivity. The projected savings significantly increased to $7.8 million (37%), $8.3 million (39%), and $8.6 million (40%) in years 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Step-edits strategies were projected to result in small incremental savings of $0.3 million (1.5%) annually in years 3 to 5. The 1-million-member Medicare plan saved $1.7 million (3%) in year 1 and $14.1 million (19%) in year 2. The projected savings were $27.8 million (37%), $29.5 million (39%), and $30.8 million (40%), with step-edit estimated to add only $0.9 million (1.2%) annually in years 3 to 5. Generic imatinib saved US payers $2.5 billion (13% of the total spending on TKIs) in years 1 and 2. In years 3 to 5, the cumulative projected savings totaled $12.2 billion, and the savings were expected to grow to 39% as a result of passive generic imatinib substitution, with only 1.7% additional savings from step-edit restriction. Conclusions: As a result of a lower price for generic imatinib relative to the brand-name version of the drug, substantial cost-savings to US payers over the next 3 years are expected without step-edit formulary management restrictions. Cost-saving strategies, including formulary management restrictions, should adhere to evidence-based guidelines to ensure the appropriate use of generic imatinib and all available TKIs, with the objective to maintain positive outcomes and, in turn, increase the value of patient care.","['Campbell, David', 'Blazer, Marlo', 'Bloudek, Lisa', 'Brokars, John', 'Makenbaeva, Dinara']","['Campbell D', 'Blazer M', 'Bloudek L', 'Brokars J', 'Makenbaeva D']","['Assistant Director, Scientific Consulting, Scientific Consulting, Xcenda, Palm Harbor, FL.', 'Associate Director, Scientific Consulting, Xcenda, Palm Harbor, FL.', 'President, Curta, Seattle, WA.', 'Health Outcomes Research Director, Worldwide Health Economics and Outcomes Research Communications Lead, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.', 'Group Director, Worldwide Health Economics and Outcomes Research Communications Lead, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am Health Drug Benefits,American health & drug benefits,101479877,,,,2020/02/15 06:00,2020/02/15 06:01,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Am Health Drug Benefits. 2019 Nov;12(7):333-342.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2019 by Engage Healthcare Communications, LLC.']",PMC6996618,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)', 'cost-savings', 'formulary management', 'generic imatinib', 'pharmacy spending', 'prior authorization', 'step-edits', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EIF3B expression was detected in AML-193, HL-60, OCI-AML2, and KG-1 cell lines and human primary bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC). EIF3B knockdown was realized by transfecting EIF3B ShRNA plasmids, and EIF3B knockdown and WNT2 overexpression were established by transfecting EIF3B ShRNA plasmids and WNT2 overexpression plasmids into KG-1 cells. The effect of EIF3B knockdown, and EIF3B knockdown plus WNT2 overexpression on cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B) and catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1) was assessed. EIF3B mRNA and protein expression were higher in AML-193, OCL-AML2 and KG-1 cell lines, but unchanged in the HL-60 cell line compared with human primary BMMC. The expression of WNT2 was decreased by EIF3B downregulation, while it had no effect on EIF3B expression. As for cell activities, EIF3B knockdown inhibited the cell proliferation and migration but promoted apoptosis by inhibiting WNT2 expression. In addition, EIF3B knockdown downregulated the expression of CTNNB1 but upregulated the expression of GSK3B by blocking WNT2 expression in AML, implying an inhibitory effect of EIF3B downregulation on WNT signaling pathway. EIF3B is upregulated and its knockdown inhibits cell proliferation, and migration, while promoting apoptosis by downregulating the WNT signaling pathway in AML.","['Feng, Yonghuai', 'Wu, Liusong']","['Feng Y', 'Wu L']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University Guizhou, China.', 'The Second Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University Guizhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200101,United States,Int J Clin Exp Pathol,International journal of clinical and experimental pathology,101480565,,,,2020/02/15 06:00,2020/02/15 06:01,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Int J Clin Exp Pathol. 2020 Jan 1;13(1):99-106. eCollection 2020.,,,['IJCEP Copyright (c) 2020.'],PMC7013369,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'EIF3B', 'WNT signaling pathway', 'apoptosis', 'migration', 'proliferation']",,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human genome contains around 100 integrated copies (called proviruses or loci) of the HERV-K(HML-2) virus and we argue that it is important for therapy development to know which and how many of these contribute to protein expression, and how this varies across tissues. We measured relative provirus expression in HERV-K(HML-2), using enriched RNA-Seq analysis with both short- and long-read sequencing, in three Mantle Cell Lymphoma cell lines (JVM2, Granta519 and REC1). We also confirmed expression of the Env protein in two of our cell lines using Western blotting, and analysed provirus expression data from all other relevant published studies. Results: Firstly, in both our and other reanalysed studies, approximately 10% of the transcripts mapping to HERV-K(HML-2) came from Env-encoding proviruses. Secondly, in one cell line the majority of the protein expression appears to come from one provirus (12q14.1). Thirdly, we find a strong tissue-specific pattern of provirus expression. Conclusions: A possible dependency of Env expression on a single provirus, combined with the earlier observation that this provirus is not present in all individuals and a general pattern of tissue-specific expression among proviruses, has serious implications for future HERV-K(HML-2)-targeted immunotherapy. Further research into HERV-K(HML-2) as a possible tumour-associated antigen in blood cancers requires a more targeted, proteome-based, screening protocol that will consider these polymorphisms within HERV-K(HML-2). We include a plan (and necessary alignments) for such work.","['Tatkiewicz, Witold', 'Dickie, James', 'Bedford, Franchesca', 'Jones, Alexander', 'Atkin, Mark', 'Kiernan, Michele', 'Maze, Emmanuel Atangana', 'Agit, Bora', 'Farnham, Garry', 'Kanapin, Alexander', 'Belshaw, Robert']","['Tatkiewicz W', 'Dickie J', 'Bedford F', 'Jones A', 'Atkin M', 'Kiernan M', 'Maze EA', 'Agit B', 'Farnham G', 'Kanapin A', 'Belshaw R']","['1Peninsula Medical School, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '1Peninsula Medical School, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747', '3Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.grid.4991.50000 0004 1936 8948', '4Current address: Institute of Translational Biomedicine, Saint Petersburg State University, Saint Petersburg, Russia.grid.15447.330000 0001 2289 6897', '2School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health: Medicine, Dentistry and Human Sciences, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UK.grid.11201.330000 0001 2219 0747']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200207,England,Mob DNA,Mobile DNA,101519891,,,,2020/02/15 06:00,2020/02/15 06:01,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13100-020-0204-1 [doi]', '204 [pii]']",epublish,Mob DNA. 2020 Feb 7;11:9. doi: 10.1186/s13100-020-0204-1. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-6234-3947'],,['(c) The Author(s). 2020.'],PMC7007669,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer immunotherapy', 'HERV-K', 'HERV-K(HML-2)', 'Leukemia', 'NGS', 'RNA-Seq', 'Transcriptomics', 'Transposable element', 'minION']",,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],['Mob DNA. 2020 Nov 30;11(1):31.

Furthermore, these treatments can have notable morbidity and are not uniformly tolerated in all patients. As there is no cure for MM, patients eventually become resistant to therapies, leading to development of relapsed/refractory MM. Therefore, an unmet need exists for MM treatments with novel mechanisms of action that can provide durable responses, evade resistance to prior therapies, and/or are better tolerated. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is preferentially expressed by mature B lymphocytes, and its overexpression and activation are associated with MM in preclinical models and humans, supporting its potential utility as a therapeutic target for MM. Moreover, the use of BCMA as a biomarker for MM is supported by its prognostic value, correlation with clinical status, and its ability to be used in traditionally difficult-to-monitor patient populations. Here, we review three common treatment modalities used to target BCMA in the treatment of MM: bispecific antibody constructs, antibody-drug conjugates, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T-cell therapy. We provide an overview of preliminary clinical data from trials using these therapies, including the BiTE(R) (bispecific T-cell engager) immuno-oncology therapy AMG 420, the antibody-drug conjugate GSK2857916, and several CAR T-cell therapeutic agents including bb2121, NIH CAR-BCMA, and LCAR-B38M. Notable antimyeloma activity and high minimal residual disease negativity rates have been observed with several of these treatments. These clinical data outline the potential for BCMA-targeted therapies to improve the treatment landscape for MM. Importantly, clinical results to date suggest that these therapies may hold promise for deep and durable responses and support further investigation in earlier lines of treatment, including newly diagnosed MM.","['Shah, Nina', 'Chari, Ajai', 'Scott, Emma', 'Mezzi, Khalid', 'Usmani, Saad Z']","['Shah N', 'Chari A', 'Scott E', 'Mezzi K', 'Usmani SZ']","['University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA. nina.shah@ucsf.edu.', 'Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, NY, USA.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Portland, OR, USA.', 'Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Atrium Health, Charlotte, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200213,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (TNFRSF17 protein, human)', 'DB1041CXDG (belantamab mafodotin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Cell Maturation Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0734-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0734-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Apr;34(4):985-1005. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0734-z.

Traditional methods such as karyotyping and FISH struggle to accurately identify and phase such large-scale chromosomal aberrations in ALL genomes. We therefore evaluated linked-read WGS for detecting chromosomal rearrangements in primary samples of from 12 patients diagnosed with ALL. We assessed the effect of input DNA quality on phased haplotype block size and the detectability of copy number aberrations and structural variants in the ALL genomes. We found that biobanked DNA isolated by standard column-based extraction methods was sufficient to detect chromosomal rearrangements even at low 10x sequencing coverage. Linked-read WGS enabled precise, allele-specific, digital karyotyping at a base-pair resolution for a wide range of structural variants including complex rearrangements and aneuploidy assessment. With use of haplotype information from the linked-reads, we also identified previously unknown structural variants, such as a compound heterozygous deletion of ERG in a patient with the DUX4-IGH fusion gene. We conclude that linked-read WGS allows detection of important pathogenic variants in ALL genomes at a resolution beyond that of traditional karyotyping and FISH.","['Nordlund, Jessica', 'Marincevic-Zuniga, Yanara', 'Cavelier, Lucia', 'Raine, Amanda', 'Martin, Tom', 'Lundmark, Anders', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Noren-Nystrom, Ulrika', 'Lonnerholm, Gudmar', 'Syvanen, Ann-Christine']","['Nordlund J', 'Marincevic-Zuniga Y', 'Cavelier L', 'Raine A', 'Martin T', 'Lundmark A', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Noren-Nystrom U', 'Lonnerholm G', 'Syvanen AC']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. jessica.nordlund@medsci.uu.se.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Pediatrics, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Oncology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Medical Sciences, Molecular Medicine and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200213,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Dosage', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59214-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59214-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 13;10(1):2512. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59214-w.,,,,PMC7018692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) present the current state-of-the-art for this type of image classification, but their computational cost for training and deployment can be high. We here present an improved hybrid approach for efficient classification of WBC Leukemia. We first extract features from WBC images using VGGNet, a powerful CNN architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet. The extracted features are then filtered using a statistically enhanced Salp Swarm Algorithm (SESSA). This bio-inspired optimization algorithm selects the most relevant features and removes highly correlated and noisy features. We applied the proposed approach to two public WBC Leukemia reference datasets and achieve both high accuracy and reduced computational complexity. The SESSA optimization selected only 1 K out of 25 K features extracted with VGGNet, while improving accuracy at the same time. The results are among the best achieved on these datasets and outperform several convolutional network models. We expect that the combination of CNN feature extraction and SESSA feature optimization could be useful for many other image classification tasks.","['Sahlol, Ahmed T', 'Kollmannsberger, Philip', 'Ewees, Ahmed A']","['Sahlol AT', 'Kollmannsberger P', 'Ewees AA']","['Computer Department, Damietta University, Damietta, Egypt.', 'Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Center for Computational and Theoretical Biology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany. philip.kollmannsberger@uni-wuerzburg.de.', 'Computer Department, Damietta University, Damietta, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200213,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Bone Marrow/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia/blood/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*pathology', '*Machine Learning', 'Neural Networks, Computer']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59215-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59215-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 13;10(1):2536. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59215-9.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8049-6186'],,,PMC7018965,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) enrolled in a phase II clinical trial (NCT02337829) with the covalent, selective BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib donated blood samples for pharmacodynamic analyses. Study design included randomization to acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily or 200 mg once daily and dose interruptions on day 4 and 5 of the first week. BTK occupancy and readouts of intracellular signaling were assessed sequentially between 4 and 48 hours from last dose. RESULTS: Four hours from last dose, BTK occupancy exceeded 96% and at trough, was higher with twice daily, median 95.3%, than with once daily dosing, median 87.6% (P < 0.0001). By 48 hours from last dose, median free BTK increased to 25.6%. Due to covalent binding of acalabrutinib, free BTK is generated by de novo synthesis. The estimated rate of BTK synthesis varied widely between patients ranging from 3.6% to 31.4% per day. Acalabrutinib reduced phosphorylation of BTK and inhibited downstream B-cell receptor (BCR) and NFkappaB signaling. During dosing interruptions up to 48 hours, expression of BCR target genes rebounded, while phosphorylation of signaling molecules remained repressed. In vitro cross-linking of IgM on CLL cells obtained 36 to 48 hours from last dose upregulated CD69, with high correlation between cellular free BTK and response (R = 0.7, P </= 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher BTK occupancy was achieved with twice daily over once daily dosing, resulting in deeper and more sustained inhibition of BCR signaling.","['Alsadhan, Anfal', 'Cheung, Jean', 'Gulrajani, Michael', 'Gaglione, Erika M', 'Nierman, Pia', 'Hamdy, Ahmed', 'Izumi, Raquel', 'Bibikova, Elena', 'Patel, Priti', 'Sun, Clare', 'Covey, Todd', 'Herman, Sarah E M', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Alsadhan A', 'Cheung J', 'Gulrajani M', 'Gaglione EM', 'Nierman P', 'Hamdy A', 'Izumi R', 'Bibikova E', 'Patel P', 'Sun C', 'Covey T', 'Herman SEM', 'Wiestner A']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C.', 'Acerta Pharma, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, South San Francisco, California.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Acerta Pharma, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, South San Francisco, California.', 'Acerta Pharma, South San Francisco, California.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Acerta Pharma, South San Francisco, California.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland. wiestnea@nhlbi.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200213,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Pyrazines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use']",2020/02/15 06:00,2021/09/14 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/14 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-3505 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3505 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 Jun 15;26(12):2800-2809. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3505.

Leukemic cell survival and treatment resistance have been attributed to the overexpression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and aberrant DNA hypermethylation. In a phase Ib study in elderly patients with AML, combining the BCL-2 selective inhibitor venetoclax with hypomethylating agents 5-azacitidine (5-Aza) or decitabine resulted in 67% overall response rate; however, the underlying mechanism for this activity is unknown. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied the consequences of combining two therapeutic agents, venetoclax and 5-Aza, in AML preclinical models and primary patient samples. We measured expression changes in the integrated stress response (ISR) and the BCL-2 family by Western blot and qPCR. Subsequently, we engineered PMAIP1 (NOXA)- and BBC3 (PUMA)-deficient AML cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 methods to understand their respective roles in driving the venetoclax/5-Aza combinatorial activity. RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate that venetoclax and 5-Aza act synergistically to kill AML cells in vitro and display combinatorial antitumor activity in vivo. We uncover a novel nonepigenetic mechanism for 5-Aza-induced apoptosis in AML cells through transcriptional induction of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein NOXA. This induction occurred within hours of treatment and was mediated by the ISR pathway. NOXA was detected in complex with antiapoptotic proteins, suggesting that 5-Aza may be ""priming"" the AML cells for venetoclax-induced apoptosis. PMAIP1 knockout confirmed its major role in driving venetoclax and 5-Aza synergy. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide a novel nonepigenetic mechanism of action for 5-Aza and its combinatorial activity with venetoclax through the ISR-mediated induction of PMAIP1.","['Jin, Sha', 'Cojocari, Dan', 'Purkal, Julie J', 'Popovic, Relja', 'Talaty, Nari N', 'Xiao, Yu', 'Solomon, Larry R', 'Boghaert, Erwin R', 'Leverson, Joel D', 'Phillips, Darren C']","['Jin S', 'Cojocari D', 'Purkal JJ', 'Popovic R', 'Talaty NN', 'Xiao Y', 'Solomon LR', 'Boghaert ER', 'Leverson JD', 'Phillips DC']","['Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Genomics Research Center, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Drug Discovery Science and Technologies, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Discovery, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois.

We have recently shown that cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is specifically and consistently overexpressed in ATLL cells, and functions as a novel cell surface marker. In this study, we first show that a soluble form of CADM1 (sCADM1) is secreted from ATLL cells by mainly alternative splicing. After developing the Alpha linked immunosorbent assay (AlphaLISA) for sCADM1, we showed that plasma sCADM1 concentrations gradually increased during disease progression from indolent to aggressive ATLL. Although other known biomarkers of tumor burden such as soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha (sIL-2Ralpha) also increased with sCADM1 during ATLL progression, multivariate statistical analysis of biomarkers revealed that only plasma sCADM1 was selected as a specific biomarker for aggressive ATLL, suggesting that plasma sCADM1 may be a potential risk factor for aggressive ATLL. In addition, plasma sCADM1 is a useful marker for monitoring response to chemotherapy as well as for predicting relapse of ATLL. Furthermore, the change in sCADM1 concentration between indolent and aggressive type ATLL was more prominent than the change in the percentage of CD4+CADM1+ ATLL cells. As plasma sCADM1 values fell within normal ranges in HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) patients with higher levels of serum sIL-2Ralpha, a measurement of sCADM1 may become a useful tool to discriminate between ATLL and other inflammatory diseases, including HAM/TSP.","['Nakahata, Shingo', 'Syahrul, Chilmi', 'Nakatake, Ayako', 'Sakamoto, Kuniyo', 'Yoshihama, Maki', 'Nishikata, Ichiro', 'Ukai, Yoshinori', 'Matsuura, Tadashi', 'Kameda, Takuro', 'Shide, Kotaro', 'Kubuki, Yoko', 'Hidaka, Tomonori', 'Kitanaka, Akira', 'Ito, Akihiko', 'Takemoto, Shigeki', 'Nakano, Nobuaki', 'Saito, Masumichi', 'Iwanaga, Masako', 'Sagara, Yasuko', 'Mochida, Kosuke', 'Amano, Masahiro', 'Maeda, Kouichi', 'Sueoka, Eisaburo', 'Okayama, Akihiko', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Watanabe, Toshiki', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Nakahata S', 'Syahrul C', 'Nakatake A', 'Sakamoto K', 'Yoshihama M', 'Nishikata I', 'Ukai Y', 'Matsuura T', 'Kameda T', 'Shide K', 'Kubuki Y', 'Hidaka T', 'Kitanaka A', 'Ito A', 'Takemoto S', 'Nakano N', 'Saito M', 'Iwanaga M', 'Sagara Y', 'Mochida K', 'Amano M', 'Maeda K', 'Sueoka E', 'Okayama A', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Shimoda K', 'Watanabe T', 'Morishita K']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Perseus Proteomics Inc., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Perseus Proteomics Inc., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kindai University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Dept of Frontier Life Science, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Internal Medicine, National Hospital Organization Miyakonojo Medical Center, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Saga University Hospital, Saga, Japan.', 'Dept. of Infectious Diseases and Laboratory Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Computational Biology and Medical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20210201,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', '*Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis', '*Lymphoma']",2020/02/15 06:00,2021/05/28 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.234096 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.234096 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2021 Feb 1;106(2):532-542. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.234096.,,,,PMC7849584,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise characteristics and alternation of MSCs during acquired aplastic anemia (AA) remain obscure. METHODS: In this study, we originally collected samples from both healthy donors (HD) and AA patients to dissect the hematological changes. To systematically evaluate the biological defects of AA-derived MSCs (AA-MSCs), we analyzed alterations in cellular morphology, immunophenotype, multi-lineage differentiation, cell migration, cellular apoptosis, and chromosome karyocyte, together with the immunosuppressive effect on the activation and differentiation of lymphocytes. With the aid of whole genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, we try to compare the differences between AA-MSCs and HD-derived MSCs (HD-MSCs) upon the molecular genetics, especially the immune-associated gene expression pattern. In addition, the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSC (UC-MSC) transplantation on AA mice was evaluated by utilizing survivorship curve, histologic sections, and blood cell analyses. RESULTS: In coincidence with the current reports, AA patients showed abnormal subsets of lymphocytes and higher contents of proinflammatory cytokines. Although with similar immunophenotype and chromosome karyotype to HD-MSCs, AA-MSCs showed distinguishable morphology and multiple distinct characteristics including genetic properties. In addition, the immunosuppressive effect on lymphocytes was significantly impaired in AA-MSCs. What is more, the cardinal symptoms of AA mice were largely rescued by systemic transplantation of UC-MSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we systematically investigated the signatures and efficacy of MSCs to dissect the alterations occurred in AA both at the cellular and molecular levels. Different from HD-MSCs, AA-MSCs exhibited multifaceted defects in biological characteristics and alterative molecular genetics in the whole genome.

Due to a lack of real-world evidence regarding AEs that are associated with PNAs, we used commercial data to assess AE rates, AE-related health care resource utilization (HCRU), and costs among PNA-treated patients with HCL. Adults aged >/=18 years with >/=2 claims for HCL >/=30 days apart from 1 January 2006 through 31 December 2015 were included. Included patients had >/=1 claim for HCL therapy (cladribine +/- rituximab or pentostatin +/- rituximab [index date: first claim date]) and continuous enrollment for a >/= 6-month baseline and >/= 12-month follow-up period. Patient sub-cohorts were based on the occurrence of myelosuppression and opportunistic infections (OIs). Generalized linear models were used to compare HCRU and costs. RESULTS: In total, 647 PNA-treated patients were identified (mean age: 57.1 years). Myelosuppression and OI incidence were 461 and 42 per 1000 patient-years, respectively. Adjusted results indicated that those with myelosuppression had higher rates of hospitalization (47.4% vs 12.4%; P < .0001) and incurred higher mean inpatient costs ($23,517 vs $12,729; P = .011) and total costs ($57,325 vs $34,733; P = .001) as compared with those without myelosuppression. Similarly, patients with OIs had higher rates of hospitalization (53.8% vs 30.8%; P = .025) and incurred higher mean inpatient costs ($21,494 vs $11,229; P < .0001) as compared with those without OIs. CONCLUSIONS: PNA therapy is highly effective but associated with significant toxicities that increase costs; these findings indicate a need for therapies with improved toxicity profiles and better risk stratification of patients at risk of developing myelosuppression and OIs.","['Epperla, Narendranath', 'Pavilack, Melissa', 'Olufade, Temitope', 'Bashyal, Richa', 'Li, Jieni', 'Kabadi, Shaum M', 'Yuce, Huseyin', 'Andritsos, Leslie']","['Epperla N', 'Pavilack M', 'Olufade T', 'Bashyal R', 'Li J', 'Kabadi SM', 'Yuce H', 'Andritsos L']","['Division of Hematology, The James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, A346 Starling Loving Hall, 320W 10th Ave, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.

Here, increased DNA damage is detected by gammaH2AX foci analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of de novo untreated chronic phase (CP)-CML patients (n = 5; 2.5 gammaH2AX foci per PBMC +/- 0.5) and blast phase (BP)-CML patients (n = 3; 4.4 gammaH2AX foci per PBMC +/- 0.7) as well as CP-CML patients with loss of major molecular response (MMR) (n = 5; 1.8 gammaH2AX foci per PBMC +/- 0.4) when compared to DNA damage in PBMC of healthy donors (n = 8; 1.0 gammaH2AX foci per PBMC +/- 0.1) and CP-CML patients in deep molecular response or MMR (n = 26; 1.0 gammaH2AX foci per PBMC +/- 0.1). Progressive activation of erroneous non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanisms during blastic transformation in CML is indicated by abundant co-localization of gammaH2AX/53BP1 foci, while a decline of the DDR is suggested by defective expression of (p-)ATM and (p-)CHK2. In summary, our data provide evidence for the accumulation of DNA damage in the course of CML and suggest ongoing DNA damage, erroneous NHEJ repair mechanisms, and alterations in the DDR as critical mediators of blastic transformation in CML.","['Popp, Henning D', 'Kohl, Vanessa', 'Naumann, Nicole', 'Flach, Johanna', 'Brendel, Susanne', 'Kleiner, Helga', 'Weiss, Christel', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Fabarius, Alice']","['Popp HD', 'Kohl V', 'Naumann N', 'Flach J', 'Brendel S', 'Kleiner H', 'Weiss C', 'Seifarth W', 'Saussele S', 'Hofmann WK', 'Fabarius A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Statistics and Biomathematics, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, 68167 Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200211,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', '*DNA Repair', 'Female', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/15 06:00,2020/11/21 06:00,['2020/02/15 06:00'],"['2019/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21041177 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21041177 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Feb 11;21(4). pii: ijms21041177. doi: 10.3390/ijms21041177.,,['DJCLS 14 R/2017/Deutsche Jose Carreras Leukamie-Stiftung'],,PMC7072846,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage response', 'DNA double-strand breaks', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'genetic instability']",,,"['The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Monitoring the expansion and contraction of distinct clones helps to reveal the mutations that initiate the disease and those that drive progression. Existing approaches for clonal tracking from sequencing data typically require the user to combine multiple tools that are not purpose-built for this task. Furthermore, most methods require a matched normal (non-tumour) sample, which limits the scope of application. We developed SuperFreq, a cancer exome sequencing analysis pipeline that integrates identification of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number alterations (CNAs) and clonal tracking for both. SuperFreq does not require a matched normal and instead relies on unrelated controls. When analysing multiple samples from a single patient, SuperFreq cross checks variant calls to improve clonal tracking, which helps to separate somatic from germline variants, and to resolve overlapping CNA calls. To demonstrate our software we analysed 304 cancer-normal exome samples across 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and evaluated the quality of the SNV and CNA calls. We simulated clonal evolution through in silico mixing of cancer and normal samples in known proportion. We found that SuperFreq identified 93% of clones with a cellular fraction of at least 50% and mutations were assigned to the correct clone with high recall and precision. In addition, SuperFreq maintained a similar level of performance for most aspects of the analysis when run without a matched normal. SuperFreq is highly versatile and can be applied in many different experimental settings for the analysis of exomes and other capture libraries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: MDR1 C3435T polymorphism was investigated in 60 patients with Chinese childhood ALL. The study also compared the MDR1; polymorphism between the patients with Chinese childhood ALL and the published data on Americans, Mexicans, Caucasians, and Thais. The C3435T polymorphism was identi fi ed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and direct sequence analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma concentrations of MTX were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). MTX concentrations were compared according to MDR1 C3435T genotypes. RESULTS: The frequencies of MDR1 C3435T genotype in male and female patients with Chinese childhood ALL were significantly different (p = 0.001). For the frequencies of MDR1 C3435T genotype in Hui and Han patients with Chinese childhood ALL there was no difference (p = 0.188). The distribution of allele frequencies in patients with Chinese childhood ALL was similar to the published data on Americans, Mexican, Caucasians, and Thais (p > 0.05). The CSF concentrations of MTX were found to be significantly different between the C allele (CC + CT) carriers and TT homozygous group (p = 0.04). The plasma concentrations of MTX had no significant difference between the C allele (CC + CT) carriers and TT homozygous group (p > 0.1). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the polymorphism of MDR1 C3435T influenced the CSF concentration of MTX in patients with Chinese childhood ALL receiving IV and IT HDMTX treatment.","['Zhang, Yu-Xin', 'Ma, Yu', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Zhang, Wen-Ping', 'Yang, Xiao-Ying']","['Zhang YX', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang WP', 'Yang XY']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*cerebrospinal fluid/therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Child', 'China', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2020/02/14 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2020/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['186228 [pii]', '10.5414/CP203462 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2020 May;58(5):254-260. doi: 10.5414/CP203462.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: A 28-year-old woman who developed T-ALL with coexpressing both p210 and p190 BCR-ABL transcripts five years after the initial diagnosis of CML in chronic phase. The proliferation of bone marrow was extremely active with blast cells over 20%. Chromosome analysis revealed t(9;22)(q34;q11) and t(10;11)(q25;p15). Flow immunophenotyping showed that blasts expressed CD4, CD7, CD11b, CD38, CD34, CD33, and cCD3. CONCLUSION: It is the first T-cell blast of CML case with coexisting p210 and p190 as well as additional chromosome translocations. Through review this case and previous reports, we will reveal that CML patients with T-lymphocyte transformation depend on potential molecular and pathological mechanism.","['Xia, Ting', 'Yang, Yuchao', 'Li, Guoxia', 'Chang, Jianmei', 'Li, Jianlan', 'Ren, Fanggang', 'Ren, Weixiao', 'Wang, Hongwei', 'Xu, Zhifang']","['Xia T', 'Yang Y', 'Li G', 'Chang J', 'Li J', 'Ren F', 'Ren W', 'Wang H', 'Xu Z']","['The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.', 'The Haematology Department, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200213,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2020/02/14 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.23241 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2020 Jun;34(6):e23241. doi: 10.1002/jcla.23241.

SPLL-U is a rare disease that includes subtypes of a hairy cell leukemia-variant (HCL-v), splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (SDRPL) and other types that are known as narrow sense SPLL-U (SPLL-U-NS). Notably, limited information is available regarding the BRAF mutation (V600E) and cyclin D3 expression in subtypes of SPLL-U. Therefore, we performed a pathological analysis of the BRAF mutation (V600E) and characterized pathological features of SPLL-U. We reviewed the pathological findings of 12 SPLL-U cases. The 12 cases considered included two cases of HCL-v, six cases of SPLL-U-NS and four undetermined cases. The BRAF mutation (V600E) was detected in three cases, which were all SPLL-U-NS. Cases with the BRAF mutation (V600E) have increased levels of CD103 expression and decreased cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 expression compared with cases that lacked the BRAF mutation. These findings suggest that the BRAF mutation might play a significant role in SPLL-U. Therefore, the significance of the BRAF mutation should be evaluated via genomic or transcriptional analyses of a large cohort of SPLL-U patients.","['Suzuki, Takaharu', 'Miyoshi, Hiroaki', 'Shimono, Joji', 'Kawamoto, Keisuke', 'Arakawa, Fumiko', 'Furuta, Takuya', 'Yamada, Kyohei', 'Yanagida, Eriko', 'Takeuchi, Mai', 'Seto, Masao', 'Sone, Hirohito', 'Takizawa, Jun', 'Ohshima, Koichi']","['Suzuki T', 'Miyoshi H', 'Shimono J', 'Kawamoto K', 'Arakawa F', 'Furuta T', 'Yamada K', 'Yanagida E', 'Takeuchi M', 'Seto M', 'Sone H', 'Takizawa J', 'Ohshima K']","['Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Medicine, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University, School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200212,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics', 'Splenic Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology']",2020/02/14 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pin.12909 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2020 May;70(5):280-286. doi: 10.1111/pin.12909.

However, the clinical significance of NP, detected in routine complete blood cell counts (CBC) in primary care, is poorly characterized. Here, from a primary care resource with ANCs from >370 000 individuals, we identified and followed neutropenic subjects for the next 4 years for novel ICD-10 based diagnoses of viral infections and hematological malignancies (ie, previously identified major outcomes in NP individuals) in Danish nationwide health registers. Risk estimates were assessed for children/adolescents (1-18 years) and adults (19-90 years) in relation to NP severity, and for isolated NP, bi- or pancytopenias. We found that NP was observed in 4.9% of children and in 1.9% of adults. The lower the ANC, the likelier was a diagnosis of viral infections or hematological malignancies established during the ensuing 4 years. Among neutropenic children, unspecified viral infections predominated, followed by mononucleosis (with other cytopenias in only 7% and 25% of the cases, respectively). All NP children with acute leukemia presented with bi- or pancytopenia from start of follow-up. In NP adults, hepatitis, followed by HIV, were the most common infections, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) the predominating hematological malignancies. Adult NP patients, subsequently diagnosed with hepatitis, HIV or AML, MDS, were bi- or pancytopenic in 42%, 47%, 90% and 91% of cases, respectively. Thus, presence of NP in even one CBC may be the first sign of a latent viral or hematological disorder requiring careful follow-up.","['Palmblad, Jan', 'Siersma, Volkert', 'Lind, Bent', 'Bjerrum, Ole Weis', 'Hasselbalch, Hans', 'Andersen, Christen Lykkegaard']","['Palmblad J', 'Siersma V', 'Lind B', 'Bjerrum OW', 'Hasselbalch H', 'Andersen CL']","['Department of Hematology and Medicine, The Karolinska Institute at Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'The Research Unit for General Practice and Section of General Practice, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Roskilde University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'The Research Unit for General Practice and Section of General Practice, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Roskilde University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200304,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Data Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/*diagnostic imaging', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care/*methods']",2020/02/14 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25756 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 May;95(5):521-528. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25756.

Although CD16(+) (Fc-gamma III receptor) monocytes that express CD163 (a hemoglobin/haptoglobin receptor) have been implicated in a variety of disease states, the conditions necessary to establish lineages of these cell subtypes remains unknown. The current investigations utilize a cell line derived from acute myelogenous leukemia lineage, MonoMac-1, to interrogate the factors that promote the development of CD16(+) macrophages that express CD163. Results implicate the glucocorticoid pathway as well as c-fms signaling based on the action of dexamethasone and macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 in promoting CD16(+) expression, in addition to phorbol myristate acetate and lipopolysaccharides treatment. The ability of glucocorticoid and c-fms receptor antagonists to inhibit CD16(+) cell formation further establishes the role of these pathways in CD16 expression in this cell line. In view of the inherent difficulty in working with primary cells as well as donor variation, cell lines may be preferable to primary cells for their consistency. We envision that the process we use to induce CD16 expression in this cell type will be useful for screening and identification of drug candidates potentially useful for the treatment of diseases where the etiology involves the expansion of the CD16(+) monocytes subset or the accumulation of CD163(+) tissue macrophages.","['Vakili, Sarah', 'Fischer, Tracy', 'Rappaport, Jay']","['Vakili S', 'Fischer T', 'Rappaport J']","['Center for Neurovirology, Department of Neuroscience, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Neurovirology, Department of Neuroscience, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Neurovirology, Department of Neuroscience, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200213,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD163 antigen)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, fms/genetics', 'Glucocorticoids/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",2020/02/14 06:00,2021/03/05 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29638 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Oct;235(10):7383-7391. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29638.

Various molecular regulatory mechanisms such as epigenetic modifications and transcription factor (TF) networks play crucial roles in establishing a balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. Histone/DNA methylations are important epigenetic modifications involved in transcriptional regulation of specific lineage HSCs via controlling chromatin structure and accessibility of DNA. Also, TFs contribute to either facilitation or inhibition of gene expression through binding to enhancer or promoter regions of DNA. As a result, epigenetic factors and TFs regulate the activation or repression of HSCs genes, playing a central role in normal hematopoiesis. Given the importance of histone/DNA methylation and TFs in gene expression regulation, their aberrations, including changes in HSCs-related methylation of histone/DNA and TFs (e.g., CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein alpha, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on the chromosome 10, Runt-related transcription factor 1, signal transducers and activators of transcription, and RAS family proteins) could disrupt HSCs fate.

The ability of the enzyme to convert L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia is the reason behind its anti-cancerous activity. Apart from its medicinal uses, it is widely used in food industry to tackle acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen and, production in carbohydrate-rich foods cooked at high temperatures.

Primary cardiac lymphoma is a rare cardiac malignancy with a very poor prognosis. Here we present a case of a cardiac myxoma with cerebral metastases and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) arising within the cerebral metastases. Case description A 62-year-old man, who presented with symptoms of multiple transient ischemic attacks, was found to have a left atrial myxoma. Twelve months after excision of the myxoma, the patient experienced a recurrence of neurologic symptoms. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple hemorrhagic masses. Craniotomy was performed to resect the lesions. Histopathologic examination confirmed cardiac myxoma metastases and a small lymphocytic infiltrate within the tumor consistent with CLL/SLL. Conclusion Including the present case, there are 27 cases of cardiac myxoma cerebral metastases and 22 cases of lymphomas arising within myxomas. The present case is the first known instance of both entities in the same patient. There is no standard management for either cardiac myxoma metastases or lymphoma within a myxoma. For both diseases, surgical excision is the primary treatment modality, but postoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation have been attempted. Myxomas may create a chronic inflammatory state that could lead to the development of CLL/SLL.","['Maas, Jared A', 'Menes, Manuel', 'Siomin, Vitaly']","['Maas JA', 'Menes M', 'Siomin V']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Hazelrig Salter Radiation Oncology Center, Birmingham, Alabama, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Baptist Health South Florida, Miami, Florida, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Baptist Health South Florida, Miami, Florida, United States.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200211,Germany,J Neurol Surg Rep,Journal of neurological surgery reports,101601540,,,,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:01,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1055/s-0039-3399570 [doi]', '190024 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurol Surg Rep. 2020 Jan;81(1):e1-e6. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-3399570.

We aimed to establish the prevalence of HBV Ag and anti-HBc serologic positive results in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Poland before anti-CD20 therapy initiation; to assess the frequency of insufficient HBV screening; and to assess the association between inadequate HBV screening and diagnosis according to the WHO classification and age or gender. Material and methods: We retrospectively collected data from 805 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated in 2016-2018. Results: We found a positive result of HBsAg in 13 (1.16%), and a negative result in 633 (78.64%) patients. The test was not done in 159 (19.75%) patients. In the HBsAg negative subgroup of 633 patients, we found that the anti-HBc was positive in 52 (8.22%), negative in 303 (47.87%) and not done in 278 patients. In 136 out of 805 (16.9%) patients diagnostics tests were not performed before therapy initiation. We found that age is significantly associated (p = 0.0002) with the lack of HBV infection screening, and in CLL this risk is significantly (p = 0.024) higher (by 49%) compared with other WHO diagnosis subgroups. Conclusions: In Polish lymphoma patients the incidence of positive HBsAg and/or anti-HBc results is consistent with the prevalence in the United States or Australia. The adherence to appropriate HBV screening guidelines in Polish centers is not sufficient. We should intensify educational strategies in the global oncohematologic medical community.","['Kalinka, Ewa', 'Drozd-Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Barankiewicz, Joanna', 'Zalewska, Elzbieta', 'Symonowicz, Igor', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa']","['Kalinka E', 'Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Barankiewicz J', 'Zalewska E', 'Symonowicz I', 'Lech-Maranda E']","[""Department of Oncology, Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital - Research Institute, Lodz, Poland."", 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Internal Diseases, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Statistical Methods Unit, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', ""Department of Oncology, Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital - Research Institute, Lodz, Poland."", 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190718,Poland,Arch Med Sci,Archives of medical science : AMS,101258257,,,,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:01,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/06/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5114/aoms.2019.86761 [doi]', '37254 [pii]']",epublish,Arch Med Sci. 2019 Jul 18;16(1):157-161. doi: 10.5114/aoms.2019.86761. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 Termedia & Banach.'],PMC6963131,,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-CD20 treatment', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'hepatitis B virus', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'screening']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We utilized multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF) imaging with digital image analysis to perform an in situ analysis of the microenvironment in NPM1-mutated AML using diagnostic bone marrow biopsy tissues (N = 17) and correlated these findings with diagnostic next-generation sequencing (NGS, N = 17), flow cytometry (FC, N = 14), and first remission (CR1) NPM1-specific molecular MRD (n = 16) data. The total CD3-positive T-cell percentages correlated positively between FC and MIF (r = 0.53, p = 0.05), but were significantly lower by MIF (1.62% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.009). The percentage of mutant NPM1-positive (NPM1c+) cells ranged from 9.7 to 90.8% (median 45.4%) and did not correlate with the NPM1 mutant allele fraction by NGS (p > 0.05). The percentage of CD34+/NPM1c+ cells ranged from 0 to 1.8% (median 0.07%). The percentage of NPM1c+ cells correlated inversely (34% vs. 62%, p = 0.03), while the percentages of CD3-/NPM1c- cells (64% vs. 35%, p = 0.03), and specifically CD3-/CD4-/NPM1c- cells (26% vs. 13%, p = 0.04), correlated positively with subsequent MRD. Discordances between MIF and FC/NGS data suggest that aspirate materials are likely an imperfect reflection of the core biopsy tissue. Furthermore, increased numbers of NPM1 wild-type cells within the microenvironment at diagnosis correlate with the subsequent presence of MRD.","['Patel, Sanjay S', 'Lipschitz, Mikel', 'Pinkus, Geraldine S', 'Weirather, Jason L', 'Pozdnyakova, Olga', 'Mason, Emily F', 'Inghirami, Giorgio', 'Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Rodig, Scott J', 'Weinberg, Olga K']","['Patel SS', 'Lipschitz M', 'Pinkus GS', 'Weirather JL', 'Pozdnyakova O', 'Mason EF', 'Inghirami G', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Rodig SJ', 'Weinberg OK']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Center for Immuno-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Center for Immuno-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Center for Immuno-Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. olga.weinberg@childrens.harvard.edu."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. olga.weinberg@childrens.harvard.edu.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200212,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/methods', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",2020/02/14 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-020-0498-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-020-0498-z [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2020 Jul;33(7):1380-1388. doi: 10.1038/s41379-020-0498-z.

The etiology of iMCD-TAFRO and the basis for cytokine hypersecretion commonly seen in iMCD-TAFRO patients has not been elucidated. Here, we identified a somatic MEK2(P128L) mutation and a germline RUNX1(G60C) mutation in two patients with iMCD-TAFRO, respectively. The MEK2(P128L) mutation, which has been identified previously in solid tumor and histiocytosis patients, caused hyperactivated MAP kinase signaling, conferred IL-3 hypersensitivity and sensitized the cells to various MEK inhibitors. The RUNX1(G60C) mutation abolished the transcriptional activity of wild-type RUNX1 and functioned as a dominant negative form of RUNX1, resulting in enhanced self-renewal activity in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Interestingly, ERK was heavily activated in both patients, highlighting a potential role for activation of MAPK signaling in iMCD-TAFRO pathogenesis and a rationale for exploring inhibition of the MAPK pathway as a therapy for iMCD-TAFRO. Moreover, these data suggest that iMCD-TAFRO might share pathogenetic features with clonal inflammatory disorders bearing MEK and RUNX1 mutations such as histiocytoses and myeloid neoplasms.","['Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Trippett, Tanya M', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Chen, Xueyan', 'Penson, Alexander V', 'Arcila, Maria E', 'Pichardo, Janine', 'Baik, Jeeyeon', 'Sigler, Allison', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Fajgenbaum, David C', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Xiao, Wenbin']","['Yoshimi A', 'Trippett TM', 'Zhang N', 'Chen X', 'Penson AV', 'Arcila ME', 'Pichardo J', 'Baik J', 'Sigler A', 'Harada H', 'Fajgenbaum DC', 'Dogan A', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Xiao W']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Buffalo General Medical Center, SUNY at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, 14206, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Rochester General Hospital, Rochester, NY, 14621, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Diagnostic Molecular laboratory, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Oncology, School of Life Sciences, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Castleman Disease Collaborative Network, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA. xiaow@mskcc.org.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA. xiaow@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200212,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', ""Multi-centric Castleman's Disease""]",IM,"['Adult', 'Castleman Disease/*genetics/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics', 'Male', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/14 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-020-1204-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-020-1204-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2020 Apr;39(15):3218-3225. doi: 10.1038/s41388-020-1204-9.

Factors intrinsic and extrinsic to CML cells contribute to response heterogeneity and TKI resistance. Among extrinsic factors, cytokine-mediated TKI resistance has been demonstrated in CML progenitors, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Using RNA-sequencing, we identified differentially expressed splicing factors in primary CD34(+) chronic phase (CP) CML progenitors and controls. We found SRSF1 expression to be increased as a result of both BCR-ABL1- and cytokine-mediated signaling. SRSF1 overexpression conferred cytokine independence to untransformed hematopoietic cells and impaired imatinib sensitivity in CML cells, while SRSF1 depletion in CD34(+) CP CML cells prevented the ability of extrinsic cytokines to decrease imatinib sensitivity. Mechanistically, PRKCH and PLCH1 were upregulated by elevated SRSF1 levels, and contributed to impaired imatinib sensitivity. Importantly, very high SRSF1 levels in the bone marrow of CML patients at presentation correlated with poorer clinical TKI responses. In summary, we find SRSF1 levels to be maintained in CD34(+) CP CML progenitors by cytokines despite effective BCR-ABL1 inhibition, and that elevated levels promote impaired imatinib responses. Together, our data support an SRSF1/PRKCH/PLCH1 axis in contributing to cytokine-induced impaired imatinib sensitivity in CML.","['Sinnakannu, Joanna R', 'Lee, Kian Leong', 'Cheng, Shanshan', 'Li, Jia', 'Yu, Mengge', 'Tan, Siew Peng', 'Ong, Clara Chong Hui', 'Li, Huihua', 'Than, Hein', 'Anczukow-Camarda, Olga', 'Krainer, Adrian R', 'Roca, Xavier', 'Rozen, Steven G', 'Iqbal, Jabed', 'Yang, Henry', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Ong, Sin Tiong']","['Sinnakannu JR', 'Lee KL', 'Cheng S', 'Li J', 'Yu M', 'Tan SP', 'Ong CCH', 'Li H', 'Than H', 'Anczukow-Camarda O', 'Krainer AR', 'Roca X', 'Rozen SG', 'Iqbal J', 'Yang H', 'Chuah C', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Health Services Research Unit, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Quantitative Medicine, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.', 'Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Centre for Computational Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore, Singapore. sintiong.ong@duke-nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore. sintiong.ong@duke-nus.edu.sg.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. sintiong.ong@duke-nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA. sintiong.ong@duke-nus.edu.sg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200212,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (SRSF1 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2020/02/14 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0732-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0732-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jul;34(7):1787-1798. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0732-1.

These mutations can modify gene expression in cis or by inducing high-order chormatin structure modifications with long-range effects. Previous analysis reported the detection of recurrent and functional non-coding DNA mutations in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) genome, such as those in the 3' untranslated region of NOTCH1 and in the PAX5 super-enhancer. In this report, we used whole genome sequencing data produced by the International Cancer Genome Consortium in order to analyze regions with previously reported regulatory activity. This approach enabled the identification of numerous recurrently mutated regions that were frequently positioned in the proximity of genes involved in immune and oncogenic pathways. By correlating these mutations with expression of their nearest genes, we detected significant transcriptional changes in genes such as PHF2 and S1PR2. More research is needed to clarify the function of these mutations in CLL, particularly those found in intergenic regions.","['Mosquera Orgueira, Adrian', 'Rodriguez Antelo, Beatriz', 'Diaz Arias, Jose Angel', 'Diaz Varela, Nicolas', 'Alonso Vence, Natalia', 'Gonzalez Perez, Marta Sonia', 'Bello Lopez, Jose Luis']","['Mosquera Orgueira A', 'Rodriguez Antelo B', 'Diaz Arias JA', 'Diaz Varela N', 'Alonso Vence N', 'Gonzalez Perez MS', 'Bello Lopez JL']","['Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain. adrian.mosquera@live.com.', 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Division of Hematology, SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. adrian.mosquera@live.com.', 'University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain. adrian.mosquera@live.com.', 'Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Division of Hematology, SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Division of Hematology, SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Division of Hematology, SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Division of Hematology, SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Division of Hematology, SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS), Division of Hematology, SERGAS, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'University of Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200212,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Intergenic)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (PHF2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (S1PR2 protein, human)', '0 (Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Intergenic/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors/genetics', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",2020/02/14 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59243-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59243-5 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 12;10(1):2407. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59243-5.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4838-6750'],,,PMC7015923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although abnormal hematologic profiles and bone marrow suppression are common in patients with dengue, whether dengue is associated with a higher risk of leukemia has not been investigated. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study by analyzing the National Health Insurance Research Databases in Taiwan. Laboratory-confirmed dengue patients between 2002 and 2011 were identified; five matched non-dengue controls were randomly selected for each patient. Follow-up ended on December 31, 2015. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the effect of dengue virus infection on the risk of leukemia. Cancers other than leukemia were used as falsification endpoints to evaluate the validity of this study. RESULTS: We identified 12,573 patients with dengue and 62,865 non-dengue controls. Patients with dengue had a higher risk of leukemia [adjusted HR, 2.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-3.53]. Stratified analyses by different follow-up periods showed that dengue virus infection was significantly associated with a higher risk of leukemia only between 3 and 6 years after infection (adjusted HR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.25-8.32). There was no significant association between dengue and the risk of other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first epidemiologic evidence for the association between dengue virus infection and leukemia. IMPACT: Considering the rapidly increasing global incidence of dengue and the burden of leukemia, further studies are required to verify this association and to unravel the potential mechanisms of pathogenesis.","['Chien, Yu-Wen', 'Wang, Chia-Chun', 'Wang, Yu-Ping', 'Lee, Cho-Yin', 'Perng, Guey Chuen']","['Chien YW', 'Wang CC', 'Wang YP', 'Lee CY', 'Perng GC']","['Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, National Cheng Kung University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Public Health, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan. gperng@mail.ncku.edu.tw choyin.lee@ym.edu.tw.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan City, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan. gperng@mail.ncku.edu.tw choyin.lee@ym.edu.tw.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.', 'Center of Infectious Disease and Signaling Research, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200212,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dengue/diagnosis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Dengue Virus/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Taiwan/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/14 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-19-1214 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-1214 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2020 Mar;29(3):558-564. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-19-1214.

The aim of this study was to describe the phenotypic spectrum of TAP in a multi-institutional cohort. TAP cases were identified from eight high-risk cancer centers. Cases were defined as patients with >/=10 gastrointestinal polyps without known causative germline alteration or hereditary colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome who had a history of prior treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for CYAC. A total of 34 TAP cases were included (original CYAC: 27 Hodgkin lymphoma, three neuroblastoma, one acute myeloid leukemia, one medulloblastoma, one nephroblastoma, and one non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Gastrointestinal polyposis was first detected at a median of 27 years (interquartile range, 20-33) after CYAC treatment. A total of 12 of 34 (35%) TAP cases had >/=50 colorectal polyps. A total of 32 of 34 (94%) had >1 histologic polyp type. A total of 25 of 34 (74%) had clinical features suggestive of >/=1 colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome [e.g., attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), serrated polyposis syndrome, extracolonic manifestations of FAP, mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer, or hamartomatous polyposis] including 8 of 34 (24%) with features of multiple such syndromes. TAP is an apparently acquired phenomenon that should be considered in patients who develop significant polyposis without known causative germline alteration but who have had prior treatment for a CYAC. Patients with TAP have features that may mimic various hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes, suggesting multiple concurrent biologic mechanisms, and recognition of this diagnosis may have implications for cancer risk and screening.","['Biller, Leah H', 'Ukaegbu, Chinedu', 'Dhingra, Tara G', 'Burke, Carol A', 'Chertock, Yana', 'Chittenden, Anuradha', 'Church, James M', 'Koeppe, Erika S', 'Leach, Brandie H', 'Levinson, Elana', 'Lim, Ramona M', 'Lutz, Megan', 'Salo-Mullen, Erin', 'Sheikh, Rania', 'Idos, Gregory', 'Kastrinos, Fay', 'Stoffel, Elena', 'Weiss, Jennifer M', 'Hall, Michael J', 'Kalady, Matthew F', 'Stadler, Zsofia K', 'Syngal, Sapna', 'Yurgelun, Matthew B']","['Biller LH', 'Ukaegbu C', 'Dhingra TG', 'Burke CA', 'Chertock Y', 'Chittenden A', 'Church JM', 'Koeppe ES', 'Leach BH', 'Levinson E', 'Lim RM', 'Lutz M', 'Salo-Mullen E', 'Sheikh R', 'Idos G', 'Kastrinos F', 'Stoffel E', 'Weiss JM', 'Hall MJ', 'Kalady MF', 'Stadler ZK', 'Syngal S', 'Yurgelun MB']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.', 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, Wisconsin.', 'Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts. matthew_yurgelun@dfci.harvard.edu.', ""Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200212,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects', 'Intestinal Polyposis/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Stomach Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/14 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-19-0416 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-19-0416 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2020 Mar;13(3):291-298. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-19-0416.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the children who have received micafungin treatment. In the study, 125 children who were hospitalized in the pediatric wards and intensive care units of our hospital and had used micafungin between November 2016 and January 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical data, micafungin indication, blood values on the first and fourth days of the treatment, side effects of the drug and efficacy were evaluated. Sixty percent (75/125) of the patients were male and the mean age of all the patients were 58 +/- 67 (0-215, 30) months. Approximately half of the cases (48%) had malignancy and 13% of them were premature. Sixty-two percent (n= 37) of the malignencies were hematological (27 acute lymphocytic leukemia, nine acute myeloid leukemia, one myelodysplastic syndrome) and 38% (n= 23) were oncological (six neuroblastoma, four Hodgkin lymphoma, two Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, five sarcomas, one hepatoblastoma, five others) malignencies. The major cause of hospitalization was sepsis (53%). The patients had several risk factors like immunosuppressive therapy (n= 68, 54%), neutropenia (n= 61, 49%), central venous catheter (n= 102, 82%), nasogastric tube (n= 63, 50%), endotracheal intubation tube (n= 49, 39%), urinary catheter (n= 14, 11%) and total parenteral nutrition (n= 81, 65%). Thirteen percent (n= 16) of the cases were post-operative patients. Candida species were cultivated in 97 clinical specimens (blood, endotracheal aspirate, sputum, urine, etc.) among 23 (18%) of the patients. Thirteen (10%) of the patients had candidemia and 62% of them were non-albicans strains. In all candidemias, strains were echinocandin susceptible, and blood cultures were negative within four days. When all the patients (n= 125) were evaluated, a significant decrease in C-reactive protein, an increase in sodium, and a decrease in alanine aminotransferase were observed on the fourth day of micafungin treatment (p<0.05). A total of 39 (31%) patients underwent various antifungal treatments for median seven (1-60) days prior to micafungin treatment. Fourteen (36%) of these 39 patients, had elevated liver function tests (LFT), 10 (26%) of them had hypokalemia, and five (13%) of them had elevated renal function tests. Ten (26%) patients had antifungal-induced hypokalemia previously; and potassium levels were normalized after micafungin treatment (p= 0.0001). The patients for which micafungin treatment was chosen due to elevated liver function tests (n= 47, 38%), whether the antifungalinduced or not; alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were decreased after micafungin treatment (p= 0.0001 and p= 0.0001, respectively). Nineteen (15%) of the patients have died within the first 30 days of micafungin treatment and one of them had candidemia. No micafungin treatment related significant side effects were observed in any of the patients. Our study showed that micafungin could be a safe and effective option in pediatric cases including newborns with high liver and kidney function tests.","['Yesil, Edanur', 'Celebi, Solmaz', 'Sezgin Evim, Melike', 'Ozer, Arife', 'Turan, Cansu', 'Timur, Demet', 'Cakir, Salih Cagri', 'Bulbul, Beyhan', 'Ener, Beyza', 'Gunes, Adalet Meral', 'Koksal, Nilgun', 'Ozkan, Hilal', 'Sevinir, Betul', 'Duzcan Kilimci, Duygu', 'Hacimustafaoglu, Mustafa']","['Yesil E', 'Celebi S', 'Sezgin Evim M', 'Ozer A', 'Turan C', 'Timur D', 'Cakir SC', 'Bulbul B', 'Ener B', 'Gunes AM', 'Koksal N', 'Ozkan H', 'Sevinir B', 'Duzcan Kilimci D', 'Hacimustafaoglu M']","['Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Mycology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neonatology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Mycology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neonatology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Neonatology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Oncology, Bursa, Turkey.', 'Celal Bayar University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Manisa, Turkey.', 'Uludag University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Bursa, Turkey.']",['tur'],['Journal Article'],,Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'R10H71BSWG (Micafungin)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Lipopeptides', 'Male', '*Micafungin/blood/standards/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.68832 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2020 Jan;54(1):120-134. doi: 10.5578/mb.68832.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cocuklarda Mikafungin Kullaniminin Degerlendirilmesi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the fast recovery from organ failure, after Gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration, has never been reported. This study aimed to demonstrate the efficacy and rapid response of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin in refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with pulmonary and kidney failure and poor performance status. Three refractory AML patients, with organ dysfunction, are described. One patient was pre-treated with intensive chemotherapy, and two other patients progressed during Azacitidine treatment. Two patients had respiratory failure grade 2 and one patient suffered from acute kidney insufficiency. Two patients were highly febrile with an elevated capital ES, Cyrillic-Reactive Protein (CRP) level. The WHO performance status of three was measured in all patients. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration was performed in three patients, followed by a further switch to Gemtuzumab ozogamicin + Azacitidine or ""7+3"" treatment. RESULTS: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration resulted in abrupt fever cessation in two febrile patients simultaneously with a rapid decrease in CRP level and fast resolution of respiratory failure. Recovery of kidney function was noticed rapidly in patients with renal insufficiency. The WHO performance status was elevated in all three patients. No adverse grade II-III effects were noticed. Further treatment made two patients eligible for intensive chemotherapy, one patient underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and the patient with kidney failure obtained complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: Gemtuzumab ozogamicin therapy appeared to be safe and highly efficacious in relapsed/refractory AML patients with organ dysfunction, like pulmonary or renal failure and poor performance status, and may contribute to rapid recovery from organ failures.","['Zaytsev, Daniil', 'Girshova, Larisa', 'Ivanov, Vladimir', 'Budaeva, Irina', 'Motorin, Dmitri', 'Badaev, Renat', 'Mirolubova, Julia', 'Grobovenko, Evgeni', 'Chitanava, Tamara', 'Zaykova, Ekaterina', 'Alexeeva, Julia', 'Zaritskey, Andrey']","['Zaytsev D', 'Girshova L', 'Ivanov V', 'Budaeva I', 'Motorin D', 'Badaev R', 'Mirolubova J', 'Grobovenko E', 'Chitanava T', 'Zaykova E', 'Alexeeva J', 'Zaritskey A']","['Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.', 'Almazov National Medical Research Centre, 2 Akkuratova street, 197341 St. Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200210,Switzerland,Biology (Basel),Biology,101587988,,,,2020/02/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:01,['2020/02/14 06:00'],"['2019/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:01 [medline]']","['biology9020028 [pii]', '10.3390/biology9020028 [doi]']",epublish,Biology (Basel). 2020 Feb 10;9(2). pii: biology9020028. doi: 10.3390/biology9020028.,,,,PMC7167863,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'kidney failure', 'organ dysfunction', 'respiratory failure']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate the analysis, patients were divided into three groups: relapsed children who survived; relapsed children who died; children without relapse who died due to toxicity.Our analysis showed that age older than 10 years is a particular risk factor for the failure of first-line of treatment, both in terms of relapse and treatment-related mortality.","['Zawitkowska, Joanna', 'Lejman, Monika', 'Drabko, Katarzyna', 'Zaucha-Prazmo, Agnieszka', 'Plonowski, Marcin', 'Bulsa, Joanna', 'Romiszewski, Michal', 'Mizia-Malarz, Agnieszka', 'Koltan, Andrzej', 'Derwich, Katarzyna', 'Karolczyk, Grazyna', 'Ociepa, Tomasz', 'Cwiklinska, Magdalena', 'Trelinska, Joanna', 'Owoc-Lempach, Joanna', 'Niedzwiecki, Maciej', 'Kiermasz, Aleksandra', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy']","['Zawitkowska J', 'Lejman M', 'Drabko K', 'Zaucha-Prazmo A', 'Plonowski M', 'Bulsa J', 'Romiszewski M', 'Mizia-Malarz A', 'Koltan A', 'Derwich K', 'Karolczyk G', 'Ociepa T', 'Cwiklinska M', 'Trelinska J', 'Owoc-Lempach J', 'Niedzwiecki M', 'Kiermasz A', 'Kowalczyk J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University Children's Hospital, Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory, Lublin."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Zabrze.', ""Department of Hematology and Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, Warsaw."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Chemotherapy, Medical University of Katowice.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum of Bydgoszcz.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Medical University of Poznan.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Kielce."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Szczecin.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's University Hospital, Krakow."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz.', 'Department of Pediatric Transplantology, Oncology, Hematology, Medical University of Wroclaw.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hematology, Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Center of Pediatrics and Oncology, Chorzow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Failure']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000019241 [doi]', '00005792-202002140-00090 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Feb;99(7):e19241. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019241.,,,,PMC7035074,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of IM in children and adolescents with CML.We investigated 21 patients under 18 years of age with newly diagnosed CML and treated with IM in Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University between May 2014 and February 2018. The disease was staged according to the European LeukemiaNet criteria and the IM dose was determined based on the disease stage. Cumulative responses and survival probabilities were estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.The estimated complete hematologic response rate of chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) was 89.5% at 3 months. The complete cytogenetic response rates increased with time, reaching 47.4%, 73.7%, and 80.3% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The cumulative major molecular response rates were 42.1% and 76.3% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 33.8 months (range, 3.2-61.7 months), the estimated 2-year overall survival (OS) rate for CML was 95.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 70.7%-99.3%). None of the CML-CP patients progressed to the accelerated phase or had a blast crisis. The 2-year OS and progression-free survival rates for the CML-CP cohort were both 100%, while the estimated 2-year event-free survival rate was 68% (95% CI, 42.1%-84.2%). None of the patients in this group had treatment-related deaths or IM discontinuation due to drug toxicities, and only 1 patient had a grade III-IV nonhematologic adverse event. Overall, anemia was the most common adverse effect and 42.9% of patients had a decrease in bone mineral density.IM was effective and the adverse effects were well-tolerated throughout the follow-up period in Chinese CML patients under 18 years of age.","['Deng, Mengyue', 'Guan, Xianmin', 'Wen, Xianhao', 'Xiao, Jianwen', 'An, Xizhou', 'Yu, Jie']","['Deng M', 'Guan X', 'Wen X', 'Xiao J', 'An X', 'Yu J']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University."", 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, P.R China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University."", 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, P.R China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University."", 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, P.R China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University."", 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, P.R China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University."", 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, P.R China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders; China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders; Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University."", 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Chongqing, P.R China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000019150 [doi]', '00005792-202002140-00067 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2020 Feb;99(7):e19150. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000019150.,,,,PMC7035079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Standardized phase angle has been shown to predict survival in solid malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. We investigated the predictive value of SPhA on 60-day mortality, overall survival (OS), and length of hospital stay (LHS) for adults with acute myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia (AML and ALL). Consecutive patients >/=18 years with newly diagnosed acute leukemia receiving intensive chemotherapy were enrolled. Phase angle measurements were taken on day 1 of therapy for all patients and on the day of nadir marrow for AML patients. Measurements were standardized by BMI, gender, and age to calculate the SPhA. The difference between SPhA at nadir bone marrow compared to day 1 of induction was used to calculate change in SPhA. A cutoff of 25th percentile was used to dichotomize baseline SPhA. Among 100 patients, 88% were AML, 56% were female, and mean age was 59 years. Though not statistically significant, OS by Kaplan-Meier analysis was shorter for those below the 25th percentile SPhA compared to those above (median OS: 11.0 months vs 19.5 months; P = .09).

Cladribine has activity in AML, and an enhancing effect on other cytostatic drugs thus may help overcome resistance. Here, we present the final analysis of our phase II trial evaluating safety and efficacy of cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin (CAI) in relapsed AML. METHODS: Patients with relapsed AML after at least 6 months remission received two courses of CAI. After 9 patients, prolonged neutropenia prompted protocol change (omission of idarubicin in 2nd course and dose-reduction of cytarabine). Primary endpoints were remission rate and safety. RESULTS: Twenty patients received treatment, fourteen one, and six two courses CAI/CA. After first course, complete remission (CR/CRi) was achieved in 60%. Most frequent toxicity was infection. Median OS was 8.8 months in all patients and 21.1 months in those with CR. Nine patients (48%) proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), four of those are still alive and in CR, accounting for a 5-year survival rate of 55% of transplanted patients. CONCLUSION: Cladribine, cytarabine, and idarubicin in relapsed AML is feasible and induces good response rates. As expected, infections are the most important complication. However, combined with allo-SCT, long-term survival can be achieved in a substantial number of patients.","['Mayer, Karin', 'Hahn-Ast, Corinna', 'Schwab, Katjana', 'Schmidt-Wolf, Ingo G H', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Glasmacher, Axel', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie']","['Mayer K', 'Hahn-Ast C', 'Schwab K', 'Schmidt-Wolf IGH', 'Brossart P', 'Glasmacher A', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie/Onkologie/Rheumatologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie/Onkologie/Rheumatologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie/Onkologie/Rheumatologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Abteilung fur Integrierte Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie/Onkologie/Rheumatologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie/Onkologie/Rheumatologie, Universitatsklinikum Bonn, Bonn, Germany.', 'Klinik fur Innere Medizin II, Abteilung fur Hamatologie und Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Institut fur Naturstoff-Forschung und Infektionsbiologie, Hans-Knoll Institut, Jena, Germany.', 'Center for Sepsis Control and Care (CSCC), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",20200310,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/13 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13395 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2020 Jun;104(6):538-545. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13395.

Herein, we identify a molecular mechanism responsible for reciprocal activation between Aurora B kinase (AURKB) and MYC. AURKB directly phosphorylates MYC at serine 67, counteracting GSK3beta-directed threonine 58 phosphorylation and subsequent FBXW7-mediated proteasomal degradation. Stabilized MYC, in concert with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (TAL1), directly activates AURKB transcription, constituting a positive feedforward loop that reinforces MYC-regulated oncogenic programs. Therefore, inhibitors of AURKB induce prominent MYC degradation concomitant with robust leukemia cell death. These findings reveal an AURKB-MYC regulatory circuit that underlies T cell leukemogenesis, and provide a rationale for therapeutic targeting of oncogenic MYC via AURKB inhibition.","['Jiang, Jue', 'Wang, Jingchao', 'Yue, Ming', 'Cai, Xiaolian', 'Wang, Tianci', 'Wu, Chao', 'Su, Hexiu', 'Wang, Yanwu', 'Han, Meng', 'Zhang, Yingchi', 'Zhu, Xiaofan', 'Jiang, Peng', 'Li, Peng', 'Sun, Yonghua', 'Xiao, Wuhan', 'Feng, Hui', 'Qing, Guoliang', 'Liu, Hudan']","['Jiang J', 'Wang J', 'Yue M', 'Cai X', 'Wang T', 'Wu C', 'Su H', 'Wang Y', 'Han M', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhu X', 'Jiang P', 'Li P', 'Sun Y', 'Xiao W', 'Feng H', 'Qing G', 'Liu H']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China; Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China; Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Central Hospital of Wuhan, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430014, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology and Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology and Division of Pediatric Blood Diseases Center, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Beijing 100084, China.', 'South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510530, China.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Innovation Academy for Seed Design, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan 430072, China.', 'Departments of Pharmacology and Medicine, Section of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02118, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China; Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China; Frontier Science Center for Immunology and Metabolism, Medical Research Institute, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430071, China.

Overexpression of CDK9 has been reported in several diseases, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and malignant melanoma. Recent research revealed that CDK9-inhibitors have a major impact on the induction of apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. Despite surprisingly promising results in in vitro and in vivo research, no CDK9 related therapy is currently allowed in cases of HCC. Furthermore, due to their high specificity, the inhibitors had no effects on unaltered hepatocytes and no toxic effects were shown. Considering that they were well tolerated and showed relatively few severe side-effects in mice, CDK9- inhibitors would seem to be promising targets in HCC biomarker-guided immunotherapy. Studies have verified that CDK9 has a pivotal role in c-Myc-mediated tumor growth and CDK9 inhibitors inhibit not only its progression but diametrically decrease both the mass and size of HCC nodules. CDK9-inhibitors seem to be a promising target in HCC treatment.","['Borowczak, Jedrzej', 'Szczerbowski, Krzysztof', 'Stec, Ewa', 'Grzanka, Dariusz', 'Szylberg, Lukasz']","['Borowczak J', 'Szczerbowski K', 'Stec E', 'Grzanka D', 'Szylberg L']","['Department of Clinical Pathomorphology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pathomorphology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pathomorphology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pathomorphology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pathomorphology, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pathomorphology, Military Clinical Hospital, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Curr Cancer Drug Targets,Current cancer drug targets,101094211,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy']",2020/02/13 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['CCDT-EPUB-104445 [pii]', '10.2174/1568009620666200212124357 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 2020;20(5):318-324. doi: 10.2174/1568009620666200212124357.,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK9', '*HCC', '*P-TEFb', '*c-Myc', '*inhibitors', '*therapy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only approximately 40% of such patients typically proceed to HCT. METHODS: We used a prospective organized approach to rapidly identify donors to improve the allogeneic HCT rate in adults with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia in CR1. Newly diagnosed patients had cytogenetics obtained at enrollment, and those with high-risk cytogenetics underwent expedited HLA typing and were encouraged to be referred for consultation with a transplantation team with the goal of conducting an allogeneic HCT in CR1. RESULTS: Of 738 eligible patients (median age, 49 years; range, 18-60 years of age), 159 (22%) had high-risk cytogenetics and 107 of these patients (67%) achieved CR1. Seventy (65%) of the high-risk patients underwent transplantation in CR1 (P < .001 compared with the historical rate of 40%). Median time to HCT from CR1 was 77 days (range, 20-356 days). In landmark analysis, overall survival (OS) among patients who underwent transplantation was significantly better compared with that of patients who did not undergo transplantation (2-year OS, 48% v 35%, respectively [P = .031]). Median relapse-free survival after transplantation in the high-risk cohort who underwent transplantation in CR1 (n = 70) was 11.5 months (range, 4-47 months), and median OS after transplantation was 14 months (range, 4-44 months). CONCLUSION: Early cytogenetic testing with an organized effort to identify a suitable allogeneic HCT donor led to a CR1 transplantation rate of 65% in the high-risk group, which, in turn, led to an improvement in OS when compared with the OS of patients who did not undergo transplantation.","['Pagel, John M', 'Othus, Megan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Fang, Min', 'Radich, Jerald P', 'Rizzieri, David A', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Strickland, Stephen A', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Savoie, M Lynn', 'Spellman, Stephen R', 'Confer, Dennis L', 'Chell, Jeffrey W', 'Brown, Maria', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Lin, Tara L', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Bayer, Ruthee-Lu', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Claxton, David', 'Essell, James', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Mohan, Sanjay R', 'Moseley, Anna', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R']","['Pagel JM', 'Othus M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Fang M', 'Radich JP', 'Rizzieri DA', 'Marcucci G', 'Strickland SA', 'Litzow MR', 'Savoie ML', 'Spellman SR', 'Confer DL', 'Chell JW', 'Brown M', 'Medeiros BC', 'Sekeres MA', 'Lin TL', 'Uy GL', 'Powell BL', 'Bayer RL', 'Larson RA', 'Stone RM', 'Claxton D', 'Essell J', 'Luger SM', 'Mohan SR', 'Moseley A', 'Erba HP', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, WA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN.', 'National Marrow Donor Program, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'University of Kansas, Westwood, KS.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO.', 'Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Monter Cancer Center, Northwell Health System, Lake Success, NY.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Pennsylvania State Milton S.

Substantial progress has been made as we began to understand and address the multifaceted drivers behind this outcome disparity. New insights into the biology of B-cell ALL have uncovered distinct genetic characteristics more commonly found in AYAs that affect prognosis. Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved with the use of pediatric-inspired protocols in the front-line setting, as well as antibody-based and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies in the relapsed and refractory setting. Guided by the incorporation of minimal residual disease testing to inform clinical decision making, these represent major paradigm shifts in management. Efforts to design clinical trials geared toward AYAs and to enroll AYAs in available clinical trials will ensure ongoing progress.

There is growing evidence that microRNAs (miRNAs) provide prognostic information in AML. MiR-204 has a tumor suppressor function, and several studies have proven its role in solid cancers. The aim of this work is to evaluate the level of expression of miR-204 in adults newly diagnosed with AML with normal karyotype and to correlate its level of expression with disease outcome and different prognostic factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 87 adult patients newly diagnosed with AML. Detection of miR-204 was done using RT-PCR in patients and seven age-matched controls. RESULTS: Acute myeloid leukemia patients showed significantly lower miR-204 expression, compared to control group (P = .029). Low miR-204 expression was significantly associated with positive CD34 (P = .017), with poor performance status (PS) (P = .009), and with the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (P = .014). Low expression of miR-204 was also significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (P = .020) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = .013). Low miR-204 expression was identified as an independent prognostic factor for prediction of shorter OS (P = .034) and DFS (P = .027) in AML. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge; this is the first time to prove the correlation between miR-204 expression and CD34 expression. Further study of this correlation is needed to confirm the role of miR-204 in CD34-positive cells, including leukemic stem cells. This correlation may have therapeutic implications. MiR-204 can be used as a biomarker for PS in AML patients.","['Abdelhafiz, Ahmed S', 'Elsayed, Ghada M', 'Saber, Magdy M', 'Gameel, Abdallah', 'Hamdy, Nayera']","['Abdelhafiz AS', 'Elsayed GM', 'Saber MM', 'Gameel A', 'Hamdy N']","['Department of Clinical pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20200212,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MIRN204 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis']",2020/02/13 06:00,2021/01/01 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.13161 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2020 Jun;42(3):263-269. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.13161.

A quad microraft array-based platform was developed to perform semi-automated cell sampling, bioassay, and banking on ultra-small sample sizes. The system biopsies and collects colony fragments, quantifies intracellular protein levels via immunostaining, and then retrieves the living mother colonies based on the fragments' immunoassay outcome. To accomplish this, a magnetic, microwell-based plate was developed to mate directly above the microraft array and capture colony fragments with a one-to-one spatial correspondence to their mother colonies. Using the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) model pathway in basophilic leukemia cells, the system was used to sort cells based on the amount of intracellular STAT3 protein phosphorylation (pSTAT3). Colonies were detected on quad arrays using bright field microscopy with 96 +/- 20% accuracy (true-positive rate), 49 +/- 3% of the colonies were identified as originating from a single cell, and the majority (95 +/- 3%) of biopsied clonal fragments were successfully collected into the microwell plate for immunostaining. After assay, biopsied fragments were matched back to their mother colonies and mother colonies with fragments possessing the greatest and least pSTAT3/STAT3 were resampled for expansion and downstream biological assays for pSTAT3/STAT3 and immune granule exocytosis. This approach has the potential to enable colony screening and sorting based on assays not compatible with cell viability, greatly expanding the cell selection criteria available to identify cells with unique phenotypes for subsequent biomedical research.","['Smiddy, Nicole M', 'DiSalvo, Matthew', 'Allbritton-King, Jules D', 'Allbritton, Nancy L']","['Smiddy NM', 'DiSalvo M', 'Allbritton-King JD', 'Allbritton NL']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200212,England,Analyst,The Analyst,0372652,['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunoassay/instrumentation/*methods', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetics', '*Microarray Analysis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/12/29 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/d0an00030b [doi]'],ppublish,Analyst. 2020 Apr 7;145(7):2649-2660. doi: 10.1039/d0an00030b.

However, its recommended daily dose in different products varies widely. Besides, it is unknown whether, and how, GABA consumption during early pregnancy influences pregnancy establishment. In this study, we found that when pregnant mice were treated with a high (12.5 mg/g) dose of GABA (orally) during preimplantation, there was a reduction in the number of implantation sites on day 5 of pregnancy. Also, among these unimplanted embryos, most exhibited morphological degeneration and developmental retardation, and only a few of them developed into blastocysts but could not implant into the uterus. Moreover, the expression of uterine receptivity-related factors-LIF, E-cadherin, and HOXA10-were all downregulated, while the number of uterine glands was reduced in the high GABA dose group. Finally, in vitro results demonstrated that GABA (ranging from 10 to 50 mug/muL) markedly inhibited preimplantation embryo development in a dose-response manner. However, this inhibitory effect was not observed when the embryos were pretreated with 40 muMu 2-hydroxysaclofen, a GABAB antagonist, indicating that GABA exerts its inhibitory effects via its B-type receptor. Our results suggest that exposure to certain GABA concentrations, during early pregnancy, can impair preimplantation embryo development via its B-type receptor, and endometrial receptivity, which greatly disturbs early embryo implantation in mice. These findings could raise concerns about GABA consumption during the early stages of pregnancy.","['Tian, Na', 'Liang, Hao', 'Luo, Wenping', 'Wang, Xiaojie', 'Cao, Ke', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Tan, Yi', 'Tan, Dongmei']","['Tian N', 'Liang H', 'Luo W', 'Wang X', 'Cao K', 'Zhang Q', 'Tan Y', 'Tan D']","['Laboratory Animal Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', ""Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, National Clinical Research Center for Child Health and Disorders, China International Science and Technology Cooperation Base of Child Development and Critical Disorders, Pediatric Research Institute, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China."", 'Laboratory Animal Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Chongqing Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases and Biomedical Sciences, Stomatological Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Laboratory Animal Center, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200211,United States,J Biochem Mol Toxicol,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,9717231,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (GABA-B Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '164384-16-1 (Hoxa10 protein, mouse)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)', 'H789N3FKE8 (Baclofen)', 'X5IFR0UF10 (2-hydroxysaclofen)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Baclofen/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Embryonic Development/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'GABA-B Receptor Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*administration & dosage']",2020/02/13 06:00,2021/01/08 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jbt.22473 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem Mol Toxicol. 2020 May;34(5):e22473. doi: 10.1002/jbt.22473.

This study conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate whether being delivered by CS would influence the onset of childhood leukemia. METHODS: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched from 3rd June, 1950 to 13th October, 2019 to identify the literature, which examined the relationship between CS and childhood leukemia. This study used Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the quality of literature. Subgroup analyses were conducted on region, mode of delivery, design of the study and number of confounders adjusted. Egger's test and Begg's test were performed to evaluate possible publication bias. RESULTS: The pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates illustrated that children delivered by CS had a higher risk of developing leukemia [OR 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.17, P = 0.002] and lymphoblastic leukemia (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23, P = 0.009), while a significant association for myeloid leukemia was not observed (OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.92-1.20, P = 0.451). Results of subgroup analyses indicated that elective CS would increase the risk of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.27, P = 0.002). However, a statistical relationship between emergency CS and lymphoblastic leukemia was not observed (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.23, P = 0.364). CONCLUSIONS: CS would increase the risk of childhood lymphoblastic leukemia. It is worth noting that subgroup analyses shows that elective CS rather than emergency CS increases the risk of lymphoblastic leukemia in offspring.","['Jiang, Li-Li', 'Gao, Yin-Yan', 'He, Wen-Bo', 'Gan, Ting', 'Shan, Hou-Qian', 'Han, Xue-Mei']","['Jiang LL', 'Gao YY', 'He WB', 'Gan T', 'Shan HQ', 'Han XM']","['School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 73000, China.', 'School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 73000, China.', 'School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 73000, China.', 'School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 73000, China.', 'School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 73000, China.', 'School of Public Health, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 73000, China. xmhanlzu@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20200211,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,,IM,"['Cesarean Section/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk']",2020/02/13 06:00,2021/08/24 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12519-020-00338-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12519-020-00338-4 [pii]']",ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2020 Oct;16(5):471-479. doi: 10.1007/s12519-020-00338-4.

Since existing therapies outside of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are not curative, there is a growing interest in incorporating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as meaningful endpoints for these patients in research and clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Currently, there are limited numbers of studies reporting the impact of MDS therapeutics on PROs to guide clinical decision-making and increase patient satisfaction. However, clinical trials that have incorporated QoL outcomes have demonstrated positive results with the use of growth factors, hypomethylating agents, and lenalidomide. Here we review and highlight the importance of harnessing the power of PROs as part of a comprehensive efficacy evaluation to ultimately deliver superior patient-centered care across the spectrum of MDS. As our understanding of MDS continues to increase, adapting the metrics of these outcome measurements will be equally important as the alteration of the natural history in developing new therapies.","['Barot, Shimoli V', 'Patel, Bhumika J', 'Gerds, Aaron T']","['Barot SV', 'Patel BJ', 'Gerds AT']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, 9500 Euclid Avenue, CA-6, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA. patelb3@ccf.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, 9500 Euclid Avenue, CA-6, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,,IM,"['Health Status', 'Humans', '*Longevity', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', '*Patient Reported Outcome Measures', '*Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00562-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00562-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Apr;15(2):149-154. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00562-9.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MDS', '*Myelodysplastic syndromes', '*PRO', '*Patient-reported outcomes', '*QoL, health-related quality of life']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This includes mesenchymal stem cells supporting growth and preventing apoptosis, and altered action and secretion profiles of other niche components including adipocytes, endothelial cells and T cells. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the current understanding of the AML bone marrow microenvironment. Clinical trials of agents that mobilise leukaemic stem cells from the bone marrow are currently ongoing and show early promise.

According to the World Health Organization classification, CLL is an indolent Bcell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Diagnosis requires an increase of Blymphocytes to more than 5.0G/l as well as detection of CD5- and CD19-positive Blymphocytes. Symptoms can be B symptoms, fatigue or frequent infections. Therapy is only required if there are pronounced symptoms or changes in the blood count, such as a relevant drop in hemoglobin and/or platelets. The prognosis strongly depends on the individual molecular and cytogenetic risk factors. For a long time, the first-line treatment was characterized by chemotherapy in combination with CD20 antibodies.

However, the contribution of PBX3 to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains unclear. In this study, we found that PBX3 expression was significantly upregulated in PTC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and high levels of PBX3 were correlated with tumor size, lymphatic metastasis, TMN stage, and poor prognosis of PTC patients. Overexpression of PBX3 in PTC cell lines promoted cell proliferation. Consistently, knockdown of PBX3 by shRNA induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, PBX3 promoted PTC cell proliferation and angiogenesis through activation of AT1R/VEGFR2 pathway while overexpression of AT1R and treatment with VEGFA reversed PBX3-shRNA-induced decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and its downstream (ERK1/2, AKT and Src). It demonstrated that PBX3 could be used as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PTC.","['Chen, Qin', 'Yu, Wen-Ying', 'Zhang, Huan-Huan', 'Zhang, Song-Zhao', 'Fang, Jie', 'Wu, Fang', 'Ying, Hua-Zhong', 'Yu, Chen-Huan']","['Chen Q', 'Yu WY', 'Zhang HH', 'Zhang SZ', 'Fang J', 'Wu F', 'Ying HZ', 'Yu CH']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Experimental Animal and Safety Evaluation, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou 310013, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Experimental Animal and Safety Evaluation, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou 310013, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Experimental Animal and Safety Evaluation, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou 310013, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Experimental Animal and Safety Evaluation, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou 310013, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Experimental Animal and Safety Evaluation, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou 310013, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Experimental Animal and Safety Evaluation, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, Hangzhou 310013, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200125,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '146150-81-4 (proto-oncogene protein Pbx3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KDR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (MAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/*metabolism']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2020/8954513 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2020 Jan 25;2020:8954513. doi: 10.1155/2020/8954513. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3168-9472', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8260-1624', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2617-4706']",,['Copyright (c) 2020 Qin Chen et al.'],PMC7007751,,,,,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While prognosis is good, recurrence of disease can occur. Gastrointestinal relapse, including intussusception, is well-described but the absence of abdominal pain in this setting is rare. CASE SUMMARY: We report a 13-year-old male with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission presenting with anemia and weight loss. Examination was significant for absence of abdominal pain, but a stool sample was positive for occult blood. Pan-endoscopy was performed with colonoscopy revealing a mass filling the colonic lumen. Biopsy of the mass confirmed recurrence of recurrent B-cell lymphoma. Computed tomography scan revealed ileocolic intussusception resulting from the tumor. This case is unusual in that the patient had no abdominal pain despite the presence of intussusception. CONCLUSION: While intestinal involvement with lymphoma has been well described in the literature, presentation as painless intussusception has not been reported. This case report highlights the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of recurrent B-cell lymphoma involving the gastrointestinal tract, in particular the near absence of symptoms despite the finding of intussusception.","['Giroux, Parker', 'Collier, Anderson', 'Nowicki, Michael']","['Giroux P', 'Collier A', 'Nowicki M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, United States.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, United States.', 'Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS 39216, United States. mnowicki@umc.edu.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],,United States,World J Clin Cases,World journal of clinical cases,101618806,,,,2020/02/13 06:00,2020/02/13 06:01,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12998/wjcc.v8.i2.306 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Clin Cases. 2020 Jan 26;8(2):306-312. doi: 10.12998/wjcc.v8.i2.306.,,,"['(c)The Author(s) 2020.

In this report, we investigate the effect of T-cell leukemia lymphoma 6 (TCL6) on paclitaxel (PTX)-induced apoptosis in Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. Methods: Expression levels of TCL6 in RCC tissues were analyzed via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to detect the expression of TCL6 in RCC tissues and cells. Two pairs of cell lines were used: TCL6-silenced 786-O cell line and scrambled 786-O cell line, TCL6-overexpressed Caki-1 cell line and Caki-1 scrambled cell line. Cell viability was detected using the MTT assay. Apoptosis was examined by flow cemetery. Dual reporter gene assay was performed to confirm the direct downstream target miRNA of TCL6. Results: Based on RNA sequencing expression data of RCC tissues from TCGA and GEO datasets, the expression deficiency of TCL6 was observed in RCC tissues. Low level of TCL6 was associated with worse overall and disease-free survival of RCC patients. The FISH showed similar results with low expression of TCL6 in RCC tissues and cells. After PTX treatment, a time-dependent decrease in cell viability was observed in TCL6-overexpressed RCC cells and an increase in cell viability was observed in TCL6-silenced cells compared to control cells. Apoptosis induced by PTX was significantly increased in TCL6-overexpressed cells. Inhibition of TCL6 showed a significant decrease in apoptosis. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay revealed that TCL6 is a direct target gene of miR-221. Conclusions: TCL6 effectively sensitizes RCC to PTX mainly through downregulation of miR-221. Our results suggest that PTX combined with TCL6 might be a potentially more effective chemotherapeutic approach for renal cancer.","['Chen, Zhizhao', 'Zhuang, Quan', 'Cheng, Ke', 'Ming, Yingzi', 'Zhao, Yujun', 'Ye, Qifa', 'Zhang, Sheng']","['Chen Z', 'Zhuang Q', 'Cheng K', 'Ming Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Ye Q', 'Zhang S']","['The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Wuhan University, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Institute of Hepatobiliary Diseases of Wuhan University, Transplant Center of Wuhan University, Hubei Key Laboratory of Medical Technology on Transplantation, Wuhan Hubei, China.', 'The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Wuhan University, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Institute of Hepatobiliary Diseases of Wuhan University, Transplant Center of Wuhan University, Hubei Key Laboratory of Medical Technology on Transplantation, Wuhan Hubei, China.', 'The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200101,Australia,J Cancer,Journal of Cancer,101535920,,,,2020/02/13 06:00,2020/02/13 06:01,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7150/jca.32552 [doi]', 'jcav11p1383 [pii]']",epublish,J Cancer. 2020 Jan 1;11(6):1383-1392. doi: 10.7150/jca.32552. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) The author(s).'],PMC6995388,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Chemotherapy.', 'Paclitaxel', 'Renal cell carcinoma']",,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, a genome-wide association study was performed for the genetic selection of egg production characters in lion head geese. We detected 30 single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in or near 30 genes that might be associated with egg production character, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to verify their expression level in lion head geese. The results showed that the expression levels of CRTC1 (encoding CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1), FAAH2 (encoding fatty acid amide hydrolase 2), GPC3 (encoding glypican 3), and SERPINC1 (encoding serpin family C member 1) in high egg production population were significantly lower than those in the low egg production populations (*P < 0.05). The expression levels of CLPB (encoding caseinolytic peptidase B protein homolog), GNA12 (encoding guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-12), and ZMAT5 (encoding zinc finger, matrin type 5) in the high egg production population were significantly higher than those in the low egg production populations (*P < 0.05). The expression of BMP4 (encoding bone morphogenetic protein 4), FRMPD3 (encoding FERM and PDZ domain containing 3), LIF (encoding leukemia inhibitory factor), and NFYC (encoding nuclear transcription factor Y subunit gamma) in the high egg production population were very significantly lower than those in the low egg production population (**P < 0.01).

ATIR101 is a haploidentical, naive cell-enriched T-cell product, depleted of recipient-alloreactive T cells to minimize the risk of GvHD and provide graft-versus-infection and -leukemia activity. Safety and efficacy of ATIR101 administered after T-cell-depleted haploidentical HSCT (TCD-haplo + ATIR101) without posttransplant immunosuppressors were evaluated in a Phase 2, multicenter study of 23 patients with acute leukemia and compared with an observational cohort undergoing TCD-haplo alone (n = 35), matched unrelated donor (MUD; n = 64), mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD; n = 37), and umbilical cord blood (UCB; n = 22) HSCT. The primary endpoint, 6-month non-relapse mortality (NRM), was 13% with TCD-haplo + ATIR101. One year post HSCT, TCD-haplo + ATIR101 resulted in lower NRM versus TCD-haplo alone (P = 0.008). GvHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) was higher with TCD-haplo + ATIR101 versus MMUD and UCB (both P < 0.03; 1-year rates: 56.5%, 27.0%, and 22.7%, respectively) and was not statistically different from MUD (1 year: 40.6%). ATIR101 grafts with high third-party reactivity were associated with fewer clinically relevant viral infections. Results suggest that haploidentical, selective donor-cell depletion may eliminate requirements for posttransplant immunosuppressors without increasing GvHD risk, with similar GRFS to MUD. Following these results, a randomized Phase 3 trial versus posttransplant cyclophosphamide had been initiated.","['Roy, Denis Claude', 'Walker, Irwin', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Lewalle, Philippe', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Selleslag, Dominik', 'Lachance, Sylvie', 'Buyse, Marc', 'Wang, Kun', 'Rovers, Jeroen', 'Santi, Irene', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Sandler, Andrew', 'Velthuis, Jurjen', 'Mielke, Stephan']","['Roy DC', 'Walker I', 'Maertens J', 'Lewalle P', 'Olavarria E', 'Selleslag D', 'Lachance S', 'Buyse M', 'Wang K', 'Rovers J', 'Santi I', 'Bonig H', 'Sandler A', 'Velthuis J', 'Mielke S']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. denis-claude.roy@umontreal.ca.', 'Juravinski Hospital and Cancer Centre, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'KU Leuven, Microbiology Immunology & Transplantation, Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology, and Department of Hematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Jules Bordet Institut, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Centre for Haematology, Imperial College London at Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.', 'AZ Sint Jan Brugge-Oostende, Brugge, Belgium.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, Division of Hematology & Oncology, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'International Drug Development Institute, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.', 'International Drug Development Institute, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium.', 'DC Prime, Leiden, Netherlands.', 'Kiadis Pharma, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University and German Red Cross Blood Service Baden-Wurttemberg-Hesse, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Kiadis Pharma, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Kiadis Pharma, Amsterdam, Netherlands.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Center of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg University Medical Center, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, CAST, Karolinska Institute and University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200211,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*mortality/pathology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Unrelated Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0733-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0733-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jul;34(7):1907-1923. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0733-0.

Vitamin D sufficient mice died earlier (p = 0.003) compared to vitamin D deficient (VDD) mice. Vitamin A deficient (VAD) mice fared worst with more rapid disease progression and decreased survival. Mice deficient for vitamins A and D (VADD) had disease progression similar to VAD mice. Regulatory T cells, previously shown to associate with poor BCR-ABL leukemia control, were present at higher frequencies among CD4(+) splenocytes of vitamin A deficient vs. sufficient mice. In vitro studies demonstrated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2VD3) increased the number of BCR-ABL ALL cells only when co-cultured with bone marrow stroma. 1,25(OH)2VD3 induced CXCL12 expression in vivo and in vitro in stromal cells and CXCL12 increased stromal migration and the number of BCR-ABL blasts. Vitamin D plus leukemia reprogrammed the marrow increasing production of collagens, potentially trapping ALL blasts. Vitamin A (all trans retinoic acid, ATRA) treated leukemic cells had increased apoptosis, decreased cells in S-phase, and increased cells in G0/G1. ATRA signaled through the retinoid X receptor to decrease BCR-ABL leukemic cell viability. In conclusion, vitamin A and D deficiencies have opposing effects on mouse survival from BCR-ABL ALL.","['Annu, Kavya', 'Cline, Cynthia', 'Yasuda, Kazuto', 'Ganguly, Samit', 'Pesch, Andrea', 'Cooper, Brittany', 'Janke, Laura', 'Payton, Monique', 'Mukherjee, Kamalika', 'Surman, Sherri L', 'Hurwitz, Julia L', 'Schuetz, Erin G']","['Annu K', 'Cline C', 'Yasuda K', 'Ganguly S', 'Pesch A', 'Cooper B', 'Janke L', 'Payton M', 'Mukherjee K', 'Surman SL', 'Hurwitz JL', 'Schuetz EG']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. erin.schuetz@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200211,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/drug effects/metabolism', 'Vitamin A/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vitamin D/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59101-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59101-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 11;10(1):2359. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59101-4.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7312-2947', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0228-8792', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2505-8738']",['R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7012907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of IGHV mutations distinguishes mutated (M) CLL with a markedly superior prognosis from unmutated (UM) CLL cases. In addition, B cell antigen receptor (BCR) stereotypes as defined by IGHV usage and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) classify approximately 30% of CLL cases into prognostically important subsets. Subset 2 expresses a BCR with the combination of IGHV3-21-derived heavy chains (HCs) with IGLV3-21-derived light chains (LCs), and is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Importantly, the subset 2 LC carries a single-point mutation, termed R110, at the junction between the variable and constant LC regions. By analyzing 4 independent clinical cohorts through BCR sequencing and by immunophenotyping with antibodies specifically recognizing wild-type IGLV3-21 and R110-mutated IGLV3-21 (IGLV3-21(R110)), we show that IGLV3-21(R110)-expressing CLL represents a distinct subset with poor prognosis independent of IGHV mutations. Compared with other alleles, only IGLV3-21*01 facilitates effective homotypic BCR-BCR interaction that results in autonomous, oncogenic BCR signaling after acquiring R110 as a single-point mutation. Presumably, this mutation acts as a standalone driver that transforms IGLV3-21*01-expressing B cells to develop CLL. Thus, we propose to expand the conventional definition of CLL subset 2 to subset 2L by including all IGLV3-21(R110)-expressing CLL cases regardless of IGHV mutational status.

Age-related narrowing of T-cells repertoire and expansion of immune or autoimmune clones may lead to false-positive results. The objective of this study was to evaluate the specificity and positive predictive value of PCR-based clonality assessment for a differential diagnostics of T-LGL leukemia. Rearrangements of TCRG and TCRB genes using the BIOMED-2 protocol were assessed in healthy individuals including the elderly (n = 62) and patients with rheumatic diseases (n = 14), transitory reactive CD8+ lymphocytosis (n = 17), and T-LGL leukemia (n = 42). Monoclonal TCRG/TCRB rearrangements in blood were identified in 11.3%/4.8% (7/3 of 62) of healthy individuals; 21.4%/14.3% (3/2 of 14) of patients with rheumatic diseases, and 17.6%/11.8% (3/2 of 17) of patients with reactive lymphocytosis. Immunomagnetic selection of lymphocytes in healthy individuals (31 of 33) revealed that clonal T-cells belong to CD8+ and CD57+ population. No clonal Vbeta-Jbeta TCRB rearrangements were found in the control group, only Dbeta-Jbeta TCRB and TCRG. Given the high detectability (96.7%) of Vbeta-Jbeta TCRB monoclonal rearrangements in patients with alphabeta-T-LGL leukemia, this marker had the greatest specificity and positive predictive value (100%; 99.2%). The presence of clonal CD8+CD57+ cells in blood is common for healthy individuals and patients with reactive conditions and may not associate with any malignancy. Different specificity of TCRG/ Dbeta-Jbeta TRB/ Vbeta-Jbeta TCRB PCR reactions should be taken into account for T-cell clonality data interpretation.","['Sidorova, Yulia V', 'Sychevskaya, Kseniya A', 'Chernova, Nataliya G', 'Julhakyan, Hunan L', 'Smirnova, Svetlana Ju', 'Ryzhikova, Nataliya V', 'Gorodetskiy, Vadim R', 'Naumova, Elena V', 'Sudarikov, Andrey B']","['Sidorova YV', 'Sychevskaya KA', 'Chernova NG', 'Julhakyan HL', 'Smirnova SJ', 'Ryzhikova NV', 'Gorodetskiy VR', 'Naumova EV', 'Sudarikov AB']","['National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.

Fifty subjects (control group) underwent laparoscopic adenomyoma excision and received gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and 201 subjects (experimental group) underwent laparoscopic adenomyoma resection and received GnRH agonists combined with the LNG-IUS. Pipelle endometrial biopsies were obtained in the mid-luteal phase, before the operation, and 19 months after the operation. Menstrual blood loss was measured using a pictorial blood loss assessment chart. Pain intensity during menstruation was evaluated on a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). The volume of uterus was measured through ultrasound. Quantification of HOXA10 promoter methylation was performed through bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction (BSP). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analyzed the expression levels of endometrial HOXA10-mRNA and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-mRNA. After surgery, the scores for dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia were significantly improved, and the volume of the uterus was obviously reduced (all p < 0.01). The mean number of methylated CpG sites, level of endometrial HOXA10-mRNA, and level of endometrial LIF-mRNA were 5.6 +/- 1.7 versus 3.9 +/- 1.3, 0.8 +/- 0.2 versus 0.9 +/- 0.3, and 0.8 +/- 0.2 versus 1.0 +/- 0.2, respectively, in the control group versus the experimental group at 19 months after surgery, and significant improvements were observed in the experimental group (p < 0.001, p = 0.034, p < 0.001). Laparoscopic adenomyoma excision and GnRH agonists can alleviate the symptoms, reduce the number of methylated CpG sites in HOXA10, and improve endometrial HOXA10-mRNA and endometrial LIF-mRNA levels. When combined with subsequent use of the LNG-IUS, better efficacy can be achieved.","['Wu, Qing', 'Lian, Yawan', 'Chen, Lifeng', 'Yu, Yan', 'Lin, Tan']","['Wu Q', 'Lian Y', 'Chen L', 'Yu Y', 'Lin T']","[""Department of Gynecology, Zhejiang Provincial Peoples' Hospital, Peoples' Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fujian Huian Hospital, Quanzhou, 362100, Fujian, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Zhejiang Provincial Peoples' Hospital, Peoples' Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gynecology, Zhejiang Provincial Peoples' Hospital, Peoples' Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College, Hangzhou, 310014, Zhejiang, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Clinical Medical School of Fujian Medical University, 134 East Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, People's Republic of China. okwq31@sina.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200106,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Contraceptive Agents, Female)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)', '5W7SIA7YZW (Levonorgestrel)']",IM,"['Adenomyoma/drug therapy/metabolism/*surgery', 'Adult', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Contraceptive Agents, Female/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gynecologic Surgical Procedures', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intrauterine Devices, Medicated', 'Laparoscopy', 'Levonorgestrel/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Uterine Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*surgery']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s43032-019-00130-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s43032-019-00130-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2020 Jun;27(6):1259-1265. doi: 10.1007/s43032-019-00130-4.

We hypothesize that large intramural leiomyomas (IM) decrease the expression of endometrial implantation factors during the window of implantation. We prospectively recruited sub-fertile patients with IM 3 cm or greater in size planning myomectomy and performed endometrial biopsies the day of planned myomectomy (n = 9). Preoperative screening demonstrated no intercavitary lesions. Control endometrial samples were obtained from young, normally menstruating women free of uterine leiomyomas (n = 8). Endometrial samples were obtained in the mid-secretory phase (average cycle day for control patients and intramural leiomyoma patients were 24.5 and 21.3, respectively). Expression of implantation markers HOXA10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ER-alpha, and PR was compared using quantitative immunohistochemistry. Standard descriptive statistics were used to compare H-scores between the cohorts. Patients with intramural leiomyomas were found to have decreased LIF compared to controls (p value < 0.001). Expressions of HOXA10 and PR were no different between cohorts; however, ER-alpha showed a trend toward increased expression in the fibroid cohort (p value 0.07). LIF is downregulated in the endometrium of patients with large IM. This study is among the first to show decreased LIF expression in patients with uterine leiomyomas. We hypothesize that this difference from previously published work is due to sampling the endometrium at the height of LIF expression. Further work is needed to show if LIF downregulation is corrected with leiomyoma resection.","['Pier, Bruce', 'Crellin, Christopher', 'Katre, Ashwini', 'Conner, Michael G', 'Novak, Lea', 'Young, Steven L', 'Arend, Rebecca']","['Pier B', 'Crellin C', 'Katre A', 'Conner MG', 'Novak L', 'Young SL', 'Arend R']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Tripler Army Medical Center, Jarrett White Road, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96859, USA. bruce.d.pier3.mil@mail.mil.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Tripler Army Medical Center, Jarrett White Road, Honolulu, Hawaii, 96859, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, USA.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Cell, Developmental and Integrative Biology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200101,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/metabolism', 'Female', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leiomyoma/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Progesterone/metabolism', 'Uterine Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/12/15 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s43032-019-00056-x [doi]', '10.1007/s43032-019-00056-x [pii]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2020 Feb;27(2):569-574. doi: 10.1007/s43032-019-00056-x.

Thanks to progress in chemotherapy protocols, ALL outcome has significantly improved. However, drug-resistance remains an unresolved issue in the treatment of ALL and toxic effects limit dose escalation of current chemotherapeutics. Therefore, the identification of novel targeted therapies to support conventional chemotherapy is required. The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is a conserved signaling axis involved in several physiological processes such as development, differentiation, and adult tissue homeostasis. As a result, deregulation of this cascade is closely related to initiation and progression of various types of cancers, including hematological malignancies. In particular, deregulation of this signaling network is involved in the transformation of healthy HSCs in leukemic stem cells (LSCs), as well as cancer cell multi-drug-resistance. This review highlights the recent findings on the role of Wnt/beta-catenin in hematopoietic malignancies and provides information on the current status of Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitors with respect to their therapeutic potential in the treatment of ALL.","['Chiarini, Francesca', 'Paganelli, Francesca', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Evangelisti, Camilla']","['Chiarini F', 'Paganelli F', 'Martelli AM', 'Evangelisti C']","['CNR Institute of Molecular Genetics ""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", Unit of Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 40136 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.', 'CNR Institute of Molecular Genetics ""Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza"", Unit of Bologna, 40136 Bologna, Italy.', 'IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 40136 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200207,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway']",2020/02/13 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/13 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21031098 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21031098 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Feb 7;21(3). pii: ijms21031098. doi: 10.3390/ijms21031098.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-5196-7260'],,,PMC7037748,,['NOTNLM'],"['Wnt/beta-catenin', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'hematopoietic stem cells', 'leukemic stem cells', 'signaling pathway', 'targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, there is no standard management of this complication. Here, we present a case report of pegylated asparaginase-induced hypertriglyceridemia and hepatotoxicity successfully treated with continuous intravenous infusion of insulin and heparin. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old male patient with lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia was treated with pegylated asparaginase. The patient developed severe hypertriglyceridemia. Supportive therapy with low-fat diet, fibric acids, and omega-3 fatty acids was not successful, and later, the patient developed high-grade hepatotoxicity. Like hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis, continuous intravenous infusion of insulin and heparin was initiated. The level of triglyceride and cholesterol decreased rapidly within 4 days. CONCLUSION: In case of severe pegylated asparaginase-induced hypertriglyceridemia, continuous intravenous infusion of insulin and heparin can reduce rapidly and safely the triglyceride level. Controlled trials are needed to address this important issue.","['Alakel, Nael', 'Heuschkel, Sandra', 'Balaian, Ekaterina', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Bornhauser, Martin']","['Alakel N', 'Heuschkel S', 'Balaian E', 'Rollig C', 'Bornhauser M']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany, nael.alakel@uniklinikum-dresden.de.', 'Klinik-Apotheke, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus an der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200211,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Diet, Fat-Restricted', 'Heparin/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hypertriglyceridemia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Insulin/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatitis/etiology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Triglycerides/blood']",2020/02/12 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['000505773 [pii]', '10.1159/000505773 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2019;64(4):210-214. doi: 10.1159/000505773.

Unlike this 2D culture, 3D scaffolds are more similar to the bone marrow microenvironment so can better simulate the drug effect on leukemia cells, which can benefit the preliminary screening of drugs for clinical use. For this purpose, the freeze-drying method was proposed for the fabrication of 3D scaffolds of graphene oxide/silk fibroin/carboxymethyl chitosan (GO/SF/CMCS). Experimental results show that these 3D scaffolds exhibit a better swelling ratio because of the embedding of GO. The improved hydrophilicity of the scaffolds brings about promoted adhesion and proliferation of leukemia cells. In contrast to the traditional 2D culture, leukemia cells in this 3D culture show stronger drug resistance, which is consistent with the previously reported clinical results. It implies that these 3D GO/SF/CMCS scaffolds can simulate well the in vivo bone marrow microenvironment, making it a promising platform for preliminary drug screening for clinical use.","['Shang, Zhi-Yu', 'Sun, Hao', 'Xiang, Hong-Fei', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Yu, Miao', 'Zhao, Huai-Song', 'Zhao, Chun-Ting', 'Long, Yun-Ze']","['Shang ZY', 'Sun H', 'Xiang HF', 'Zhang J', 'Yu M', 'Zhao HS', 'Zhao CT', 'Long YZ']","[""Collaborative Innovation Center for Nanomaterials & Devices, College of Physics, Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200428,England,Biomed Mater,"Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)",101285195,"['0 (Biocompatible Materials)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (carboxymethyl-chitosan)', '0 (graphene oxide)', '7782-42-5 (Graphite)', '9007-76-5 (Fibroins)', '9012-76-4 (Chitosan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Bombyx', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Chitosan/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Culture Media', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fibroins/chemistry', 'Graphite/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', '*Porosity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods', 'Tissue Scaffolds/chemistry', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1748-605X/ab74e2 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Mater. 2020 Apr 28;15(3):035016. doi: 10.1088/1748-605X/ab74e2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this method cannot be simply extrapolated to human ESCs/iPSCs that are principally stabilized in primed pluripotency and become primitive neuroepithelium-like cells in N2B27+2i/LIF culture. Here, we assessed iPSC reprogramming of fibroblasts from chimpanzee, our closest living relative, in N2B27+2i/LIF culture. Under this condition, chimpanzee cells formed alkaline phosphatase-positive dome-shaped colonies. The colony-forming cells could be stably expanded by serial passaging without a ROCK inhibitor. However, their gene expression was distinct from iPSCs and neuroepithelium. They expressed the OCT3/4 transgene and a subset of transcripts associated with pluripotency, mesenchymal-epithelial transition, and neural crest formation. These cells exhibited a differentiation potential into the three germ layers in vivo and in vitro. The current study demonstrated that iPSC reprogramming in N2B27+2i/LIF culture converted chimpanzee fibroblasts into a multipotent cancerous state with unique gene expression, but not fully pluripotent stem cells.","['Lin, Zachary Yu-Ching', 'Nakai, Risako', 'Hirai, Hirohisa', 'Kozuka, Daiki', 'Katayama, Seiya', 'Nakamura, Shin-Ichiro', 'Okada, Sawako', 'Kitajima, Ryunosuke', 'Imai, Hiroo', 'Okano, Hideyuki', 'Imamura, Masanori']","['Lin ZY', 'Nakai R', 'Hirai H', 'Kozuka D', 'Katayama S', 'Nakamura SI', 'Okada S', 'Kitajima R', 'Imai H', 'Okano H', 'Imamura M']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Molecular Biology Section, Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Molecular Biology Section, Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Molecular Biology Section, Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Biology Course, College of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University, Kakuma-machi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, 920-1192, Japan.', 'Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta-Tsukinowa-cho, Otsu, Shiga, 520-2192, Japan.', 'Molecular Biology Section, Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Molecular Biology Section, Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Molecular Biology Section, Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484-8506, Japan.', 'Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Molecular Biology Section, Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University, Inuyama, Aichi, 484-8506, Japan.

PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the effect of the ethyl acetate extract of the dried heartwood of Caesalpinia sappan L. (C-A-E) on induction of apoptosis and promotion of differentiation in vitro and anti-AML activity in vivo. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: The aqueous extract was sequentially separated with solvents of increasing polarity and the active fraction was determined through the inhibition potency. The inhibition of the active fraction on cell viability, proliferation and colony formation was performed in different AML cells. Induction of apoptosis and the promotion of differentiation were further determined. Then, the level of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and its potential role were assessed. Finally, anti-AML activity was evaluated in NOD/SCID mice. RESULTS: C-A-E exhibited the highest inhibition on the cell viability of HL-60 cells. Meanwhile, C-A-E significantly suppressed the proliferation and the colony formation ability of HL-60 and Kasumi-1 cells. Moreover, C-A-E significantly induced the apoptosis, which was partially reversed by Z-VAD-FMK. C-A-E also reduced the level of mitochondrial membrane potential, promoted the release of cytochrome C, decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio, and promoted the cleavage of caspase-9 and -3. In addition, Mdivi-1 (mitochondrial fission blocker) remarkably reduced the apoptosis caused by C-A-E. Meanwhile, C-A-E also induced the expression of Mff and Fis1 and increased the location of Drp1 in mitochondria. Furthermore, C-A-E obviously promoted the differentiation of AML cells characterized by the typic morphological changes, the increased NBT positive cells, as well as the increased CD11b and CD14 levels. Notably, C-A-E significantly enhanced the intracellular ROS level. Moreimportantly, C-A-E-mediated apoptosis and differentiation of HL-60 cells was significantly mitigated by NAC. Additionally, C-A-E also exhibited an obvious anti-AML effect in NOD/SCID mice with the injection of HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: C-A-E exhibited an inhibitory effect on AML cells by inducing mitochondrial apoptosis and promoting differentiation, both of which were highly correlated to the activation of ROS.","['Ma, Hao-Yue', 'Wang, Cheng-Qiang', 'He, Hui', 'Yu, Zan-Yang', 'Tong, Yao', 'Liu, Gen', 'Yang, Yu-Qi', 'Li, Li', 'Pang, Lei', 'Qi, Hong-Yi']","['Ma HY', 'Wang CQ', 'He H', 'Yu ZY', 'Tong Y', 'Liu G', 'Yang YQ', 'Li L', 'Pang L', 'Qi HY']","['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, 2 Tiansheng Road, Beibei District, Chongqing 400716, China.

Previously, we described the regulatory role of the LIF-trophoblast-IL10 axis in the process of macrophage deactivation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, the direct regulatory effects of LIF in macrophage and trophoblast cell function remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to examine whether and how LIF regulates the behavior of macrophages and trophoblast cells in response to pro-inflammatory stress factors. We found that LIF modulated the activating effects of interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in macrophages and trophoblast cells by reducing the phosphorylation levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (Stat1) and -5 (Stat5). Cell activation with IFNgamma inhibited cell invasion and migration but this immobilizing effect was abrogated when macrophages and trophoblast cells were deactivated with LIF; macrophage cell motility restitution could in part be explained by the positive effects of LIF in Stat3 activation and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) expression. Pharmacological inhibition of Stat1 and Stat3 indicated that IFNgamma-induced Stat1 activation mediated macrophage motility inhibition, and that cell motility in IFNgamma-activated macrophages is restored via LIF-induced Stat3 activation and Stat1 inhibition. Moreover, IFNgamma-induced TNFalpha gene expression was also abrogated by LIF through Stat1 inhibition and Stat3 activation. Finally, we have found that cell invasion of trophoblast cells is inhibited when they were cocultured with GM-CSF-differentiated, IFNgamma-stimulated macrophages. This effect, however, was inhibited when macrophages were exposed to LIF. Overall, this in vitro study reveals for the first time the anti-inflammatory and pro-gestational activities of LIF by acting directly on macrophages and trophoblast cells.","['Hamelin-Morrissette, Jovane', 'Dallagi, Angham', 'Girouard, Julie', 'Ravelojaona, Marion', 'Oufqir, Yassine', 'Vaillancourt, Cathy', 'Van Themsche, Celine', 'Carrier, Christian', 'Reyes-Moreno, Carlos']","['Hamelin-Morrissette J', 'Dallagi A', 'Girouard J', 'Ravelojaona M', 'Oufqir Y', 'Vaillancourt C', 'Van Themsche C', 'Carrier C', 'Reyes-Moreno C']","['Groupe de Recherche en Signalisation Cellulaire (GRSC), Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 4M3, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada.', 'Groupe de Recherche en Signalisation Cellulaire (GRSC), Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 4M3, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada.', 'Groupe de Recherche en Signalisation Cellulaire (GRSC), Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 4M3, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada.', 'Groupe de Recherche en Signalisation Cellulaire (GRSC), Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 4M3, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada.', 'Groupe de Recherche en Signalisation Cellulaire (GRSC), Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 4M3, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada.', ""Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada; Centre d'Excellence en Recherche sur les Maladies Orphelines - Fondation Courtois (CERMO-FC), Montreal, QC, H2X 3Y7, Canada; Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), Centre Armand-Frappier Sante Biotechnologie, Laval, QC, H7V 1B7, Canada; Reseau Intersectoriel de Recherche en Sante de l'Universite du Quebec (RISUQ), Laval, QC H7V 1B7, Canada."", ""Groupe de Recherche en Signalisation Cellulaire (GRSC), Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 4M3, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada; Centre d'Excellence en Recherche sur les Maladies Orphelines - Fondation Courtois (CERMO-FC), Montreal, QC, H2X 3Y7, Canada; Reseau Intersectoriel de Recherche en Sante de l'Universite du Quebec (RISUQ), Laval, QC H7V 1B7, Canada."", ""Centre Hospitalier Affilie Universitaire Regional de Trois-Rivieres (CHAUR-TR), Service d'Hemato-Oncologie, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 3R9, Canada."", ""Groupe de Recherche en Signalisation Cellulaire (GRSC), Universite du Quebec a Trois-Rivieres, departement de biologie medicale, Trois-Rivieres, QC, G8Z 4M3, Canada; Centre de Recherche Interuniversitaire en Reproduction et Developpement-Reseau Quebecois en Reproduction (CIRD-RQR), Universite de Montreal, St-Hyacinthe, QC, J2S 2M2, Canada; Centre d'Excellence en Recherche sur les Maladies Orphelines - Fondation Courtois (CERMO-FC), Montreal, QC, H2X 3Y7, Canada; Reseau Intersectoriel de Recherche en Sante de l'Universite du Quebec (RISUQ), Laval, QC H7V 1B7, Canada.

The objectives of this study were to assess measles immunity before considering vaccination in a cohort of allogeneic HCT long-term survivors and to identify the factors associated with seropositivity/seroprotection. One hundred and twenty-six patients who underwent transplantation between 1 and 39 years earlier (median, 9 years) were assessed for measles immunity. Measles IgG titers were determined with an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay. Seropositivity/seroprotection was defined by an IgG titer >16.5 UA/mL. Patients underwent transplantation with a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) or nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning in 46% of cases, mainly for acute leukemia (61%). Seventy-eight of the 126 patients (62%) were seropositive/seroprotected for measles. Among the seropositive patients, the patients who had been vaccinated before transplantation had a lower median IgG titer compared with those who had not (48 UA/mL versus 116 UA/mL). Myeloproliferative disorder, RIC or NMA conditioning, and absence of acute grade >/=II graft-versus-host disease were associated with seropositivity/seroprotection. With a 62% rate of seropositivity/seroprotection for measles at a median of 9 years after transplantation, our findings strongly support a systematic assessment of anti-measles antibody titers to avoid unnecessary vaccination in seroprotected patients.","['Robin, Christine', 'Mariaggi, Alice-Andree', 'Redjoul, Rabah', 'Leclerc, Mathieu', 'Beckerich, Florence', 'Cabanne, Ludovic', 'Pautas, Cecile', 'Maury, Sebastien', 'Rozenberg, Flore', 'Cordonnier, Catherine']","['Robin C', 'Mariaggi AA', 'Redjoul R', 'Leclerc M', 'Beckerich F', 'Cabanne L', 'Pautas C', 'Maury S', 'Rozenberg F', 'Cordonnier C']","['Hematology Department, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil, France; University Paris-Est-Creteil, Creteil, France.

Recently, it was reported that the published prediction equations cannot accurately predict a valid maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) value in cancer survivors. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish and to validate a new equation based on the 6MWT to predict VO2 peak in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. METHODS: A total of 200 childhood ALL survivors were enrolled in this study, among which 168 participants underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test and a 6MWT to assess their functional capacity and their cardiorespiratory fitness. In addition, participants completed a physical activity questionnaire. Participants were randomly divided in two groups to establish the equations (n = 118 (70%)) and to validate it (n = 50 (30%)). Multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine a new prediction equation for VO2 peak from 6MWT using clinical and specific variables related to the disease. The accuracy in between VO2 peak measured and VO2 peak predicted were assessed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS: The new establish clinical VO2 peak equation is: VO2 peak (mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) = (-0.283*age(years)) - (0.099*weight(kg)) + (0.071*6MWD(meters)) -(0.135*HR end(bpm)) + 22.789 with a mean bias of 2.67 mL.kg(-1).min(-1) (95% CI (-9.64 to 14.98)). The new establish disease-specific VO2 peak equation is: VO2 peak (mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) = (-0.236*age(years)) - (0.094*weight(kg)) -(0.120*HR end(bpm)) + (0.067*6MWD(meters)) + (0.065*MVLPA(min/day)) - (0.204*DT(years)) + 25.145 with a mean bias of 2.51 mL.kg(-1).min(-1) (95% CI (-9.98 to 15.01)). CONCLUSION: This is the first study that predicted VO2 peak from a 6MWT using clinical and specific variables related to the disease of childhood ALL survivors. The availability of these newly established VO2 peak equations makes them an accurate tool to provide a better follow-up and better adapted physical training for survivors. We invite researchers to use our assessment procedures for their further studies.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONIt is critical to understand the cardiorespiratory fitness of the childhood ALL survivorsThe maximal oxygen consumption (i.e., VO2 peak) is recognized as the gold standard to measure the patient's cardiorespiratory fitness in the field of exercise physiologyThis study is novel and reports the validation of two new VO2 peak equations, from 6MWT, by using clinical and disease-specific variables of childhood ALL survivorsThe availability of such validated equations can better facilitate the follow-up of survivors' cardiorespiratory fitness, by relevant health care professionals and exercise physiologists.","['Labonte, Jennifer', 'Caru, Maxime', 'Lemay, Valerie', 'Alos, Nathalie', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Andelfinger, Gregor', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Curnier, Daniel']","['Labonte J', 'Caru M', 'Lemay V', 'Alos N', 'Drouin S', 'Bertout L', 'Andelfinger G', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Curnier D']","['Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430 - Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), Department of psychology, University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Center, Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200211,England,Disabil Rehabil,Disability and rehabilitation,9207179,,IM,"['*Cardiorespiratory Fitness', 'Exercise Test', 'Humans', 'Oxygen Consumption', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Survivors', 'Walk Test']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/10/16 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09638288.2020.1725159 [doi]'],ppublish,Disabil Rehabil. 2021 Oct;43(20):2937-2944. doi: 10.1080/09638288.2020.1725159.

XPO1 also affects the translation of messenger RNAs for critical oncogenes, including MYC, BCL2, MCL1, and BCL6, by blocking the export of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. Early trials with venetoclax (ABT-199), a potent, selective inhibitor of BCL2, have revealed responses across a variety of hematologic malignancies. However, many tumors are not responsive to venetoclax. We used models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) to determine in vitro and in vivo responses to treatment with venetoclax and SINE compounds combined. Cotreatment with venetoclax and SINE compounds demonstrated loss of viability in multiple cell lines. Further in vitro analyses showed that this enhanced cell death was the result of an increase in apoptosis that led to a loss of clonogenicity in methylcellulose assays, coinciding with activation of p53 and loss of MCL1. Treatment with SINE compounds and venetoclax combined led to a reduction in tumor growth in both AML and DLBCL xenografts. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue sections revealed that the reduction in tumor cells was partly the result of an induction of apoptosis. The enhanced effects of this combination were validated in primary AML and DLBCL patient cells. Our studies reveal synergy with SINE compounds and venetoclax in aggressive hematologic malignancies and provide a rationale for pursuing this approach in a clinical trial.","['Fischer, Melissa A', 'Friedlander, Sharon Y', 'Arrate, Maria P', 'Chang, Hua', 'Gorska, Agnieszka E', 'Fuller, Londa D', 'Ramsey, Haley E', 'Kashyap, Trinayan', 'Argueta, Christian', 'Debler, Sophie', 'Byrne, Michael', 'Villaume, Matthew T', 'Shaver, Aaron C', 'Senapedis, William', 'Landesman, Yosef', 'Baloglu, Erkan', 'Shacham, Sharon', 'Savona, Michael R']","['Fischer MA', 'Friedlander SY', 'Arrate MP', 'Chang H', 'Gorska AE', 'Fuller LD', 'Ramsey HE', 'Kashyap T', 'Argueta C', 'Debler S', 'Byrne M', 'Villaume MT', 'Shaver AC', 'Senapedis W', 'Landesman Y', 'Baloglu E', 'Shacham S', 'Savona MR']","['Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., Newton, MA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.', 'Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', '*Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Sulfonamides']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31505-6 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000359 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 11;4(3):586-598. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000359.,,"['P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000445/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7013257,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress of the disease from an indolent chronic phase to the more aggressive accelerated phase or blast phase (BP) occurs in a minority of cases and is associated with an accumulation of somatic mutations. We performed genetic profiling of 85 samples and transcriptome profiling of 12 samples from 59 CML patients. We identified recurrent somatic mutations in ABL1 (37%), ASXL1 (26%), RUNX1 (16%), and BCOR (16%) in the BP and observed that mutation signatures in the BP resembled those of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that mutation load differed between the indolent and aggressive phases and that nonoptimal responders had more nonsilent mutations than did optimal responders at the time of diagnosis, as well as in follow-up. Using RNA sequencing, we identified other than BCR-ABL1 cancer-associated hybrid genes in 6 of the 7 BP samples. Uncovered expression alterations were in turn associated with mechanisms and pathways that could be targeted in CML management and by which somatic alterations may emerge in CML. Last, we showed the value of genetic data in CML management in a personalized medicine setting.","['Adnan Awad, Shady', 'Kankainen, Matti', 'Ojala, Teija', 'Koskenvesa, Perttu', 'Eldfors, Samuli', 'Ghimire, Bishwa', 'Kumar, Ashwini', 'Kytola, Soili', 'Kamel, Mahmoud M', 'Heckman, Caroline A', 'Porkka, Kimmo', 'Mustjoki, Satu']","['Adnan Awad S', 'Kankainen M', 'Ojala T', 'Koskenvesa P', 'Eldfors S', 'Ghimire B', 'Kumar A', 'Kytola S', 'Kamel MM', 'Heckman CA', 'Porkka K', 'Mustjoki S']","['Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine and.', 'Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland; and.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, and.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medical and Clinical Genetics, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland; and.', 'Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine and.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine and.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Hematology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Translational Immunology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'iCAN Digital Precision Cancer Medicine and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*Mutation Accumulation']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31502-0 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000943 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 11;4(3):546-559. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000943.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7013270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We correlated tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics with clinical/product parameters in 111 patients treated in JULIET. Tisagenlecleucel persistence in responders and nonresponders, respectively, was demonstrated for 554 and 400 days maximum by flow cytometry and for 693 and 374 days maximum by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). No relationships were identified between cellular kinetics (qPCR) and product characteristics, intrinsic/extrinsic factors, dose, or immunogenicity. Most patients with 3-month response had detectable transgene at time of response and continued persistence for >/=6 months. Expansion (maximal expansion of transgene/CAR-positive T-cell levels in vivo postinfusion [Cmax]) was potentially associated with response duration but this did not reach statistical significance (hazard ratio for a twofold increase in Cmax, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.01). Tisagenlecleucel expansion was associated with cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) severity and tocilizumab use; no relationships were observed with neurologic events. Transgene levels were associated with B-cell levels. Dose was associated with CRS severity, but this was not statistically significant after adjusting for baseline tumor burden. In contrast to the results from B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, similar exposure was observed in DLBCL in this study regardless of response and expansion was lower in DLBCL than B-ALL, likely from differences in cancer location and/or T-cell intrinsic factors. Relationships between expansion and CRS severity, and lack of relationships between dose and exposure, were similar between DLBCL and B-ALL. Tisagenlecleucel cellular kinetics in adult relapsed/refractory DLBCL improve current understanding of in vivo expansion and its relationships with safety/efficacy endpoints.

There was an inverse correlation between cardio-oncology referral and the number of CAEs (P = .0440); however, a lower ponatinib starting dose, more frequent dose reduction, and increased cardio-oncology referral all were likely to have contributed to the observed decrease in CAEs after 2014. The response rate and 5-year overall survival (OS) were higher than those observed in the Ponatinib Ph+ ALL and CML Evaluation (PACE) trial (major molecular response, 58.7% vs 40% and OS, 76% vs 73%; median follow-up of 32.5 months). Ponatinib-treated patients with chronic phase-CML did not show a significant improvement with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, whereas those with accelerated phase/blast phase-CML had a much better outcome (median OS of 32.9 months vs 9.2 months; P = .01). These results demonstrate that ponatinib is highly effective. Dose adjustments and increased awareness of the cardiotoxicities associated with ponatinib may help maximize its benefits.","['Chan, Onyee', 'Talati, Chetasi', 'Isenalumhe, Leidy', 'Shams, Samantha', 'Nodzon, Lisa', 'Fradley, Michael', 'Sweet, Kendra', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Chan O', 'Talati C', 'Isenalumhe L', 'Shams S', 'Nodzon L', 'Fradley M', 'Sweet K', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; and.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; and.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; and.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; and.', 'Department of Cardio-Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center and University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; and.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', '*Pyridazines/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31500-7 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000268 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 11;4(3):530-538. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000268.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7013263,,,,['Blood Adv. 2020 May 12;4(9):1927-1929.

Improving survival rates warrants research into long-term outcomes among this population. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the physical function and quality of life (QOL) of survivors of childhood cancer who had an osteonecrosis history with that of survivors who had no osteonecrosis history and with that of people who were healthy (controls). DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: This study included St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study participants who were >/= 10 years from the diagnosis of childhood leukemia or lymphoma and >/= 18 years old; 135 had osteonecrosis (52.5% men; mean age = 27.7 [SD = 6.08] years) and 1560 had no osteonecrosis history (52.4% men; mean age = 33.3 [SD = 8.54] years). This study also included 272 people who were from the community and who were healthy (community controls) (47.7% men; mean age = 35.1 [SD = 10.46] years). The participants completed functional assessments and questionnaires about QOL. RESULTS: Survivors with osteonecrosis scored lower than other survivors and controls for dorsiflexion strength (mean score = 16.50 [SD = 7.91] vs 24.17 [SD = 8.61] N.m/kg) and scored lower than controls for flexibility with the sit-and-reach test (20.61 [SD = 9.70] vs 23.96 [SD = 10.73] cm), function on the Physical Performance Test (mean score = 22.73 [SD = 2.05] vs 23.58 [SD = 0.88]), and mobility on the Timed ""Up & Go"" Test (5.66 [SD = 2.25] vs 5.12 [SD = 1.28] seconds). Survivors with hip osteonecrosis requiring surgery scored lower than survivors without osteonecrosis for dorsiflexion strength (13.75 [SD = 8.82] vs 18.48 [SD = 9.04] N.m/kg), flexibility (15.79 [SD = 8.93] vs 20.37 [SD = 10.14] cm), and endurance on the 6-minute walk test (523.50 [SD = 103.00] vs 572.10 [SD = 102.40] m). LIMITATIONS: Because some eligible survivors declined to participate, possible selection bias was a limitation of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood leukemia and lymphoma with and without osteonecrosis demonstrated impaired physical performance and reported reduced QOL compared with controls, with those requiring surgery for osteonecrosis most at risk for impairments. It may be beneficial to provide strengthening, flexibility, and endurance interventions for patients who have pediatric cancer and osteonecrosis for long-term function.","['DeFeo, Brian M', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Li, Zhenghong', 'Brinkman, Tara M', 'Neel, Michael D', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Karol, Seth E', 'Ness, Kirsten K']","['DeFeo BM', 'Kaste SC', 'Li Z', 'Brinkman TM', 'Neel MD', 'Srivastava DK', 'Hudson MM', 'Robison LL', 'Karol SE', 'Ness KK']","[""DPT, OCS, Rehabilitation Services and Department of Radiological Sciences, Mail Stop 113, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, 262 Danny Thomas Place, Memphis,TN 38105-3678 (USA)."", ""Department of Radiological Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control and Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Surgery, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Biostatistics and Department of Cancer Prevention and Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Department of Psychology, Department of Cancer Prevention and Control, and Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, Department of Cancer Prevention and Control, and Comprehensive Cancer Center, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, St Jude Children's Research Hospital."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control and Department of Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Phys Ther,Physical therapy,0022623,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Strength', 'Osteonecrosis/chemically induced/*physiopathology/surgery', '*Physical Functional Performance', '*Quality of Life', 'Range of Motion, Articular', 'Social Participation', 'Walk Test']",2020/02/12 06:00,2020/04/30 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['5733150 [pii]', '10.1093/ptj/pzz176 [doi]']",ppublish,Phys Ther. 2020 Mar 10;100(3):509-522. doi: 10.1093/ptj/pzz176.,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA195547/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 American Physical Therapy Association.'],PMC7246066,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epigenetic dysregulation plays a key role in disease pathogenesis and progression of some malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Epigenetic therapies, including hypomethylating agents (HMAs) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, were developed to reprogram the epigenetic abnormalities in AML. However, the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic effects of the two agents alone or their combination remain unknown. An overview of these epigenetic therapies is given here. A literature search was conducted through PubMed database, looking for important biological or clinical studies related to the epigenetic regimens in the treatment of AML until October 15th, 2019. Various types of articles, including original research and reviews, were assessed, identified, and eventually summarized as a collection of data pertaining the mechanisms and clinical effects of HMAs and HDAC inhibitors in AML patients. We provided here an overview of the current understanding of the mechanisms and clinical therapeutic effects involved in the treatment with HMAs and HDAC inhibitors alone, the combination of epigenetic therapies with intensive chemotherapy, and the combination of both types of epigenetic therapies. Relevant clinical trials were also discussed. Generally speaking, the large number of studies and their varied outcomes demonstrate that effects of epigenetic therapies are heterogeneous, and that HMAs combination regimens probably contribute to significant response rates. However, more research is needed to explore therapeutic effects of HDAC inhibitors and various combinations of HMAs and HDAC inhibitors.","['Xu, Qing-Yu', 'Yu, Li']","['Xu QY', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim 68169, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, Guangdong 518000, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['DNA Methylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/01/22 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000000685 [doi]', '00029330-202003200-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2020 Mar 20;(6):699-715. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000685.,,,,PMC7190219,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OHCP is in equilibrium with its tautomeric aldophosphamide (ALDO). From ALDO, the cytotoxic active metabolites are formed enzymatically by phosphodiesterases; these are the alkylating metabolite phosphoramide mustard (PAM) and the proapoptotic aldehyde 3-hydroxypropanal (HPA). PAM damages the DNA by alkylation; HPA amplifies the thereby induced apoptosis. The generally accepted view that acrolein, which is believed to be formed in the formation of PAM by beta-elimination from ALDO would be mainly responsible for the toxicity of cyclophosphamide, has to be revised because no acrolein is formed in the systemic circulation of patients after cyclophosphamide administration. It is shown that not acrolein, but OHCP itself is the true toxic metabolite of cyclophosphamide. Toxicity tests with OHCP and PAM were carried out, which demonstrated that OHCP unfolds its toxicity, not as a carrier of PAM but is toxic itself by reacting with nucleophilic groups of macromolecules, for example, thiol groups of membrane proteins. Further experiments demonstrate that the toxicity of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics may be drastically reduced if the formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite ALDO bypasses the formation of OHCP. Toxicity experiments in mice with S-ethanol-cyclophosphamide (SECP) that hydrolyzes to OHCP show that SECP is as toxic as OHCP, whereas the thiazolidine of ALDO, which hydrolyzes to ALDO bypassing OHCP is 7-9 times less toxic without loss of antitumor activity.","['Voelcker, Georg']",['Voelcker G'],"['Institute of Biochemistry II, Goethe University Frankfurt Medical School, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '10159-53-2 (phosphoramide mustard)', '1XBF4E50HS (4-hydroxycyclophosphamide)', '7AM2ILM9FI (aldophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Toxicity Tests']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/03/09 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000912 [doi]', '00001813-202007000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2020 Jul;31(6):617-622. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000912.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its roles in cell differentiation, cell survival, and apoptotic signaling, modulation of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway has provided a meaningful target in hematological malignancies. Several studies have demonstrated that gene expression profiles associated with increased pro-survival cAMP activity or downregulation of various pro-apoptotic factors associated with the cAMP pathway are apparent in acute leukemia patients. Previous work to increase leukemia cell intracellular cAMP focused on the use of cAMP analogs, stimulating cAMP production via transmembrane-associated adenylyl cyclases, or decreasing cAMP degradation by inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity. However, targeting cyclic nucleotide efflux by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represents an unexplored approach for modulation of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels. Preliminary studies have shown that inhibition of cAMP efflux can stimulate leukemia cell differentiation, cell growth arrest, and apoptosis, indicating that targeting cAMP efflux may show promise for future therapeutic development. Furthermore, inhibition of cyclic nucleotide transporter activity may also contribute multiple anticancer benefits by reducing extracellular pro-survival signaling in malignant cells. Hence, several opportunities for drug repurposing may exist for targeting cyclic nucleotide transporters.","['Perez, Dominique R', 'Sklar, Larry A', 'Chigaev, Alexandre', 'Matlawska-Wasowska, Ksenia']","['Perez DR', 'Sklar LA', 'Chigaev A', 'Matlawska-Wasowska K']","['Department of Pathology, Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA; Center for Molecular Discovery, Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA; Center for Molecular Discovery, Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA; University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA; Center for Molecular Discovery, Health Sciences Center, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA; University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.

Apart from increasing age, this phenomenon occurs with higher frequency in individuals with lymphoid or solid tumors and is associated with exposures to genotoxic stress. Clonal hematopoiesis in this context confers a greater risk for developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and appears to contribute to adverse cancer-related survival through a variety of potential mechanisms. These include alterations of the bone marrow microenvironment, inflammatory changes in clonal effector cells and modulation of immune responses. Understanding how clonal hematopoiesis drives therapy-related myeloid neoplasm initiation and interactions with non-myeloid malignancies will inform screening and surveillance approaches and suggest targeted therapies in this vulnerable population.

On June 28, 2018, the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for the medicinal product Kymriah for pediatric and young adult patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory, in relapse after transplant, or in second or later relapse and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) after two or more lines of systemic therapy. Kymriah became one of the first European Union-approved CAR T therapies. The active substance of Kymriah is tisagenlecleucel, an autologous, immunocellular cancer therapy that involves reprogramming the patient's own T cells to identify and eliminate CD19-expressing cells. This is achieved by addition of a transgene encoding a CAR. The benefit of Kymriah was its ability to achieve remission with a significant duration in patients with ALL and an objective response with a significant duration in patients with DLBCL. The most common hematological toxicity was cytopenia in both patients with ALL and those with DLBCL. Nonhematological side effects in patients with ALL were cytokine release syndrome (CRS), infections, secondary hypogammaglobulinemia due to B-cell aplasia, pyrexia, and decreased appetite. The most common nonhematological side effects in patients with DLBCL were CRS, infections, pyrexia, diarrhea, nausea, hypotension, and fatigue. Kymriah also received an orphan designation on April 29, 2014, following a positive recommendation by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP). Maintenance of the orphan designation was recommended at the time of marketing authorization as the COMP considered the product was of significant benefit for patients with both conditions. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T-cell therapy is becoming the most promising approach in cancer treatment, involving reprogramming the patient's own T cells with a CAR-encoding transgene to identify and eliminate cancer-specific surface antigen-expressing cells. On June 28, 2018, Kymriah became one of the first EMA approved CAR T therapies. CAR T technology seems highly promising for diseases with single genetic/protein alterations; however, for more complex diseases there will be challenges to target clonal variability within the tumor type or clonal evolution during disease progression. Products with a lesser toxicity profile or more risk-minimization tools are also anticipated.","['Ali, Sahra', 'Kjeken, Rune', 'Niederlaender, Christiane', 'Markey, Greg', 'Saunders, Therese S', 'Opsata, Mona', 'Moltu, Kristine', 'Bremnes, Bjorn', 'Gronevik, Eirik', 'Muusse, Martine', 'Hakonsen, Gro D', 'Skibeli, Venke', 'Kalland, Maria Elisabeth', 'Wang, Ingrid', 'Buajordet, Ingebjorg', 'Urbaniak, Ania', 'Johnston, John', 'Rantell, Khadija', 'Kerwash, Essam', 'Schuessler-Lenz, Martina', 'Salmonson, Tomas', 'Bergh, Jonas', 'Gisselbrecht, Christian', 'Tzogani, Kyriaki', 'Papadouli, Irene', 'Pignatti, Francesco']","['Ali S', 'Kjeken R', 'Niederlaender C', 'Markey G', 'Saunders TS', 'Opsata M', 'Moltu K', 'Bremnes B', 'Gronevik E', 'Muusse M', 'Hakonsen GD', 'Skibeli V', 'Kalland ME', 'Wang I', 'Buajordet I', 'Urbaniak A', 'Johnston J', 'Rantell K', 'Kerwash E', 'Schuessler-Lenz M', 'Salmonson T', 'Bergh J', 'Gisselbrecht C', 'Tzogani K', 'Papadouli I', 'Pignatti F']","['European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Norwegian Medicines Agency, Oslo, Norway.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, London, United Kingdom.', 'Committee for Advanced Therapies, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.', 'Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Medical Products Agency, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Scientific Advisory Group, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska University Hospital BioClinicum, New Karolinska Hospital, Solna, Sweden.', 'Scientific Advisory Group, European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France."", 'European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'European Medicines Agency, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191016,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', '*Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0233 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2020 Feb;25(2):e321-e327. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0233.

We evaluated the clinical outcomes of pediatric CML patients who had SCT in our center. METHODS: This retrospective study included children with CML, who received an allogeneic SCT at Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, 57357, from 2007 to 2017. All patients received myeloablative conditioning chemotherapy containing busulfan/cyclophosphamide followed by stem cell infusion from MRD. RESULTS: From 121 patients diagnosed with CML, 43 had available MRD and subjected to HSCT while 78 patients continued TKI therapy. The median time to transplant from diagnosis was 13 months. At initial diagnosis, there were 39 patients in CP and 4 had blastic crises. Bone marrow harvest was the stem cell source in 32 patients, while 11 cases received mobilized peripheral blood stem cells with average stem cell dose of 4.45 x 10(6) /kg. The probabilities of overall survival and event-free survival at 5 years were 97.4% and 79.8%, respectively. TRM at 100 days and TRM at 1-year post-transplant were 0%. The incidence of chronic GVHD was significantly higher in peripheral blood than bone marrow stem cell source (P = .004). CONCLUSION: Considering the excellent survival rates and very low TRM, HSCT is still a valid option for pediatric patients with newly diagnosed CML with best using marrow stem cell source to avoid a significant risk of cGVHD and its related complications.","['Hafez, Hanafy A', 'Abdallah, Amr', 'Hammad, Mahmoud', 'Hamdy, Nayera', 'Yassin, Dina', 'Salem, Sherine', 'Hassanain, Omayma', 'Elhalaby, Lama', 'Elhaddad, Alaa']","['Hafez HA', 'Abdallah A', 'Hammad M', 'Hamdy N', 'Yassin D', 'Salem S', 'Hassanain O', 'Elhalaby L', 'Elhaddad A']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Research Department, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Research Department, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200211,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*surgery', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/08/10 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13664 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2020 Jun;24(4):e13664. doi: 10.1111/petr.13664.

Autoimmune blistering diseases (AIBD) are mostly treated with systemic immunosuppressive agents. To prevent the reactivation or exacerbation of existing latent infections, patients must be screened for infectious diseases before immunosuppressive treatments are initiated. However, the prevalence of infectious diseases in AIBD remains to be elucidated. To evaluate the necessity of screening infectious diseases in AIBD, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 215 patients at a single center with AIBD for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema pallidum, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HIV infections. Approximately 40% of patients were infected with HBV. During systemic corticosteroid treatment, HBV DNA became positive in 3.4% of cases. Antibodies to HCV, interferon-gamma release assays for M. tuberculosis and the T. pallidum latex agglutination test were positive in 0.6%, 6.6% and 1.2% cases, respectively. Neither HTLV-1 nor HIV infections were detected. In conclusion, checks for HBV and M. tuberculosis infections should be made before immunosuppressive treatments are started, because of the high prevalence of these potentially life-threatening infections. Other infections should be tested for depending on the patient's risk factors.","['Ujiie, Inkin', 'Ujiie, Hideyuki', 'Yoshimoto, Norihiro', 'Iwata, Hiroaki', 'Shimizu, Hiroshi']","['Ujiie I', 'Ujiie H', 'Yoshimoto N', 'Iwata H', 'Shimizu H']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200211,England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Infections/diagnosis/*epidemiology/immunology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mass Screening/standards', 'Middle Aged', 'Pemphigoid, Bullous/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Pemphigus/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/01/07 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1346-8138.15244 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2020 Apr;47(4):378-384. doi: 10.1111/1346-8138.15244.

Arginine methylation is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), which are classified as type I and type II enzymes responsible for the formation of asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine, respectively. PRMT5 is the main type II enzyme that catalyzes symmetric dimethylarginine of histone proteins to induce gene silencing by generating repressive histone marks, including H2AR3me2s, H3R8me2s, and H4R3me2s. PRMT5 can also methylate nonhistone proteins such as the transcription factors p53, E2F1 and p65. Modifications of these proteins by PRMT5 are involved in diverse cellular processes, including transcription, translation, DNA repair, RNA processing, and metabolism. A growing literature demonstrates that PRMT5 expression is upregulated in hematologic malignancies, including leukemia and lymphoma, where PRMT5 regulates gene expression to promote cancer cell proliferation. Targeting PRMT5 by specific inhibitors has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat these diseases.","['Zhu, Fen', 'Rui, Lixin']","['Zhu F', 'Rui L']","['Department of Medicine and Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, 53792, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI, 53792, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190619,China,Genes Dis,Genes & diseases,101635967,,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:01,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.gendis.2019.06.002 [doi]', 'S2352-3042(19)30038-8 [pii]']",epublish,Genes Dis. 2019 Jun 19;6(3):247-257. doi: 10.1016/j.gendis.2019.06.002. eCollection 2019 Sep.,,,['(c) 2019 Chongqing Medical University.

The innate immune system is the first defense line against C. albicans infection. MiR-155, a multifunctional microRNA (miRNA), has been proved to be a crucial regulator in innate immune response against bacterial and virus. However, the biological function of miR-155 in innate immune response against C. albicans infection remains unknown. Methods: The expression miR-155, as well as inflammatory factors [interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)], in monocytes derived dendritic cells (DCs) during heat-killed C. albicans infection was detected by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The biological functions of miR-155 were investigated with ""gain- and loss-of-function"" experiments. Potential targets of miR-155 were identified by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assay and western blot. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to validate the function of miR-155 target. Results: C. albicans increased the expression of miR-155 and pro-inflammatory factors. MiR-155 induced by C. albicans was depended on Dectin-1-spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk)/Raf-1-MAPK signaling pathway. Furthermore, miR-155 suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by C. albicans by targeting NF-kappaB p65 and B cell leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL-10). Conclusions: In conclusion, up-regulated miR-155 acts as a negative feedback regulator in the innate immune response against C. albicans infection.","['Wei, Ting-Ting', 'Cheng, Zhuo', 'Hu, Zhi-De', 'Zhou, Lin', 'Zhong, Ren-Qian']","['Wei TT', 'Cheng Z', 'Hu ZD', 'Zhou L', 'Zhong RQ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital/Institute, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200438, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot 010050, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Changzheng Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200003, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:01,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.11.71 [doi]', 'atm-07-23-758 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2019 Dec;7(23):758. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.11.71.,,,['2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

Its incidence increases with age and has a poor prognosis. Studies have shown that DNA methylation and abnormal gene expression are closely related to AML. Methods: The methylation array data and mRNA array data are from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Through the GEO data, we identified differential genes from tumors and normal samples. Then we performed Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses on these differential genes. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction and module analysis were performed to screen the highest-scoring modules. Next, we used SurvExpress software to analyze the genes in the highest-scoring module and selected potential prognostic genes by univariate and multivariate Cox analysis. Finally, the three genes screened by SurvExpress software were analyzed using the methylation analysis site MethSurv to explore AML associated methylation biomarkers. Results: We found three genes that can be used as independent prognostic factors for AML. These three genes are the low expression/methylation genes ATP11A and ITGAM, and the high expression/low methylation gene ZNRF2. Conclusions: In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression to identify key epigenetic genes in AML.","['Hu, Linjun', 'Gao, Yuling', 'Shi, Zhan', 'Liu, Yang', 'Zhao, Junjun', 'Xiao, Zunqiang', 'Lou, Jiayin', 'Xu, Qiuran', 'Tong, Xiangmin']","['Hu L', 'Gao Y', 'Shi Z', 'Liu Y', 'Zhao J', 'Xiao Z', 'Lou J', 'Xu Q', 'Tong X']","['The Medical College of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China.', 'Department of Genetic Laboratory, Shaoxing Women and Children Hospital, Shaoxing 312030, China.', 'The Second Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310014, China.', 'The Medical College of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266071, China.', 'Graduate Department, Bengbu Medical College, Bengbu 233030, China.', 'The Second Clinical Medical College of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou 310014, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Da jiang dong Hospital, Hangzhou, 310014, China.', ""The Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), Hangzhou 310014, China."", ""The Key Laboratory of Tumor Molecular Diagnosis and Individualized Medicine of Zhejiang Province, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (People's Hospital of Hangzhou Medical College), Hangzhou 310014, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:01,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.11.122 [doi]', 'atm-07-23-737 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2019 Dec;7(23):737. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.11.122.,,,['2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

We have previously developed a 4-1BB/CD3-zeta-costimulated CAR-T cells against CD19 (CART19) for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, a preclinical safety assessment of CART19 was performed on NSG mice, to evaluate the preclinical toxicity along with its efficacy and tissue distribution. Methods: A total of 120 NSG mice were used for a combined pharmacodynamics and toxicity study for 56 days. Ninety-six mice of which were single dosed with Raji-Luc (5x10(5) per animal, i.p.) and different concentrations of CART19 (0.2x10(7), 0.6x10(7) and 1.8x10(7) per animal, i.v.), while the rest were assigned to the Untreated group. Optical intensity of Raji-Luc in mice, clinical symptoms, body mass, hematological analysis, humanized cytokine, lymphocyte subset counting, necropsy and histopathological examinations were performed. In addition, a single dose of 0.6x10(7) CART19 was intravenously administered to 48 NSG mice, and the distribution of CART19 in different tissues was analyzed using quantitative PCR. Results: CART19 is widely distributed in organs well-perfused with blood, including the lungs, blood, bone marrow, liver and spleen. Significant proliferation of CART19 was also found in the blood by through recognition using humanized CD3(+) for T lymphocytes. The survival rate and leukemia related clinical symptoms in mice administered CART19 were markedly ameliorated, and the proliferation of Raji cells in mice was effectively inhibited. However, CART19 had no obvious effects on either the mean body mass or the blood cell counts, and no cytokine release syndrome and graft versus host disease were observed. Conclusions: NSG mice given CART19 treatment demonstrated a longer survival period without significant immunotoxicity, suggesting encouraging clinical prospects for CART19 in patients with R/R ALL. Our study shed light on evaluation and supervision strategies for CAR-T products for the treatment of hematological diseases or leukemia.","['Wen, Hairuo', 'Qu, Zhe', 'Yan, Yujing', 'Pu, Chengfei', 'Wang, Chao', 'Jiang, Hua', 'Hou, Tiantian', 'Huo, Yan']","['Wen H', 'Qu Z', 'Yan Y', 'Pu C', 'Wang C', 'Jiang H', 'Hou T', 'Huo Y']","['Key Laboratory of Beijing for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Beijing for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Beijing for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100176, China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China.', 'Innovative Cellular Therapeutics Co., Ltd., Shanghai 201203, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Beijing for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Beijing for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Beijing for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100176, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Beijing for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Center for Safety Evaluation of Drugs, National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, Beijing 100176, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:01,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.12.03 [doi]', 'atm-07-23-735 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2019 Dec;7(23):735. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.12.03.,,,['2019 Annals of Translational Medicine.

For approaches that employ NGS sequencing, the relative abundance of integrations within a complex mixture is typically determined through the use of read counts or unique fragment lengths from a ligation of sheared DNA; however, these estimates may be skewed by PCR amplification biases and saturation of sequencing coverage. Results: Here we describe a modification of our previous splinkerette based ligation-mediated PCR using a novel Illumina-compatible adapter design that prevents amplification of non-target DNA and incorporates unique molecular identifiers. This design reduces the number of PCR cycles required and improves relative quantitation of integration abundance for saturating sequencing coverage. By inverting the forked adapter strands from a standard orientation, the integration-genome junction can be sequenced without affecting the sequence diversity required for cluster generation on the flow cell. Replicate libraries of murine leukemia virus-infected spleen samples yielded highly reproducible quantitation of clonal integrations as well as a deep coverage of subclonal integrations. A dilution series of DNAs bearing integrations of MuLV or piggyBac transposon shows linearity of the quantitation over a range of concentrations. Conclusions: Merging ligation and library generation steps can reduce total PCR amplification cycles without sacrificing coverage or fidelity. The protocol is robust enough for use in a 96 well format using an automated liquid handler and we include programs for use of a Beckman Biomek liquid handling workstation. We also include an informatics pipeline that maps reads, builds integration contigs and quantitates integration abundance using both fragment lengths and unique molecular identifiers. Suggestions for optimizing the protocol to other target DNA sequences are included. The reproducible distinction of clonal and subclonal integration sites from each other allows for analysis of populations of cells undergoing selection, such as those found in insertional mutagenesis screens.","['Dawes, Joanna C', 'Webster, Philip', 'Iadarola, Barbara', 'Garcia-Diaz, Claudia', 'Dore, Marian', 'Bolt, Bruce J', 'Dewchand, Hamlata', 'Dharmalingam, Gopuraja', 'McLatchie, Alex P', 'Kaczor, Jakub', 'Caceres, Juan J', 'Paccanaro, Alberto', 'Game, Laurence', 'Parrinello, Simona', 'Uren, Anthony G']","['Dawes JC', 'Webster P', 'Iadarola B', 'Garcia-Diaz C', 'Dore M', 'Bolt BJ', 'Dewchand H', 'Dharmalingam G', 'McLatchie AP', 'Kaczor J', 'Caceres JJ', 'Paccanaro A', 'Game L', 'Parrinello S', 'Uren AG']","['1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '3Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK.grid.417895.60000 0001 0693 2181', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '4Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, WC1E 6DD, London, UK.grid.83440.3b0000000121901201', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '5UCL Cancer Institute, WC1E 6DD, London, UK.grid.83440.3b0000000121901201', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '6Centre for Systems and Synthetic Biology, Department of Computer Science, Royal Holloway, University of London, London, UK.grid.4464.20000 0001 2161 2573', '6Centre for Systems and Synthetic Biology, Department of Computer Science, Royal Holloway, University of London, London, UK.grid.4464.20000 0001 2161 2573', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111', '4Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, UCL Cancer Institute, WC1E 6DD, London, UK.grid.83440.3b0000000121901201', '1MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (LMS), Du Cane Road, London, W12 0NN UK.grid.14105.310000000122478951', '2Institute of Clinical Sciences (ICS), Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Du Cane Road, London, UK.grid.7445.20000 0001 2113 8111']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200204,England,Mob DNA,Mobile DNA,101519891,,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:01,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13100-020-0201-4 [doi]', '201 [pii]']",epublish,Mob DNA. 2020 Feb 4;11:7. doi: 10.1186/s13100-020-0201-4. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6019-7111'],"['BB/F00964X/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'MC_UP_A652_1001/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UP_A652_1002/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['(c) The Author(s). 2020.'],PMC7001329,,['NOTNLM'],"['Genetics', 'Genomics', 'Integration site cloning', 'Mutagenesis', 'Retroviruses']",,,['Competing interestsNone.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-arylpiperazine moiety is important for CNS-activity, particularly for serotonergic and dopaminergic activity. In the scientific literature there are many examples of coumarin-piperazine derivatives, particularly with arylpiperazines linked to a coumarin system via an alkyl liner, which can modulate serotonin, dopamine and adrenergic receptors. Numerous studies have revealed that the inclusion of a piperazine moiety could occasionally provide unexpected improvements in the bioactivity of various biologically active compounds. The piperazine analogs have been shown to have a potent antimicrobial activity and they can also act as BACE-1 inhibitors. On the other hand, arylpiperazines linked to coumarin derivatives have been shown to have antiproliferative activity against leukemia, lung, colon, breast, and prostate tumors. Recently, it has been reported that coumarin-piperazine derivatives exhibit a Fneuroprotective effect by their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and they also show activity as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and antifilarial activity. In this work we provide a summary of the latest advances in coumarin-related chemistry relevant for biological activity.","['Ostrowska, Kinga']",['Ostrowska K'],"['Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Warsaw, 1 Banacha Str., 02 097 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20191207,Saudi Arabia,Saudi Pharm J,Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society,9705695,,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:01,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jsps.2019.11.025 [doi]', 'S1319-0164(19)30167-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Saudi Pharm J. 2020 Feb;28(2):220-232. doi: 10.1016/j.jsps.2019.11.025.

We used nationwide registry data of Japan for 2003-2016 to evaluate transplant outcomes and clarified prognostic factors among adult allo-HSCT recipients with B-ALL harboring t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) (n = 125). Compared with cytogenetically normal (CN) B-ALL patients (n = 1057), their 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were comparable (55.4% for t(1;19) and 54.4% for CN; P = 0.76). Considering only patients in first complete hematological remission (CR1), the 3-year OS rates remained comparable (70.5% for t(1;19) and 67.8% for CN; P = 0.86). For t(1;19) patients in CR1, minimal residual disease (MRD) at transplantation was associated with relatively worse outcomes. The 3-year OS rates were 43.6% for patients with MRD and 77.4% for those without it (P = 0.016). The 3-year relapse rates were 54.5% for patients with MRD and 12.8% for those without it (P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that MRD at transplantation was a significant risk factor for OS and relapse. In the high-intensity chemotherapy era, t(1;19)(q23;p13.3) did not have a poorer posttransplant prognosis than the normal karyotype. However, even for patients in CR1, MRD at transplantation was associated with comparatively worse OS and higher relapse rates.","['Kaito, Satoshi', 'Najima, Yuho', 'Harada, Kaito', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Noguchi, Yuma', 'Ikegame, Kazuhiro', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Inoue, Yoshiko', 'Tanaka, Junji', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kako, Shinichi']","['Kaito S', 'Najima Y', 'Harada K', 'Fukuda T', 'Noguchi Y', 'Ikegame K', 'Tanaka M', 'Ozawa Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Sawa M', 'Ota S', 'Inoue Y', 'Tanaka J', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kako S']","['Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan. kaitosatoshi1223@gmail.com.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hamanomachi Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, Kumamoto, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200210,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Karyotype', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/06/22 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-020-0816-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-020-0816-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2020 Jul;55(7):1337-1346. doi: 10.1038/s41409-020-0816-6.

The aim of the multicenter, prospective CLL1 trial was to explore a novel prognostic model (CLL1-PM) developed to identify risk groups, separating patients with favorable from others with dismal prognosis. A cohort of 539 clinically, biochemically, and genetically characterized Binet stage A patients were observed until progression, first-line treatment, or death. Multivariate analysis identified six independent factors associated with overall survival (OS) and time-to-first treatment (TTFT): del(17p), unmutated IGHV, del(11q), ss2-microglobulin >3.5 mg/dL, lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) <12 months, and age >60 years. These factors were integrated into the CLL1-PM, which stratified patients into four risk groups. The CLL1-PM was prognostic for OS and TTFT, e.g., the risk of treatment at 5 years was 85.9, 51.8, 27.6, and 11.3% for very low (0-1.5), low (2-4), high (4.5-6.5), and very high-risk (7-14) scores, respectively (P < 0.001). Notably, in addition to factors comprising CLL-IPI, we substantiated del(11q) and LDT as prognostic factors in early CLL. Altogether, our findings would be useful to effectively stratify Binet stage A patients, particularly within the scope of clinical trials evaluating novel agents.","['Hoechstetter, Manuela A', 'Busch, Raymonde', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Buhler, Andreas', 'Winkler, Dirk', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Robrecht, Sandra', 'Eckart, Michael J', 'Vehling-Kaiser, Ursula', 'Jacobs, Georg', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Hurtz, Hans Jurgen', 'Hopfinger, Georg', 'Hartmann, Frank', 'Fuss, Harald', 'Abenhardt, Wolfgang', 'Blau, Ilona', 'Freier, Werner', 'Muller, Lothar', 'Goebeler, Maria', 'Wendtner, Clemens', 'Fischer, Kirsten', 'Herling, Carmen D', 'Starck, Michael', 'Bentz, Martin', 'Emmerich, Bertold', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Hoechstetter MA', 'Busch R', 'Eichhorst B', 'Buhler A', 'Winkler D', 'Bahlo J', 'Robrecht S', 'Eckart MJ', 'Vehling-Kaiser U', 'Jacobs G', 'Jager U', 'Hurtz HJ', 'Hopfinger G', 'Hartmann F', 'Fuss H', 'Abenhardt W', 'Blau I', 'Freier W', 'Muller L', 'Goebeler M', 'Wendtner C', 'Fischer K', 'Herling CD', 'Starck M', 'Bentz M', 'Emmerich B', 'Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Hallek M']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Munchen Klinik Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Ingolstadt, Ingolstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Ingolstadt, Ingolstadt, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Private Practice, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Oncological Private Practice, Landshut, Germany.', 'Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Private Practice, Saarbrucken, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology Private Practice, Halle, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Klinikum Lippe-Lemgo, Lemgo, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Klinikum Bad Saarow, Bad Saarow, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology Private Practice, Munich, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology Private Practice, Berlin, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology Private Practice, Hildesheim, Germany.', 'Hematology and Oncology Private Practice, Leer, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Munchen Klinik Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Munchen Klinik Schwabing, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Klinikum Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Oncology Center (IOZ) Private Practice, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany. michael.hallek@uni-koeln.de.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200210,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Time-to-Treatment']",2020/02/12 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/30 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-020-0727-y [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-020-0727-y [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Apr;34(4):1038-1051. doi: 10.1038/s41375-020-0727-y.

We have previously identified miRNAs from human pre-ovulatory ovarian granulosa cells that are expressed from the intronic regions of two key genes in normal follicular development: FSH receptor (FSHR) and CYP19A1, the latter encoding the aromatase enzyme. The present study aims to identify the target genes regulated by these miRNAs: hsa-miR-548ba and hsa-miR-7973, respectively. The miRNAs of interest were transfected into KGN cell line and the gene expression changes were analyzed by Affymetrix microarray. Potential miRNA-regulated genes were further filtered by bioinformatic target prediction algorithms and validated for direct miRNA:mRNA binding by luciferase reporter assay. LIFR, PTEN, NEO1 and SP110 were confirmed as targets for hsa-miR-548ba. Hsa-miR-7973 target genes ADAM19, PXDN and FMNL3 also passed all verification steps. Additionally, the expression pattern of the miRNAs was studied in human primary cumulus granulosa cell culture in relation to the expression of their host genes and FSH stimulation. Based on our findings we propose the involvement of hsa-miR-548ba in the regulation of follicle growth and activation via LIFR and PTEN. Hsa-miR-7973 may be implicated in the modulation of extracellular matrix and cell-cell interactions by regulating the expression of its identified targets.","['Rooda, Ilmatar', 'Hensen, Kati', 'Kaselt, Birgitta', 'Kasvandik, Sergo', 'Pook, Martin', 'Kurg, Ants', 'Salumets, Andres', 'Velthut-Meikas, Agne']","['Rooda I', 'Hensen K', 'Kaselt B', 'Kasvandik S', 'Pook M', 'Kurg A', 'Salumets A', 'Velthut-Meikas A']","['Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia.', 'Competence Centre on Health Technologies, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia.', 'Proteomics Core Facility, Institute of Technology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Competence Centre on Health Technologies, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, Department of Biomedicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, Estonia. agne.velthut@taltech.ee.', 'Competence Centre on Health Technologies, Tartu, Estonia. agne.velthut@taltech.ee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200210,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (FSHR protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN548 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN548BA microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN7973-1 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, FSH)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aromatase)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP19A1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aromatase/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cumulus Cells/*physiology', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Ovarian Follicle/cytology/*growth & development', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Receptors, FSH/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/12 06:00,2020/11/21 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-59186-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-59186-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 10;10(1):2300. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-59186-x.,,,,PMC7010774,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still not possible to prospectively identify patients that will remain in treatment-free remission (TFR). Here, we used an ordinary differential equation model for CML, which explicitly includes an antileukemic immunologic effect, and applied it to 21 patients with CML for whom BCR-ABL1/ABL1 time courses had been quantified before and after TKI cessation. Immunologic control was conceptually necessary to explain TFR as observed in about half of the patients. Fitting the model simulations to data, we identified patient-specific parameters and classified patients into three different groups according to their predicted immune system configuration (""immunologic landscapes""). While one class of patients required complete CML eradication to achieve TFR, other patients were able to control residual leukemia levels after treatment cessation. Among them were a third class of patients that maintained TFR only if an optimal balance between leukemia abundance and immunologic activation was achieved before treatment cessation. Model simulations further suggested that changes in the BCR-ABL1 dynamics resulting from TKI dose reduction convey information about the patient-specific immune system and allow prediction of outcome after treatment cessation. This inference of individual immunologic configurations based on treatment alterations can also be applied to other cancer types in which the endogenous immune system supports maintenance therapy, long-term disease control, or even cure. SIGNIFICANCE: This mathematical modeling approach provides strong evidence that different immunologic configurations in patients with CML determine their response to therapy cessation and that dose reductions can help to prospectively infer different risk groups.See related commentary by Triche Jr, p. 2083.","['Hahnel, Tom', 'Baldow, Christoph', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Jilg, Stefanie', 'Jost, Philipp J', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Roeder, Ingo', 'Fassoni, Artur C', 'Glauche, Ingmar']","['Hahnel T', 'Baldow C', 'Guilhot J', 'Guilhot F', 'Saussele S', 'Mustjoki S', 'Jilg S', 'Jost PJ', 'Dulucq S', 'Mahon FX', 'Roeder I', 'Fassoni AC', 'Glauche I']","['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Carl Gustav Carus Faculty of Medicine, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'INSERM CIC 1402 - CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'INSERM CIC 1402 - CHU Poitiers, Poitiers, France.', 'III.

However, alternative mechanisms may contribute to functionally impairing the p53 pathway in the absence of a mutation. Candidate mechanisms include overexpression of p53 mRNA variants encoding either dominant-negative p53 protein isoforms such as Delta40p53 and Delta133p53, or modulatory isoforms such as p53beta, which counteract the effects of Delta133p53 on replicative senescence in T-lymphocytes. METHODS: We used semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot to investigate the expression of full length p53 (TAp53), Delta40p53, Delta133p53 or p53beta in diagnostic marrow from a clinical cohort of 50 BCP-ALL patients without TP53 mutation (29 males and 21 females, age range 2-14 years) and in the bone marrow cells of 4 healthy donors (used as controls). RESULTS: Irrespective of isoforms, levels of p53 mRNA were low in controls but were increased by 2 to 20-fold in primary or relapse BCP-ALL. TAp53 was increased in primary BCP-ALL, Delta40p53 was elevated in relapse BCP-ALL, whereas Delta133p53 and p53beta were increased in both. Next, mRNA levels were used as a basis to infer the ratio between protein isoform levels. This inference suggested that, in primary BCP-ALL, p53 was predominantly in active oligomeric conformations dominated by TAp53. In contrast, p53 mostly existed in inactive quaternary conformations containing >/=2 Delta40 or Delta133p53 in relapse BCP-ALL. Western blot analysis of blasts from BCP-ALL showed a complex pattern of N-terminally truncated p53 isoforms, whereas TAp53beta was detected as a major isoform. The hypothesis that p53 is in an active form in primary B-ALL was consistent with elevated level of p53 target genes CDKN1A and MDM2 in primary cases, whereas in relapse BCP-ALL, only CDKN1A was increased as compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Expression of p53 isoforms is deregulated in BCP-ALL in the absence of TP53 mutation, with increased expression of alternative isoforms in relapse BCP-ALL. Variations in isoform expression may contribute to functional deregulation of the p53 pathway in BCP-ALL, specifically contributing to its down-regulation in relapse forms.","['Oh, Lixian', 'Hainaut, Pierre', 'Blanchet, Sandrine', 'Ariffin, Hany']","['Oh L', 'Hainaut P', 'Blanchet S', 'Ariffin H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Advanced Biosciences, INSERM 1209 CNRS 5309 University of Grenoble-Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Institute of Advanced Biosciences, INSERM 1209 CNRS 5309 University of Grenoble-Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. hany@ummc.edu.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200210,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Protein Multimerization/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/chemistry/*genetics']",2020/02/12 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-020-6599-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-020-6599-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2020 Feb 10;20(1):110. doi: 10.1186/s12885-020-6599-8.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4607-8837'],"['RP049B-17HTM/Institut Pengurusan dan Pemantauan Penyelidikan, Universiti Malaya', 'PLBIO16-271/Institut National Du Cancer']",,PMC7011217,,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood ALL', 'Protein isoforms', 'p53 tumour suppressor protein']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the activity of the forage plant Trifolium repens, or white clover, which has been recently found to exert a hepatoprotective action. Scientific interest is increasingly focused on identifying new drugs, especially natural products and their derivatives, to treat human diseases including cancer. We analyzed the anticancer effects of T. repens in several cancer cell lines. The phytochemical components of T. repens were first extracted in a methanol solution and then separated into four fractions by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. The effects of the total extract and each fraction on cancer cell proliferation were analyzed by MTT assay and Western blotting. T. repens and, more robustly, its isoflavonoid-rich fraction showed high cytotoxic effects in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells, with IC50 values of 1.67 and 0.092 mg/mL, respectively. The block of cell growth was associated with a total inhibition of BCR-ABL/STAT5 and activation of the p38 signaling pathways. In contrast, these strongly cytotoxic effects did not occur in normal cells. Our findings suggest that the development of novel compounds derived from phytochemical molecules contained in Trifolium might lead to the identification of new therapeutic agents active against CML.","['Sarno, Federica', 'Pepe, Giacomo', 'Termolino, Pasquale', 'Carafa, Vincenzo', 'Massaro, Crescenzo', 'Merciai, Fabrizio', 'Campiglia, Pietro', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Altucci, Lucia']","['Sarno F', 'Pepe G', 'Termolino P', 'Carafa V', 'Massaro C', 'Merciai F', 'Campiglia P', 'Nebbioso A', 'Altucci L']","['Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Salerno, 84084 Fisciano, Italy.', 'Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources (IBBR), National Research Council of Italy (CNR), 80055 Portici, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Salerno, 84084 Fisciano, Italy.', 'PhD Program in Drug Discovery and Development, University of Salerno, 84084 Fisciano, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Salerno, 84084 Fisciano, Italy.', 'European Biomedical Research Institute of Salerno, 84125 Salerno, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Precision Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200206,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trifolium/*chemistry']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/02/11 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cells9020379 [pii]', '10.3390/cells9020379 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2020 Feb 6;9(2). pii: cells9020379. doi: 10.3390/cells9020379.,,,,PMC7072565,,['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL/STAT5', '*K562 cells', '*Trifolium repens', '*cancer', '*chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*isoflavonoids', '*polyphenols']",,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, life expectancy of newly infected HIV-positive patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is gradually increasing, rivaling that of age-matched HIV-negative individuals, so that the occurrence of AML is also expected to progressively increase. Even if HIV is not reported to be directly mutagenic, several indirect leukemogenic mechanisms, mainly based on bone marrow microenvironment disruption, have been proposed. Despite a well-controlled HIV infection under ART should no longer be considered per se a contraindication to intensive chemotherapeutic approaches, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, in selected fit patients with AML, survival outcomes are still generally unsatisfactory. We discussed several controversial issues about pathogenesis and clinical management of AML in PLWH, but few evidence-based answers may currently be provided, due to the limited number of cases reported in the literature, mainly as case reports or small retrospective case series.

Melittin is a major component of bee venom that accounts for about 52% of its dry mass. A vast number of studies have been dedicated to the effects of melittin's regulation of apoptosis and to the factors that induce apoptosis in various types of cancer such as breast, ovarian, prostate, lung. The latest evidence indicates its potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of leukaemia. The aim of our present study is to evaluate melittin's ability to induce apoptosis in leukaemia cell lines of different origin acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (CCRF-CEM) and chronic myelogenous leukaemia (K-562). We demonstrated that melittin strongly reduced cell viability in both leukaemia cell lines but not in physiological peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs). Subsequent estimated parameters (mitochondrial membrane potential, Annexin V binding and Caspases 3/7 activity) clearly demonstrated that melittin induced apoptosis in leukaemia cells. This is a very important step for research into the development of new potential anti-leukaemia as well as anticancer therapies. Further analyses on the molecular level have been also planned (analysis of proapoptotic genes expression and DNA damages) for our next research project, which will also focus on melittin.","['Ceremuga, Michal', 'Stela, Maksymilian', 'Janik, Edyta', 'Gorniak, Leslaw', 'Synowiec, Ewelina', 'Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Sitarek, Przemyslaw', 'Saluk-Bijak, Joanna', 'Bijak, Michal']","['Ceremuga M', 'Stela M', 'Janik E', 'Gorniak L', 'Synowiec E', 'Sliwinski T', 'Sitarek P', 'Saluk-Bijak J', 'Bijak M']","['Military Institute of Armament Technology, Prymasa Stefana Wyszynskiego 7, 05-220 Zielonka, Poland.', 'CBRN Reconnaissance and Decontamination Department, Military Institute of Chemistry and Radiometry, Antoniego Chrusciela ""Montera"" 105, 00-910 Warsaw, Poland.', 'Biohazard Prevention Centre, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Biohazard Prevention Centre, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Pharmaceutical Botany, Medical University of Lodz, 90-151 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of General Biochemistry, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.', 'Biohazard Prevention Centre, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Pomorska 141/143, 90-236 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200206,Switzerland,Biomolecules,Biomolecules,101596414,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bee Venoms)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bee Venoms/*chemistry', 'Bees', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Melitten/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary']",2020/02/12 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2019/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['biom10020247 [pii]', '10.3390/biom10020247 [doi]']",epublish,Biomolecules. 2020 Feb 6;10(2). pii: biom10020247. doi: 10.3390/biom10020247.,"['ORCID: 0000-0001-8385-7744', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7838-4097']",['506/1136/University of Lodz/International'],,PMC7072249,,['NOTNLM'],"['*apoptosis', '*bee venom', '*leukaemia', '*melittin']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds were tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (reference and control strains), three methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus, and three isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis. 1-[3-(Dipropylammonio)-2-({[3-(pentyloxy-/hexyloxy-/heptyloxy)phenyl]carbamoyl}ox y)propyl]pyrrolidinium dichlorides showed high activity against staphylococci and enterococci comparable with or higher than that of used controls (clinically used antibiotics and antiseptics). The screening of the cytotoxicity of the compounds as well as the used controls was performed using human monocytic leukemia cells. IC50 values of the most effective compounds ranged from ca. 3.5 to 6.3 microM, thus, it can be stated that the antimicrobial effect is closely connected with their cytotoxicity. The antibacterial activity is based on the surface activity of the compounds that are influenced by the length of their alkoxy side chain, the size of the azacyclic system, and hydro-lipophilic properties, as proven by in vitro experiments and chemometric principal component analyses. Synergistic studies showed the increased activity of oxacillin, gentamicin, and vancomycin, which could be explained by the direct activity of the compounds against the bacterial cell wall. All these compounds demonstrate excellent antibiofilm activity, when they inhibit and disrupt the biofilm of S. aureus in concentrations close to minimum inhibitory concentrations against planktonic cells. Expected interactions of the compounds with the cytoplasmic membrane are proven by in vitro crystal violet uptake assays.","['Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Malik, Ivan', 'Bezouskova, Kristyna', 'Kauerova, Tereza', 'Kollar, Peter', 'Csollei, Jozef', 'Oravec, Michal', 'Cizek, Alois', 'Jampilek, Josef']","['Pospisilova S', 'Malik I', 'Bezouskova K', 'Kauerova T', 'Kollar P', 'Csollei J', 'Oravec M', 'Cizek A', 'Jampilek J']","['Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Slechtitelu 27, 783 71 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University in Bratislava, Odbojarov 10, 832 32 Bratislava, Slovakia.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Palackeho 1946/1, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Human Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Palackeho 1, 61242 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Human Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Palackeho 1, 61242 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Chemical Drugs, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, Palackeho 1946/1, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Global Change Research Institute CAS, Belidla 986/4a, 603 00 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Palackeho 1946/1, 612 42 Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Regional Centre of Advanced Technologies and Materials, Faculty of Science, Palacky University, Slechtitelu 27, 783 71 Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Neuroimmunology, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 10 Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200206,Switzerland,Antibiotics (Basel),"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",101637404,,,,2020/02/12 06:00,2020/02/12 06:01,['2020/02/12 06:00'],"['2020/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:01 [medline]']","['antibiotics9020064 [pii]', '10.3390/antibiotics9020064 [doi]']",epublish,Antibiotics (Basel). 2020 Feb 6;9(2). pii: antibiotics9020064. doi: 10.3390/antibiotics9020064.,,"['FaF UK/26/2019/Faculty of Pharmacy, Comenius University in Bratislava', 'APVV-14-0547/Slovak Research and Development Agency', 'LO1305/Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic', 'CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_013/0001609/CzeCOS ProCES', 'LO1415/National Sustainability Program I']",,PMC7168207,,['NOTNLM'],"['antibacterial', 'antibiofilm activity', 'carbamate', 'structure-activity relationships', 'synergy']",,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to examine the risk of haematological malignancies: first, in subjects exposed early in life, independently of any occupational exposure occurring later; second, in subjects exposed occupationally. We established an environmentally exposed cohort from four schools located near the only former asbestos cement production plant in Denmark. We identified nearly all pupils in the seventh grade and created an age and sex-matched 1:9 reference cohort from the Danish Central Population Register. Participants were born 1940-1970 and followed up in national registers until the end of 2015. Occupational asbestos exposure was assessed for all participants using two different job exposure matrices. The school cohort included 12,111 participants (49.7% girls) and the reference cohort 108,987 participants. Eight subgroups of haematological malignancy were identified in the Danish Cancer Registry. These cases were analysed for combined overall haematological malignancy, a combined subgroup of lymphomas and a combined subgroup of leukaemias. The data were analysed using Cox regression (hazard ratios (HR)) including other cancers and death as competing risks. Haematological malignancy was identified in 1125 participants. The median follow-up was 49.3 years (0.1-63.4). Early environmental asbestos exposure was not associated with an increased risk of haematological malignancy. Long-term occupational asbestos exposure was associated with overall haematological malignancy (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.04-2.73); in particular for the leukaemia subgroup (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.19-3.84). This large follow-up study suggests that long-term occupational asbestos exposure is associated with increased leukaemia risk. However, further studies are needed to confirm these observations.","['Wurtz, Else Toft', 'Hansen, Johnni', 'Roe, Oluf Dimitri', 'Omland, Oyvind']","['Wurtz ET', 'Hansen J', 'Roe OD', 'Omland O']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Danish Ramazzini Centre, Aalborg University Hospital, Havrevangen 1, 4th, 9000, Alborg, Denmark. etw@rn.dk.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100, Copenhagen O, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Research and Molecular Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Prinsesse Kristinasgt. 1, Gastrosenteret 3rd, 7491, Trondheim, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University Hospital, Sdr.

This study aimed to evaluate the level of m6A as a biomarker for gastric cancer (GC) diagnosis. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 100 GC patients, 30 benign gastric disease (BGD) patients, and 75 healthy controls (HCs). Levels of m6A in total RNA and expression of m6A-related proteins were analyzed. RESULTS: The m6A levels in peripheral blood RNA were significantly increased in the GC group compared with those in the BGD or HC groups; moreover, levels increased with the progression and metastasis of GC and decreased in GC patients after surgery. The area under the curve (AUC) for m6A in the GC group was 0.929 (95% CI, 0.88-0.96), which is markedly greater than the AUCs for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA; 0.694) and carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199; 0.603). The combination of CEA and CA199 with m6A improved the AUC to 0.955 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98). The expressions of m6A demethylases ALKBH5 and FTO were significantly downregulated in the GC group compared with the HC group. Coculture with GC cells increased the m6A of RNA in promyelocytic (HL-60) and monocytic (THP-1) leukemia cells and nontumorigenic human peripheral blood B lymphocyte cells (PENG-EBV). Furthermore, a xenograft model enhanced the m6A in peripheral blood RNA of mice. Accordingly, expressions of ALKBH5 and FTO were decreased both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Level of m6A in peripheral blood RNA is a promising noninvasive diagnostic biomarker for GC patients.","['Ge, Lichen', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Chen, Zhuojia', 'Song, Jiaxi', 'Wu, Yingmin', 'Li, Zhuoling', 'Chen, Feng', 'Wu, Jia', 'Li, Dandan', 'Li, Jiexin', 'Wang, Cheng', 'Wang, Hongsheng', 'Wang, Junjun']","['Ge L', 'Zhang N', 'Chen Z', 'Song J', 'Wu Y', 'Li Z', 'Chen F', 'Wu J', 'Li D', 'Li J', 'Wang C', 'Wang H', 'Wang J']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Nanjing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Chiral Molecule and Drug Discovery, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Chiral Molecule and Drug Discovery, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Chiral Molecule and Drug Discovery, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Jinling Hospital, Medical School of Nanjing University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (carbohydrate antigen 199, human)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (ALKBH5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase)', 'EC 1.14.11.33 (Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO)', 'EC 1.14.11.33 (FTO protein, human)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'AlkB Homolog 5, RNA Demethylase/analysis/metabolism', 'Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO/analysis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/analysis', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2020/02/11 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['5721443 [pii]', '10.1093/clinchem/hvz004 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2020 Feb 1;66(2):342-351. doi: 10.1093/clinchem/hvz004.,,,"['(c) American Association for Clinical Chemistry 2020.

A mutagenesis screen identified FLT3 F691L, Y693C/N, and G697S as mutations that confer moderate resistance to gilteritinib in vitro. Analysis of patients treated with gilteritinib revealed that 2/9 patients with preexisting NC FLT3 mutations responded and that secondary TKD mutations are acquired in a minority (5/31) of patients treated with gilteritinib. Four of 5 patients developed F691L mutations (all treated at <200 mg). These studies suggest that gilteritinib has broad activity against FLT3 mutations and limited vulnerability to resistance-causing FLT3 TKD mutations, particularly when used at higher doses.","['Tarver, Theodore C', 'Hill, Jason E', 'Rahmat, Leena', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Bahceci, Erkut', 'Mori, Kenichi', 'Smith, Catherine C']","['Tarver TC', 'Hill JE', 'Rahmat L', 'Perl AE', 'Bahceci E', 'Mori K', 'Smith CC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL.', 'Division of Oncology-Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, IL.', 'Astellas Pharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds', 'Humans', 'Mutation', '*Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazines', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2020/02/11 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31498-1 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000919 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 11;4(3):514-524. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000919.,,"['K08 CA187577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA198621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7013266,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost all AML cells are dependent upon Myc for their proliferation and survival. Thus, Myc has been proposed as a critical anti-AML target. Myc has Max-mediated transactivational and Myc-interacting zinc finger protein 1 (Miz1)-mediated transrepressional activities. The role of Myc-Max-mediated transactivation in the pathogenesis of AML has been well studied; however, the role of Myc-Miz1-mediated transrepression in AML is still somewhat obscure. Myc protein harboring a V394D mutation (MycV394D) is a mutant form of Myc that lacks transrepressional activity due to a defect in its ability to interact with Miz1. We found that, compared with Myc, the oncogenic function of MycV394D is significantly impaired. The AML/myeloproliferative disorder that develops in mice receiving MycV394D-transduced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) is significantly delayed compared with mice receiving Myc-transduced HSPCs. Using a murine MLL-AF9 AML model, we found that AML cells expressing MycV394D (intrinsic Myc deleted) are partially differentiated and show reductions in both colony-forming ability in vitro and leukemogenic capacity in vivo. The reduced frequency of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) among MycV394D-AML cells and their reduced leukemogenic capacity during serial transplantation suggest that Myc-Miz1 interaction is required for the self-renewal of LSCs. In addition, we found that MycV394D-AML cells are more sensitive to chemotherapy than are Myc-AML cells. Mechanistically, we found that Myc represses Miz1-mediated expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (Cebpalpha) and Cebpdelta, thus playing an important role in the pathogenesis of AML by maintaining the undifferentiated state and self-renewal capacity of LSCs.","['Zhang, Lei', 'Li, Jing', 'Xu, Hui', 'Shao, Xianyu', 'Fu, Li', 'Hou, Ye', 'Hao, Caiqing', 'Li, Wenyan', 'Joshi, Kanak', 'Wei, Wei', 'Xu, Yan', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Dai, Shaojun', 'Breslin, Peter', 'Zhang, Jiwang', 'Zhang, Jun']","['Zhang L', 'Li J', 'Xu H', 'Shao X', 'Fu L', 'Hou Y', 'Hao C', 'Li W', 'Joshi K', 'Wei W', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang F', 'Dai S', 'Breslin P', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang J']","[""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL.', ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Lanzhou University Second Hospital, Lanzhou, China.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL.', ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL.', 'Department of Biology and.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Physiology, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL; and.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL.', 'Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL.', ""Department of Biology, College of Life Sciences, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (Cebpd protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Miz1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/*metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Self Renewal', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2020/02/11 06:00,2020/11/03 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62136-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001863 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Apr 2;135(14):1133-1145. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001863.,,,['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, CDK6 silencing is more effective than treatment with the dual CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in suppressing Ph+ ALL in mice, suggesting that the growth-promoting effects of CDK6 are, in part, kinase-independent in Ph+ ALL. Accordingly, we developed CDK4/6-targeted proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that inhibit CDK6 enzymatic activity in vitro, promote the rapid and preferential degradation of CDK6 over CDK4 in Ph+ ALL cells, and markedly suppress S-phase cells concomitant with inhibition of CDK6-regulated phospho-RB and FOXM1 expression. No such effects were observed in CD34+ normal hematopoietic progenitors, although CDK6 was efficiently degraded. Treatment with the CDK6-degrading PROTAC YX-2-107 markedly suppressed leukemia burden in mice injected with de novo or tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant primary Ph+ ALL cells, and this effect was comparable or superior to that of the CDK4/6 enzymatic inhibitor palbociclib. These studies provide ""proof of principle"" that targeting CDK6 with PROTACs that inhibit its enzymatic activity and promote its degradation represents an effective strategy to exploit the ""CDK6 dependence"" of Ph+ ALL and, perhaps, of other hematologic malignancies. Moreover, they suggest that treatment of Ph+ ALL with CDK6-selective PROTACs would spare a high proportion of normal hematopoietic progenitors, preventing the neutropenia induced by treatment with dual CDK4/6 inhibitors.","['De Dominici, Marco', 'Porazzi, Patrizia', 'Xiao, Youcai', 'Chao, Allen', 'Tang, Hsin-Yao', 'Kumar, Gaurav', 'Fortina, Paolo', 'Spinelli, Orietta', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Peterson, Luke F', 'Petruk, Svetlana', 'Barletta, Camilla', 'Mazo, Alexander', 'Cingolani, Gino', 'Salvino, Joseph M', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['De Dominici M', 'Porazzi P', 'Xiao Y', 'Chao A', 'Tang HY', 'Kumar G', 'Fortina P', 'Spinelli O', 'Rambaldi A', 'Peterson LF', 'Petruk S', 'Barletta C', 'Mazo A', 'Cingolani G', 'Salvino JM', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Ospedale Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology-Oncology, Universita Statale Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.', 'The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, cdc', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2020/02/11 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)62064-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019003604 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2020 Apr 30;135(18):1560-1573. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019003604.,,"['R01 GM122844/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA010815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R50 CA221838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL127895/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA056036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA167169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7193186,,,,['Blood. 2020 Apr 30;135(18):1512-1514.

As a prerequisite they need to adopt a polarized cell shape, forming a leading edge at the front and a uropod at rear pole. In this study we explored the capability of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells to adopt this leukocyte-specific migration phenotype. Furthermore, we studied the impact of the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonists CpGs type A, B and C and the antagonist oligodesoxynucleotide (ODN) INH-18 on the cell polarization and migration process of primary human CLL cells. Upon cultivation, a portion of purified CLL cells adopted polarized cell shapes spontaneously (range 10-38%). Stimulation with CpG ODNs type B (ODN 2006) and CpGs type C (ODN 2395) significantly increased the frequency of morphologically polarized CLL cells, while ODN INH-18 was hardly able to act antagonistically. Like in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, in morphologically polarized CLL cells CXCR4 was redistributed to the leading edge and CD50 to the uropod. Coupled to the increased frequencies of morphologically polarized cells, CpGs type B and C stimulated CLL cells showed higher migration activities in vitro and following intravenous injection higher homing frequencies to the bone marrow of immunocompromised NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. Thus, presumably independent of TLR-9 signaling, CpGs type B and C promote the cellular polarization process of CLL cells and their ability to migrate in vitro and in vivo.","['Dampmann, Maria', 'Gorgens, Andre', 'Mollmann, Michael', 'Murke, Florian', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Giebel, Bernd', 'Durig, Jan']","['Dampmann M', 'Gorgens A', 'Mollmann M', 'Murke F', 'Duhrsen U', 'Giebel B', 'Durig J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, St. Josef Hospital, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200210,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (CpG ODN 2006)', '0 (CpG ODN 2395)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (TLR9 protein, human)', '0 (Tlr9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism']",2020/02/11 06:00,2020/05/07 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0228674 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-25199 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Feb 10;15(2):e0228674. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228674. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-1418-3269', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9198-0857']",,,PMC7010256,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BRAF V600E and the latter 4 markers are usually absent in the more aggressive and chemoresistant variant HCLv. To evaluate differences between HCL and HCLv, expression microarrays comparing HCL with HCLv were performed for 24694 genes using 47323 probes. Microarray data from 35 HCL and 27 HCLv purified samples showed the greatest HCL-HCLv difference in the muscle-associated gene MYF6, expressed by its 2 probes 18.5- and 10.8-fold higher in HCL than HCLv (p<0.0001). By real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR), 100% of 152 classic HCL samples were MYF6-positive, vs 5 (6%) of 90 blood donors. MYF6-expression was also detected in 18 (35%) of 51 with HCLv, 11 (92%) of 12 with HCL expressing unmutated IGHV4-34, 35 (73%) of 48 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 1 (8%) of 12 with mantle cell lymphoma. Hypomethylation status of MYF6 supported expression in HCL more than HCLv. Posttreatment blood samples becoming negative by flow cytometry remained MYF6+ by RQ-PCR in 42 (48%) of 87 HCL patients, and MYF6 RQ-PCR could detect 1 HCL in 105 normal cells. MYF6, universally expressed in HCL and in most CLL samples, may be a useful biomarker for these leukemias.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the data on the efficacy of antiviral prophylaxis for the prevention of HBV reactivation in this group of patients. METHODS: We conducted a systemic literature search of PubMed including MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to 31 January 2019 to identify studies published in English comparing antiviral prophylaxis with no prophylaxis for HBV reactivation in patients treated for hematological malignancies. The search terms used were (""occult hepatitis B"" OR ""resolved hepatitis B"") AND (""reactivation"") AND (""haematological malignancy"" OR ""hematological malignancy"" OR ""chemotherapy"" OR ""immunotherapy"" OR ""chemoimmunotherapy"" OR ""lymphoma"" OR ""leukemia"" OR ""transplant""). The primary outcome was the reactivation of HBV infection. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: We identified 13 relevant studies including two randomized controlled trials (RCT), one post hoc analysis from RCT and 10 cohort studies. There was a trend towards a lower rate of HBV reactivation using antiviral prophylaxis, but the difference was not significant (RR 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-1.40, P = 0.22). When limiting the analysis to the three prospective studies of patients receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, we found antiviral prophylaxis was associated with a significantly lower risk of HBV reactivation (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.06-0.49, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Antiviral prophylaxis reduced the risk of HBV reactivation in patients receiving anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for hematological malignancies but not in a broader group of patients receiving anticancer therapy.","['Cheung, Carmen Ka Man', 'Law, Man Fai', 'Chao, David Chun', 'Wong, Sunny Hei', 'Ho, Rita', 'Chao, Amelia Chien Wei', 'Lai, Jennifer Wing Yan', 'Chan, Ted Yun Tat', 'Tam, Mark Tsz Kin', 'Lau, Sam Lik Fung', 'Tam, Tommy Ho Chi']","['Cheung CKM', 'Law MF', 'Chao DC', 'Wong SH', 'Ho R', 'Chao ACW', 'Lai JWY', 'Chan TYT', 'Tam MTK', 'Lau SLF', 'Tam THC']","['Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Institute of Digestive Disease, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine, North District Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",20200320,Australia,J Dig Dis,Journal of digestive diseases,101302699,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*adverse effects', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chemoprevention/methods', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/virology', 'Hepatitis B/*prevention & control/virology', 'Hepatitis B virus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation/drug effects']",2020/02/11 06:00,2021/03/30 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/30 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1751-2980.12848 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dig Dis. 2020 Mar;21(3):160-169. doi: 10.1111/1751-2980.12848.

By entering G0, cancer cells survive unfavorable conditions such as chemotherapy and cause relapse. While G0 cells have been studied at the transcriptome level, how post-transcriptional regulation contributes to their chemoresistance remains unknown. RESULTS: We induce chemoresistant and G0 leukemic cells by serum starvation or chemotherapy treatment. To study post-transcriptional regulation in G0 leukemic cells, we systematically analyzed their transcriptome, translatome, and proteome. We find that our resistant G0 cells recapitulate gene expression profiles of in vivo chemoresistant leukemic and G0 models. In G0 cells, canonical translation initiation is inhibited; yet we find that inflammatory genes are highly translated, indicating alternative post-transcriptional regulation. Importantly, AU-rich elements (AREs) are significantly enriched in the upregulated G0 translatome and transcriptome. Mechanistically, we find the stress-responsive p38 MAPK-MK2 signaling pathway stabilizes ARE mRNAs by phosphorylation and inactivation of mRNA decay factor, Tristetraprolin (TTP) in G0. This permits expression of ARE mRNAs that promote chemoresistance. Conversely, inhibition of TTP phosphorylation by p38 MAPK inhibitors and non-phosphorylatable TTP mutant decreases ARE-bearing TNFalpha and DUSP1 mRNAs and sensitizes leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Furthermore, co-inhibiting p38 MAPK and TNFalpha prior to or along with chemotherapy substantially reduces chemoresistance in primary leukemic cells ex vivo and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These studies uncover post-transcriptional regulation underlying chemoresistance in leukemia. Our data reveal the p38 MAPK-MK2-TTP axis as a key regulator of expression of ARE-bearing mRNAs that promote chemoresistance. By disrupting this pathway, we develop an effective combination therapy against chemosurvival.","['Lee, Sooncheol', 'Micalizzi, Douglas', 'Truesdell, Samuel S', 'Bukhari, Syed I A', 'Boukhali,

We term the use of single-cell chemistries for sequencing low numbers of cells limiting-cell RNA-seq (lcRNA-seq). Currently, there is no customized algorithm to select robust/low-noise transcripts from lcRNA-seq data for between-group comparisons. METHODS: Herein, we present CLEAR, a workflow that identifies reliably quantifiable transcripts in lcRNA-seq data for differentially expressed genes (DEG) analysis. Total RNA obtained from primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) CD5+ and CD5- cells were used to develop the CLEAR algorithm. Once established, the performance of CLEAR was evaluated with FACS-sorted cells enriched from mouse Dentate Gyrus (DG). RESULTS: When using CLEAR transcripts vs. using all transcripts in CLL samples, downstream analyses revealed a higher proportion of shared transcripts across three input amounts and improved principal component analysis (PCA) separation of the two cell types. In mouse DG samples, CLEAR identifies noisy transcripts and their removal improves PCA separation of the anticipated cell populations. In addition, CLEAR was applied to two publicly-available datasets to demonstrate its utility in lcRNA-seq data from other institutions. If imputation is applied to limit the effect of missing data points, CLEAR can also be used in large clinical trials and in single cell studies. CONCLUSIONS: lcRNA-seq coupled with CLEAR is widely used in our institution for profiling immune cells (circulating or tissue-infiltrating) for its transcript preservation characteristics. CLEAR fills an important niche in pre-processing lcRNA-seq data to facilitate transcriptome profiling and DEG analysis. We demonstrate the utility of CLEAR in analyzing rare cell populations in clinical samples and in murine neural DG region without sample pooling.","['Walker, Logan A', 'Sovic, Michael G', 'Chiang, Chi-Ling', 'Hu, Eileen', 'Denninger, Jiyeon K', 'Chen, Xi', 'Kirby, Elizabeth D', 'Byrd, John C', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Bundschuh, Ralf', 'Yan, Pearlly']","['Walker LA', 'Sovic MG', 'Chiang CL', 'Hu E', 'Denninger JK', 'Chen X', 'Kirby ED', 'Byrd JC', 'Muthusamy N', 'Bundschuh R', 'Yan P']","['Department of Physics, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Chronic Brain Injury Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Physics, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. bundschuh@mps.ohio-state.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. bundschuh@mps.ohio-state.edu.', 'Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, College of Arts and Sciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. bundschuh@mps.ohio-state.edu.', 'Center for RNA Biology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. bundschuh@mps.ohio-state.edu.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.

The AS data, RNA sequencing data, and the survival statistics of 136 AML patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and TCGA SpliceSeq databases. Total 34,984 AS events generated from 8,656 genes, 2,583 of which were survival-associated AS events, were identified using univariate Cox regression. The prognostic models constructed using independent survival-associated AS events revealed that low-risk splicing better predicted patients' survival. ROC analysis indicated that the predictive efficacy of the alternate terminator model was best in the area under the curve at 0.781. Enrichment analysis revealed several important genes (TP53, BCL2, AURKB, PPP2R1B, FOS, and BIRC5) and pathways, such as the protein processing pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum, RNA transport pathway, and HTLV-I infection pathway. The splicing network of splicing events and factors revealed interesting interactions, such as the positive correlation between HNRNPH3 and CALHM2-13010-AT, which may indicate the potential splicing regulatory mechanism. Taken together, survival-associated splicing events and the prognostic signatures for predicting survival can help provide an overview of splicing in AML patients and facilitate clinical practice. The splicing regulatory network may improve the understanding of spliceosomes in AML.","['Xie, Z C', 'Gao, L', 'Chen, G', 'Ma, J', 'Yang, L H', 'He, R Q', 'Li, M W', 'Cai, K T', 'Li, T T', 'Peng, Z G']","['Xie ZC', 'Gao L', 'Chen G', 'Ma J', 'Yang LH', 'He RQ', 'Li MW', 'Cai KT', 'Li TT', 'Peng ZG']","['Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200209,Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",2020/02/11 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.4149/neo_2020_190917N922 [doi]', '190917N922 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2020 May;67(3):623-635. doi: 10.4149/neo_2020_190917N922.

Methods and Materials: Level 3 AML patients gene transcriptome profiles were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Clinical characteristics and survival data were extracted from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) tool. Then, limma package was utilized for normalization processing. ESTIMATE algorithm was used for calculating immune, stromal and ESTIMATE scores. We examined the distribution of these scores in Cancer and Acute Leukemia Group B (CALGB) cytogenetics risk category. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves were used to evaluate the relationship between immune scores, stromal scores, ESTIMATE scores and overall survival. We performed clustering analysis and screened differential expressed genes (DEGs) by using heatmaps, volcano plots and Venn plots. After pathway enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GESA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and hub genes were screened. We explore the prognostic value of hub genes by calculating risk scores (RS) and processing survival analysis. Finally, we verified the expression level, association of overall survival and gene interactions of hub genes in the Vizome database. Results: We enrolled 173 AML samples from TCGA database in our study. Higher immune score was associated with higher risk rating in CALGB cytogenetics risk category (P = 0.0396) and worse overall survival outcomes (P = 0.0224). In Venn plots, 827 intersect genes were screened with differential analysis. Functional enrichment clustering analysis revealed a significant association between intersect genes and the immune response. After PPI network, 18 TME-related hub genes were identified. RS was calculated and the survival analysis results revealed that high RS was related with poor overall survival (P < 0.0001). Besides, the survival receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed superior predictive accuracy (area under the curve = 0.725). Finally, the heatmap from Vizome database demonstrated that 18 hub genes showed high expression in patient samples. Conclusion: We identified 18 TME-related genes which significantly associated with overall survival in AML patients from TCGA database.","['Ni, Jie', 'Wu, Yang', 'Qi, Feng', 'Li, Xiao', 'Yu, Shaorong', 'Liu, Siwen', 'Feng, Jifeng', 'Zheng, Yuxiao']","['Ni J', 'Wu Y', 'Qi F', 'Li X', 'Yu S', 'Liu S', 'Feng J', 'Zheng Y']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Research Center for Clinical Oncology, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Research Center for Clinical Oncology, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Urology, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200121,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2020/02/11 06:00,2020/02/11 06:01,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01509 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 21;9:1509. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01509. eCollection 2019.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Ni, Wu, Qi, Li, Yu, Liu, Feng and Zheng.']",PMC6990132,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'biomarkers', 'immune infiltrates', 'immune/stromal scores', 'tumor microenvironment (TME)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While most of these are focused on stimulating the adaptive immune system (including T cell checkpoint inhibitors), several key approaches targeting the innate immune system have been identified. Macrophages are a key cell type in the innate immune response with CD47 being identified as a dominant macrophage checkpoint. CD47 is a ""do not eat me"" signal, overexpressed in myeloid malignancies that leads to tumor evasion of phagocytosis by macrophages. Blockade of CD47 leads to engulfment of leukemic cells and therapeutic elimination. Pre-clinical data has demonstrated robust anti-cancer activity in multiple hematologic malignancies including AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In addition, clinical studies have been underway with CD47 targeting agents in both AML and MDS as monotherapy and in combination. This review will describe the role of CD47 in myeloid malignancies and pre-clinical data supporting CD47 targeting. In addition, initial clinical data of CD47 targeting in AML/MDS will be reviewed, and including the first-in-class anti-CD47 antibody magrolimab.","['Chao, Mark P', 'Takimoto, Chris H', 'Feng, Dong Dong', 'McKenna, Kelly', 'Gip, Phung', 'Liu, Jie', 'Volkmer, Jens-Peter', 'Weissman, Irving L', 'Majeti, Ravindra']","['Chao MP', 'Takimoto CH', 'Feng DD', 'McKenna K', 'Gip P', 'Liu J', 'Volkmer JP', 'Weissman IL', 'Majeti R']","['Forty Seven, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, United States.', 'Forty Seven, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, United States.', 'Forty Seven, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, United States.', 'Forty Seven, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, United States.', 'Forty Seven, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, United States.', 'Forty Seven, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, United States.', 'Forty Seven, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, United States.', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States.', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200122,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2020/02/11 06:00,2020/02/11 06:01,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.01380 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 22;9:1380. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.01380. eCollection 2019.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Chao, Takimoto, Feng, McKenna, Gip, Liu, Volkmer, Weissman and', 'Majeti.']",PMC6990910,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'CD47', 'MDS', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia stem cell (LSC)', 'macrophage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many features of canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma resemble the ABC form of human DLBCL, including constitutive activation of the NF-kB pathway, and almost universal presence of double expressing MYC/BCL2 lymphomas. Frequent TRAF3 mutations and absence of BCL6 expression are differences with the human disease that need further exploration. Canine peripheral T-cell lymphoma is more common in dogs than in people and behaves in a similarly aggressive manner. Common features of canine and human PTCL include activation of the PI3 kinase pathways, loss of PTEN, and the tumor suppressor CDKN2. There is insufficient data available yet to determine if canine PTCL exhibits the GATA3-TBX21 dichotomy seen in people. Common to all forms of canine lymphoproliferative disease are breed-specific predilections for subsets of disease. This is particularly striking in PTCL, with the Boxer breed being dramatically overrepresented. Breed-specific diseases provide an opportunity for uncovering genetic and environmental risk factors that can aid early diagnosis and prevention.","['Avery, Anne C']",['Avery AC'],"['Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Science, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200124,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2020/02/11 06:00,2020/02/11 06:01,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2020.00023 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2020 Jan 24;10:23. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2020.00023. eCollection 2020.,,,['Copyright (c) 2020 Avery.'],PMC6992561,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoid leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'canine', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'diffuse large B cell lymphoma', 'dog', 'peripheral T cell lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since stable cytoskeleton structure and dynamics are partly regulated by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), many current studies focused on MLCK inhibition as a chemotherapeutic target. As a potent and selective MLCK inhibitor, ML-7 [1-(5-iodonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-hexahydro-1,4-diazapine hydrochloride] is a promising candidate for an anticancer agent, which would induce apoptosis as well as prevents invasion and metastasis in certain types of cancer cells. This study assessed cytotoxic effects of ML-7 against HL-60 cells and therapeutic efficacy of ML-7 as a potential antileukemia agent. Trypan-blue exclusion assays showed dose- and time- dependent decreases in ML-7 treated HL-60 cells (p < 0.05). Comet assays revealed a significant increase in DNA damage in HL-60 cells after treatment with 40 microM ML-7 for 2 h. Sub-G1 fractions, analyzed by flow cytometry increased in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that ML-7 can induce apoptotic cell death in HL-60 cells. ML-7 was selectively cytotoxic towards HL-60 cells; not affecting normal human lymphocytes. That selective effect makes it a promising potential anti-leukemia agent. In addition, anticancer efficacy of ML-7 in combination with flavonoids (genistein or quercetin) or anticancer drugs (cisplatin or AraC) against HL-60 cells was assessed. Combination of ML-7 with flavonoids increased the anticancer effect of ML-7 to a greater extent than combination with the anticancer drugs. This implies that ML-7 in combination with flavonoids could increase the efficacy of anticancer treatment, while avoiding side effects cansed by conventional anticancer drug-containing combination chemotherapy.","['Lee, Joong Won', 'Kim, Yang Jee', 'Choi, Young Joo', 'Woo, Hae Dong', 'Kim, Gye Eun', 'Ha, Tae Kyung', 'Lee, Young Hyun', 'Chung, Hai Won']","['Lee JW', 'Kim YJ', 'Choi YJ', 'Woo HD', 'Kim GE', 'Ha TK', 'Lee YH', 'Chung HW']","['School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905', 'School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905', 'School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905', 'School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905', 'School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905', 'School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905', 'School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905', 'School of Public Health and Institute of Health and Environment, Seoul National University, 28 Yongon-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 110-460 Korea.grid.31501.360000 0004 0470 5905']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20091230,Singapore,Toxicol Res,Toxicological research,101483324,,,,2009/12/01 00:00,2009/12/01 00:01,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2009/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2009/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2009/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/12/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.5487/TR.2009.25.4.181 [doi]', '2504181 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Res. 2009 Dec;25(4):181-188. doi: 10.5487/TR.2009.25.4.181.

Menadione was found to induce both apoptosis and necrosis in HL-60 cells. Low concentration (1~50 microM) of menadione induced apoptotic cell death, which was demonstrated by typical DNA ladder patterns on agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis. In contrast, a high concentration of menadione (100 microM) induced necrotic cell death, which was demonstrated by DNA smear pattern in agarose gel electrophoresis. Necrotic cell death was accompanied with a great reduction of cell viability.

The 80% methanol extract, chloroform (CHCI3) fraction and butanol (BuOH) fraction of C asiaticum inhibited the growth of mitoxantrone (MX) resistant HL-60 (HL-60/MX2) cells. When HL-60/MX2 cells were treated with the CHCI3 and BuOH fractions, DNA ladder and sub-G1 hypodiploid cells were observed. Furthermore, the fractions reduced Bcl-2 mRNA levels, whereas Bax mRNA levels were increased. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of C. asiaticum on the growth of the HL-60/MX2 cells might arise from the induction of apoptosis. Treatment of HL-60/MX2 cells with the fractions markedly decreased the mRNA levels of the multi-drug resistance protein-1 and breast cancer resistance protein. The CHCI3 fraction and hexane fraction increased MX accumulation in HL-60/MX2 cells. These results imply that the CHCI3 fraction of C asiaticum plays a pivotal role as a chemosensitizer.

However, the role and function of miR-141-5p in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are unclear. In this current study, we found that the level of miR-141-5p was significantly decreased in peripheral blood cells from CML patients compared with normal blood cells and human leukemic cell line (K562 cells) compared with normal CD34(+) cells, but was remarkably elevated in patients after treatment with nilotinib or imatinib. Suppression of miR-141-5p promoted K562 cell proliferation and migration in vitro. As expected, overexpression of miR-141-5p weakened K562 cell proliferation, migration, and promoted cell apoptosis. A xenograft model in nude mice showed that overexpression of miR-141-5p markedly suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic studies suggested that RAB32 was the potential target of miR-141-5p, and silencing of RAB32 suppressed the proliferation and migration of K562 cells and promoted cell apoptosis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that miR-141-5p plays an important role in the activation of K562 cells in vitro and may act as a tumor suppressor via targeting RAB32 in the development of CML.","['Bao, Jing', 'Li, Xiaofeng', 'Li, Yuhuan', 'Huang, Cheng', 'Meng, Xiaoming', 'Li, Jun']","['Bao J', 'Li X', 'Li Y', 'Huang C', 'Meng X', 'Li J']","['Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200122,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,2020/02/11 06:00,2020/02/11 06:01,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.01545 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2020 Jan 22;10:1545. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.01545. eCollection 2019.,,,"['Copyright (c) 2020 Bao, Li, Li, Huang, Meng and Li.']",PMC6987442,,['NOTNLM'],"['K652', 'RAB32', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'miR-141-5p', 'proliferation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the functions of Bmi-1 in the oral cavity we created a transgenic mouse line (KrTBmi-1) that expresses ectopic, Flag-tagged Bmi-1 in tongue basal epithelial stem cells only upon doxycycline (DOX) treatment. Genome wide transcriptomics and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified several pathways altered by exogenous Bmi-1 expression in the normal tongue epithelium, including EIF2 signaling (P value = 1.58 x 10(-49)), mTOR signaling (P value = 2.45 x 10(-12)), oxidative phosphorylation (P = 6.61 x 10(-3)) and glutathione redox reactions I (P = 1.74 x 10(-2)). Overall, our data indicate that ectopic Bmi-1 expression has an impact on normal tongue epithelial homeostasis. We then assessed the KrTBmi-1 mice in the 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) model of oral carcinogenesis. We found that 80% of mice expressing exogenous Bmi-1 (+DOX, +4-NQO KrTBmi-1; N = 10) developed tumors classified as grade 3 or higher, compared to 60% and 40% of mice expressing just endogenous Bmi-1 (+DOX, +4-NQO Kr and -DOX, +4-NQO KrTBmi-1 groups, respectively; N = 10/group; P value = <0.0001); and 30% of mice expressing ectopic Bmi-1 mice developed 20 or more lesions compared to 10% of mice expressing only endogenous Bmi-1 (P = .009). This demonstrates that exogenous Bmi-1 expression increases the susceptibility of mice to 4-NQO-induced oral carcinogenesis, strengthening the evidence for Bmi-1 as a therapeutic target in human oral squamous cell carcinoma.","['Kalish, Jocelin M', 'Tang, Xiao-Han', 'Scognamiglio, Theresa', 'Zhang, Tuo', 'Gudas, Lorraine J']","['Kalish JM', 'Tang XH', 'Scognamiglio T', 'Zhang T', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, New York, NY, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Genomics Core Facility, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, New York, NY, USA.', 'Meyer Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200209,United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '56-57-5 (4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/toxicity', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxycycline/*toxicity', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/etiology/metabolism/*pathology']",2020/02/11 06:00,2020/12/17 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/17 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2020.1720485 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2020 May 3;21(5):400-411. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2020.1720485.

Further clinical trials demonstrated the safety and efficacy of CPX-351 in older adults, particularly those with secondary AML (sAML). The treatment landscape of AML is evolving with the recent approval of multiple therapeutic agents. Further studies are indicated to evaluate the role of CPX-351 potentially in combination with other targeted drugs.","['Asghari, Hannah', 'Lancet, Jeffrey']","['Asghari H', 'Lancet J']","['Malignant Hematology Department, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Malignant Hematology Department, Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200208,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (CPX-351)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', '*Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Liposomes/therapeutic use']",2020/02/11 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1719093 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jun;61(6):1305-1312. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1719093.

After a median follow-up of 941 days (range, 69-2842 days), leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 years were 26.6% and 25.6%, respectively. The nonrelapse mortality rate (NMR) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) were 36.4% and 42.4%, respectively. The Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the risk factors at second transplantation for predicting limited LFS were active disease (hazard ratio (HR) = 5.1), reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) (HR = 5.0), matched unrelated donor (MUD) (HR = 3.4) and performance score <80 (HR = 3.2). Pediatric patients with AL who relapsed after their first alloHSCT may survive with a second alloHSCT. Disease status, conditioning intensity, donor type, and performance score at the second transplantation are the relevant risk factors. A score based on these factors may predict the results of the second transplantation.","['Hazar, Volkan', 'Karasu, Gulsun Tezcan', 'Uygun, Vedat', 'Ozbek, Namik', 'Karakukcu, Musa', 'Ozturk, Gulyuz', 'Daloglu, Hayriye', 'Kilic, Suar Caki', 'Aksu, Tekin', 'Unal, Ekrem', 'Kocak, Ulker', 'Yesilipek, Akif', 'Akcay, Arzu', 'Gursel, Orhan', 'Kupesiz, Alphan', 'Okur, Fatma Visal', 'Ileri, Talia', 'Kansoy, Savas', 'Bayram, Ibrahim', 'Karagun, Barbaros Sahin', 'Gokce, Muge', 'Kaya, Zuhre', 'Ok Bozkaya, Ikbal', 'Patiroglu, Turkan', 'Aksoylar, Serap']","['Hazar V', 'Karasu GT', 'Uygun V', 'Ozbek N', 'Karakukcu M', 'Ozturk G', 'Daloglu H', 'Kilic SC', 'Aksu T', 'Unal E', 'Kocak U', 'Yesilipek A', 'Akcay A', 'Gursel O', 'Kupesiz A', 'Okur FV', 'Ileri T', 'Kansoy S', 'Bayram I', 'Karagun BS', 'Gokce M', 'Kaya Z', 'Ok Bozkaya I', 'Patiroglu T', 'Aksoylar S']","['Pediatric BMT Unit, Medical Park Goztepe Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Medical Park Goztepe Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Medical Park Antalya Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Ankara Diskapi Child Health and Diseases Hematology Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Acibadem University Faculty of Medicine, Acibadem Atakent Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Medical Park Antalya Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Medical Park Goztepe Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Ankara Diskapi Child Health and Diseases Hematology Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Medical Park Antalya Hospital, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Acibadem University Faculty of Medicine, Acibadem Atakent Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, University of Health Sciences Faculty of Medicine, Ankara GATA Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Cukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Acibadem Adana Hospital, Adana, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Yuzuncu Yil University Faculty of Medicine, GOP Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Gazi University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Ankara Diskapi Child Health and Diseases Hematology Oncology Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Kayseri, Turkey.', 'Pediatric BMT Unit, Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200208,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Unrelated Donors']",2020/02/11 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1716220 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jun;61(6):1465-1474. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1716220.

In the present study, we investigate the effect of recombined human NRG-1 (rhNRG-1) on mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial function, and cell survival in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (NRCMs) exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). The results of this study showed that, in the H/R-exposed NRCMs, mitochondrial biogenesis was impaired, as manifested by the decrease of the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) and mitochondrial membrane proteins, the inner membrane (Tim23), mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), and mitofusin 2 (Mfn2). RhNRG-1 pretreatment effectively restored the expression of PGC-1alpha and these membrane proteins, upregulated the expression of the anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, preserved the mitochondrial membrane potential, and attenuated H/R-induced cell apoptosis. Blocking PGC-1 expression with siRNA abolished the beneficial role of rhNRG-1 on mitochondrial function and cell survival. The results of the present study strongly suggest that NRG-1/ErbB activation enhances the adaption of cardiomyocytes to H/R injury via promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial homeostasis. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: The results of this research revealed for the first time the relationship between neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)/erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologues (ErbB) activation and mitochondrial biogenesis in neonatal cardiomyocytes and verified the significance of this promoted mitochondrial biogenesis in attenuating hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. This finding may open a new field to further understand the biological role of NRG-1/ErbB signalling pathway in cardiomyocyte.","['Zhang, Xiao-Xia', 'Wu, Xue-Si', 'Mi, Shu-Hua', 'Fang, Shan-Juan', 'Liu, Sa', 'Xin, Yi', 'Zhao, Quan-Ming']","['Zhang XX', 'Wu XS', 'Mi SH', 'Fang SJ', 'Liu S', 'Xin Y', 'Zhao QM']","['Department of Cardiology, Beijing AnZhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing AnZhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing AnZhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Emergency and Critical Care Center, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, China.', 'Institute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, The Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Beijing Anzhen Hospital, The Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Cardiology, Beijing AnZhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200210,England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NRSN1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*metabolism/pathology', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",2020/02/11 06:00,2021/05/21 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2019/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.3503 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 2020 Jul;38(5):549-557. doi: 10.1002/cbf.3503.

This biological therapy relies upon the differences in the metabolism of cancer and normal cells. The rapid growth of tumors results in decreased expression of certain enzymes leading to auxotrophy for some specific amino acids. These auxotrophic tumors are targeted by amino acid-depleting enzymes. The depletion of amino acid selectively inhibits tumor growth as the normal cells can synthesize amino acids by their usual machinery. The enzymes used in AADT are mostly obtained from microbes for their easy availability. Microbial L-asparaginase is already approved by FDA for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Arginine deiminase and methionase are under clinical trials and the therapeutic potential of lysine oxidase, glutaminase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase is also being explored. The present review provides an overview of microbial amino acid depriving enzymes. Various attributes of these enzymes like structure, mode of action, production, formulations, and targeted cancers are discussed.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of the ginseng derivative, ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), on CD34+CD38- LSCs derived from KG1a human acute myeloid leukemia cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS CD34+CD38- LSCs were isolated from KG1a human acute myeloid leukemia cells by cell sorting. CD34+CD38- KG1alpha LSCs were divided into the control group and the Rg1 group (treated with Rg1). The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay evaluated the proliferation of CD34+CD38- KG1alpha LSCs and flow cytometry studied the cell cycle. The mixed colony-forming unit (CFU-Mix) assay and staining for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-ss-Gal) evaluated cell senescence. Expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) were evaluated using Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RESULTS CD34+CD38- KG1alpha LSCs were isolated at 98.72%. Rg1 significantly reduced the proliferation of CD34+CD38- KG1alpha LSCs compared with the control group (p<0.05). Cells in the G0/G1 phase were significantly increased, and cells in the G2/M and S phase were significantly reduced compared with the control group (p<0.05). Rg1 significantly increased SA-ss-Gal and reduced CFU-Mix formation compared with the control group (p<0.05), significantly down-regulated SIRT1 expression in CD34+CD38- KG1alpha LSCs compared with the control group (p<0.05), and significantly reduced TSC2 expression in CD34+CD38- KG1alpha LSCs compared with the control group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS Rg1 inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell senescence markers in CD34+CD38- KG1alpha LSCs by activating the SIRT1/TSC2 signaling pathway.","['Tang, Yan-Long', 'Zhang, Cheng-Gui', 'Liu, Heng', 'Zhou, Yue', 'Wang, Ya-Ping', 'Li, Yuan', 'Han, Yan-Jun', 'Wang, Cui-Li']","['Tang YL', 'Zhang CG', 'Liu H', 'Zhou Y', 'Wang YP', 'Li Y', 'Han YJ', 'Wang CL']","['Department of Radiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dali University, Dali, Yunnan, China (mainland).', 'Key Laboratory of Insect Biomedicine Research and Development in Yunnan Province, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan, China (mainland).', 'Key Laboratory of Insect Biomedicine Research and Development in Yunnan Province, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan, China (mainland).', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Dali University, Dali, Yunnan, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200210,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', 'EC 3.2.1.21 (beta-Glucosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'PJ788634QY (ginsenoside Rg1)', 'Tuberous Sclerosis 2']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/*drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirtuin 1/*metabolism', 'Tuberous Sclerosis/*metabolism', 'beta-Glucosidase/metabolism']",2020/02/11 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]']","['918207 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.918207 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2020 Feb 10;26:e918207. doi: 10.12659/MSM.918207.,,,,PMC7032532,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the clinical implications of SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts in MDS-refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (MDS-RCMD) remain unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features in 238 MDS-RCMD patients were retrospectively analyzed, and the prognostic significance of SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts on overall survival and leukemia-free survival in total MDS-RCMD patients and different subgroups stratified by the percentage of ring sideroblasts or SF3B1 mutation status were evaluated. RESULTS: MDS-RCMD patients with ring sideroblasts >/= 15% showed a significantly higher prevalence of SF3B1 mutation compared to ring sideroblasts 5%-14% or ring sideroblasts < 5% (75.6% vs. 15.1% vs. 6.4%, P < .001). In multivariate analysis, SF3B1 mutation was associated with a significantly prolonged survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.430, P = .013) and reduced leukemic transformation (HR = 0.174, P = .021) in total MDS-RCMD patients, while ring sideroblasts showed no independent effect on either survival or leukemic transformation. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics or survival between MDS-RCMD patients with ring sideroblasts >/= 15% and ring sideroblasts 5%-14% in the presence of SF3B1 mutation. Furthermore, SF3B1 mutation showed an independent prognostic effect on overall survival in MDS-RCMD patients with ring sideroblasts 5%-14% (HR = 0.195, P = .046). CONCLUSION: SF3B1 mutation, not the presence of ring sideroblasts, identifies a distinct subtype and showed independent prognostic value on survival and leukemia transformation in MDS-RCMD patients.","['Xiong, Bei', 'Xue, Mei', 'Yu, Yalan', 'Wu, Sanyun', 'Zuo, Xuelan']","['Xiong B', 'Xue M', 'Yu Y', 'Wu S', 'Zuo X']","['Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective and prospective study of patients recorded in the Shwachman-Diamond syndrome Italian Registry. RESULTS: The study population included 121 patients, 69 males and 52 females, diagnosed between 1999 and 2018. All patients had the clinical diagnosis confirmed by mutational analysis on the SBDS gene. During the study period, the incidence of SDS was 1 in 153 000 births. The median age of patients with SDS at diagnosis was 1.3 years (range, 0-35.6 years). At the first hematologic assessment, severe neutropenia was present in 25.8%, thrombocytopenia in 25.5%, and anemia in 4.6% of patients. A normal karyotype was found in 40 of 79 patients, assessed whereas the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities were isochromosome 7 and interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20. The cumulative incidence of severe neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia at 30 years of age were 59.9%, 66.8%, and 20.2%, respectively. The 20-year cumulative incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia and of bone marrow failure/severe cytopenia was 9.8% and 9.9%, respectively. Fifteen of 121 patients (12.4%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Fifteen patients (12.4%) died; the probability of overall survival at 10 and 20 years was 95.7% and 87.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an improvement in survival, hematologic complications still cause death in patients with SDS. Further studies are needed to optimize type and modality of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and to assess the long-term outcome in nontransplanted patients.","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Pegoraro, Anna', 'Sainati, Laura', 'Lucidi, Vincenzina', 'Montemitro, Enza', 'Corti, Paola', 'Ramenghi, Ugo', 'Nasi, Cristina', 'Menna, Giuseppe', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Danesino, Cesare', 'Nicolis, Elena', 'Pasquali, Francesco', 'Perobelli, Sandra', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Farruggia, Piero', 'Cipolli, Marco']","['Cesaro S', 'Pegoraro A', 'Sainati L', 'Lucidi V', 'Montemitro E', 'Corti P', 'Ramenghi U', 'Nasi C', 'Menna G', 'Zecca M', 'Danesino C', 'Nicolis E', 'Pasquali F', 'Perobelli S', 'Tridello G', 'Farruggia P', 'Cipolli M']","['Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Unit, Department of Mother and Child, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.

Whether clozapine might be associated with haematologic malignancies is unknown. We aimed to assess the association between haematologic malignancies and clozapine using Vigibase(R), the WHO pharmacovigilance database. METHODS: We performed a disproportionality analysis to compute reporting odds-ratio adjusted for age, sex and concurrent reporting of antineoplastic/immunomodulating agents (aROR) for clozapine and structurally related drugs (loxapine, olanzapine and quetiapine) compared with other antipsychotic drugs. Cases were malignant lymphoma and leukaemia reports. Non-cases were all other reports including at least one antipsychotic report. RESULTS: Of the 140 226 clozapine-associated reports, 493 were malignant lymphoma cases, and 275 were leukaemia cases. Clozapine was significantly associated with malignant lymphoma (aROR 9.14, 95% CI 7.75-10.77) and leukaemia (aROR 3.54, 95% CI 2.97-4.22). Patients suffering from those haematologic malignancies were significantly younger in the clozapine treatment group than patients treated with other medicines (p < 0.001). The median time to onset (available for 212 cases) was 5.1 years (IQR 2.2-9.9) for malignant lymphoma and 2.5 years (IQR 0.6-7.4) for leukaemia. The aROR by quartile of dose of clozapine in patients with haematologic malignancies suggested a dose-dependent association. CONCLUSIONS: Clozapine was significantly associated with a pharmacovigilance signal of haematologic malignancies. The risk-benefit balance of clozapine should be carefully assessed in patients with risk factors of haematologic malignancies. Clozapine should be used at the lowest effective posology.","['Chretien, Basile', 'Lelong-Boulouard, Veronique', 'Chantepie, Sylvain', 'Sassier, Marion', 'Bertho, Mickael', 'Brazo, Perrine', 'Humbert, Xavier', 'Alexandre, Joachim', 'Fedrizzi, Sophie', 'Dolladille, Charles']","['Chretien B', 'Lelong-Boulouard V', 'Chantepie S', 'Sassier M', 'Bertho M', 'Brazo P', 'Humbert X', 'Alexandre J', 'Fedrizzi S', 'Dolladille C']","['Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Pharmacovigilance Regional Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, UFR Sante, INSERM UMR 1075, COMETE-MOBILITES ""Vieillissement, Pathologie, Sante"", 14000Caen, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Pharmacovigilance Regional Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Pharmacovigilance Regional Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Esquirol Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, EA7466, Imagerie et Strategies Therapeutiques de la Schizophrenie (ISTS), 14000Caen, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Pharmacovigilance Regional Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'General Practice Department, Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, 14000Caen, France.', ""Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, EA4650, Signalisation, electrophysiologie et imagerie des lesions d'ischemie-reperfusion myocardique, 14000Caen, France."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Pharmacovigilance Regional Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', ""Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, EA4650, Signalisation, electrophysiologie et imagerie des lesions d'ischemie-reperfusion myocardique, 14000Caen, France."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', 'Pharmacovigilance Regional Center, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', ""Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, EA4650, Signalisation, electrophysiologie et imagerie des lesions d'ischemie-reperfusion myocardique, 14000Caen, France."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, F-14000, France.', ""Normandie Univ, UNICAEN, EA4650, Signalisation, electrophysiologie et imagerie des lesions d'ischemie-reperfusion myocardique, 14000Caen, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial Protocol', 'Journal Article']",20200210,England,Psychol Med,Psychological medicine,1254142,"['0 (Antipsychotic Agents)', '2S3PL1B6UJ (Quetiapine Fumarate)', 'J60AR2IKIC (Clozapine)', 'LER583670J (Loxapine)', 'N7U69T4SZR (Olanzapine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antipsychotic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Clozapine/*adverse effects', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Loxapine/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Olanzapine/therapeutic use', 'Pharmacovigilance', 'Quetiapine Fumarate/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Schizophrenia, Treatment-Resistant/*drug therapy', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/11 06:00,2022/01/05 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2022/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1017/S0033291720000161 [doi]', 'S0033291720000161 [pii]']",ppublish,Psychol Med. 2021 Jul;51(9):1459-1466. doi: 10.1017/S0033291720000161.

Moreover, mutations in SHP2 have been implicated in Leopard syndrome (LS), Noonan syndrome (NS), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and several types of cancer and solid tumors. Thus, SHP2 inhibitors are much needed reagents for evaluation of SHP2 as a therapeutic target. A series of novel ethyl 4-(phenoxymethyl)-2-phenylthiazole-5-carboxylate derivatives were designed and synthesized, and their SHP2 inhibitory activities (IC50) were determined. Among the desired compounds, 1d shares the highest inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.99 muM) against SHP2. Additionally, a common feature pharmacophore model was established to explain the structure activity relationship of the desired compounds.

Its expression and role in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are unknown. We investigated LILRB4 expression in 19 CMML and 27 MDS patients and correlated it with response to subsequent hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy. LILRB4 RNA expression was increased in CMML patients when compared to MDS patients and healthy controls (q < 0.1) and slightly increased in patients who responded to HMAs (q > 0.1). Pathway analysis revealed upregulation of PD-1 signaling, CTLA-4 signaling, and inflammatory response, and gene correlates were positively associated with CTLA-4 expression. Given current modest results with immunotherapy in myeloid malignancies, further investigation of LILRB4 as an immune checkpoint inhibitor target is needed. With the positive correlation between LILRB4 and CTLA-4 expression, combining anti-LILRB4 and anti-CTLA-4 agents may be a novel therapeutic approach in myeloid malignancies that warrants larger studies.","['Chien, Kelly S', 'Class, Caleb A', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Wei, Yue', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Ganan-Gomez, Irene', 'Yang, Hui', 'Soltysiak, Kelly A', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Do, Kim-Anh', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Chien KS', 'Class CA', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Wei Y', 'Sasaki K', 'Naqvi K', 'Ganan-Gomez I', 'Yang H', 'Soltysiak KA', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Do KA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200208,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (LILRB4 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/genetics', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2020/02/11 06:00,2021/04/24 06:00,['2020/02/11 06:00'],"['2020/02/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1723014 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jun;61(6):1493-1499. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1723014.

Their effector functions were initially appreciated in the 1970s when basophils were shown to express the high-affinity receptor (FcepsilonRI) for IgE and to release proinflammatory mediators (histamine and cysteinyl leukotriene C4) and immunoregulatory cytokines (i.e., IL-4 and IL-13). Basophils in the mouse were subsequently identified and immunologically characterized. There are many similarities but also several differences between human and mouse basophils. Basophil-deficient mice have enabled to examine the in vivo roles of basophils in several immune disorders and, more recently, in tumor immunity. Activated human basophils release several proangiogenic molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), vascular endothelial growth factor-B (VEGF-B), CXCL8, angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). On the other side, basophils can exert anti-tumorigenic effects by releasing granzyme B, TNF-alpha, and histamine. Circulating basophils have been associated with certain human hematologic (i.e., chronic myeloid leukemia) and solid tumors. Basophils have been found in tumor microenvironment (TME) of human lung adenocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Basophils played a role in melanoma rejection in basophil-deficient mouse model. By contrast, basophils appear to play a pro-tumorigenic role in experimental and human pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, the roles of basophils in experimental and human cancers have been little investigated and remain largely unknown. The elucidation of the roles of basophils in tumor immunity will demand studies on increasing complexity beyond those assessing basophil density and their microlocalization in TME. There are several fundamental questions to be addressed in experimental models and clinical studies before we understand whether basophils are an ally, adversary, or even innocent bystanders in cancers.","['Marone, Giancarlo', 'Gambardella, Adriana Rosa', 'Mattei, Fabrizio', 'Mancini, Jacopo', 'Schiavoni, Giovanna', 'Varricchi, Gilda']","['Marone G', 'Gambardella AR', 'Mattei F', 'Mancini J', 'Schiavoni G', 'Varricchi G']","['Department of Public Health, University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy.', 'Azienda Ospedaliera dei Colli-Monaldi Hospital Pharmacy, Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy. giovanna.schiavoni@iss.it.', 'Department of Translational Medical Sciences and Center for Basic and Clinical Immunology Research (CISI), University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy. gildanet@gmail.com.', 'WAO Center of Excellence, Naples, Italy. gildanet@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology and Oncology ""G.

A total of 44 patients (median age 61 years) allografted between 2002 and 2019 in our institution were analyzed. Fifteen patients had secondary AML. The conditioning regimen was fractionated 6-8 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) in combination with fludarabine in 33 (75%) patients. Eleven patients (25%) received alkylator-based conditioning therapy without TBI. For GVHD prophylaxis, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) backbone in combination with methotrexate (MTX) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was applied in 21 and 23 patients, respectively. All patients allografted from an unrelated donor (UD) received antithymocyte globuline. In univariate analysis of the entire cohort, TBI-based conditioning and MMF-containing immunosuppression were associated with improved leukemia-free survival (LFS, HR 0.16, P < 0.001 and HR 0.41, P = 0.030, respectively). After stratification according to conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis into four groups (TBI-MMF [n = 17], TBI-MTX [n = 16], alkylator-MMF [n = 6], alkylator-MTX [n = 5]), TBI-MMF was associated with improved overall survival (OS) and LFS (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Patient and disease characteristics did not differ between the groups. The associations of TBI-based conditioning and MMF with prolonged LFS were observed across the CMML (n = 29), secondary AML (n = 15), and UD allograft (n = 34) subgroups. In summary, our study suggests that allografting based on intermediate-dose TBI conditioning and MMF-containing GVHD prophylaxis is associated with increased disease control in CMML. Larger (registry-based) studies are warranted to confirm our findings.","['Radujkovic, Aleksandar', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Herfarth, Klaus', 'Dreger, Peter', 'Luft, Thomas']","['Radujkovic A', 'Hegenbart U', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Herfarth K', 'Dreger P', 'Luft T']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. aleksandar.radujkovic@med.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 410, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200208,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Calcineurin Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'CO61ER3EPI (treosulfan)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Calcineurin Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2020/02/10 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/10 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03952-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03952-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):855-866. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03952-4.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded trephines are frequently used in hematologic diagnostic tests and provide relevant access to leukemic cells for further studies, for example, phenotyping in bone marrow fibrosis. However, high-throughput molecular analysis of nucleic acids obtained from this material is challenging, especially the reliable detection of RNA transcripts. Sixty-three formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow trephines of patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and myeloproliferative neoplasms were analyzed for gene mutations and the presence of fusion transcripts with a commercial amplicon-based next-generation sequencing approach. Fusion transcripts relevant for diagnosis and therapy could be detected and validated (by RT-PCR) in 25 patients (39.7%).

This mutated allele encodes a truncated form of the receptor (p.P2514Rfs *4) lacking the C-terminal proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine (PEST) degradation domain that increases NOTCH1 signaling duration. NOTCH1 mutation has been associated with poor clinical outcomes in CLL. We validated a highly sensitive and quantitative droplet digital PCR assay for the NOTCH1 delCT mutation, which was anticipated to perform well compared with Sanger sequencing and allele-specific PCR. Performance characteristics of this assay were tested on 126 samples from an unselected CLL cohort and a separate cohort of 85 samples from patients with trisomy 12 CLL. The delCT mutation was detected at allele frequencies as low as 0.024%; 25% of unselected cases and 55% of trisomy 12 cases were positive at the 0.024% detection threshold. Mutational burdens >/=1% were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) in patients with trisomy 12+ disease in multivariate analysis (median OS, 9.1 versus 13 years, with hazard ratio of 2.34; P = 0.031). Mutational burdens <1% correlated with shorter OS in univariate, but not multivariate, analyses. These results suggest that droplet digital PCR testing for NOTCH1 delCT mutation may aid in risk stratification and/or disease monitoring in certain subsets of patients with CLL.","['Hoofd, Catherine', 'Huang, Steven J', 'Gusscott, Samuel', 'Lam, Sonya', 'Wong, Rachel', 'Johnston, Alexa', 'Ben-Neriah, Susana', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Scott, David W', 'Bruyere, Helene', 'Gillan, Tanya L', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Gerrie, Alina S', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Hoofd C', 'Huang SJ', 'Gusscott S', 'Lam S', 'Wong R', 'Johnston A', 'Ben-Neriah S', 'Steidl C', 'Scott DW', 'Bruyere H', 'Gillan TL', 'Toze CL', 'Gerrie AS', 'Weng AP']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and the Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and the Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Department of Pathology, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

A previous study has demonstrated that PML/RARalpha is cleaved by neutrophil elastase (NE) in early myeloid cells, which leads to an increase in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) in RARalpha and in the incidence of APL. In this study, we explored the effects of NLS-RARalpha on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and studied the mechanism of its localization. LV-NLS-RARalpha recombinant lentivirus and negative control LV-NC lentivirus were transfected into HL-60 cells and U937 cells while mutant NLS-RARalpha were transfected into U937 cells, and all groups were treated with 1alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25D3). The results showed that NLS-RARalpha was located mainly in the nucleus while mutant NLS-RARalpha was located in the cytoplasm. Overexpression of NLS-RARalpha downregulated the expression of CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and three forms of CEBPbeta compared to the overexpression of NC and mutant NLS-RARalpha. It was speculated that the abnormal localization of NLS-RARalpha was mediated via importin-alpha/beta in the pathogenesis of APL. By producing point mutations in the two NLSs in NLS-RARalpha, we showed that the nuclear import of NLS-RARalpha was mainly dependent on the NLS of the RARalpha portion. Subsequently, we found that importin-alpha1 (KPNA2)/importin-beta1 (KPNB1) participates in the nuclear transport of NLS-RARalpha. Taken together, abnormal localization of NLS-RARalpha blocks the differentiation of APL cells, and nuclear localization of NLS-RARalpha depends on NLS of the RARalpha portion and is mediated via binding with importin-alpha/beta.","['Ye, Jiao', 'Zhong, Liang', 'Xiong, Ling', 'Li, Jian', 'Yu, Lihua', 'Dan, Wenran', 'Yuan, Zhen', 'Yao, Juanjuan', 'Zhong, Pengqiang', 'Liu, Junmei', 'Liu, Dongdong', 'Liu, Beizhong']","['Ye J', 'Zhong L', 'Xiong L', 'Li J', 'Yu L', 'Dan W', 'Yuan Z', 'Yao J', 'Zhong P', 'Liu J', 'Liu D', 'Liu B']","['Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Central Laboratory of Yong-Chuan Hospital, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 402160, China; Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics, Ministry of Education, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.

However, the consequences of MYC amplification in MM remain unclear. Here, we describe an unusual case of plasma cell leukemia (PCL) harboring MYC amplification on double minute chromosomes (dmin). A 79-year-old woman was initially diagnosed as having BJP-kappa type MM with bone lesions. After seven months, the disease progressed to secondary PCL: leukocytes 49.1 x 10(9)/L with 77% plasma cells showing lymphoplasmacytic appearance. The bone marrow was infiltrated with 76% plasma cells immunophenotypically positive for CD38 and negative for CD45, CD19, CD20, and CD56. The karyotype by G-banding and spectral karyotyping was 48,XX,der(14)t(11;14)(q13;q32),+der(14)t(14;19)(q32;q13.1),+18,6~95dmin[15]/46,XX [5]. Fluorescence in situ hybridization detected multiple MYC signals on dmin and double IGH/CCND1 fusion signals on der(14)t(11;14) and der(14)t(14;19). Most plasma cells were diffusely and strongly positive for MYC and CCND1 by immunohistochemistry. The patient died of progressive disease after one week. MYC amplification led to high expression of MYC and rapid disease progression, indicating its clinical significance in the pathogenesis of MM/PCL. MYC amplification on dmin may be a very rare genetic event closely associated with the progression to PCL and coexistence of IGH/CCND1 fusions.","['Yamamoto, Katsuya', 'Yakushijin, Kimikazu', 'Ito, Mitsuhiro', 'Goto, Hideaki', 'Higashime, Ako', 'Kajimoto, Kazuyoshi', 'Hayashi, Yoshitake', 'Matsuoka, Hiroshi', 'Minami, Hironobu']","['Yamamoto K', 'Yakushijin K', 'Ito M', 'Goto H', 'Higashime A', 'Kajimoto K', 'Hayashi Y', 'Matsuoka H', 'Minami H']","['Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.

We present here a case of primary PMH occurring in the maxilla. STUDY DESIGN: A 34-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment because of possible recurrence after surgery and chemotherapy of a right maxillary malignant tumor. Morphologic features, immunophenotypes, and FOSB gene rearrangement status of the surgically sectioned sample were assessed by hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. RESULTS: Morphologically, the tumor cells were arranged in a loose fascicular and sheet-like manner, with a large number of reactive woven bones forming. The most striking feature was the presence of epithelioid cells with abundant brightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, which resembled the rhabdomyoblast in appearance. The tumor was diffusely positive for AE1/AE3, CD31, erythroblast transformation-specific transcription factor, and Friend leukemia integration 1; negative for CD34, CAM5.2, epithelial membrane antigen, and desmin; and had retained expression of integrase interactor 1. The tumor harbored FOSB rearrangement. No distant metastasis was found during the follow-up period (18 months). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first report of PMH arising in the maxilla. The distinct morphologic features, immunophenotypes, and FOSB rearrangement could help achieve precise diagnosis and prevent misdiagnosis of mimics with overlapping features.","['Xia, Rong-Hui', 'Zhu, Ling', 'Wang, Li-Zhen', 'Tian, Zhen', 'Zhang, Chun-Ye', 'Hu, Yu-Hua', 'Gu, Ting', 'Li, Jiang']","['Xia RH', 'Zhu L', 'Wang LZ', 'Tian Z', 'Zhang CY', 'Hu YH', 'Gu T', 'Li J']","[""Department of Oral Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology & Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China."", ""Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Department of Radiology, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Oral Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology & Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Oral Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology & Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Oral Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology & Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Oral Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology & Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Oral Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology & Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China."", ""Department of Oral Pathology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology & Shanghai Research Institute of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.

RESULTS: Thirteen patients with R/R T-ALL with a median age of 46 years (range, 20-75 years) were treated with venetoclax plus chemotherapy. Five patients (38%) had early T-cell precursor ALL. The patients had received a median of 2 previous lines of therapy (range, 1-11). Venetoclax at a median dose of 200 mg/d for 21 days, generally with a concomitant azole antifungal, was combined with various agents, including hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone), asparaginase, nelarabine, decitabine, or other intensive chemotherapy. Of the 10 patients evaluable for bone marrow response, 6 (60%) achieved a remission with bone marrow blasts < 5%, including 3 with complete hematologic recovery. The median overall survival and relapse-free survival were 7.7 and 4.0 months, respectively. No early death or clinically significant tumor lysis syndrome were reported. The median interval to neutrophil recovery and platelet recovery were 15 days and 44 days, respectively, with prolonged cytopenias observed with venetoclax 400 mg/d or when given for > 14 days per cycle. CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with venetoclax showed promising clinical efficacy in R/R T-ALL. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical benefit of BCL2 inhibitors in T-ALL.","['Richard-Carpentier, Guillaume', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Rausch, Caitlin R', 'Savoy, Jonathan M', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Rytting, Michael', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Richard-Carpentier G', 'Jabbour E', 'Short NJ', 'Rausch CR', 'Savoy JM', 'Bose P', 'Yilmaz M', 'Jain N', 'Borthakur G', 'Ohanian M', 'Alvarado Y', 'Rytting M', 'Kebriaei P', 'Konopleva M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Cellular Therapy and Stem Cell Transplantation, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Indeed, if these treatments are very effective in the short term, the complex logistics required imply high quality inter-center and intra-center collaboration. Hematology, intensive care unit, apheresis, neurology, cell therapy and biology laboratories, and radiology services must therefore act in a coordinated manner. A specialized monitoring for the mid and long term must also be implemented. Many questions remain concerning the profile of eligible patients, the short and long-term safety, the longer-term efficacy, improving the persistence of CAR-T cells, controlling the risk of tumor escape, the use of allogenic CAR-T cells, or the application of this concept to T-cell ALL.

This study describes the clinical features and treatment responses of 108 patients with T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGLL). METHODS: Clinical data were collected from T-LGLL patients treated at an anemia treatment center within the hematology and blood diseases unit of a single hospital from January 2009 to April 2019. RESULTS: The majority of patients (78 %) were symptomatic at the time of presentation. Splenomegaly was observed in 41 % of cases, while hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy were rare (6 % and 7 %, respectively). Cyclosporine (CsA) monotherapy was used as first-line therapy for 16 patients, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 56 %. CsA in combination with steroids was administered in 83 patients, with an ORR of 48 %. Among patients experiencing relapse or resistance to first-line therapy, 10 received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy, with an ORR of 50 %; an additional 9 patients received a modified regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) therapy, yielding an ORR of 78 %. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new information regarding the clinical features and therapeutic strategies for T-LGLL, which can be used to improve clinical decision making for T-LGLL patients. The data presented here indicate the CsA is an effective option for the treatment of T-LGLL, while modified regimens of high-dose CTX or ATG are safe and effective choices for patients with CsA refractory disease.","['Zhu, Yangmin', 'Gao, Qingyan', 'Hu, Jing', 'Liu, Xu', 'Guan, Dongrui', 'Zhang, Fengkui']","['Zhu Y', 'Gao Q', 'Hu J', 'Liu X', 'Guan D', 'Zhang F']","['Department of Therapeutic Center of Anemia, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Therapeutic Center of Anemia, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Therapeutic Center of Anemia, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Therapeutic Center of Anemia, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Therapeutic Center of Anemia, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Therapeutic Center of Anemia, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science & Peking Union Medical College (CAMS & PUMC), Tianjin, China.

Unfortunately, many tumors become resistant to antineoplastic drugs. One option is to use cocktails of compounds acting on different targets to try to overcome the resistant cells. This type of approach can produce good results, but is often accompanied by a sharp increase of associated side effects. The strategy presented herein focuses on the use of a single compound acting on two different biological targets enhancing potency and lowering the toxicity of the chemotherapy. In this light, the approach presented in the current study involves the dual inhibition of human pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDHK1) and tubulin polymerization using mono-, di- and tri-chloroacetate-loaded benzophenones and benzothiophenones. Synthesized molecules were evaluated in vitro on tubulin polymerization and on pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. The cell cycle distribution after treatment of DA1-3b leukemic cells with active compounds was tested. Twenty-two benzo(thio)phenones have been selected by the National Cancer Institute (USA) for evaluation of their anti-proliferative potential against NCI-60 cancer cell lines including multidrug-resistant tumor cell lines. Seventeen molecules proved to be very effective in combating the growth of tumor cells exhibiting inhibitory activities up to nanomolar range. The molecular docking of best antitumor molecules in the study was realized with GOLD in the tubulin and PDHK1 binding sites, and allowed to understand the positioning of active molecules. Chloroacetate-loaded benzo(thio)phenones are dual targeted tubulin- and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1)-binding antitumor agents and exhibited superior antitumor activity compared to non-chlorinated congeners particularly on leukemia, colon, melanoma and breast cancer cell lines.","['Ghinet, Alina', 'Thuru, Xavier', 'Floquet, Emilie', 'Dubois, Joelle', 'Farce, Amaury', 'Rigo, Benoit']","['Ghinet A', 'Thuru X', 'Floquet E', 'Dubois J', 'Farce A', 'Rigo B']","[""Yncrea Hauts-de-France, Hautes Etudes d'Ingenieur (HEI), UCLille, Health & Environment Department, Team Sustainable Chemistry, Laboratoire de Chimie Durable et Sante, 13 rue de Toul, F-59046 Lille, France; Univ.

Blinatumomab, a bispecific CD3/CD19 antibody, has shown remarkable activity in relapsed/refractory (r/r) ALL. Although allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the recommended consolidation therapy for patients with r/r ALL who respond to salvage therapy, HCT and toxicity outcomes for those who received blinatumomab salvage and HCT remain largely unknown. We treated 89 patients with r/r ALL with blinatumomab, of whom 43 patients (48%) achieved remission. Here we describe our single-center experience in the subset of patients who responded to blinatumomab salvage therapy for eradication of either gross (n=24) or minimal residual disease (n=11) before HCT. Overall survival at 1 and 2 years after allogeneic HCT was 77% and 52%, respectively. Leukemia-free survival at 1 and 2 years were 65% and 40%, respectively. Additionally, with blinatumomab administration pre-HCT, no unusual toxicities such as delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment or graft failure were observed. Acute grades II to IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at day +100 post-HCT was at 43% and 2-year chronic GVHD was 36%, both comparable with historic control subjects. Finally, results of our subset analysis based on pre-HCT minimal residual disease (MRD) status indicated no significant difference in survival outcomes among patients undergoing transplant in MRD-negative status and the entire cohort. In conclusion, based on results of this study, blinatumomab may be considered as a safe and effective agent for r/r ALL patients before HCT.","['Salhotra, Amandeep', 'Yang, Dongyun', 'Mokhtari, Sally', 'Malki, Monzr M Al', 'Ali, Haris', 'Sandhu, Karamjeet S', 'Aribi, Ahmed', 'Khaled, Samer', 'Mei, Matthew', 'Budde, Elizabeth', 'Snyder, David', 'Cao, Thai', 'Spielberger, Ricardo', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Pullarkat, Vinod', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Stein, Anthony', 'Aldoss, Ibrahim']","['Salhotra A', 'Yang D', 'Mokhtari S', 'Malki MMA', 'Ali H', 'Sandhu KS', 'Aribi A', 'Khaled S', 'Mei M', 'Budde E', 'Snyder D', 'Cao T', 'Spielberger R', 'Marcucci G', 'Pullarkat V', 'Forman SJ', 'Nakamura R', 'Stein A', 'Aldoss I']","['Department of Hematology and HCT, City of Hope, Duarte, California.

Blocking antibodies against inhibitory receptors, also known as ""immune checkpoints"", have revolutionized anti-cancer treatment. Inhibitory receptors are expressed not only on normal immune cells, including mast cells but also on neoplastic cells. Whether activation of inhibitory receptors through monoclonal antibodies can lead to tumor growth inhibition remains mostly unknown. Here we show that the inhibitory receptor Siglec-7 is expressed by primary neoplastic mast cells in patients with systemic mastocytosis and by mast cell leukemia cell lines. Activation of Siglec-7 by anti-Siglec-7 monoclonal antibody caused phosphorylation of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), reduced phosphorylation of KIT and induced growth inhibition in mast cell lines. In SCID-beige mice injected with either the human mast cell line HMC-1.1 and HMC-1.2 or with Siglec-7 transduced B cell lymphoma cells, anti-Siglec-7 monoclonal antibody reduced tumor growth by a mechanism involving Siglec-7 cytoplasmic domains in ""preventive"" and ""treatment"" settings. These data demonstrate that activation of Siglec-7 on mast cell lines can inhibit their growth in vitro and in vivo. This might pave the way to additional treatment strategies for mastocytosis.","['Landolina, Nadine', 'Zaffran, Ilan', 'Smiljkovic, Dubravka', 'Serrano-Candelas, Eva', 'Schmiedel, Dominik', 'Friedman, Sheli', 'Arock, Michel', 'Hartmann, Karin', 'Pikarsky, Eli', 'Mandelboim, Ofer', 'Martin, Margarita', 'Valent, Peter', 'Levi-Schaffer, Francesca']","['Landolina N', 'Zaffran I', 'Smiljkovic D', 'Serrano-Candelas E', 'Schmiedel D', 'Friedman S', 'Arock M', 'Hartmann K', 'Pikarsky E', 'Mandelboim O', 'Martin M', 'Valent P', 'Levi-Schaffer F']","['Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics Unit, Institute for Drug Research, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics Unit, Institute for Drug Research, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Biochemistry Unit, Biomedicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Respiratory Immunoallergy, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics Unit, Institute for Drug Research, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Biological Haematology Department, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Dermatology, University of Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, IMRIC, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Biochemistry Unit, Biomedicine Department, Faculty of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Laboratory of Clinical and Experimental Respiratory Immunoallergy, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.', 'Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics Unit, Institute for Drug Research, School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.

EBL causes great economic losses, so a fast and reliable diagnostic method is critical for understanding the status of BLV. This will allow us to control BLV infections efficiently and mitigate economic losses. In this study, we established a direct diagnostic test for BLV using dried blood-spotted filter papers without sample pre-treatment. The study was based on 159 clinical blood specimens collected in EDTA from one farm in Kyushu, Japan. The blood-spotted filter papers were used as the template for direct filter PCR. When an ELISA was used as the diagnostic gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the direct filter PCR were 90.1% and 97.5%, respectively. The kappa value for the direct filter PCR and real-time PCR methods was 0.97. The dried blood samples spotted onto filter papers were stable for at least 10 days at room temperature, even when the samples were from cattle with a low BLV proviral load. Direct filter PCR is a rapid, easy, reliable and cost-effective diagnostic test that directly detects the BLV proviral genome in clinical blood specimens without DNA extraction. Moreover, it simplifies the collection, transportation and storage procedures for clinical blood specimens.","['El Daous, Hala', 'Mitoma, Shuya', 'Elhanafy, Eslam', 'Thi Nguyen, Huyen', 'Thi Mai, Ngan', 'Hara, Akihiro', 'Duangtathip, Karn', 'Takezaki, Yuka', 'Kaneko, Chiho', 'Norimine, Junzo', 'Sekiguchi, Satoshi']","['El Daous H', 'Mitoma S', 'Elhanafy E', 'Thi Nguyen H', 'Thi Mai N', 'Hara A', 'Duangtathip K', 'Takezaki Y', 'Kaneko C', 'Norimine J', 'Sekiguchi S']","['Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Benha University, Toukh, Egypt.', 'Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Benha University, Toukh, Egypt.', 'Graduate School of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'National Institute of Veterinary Research, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Vietnam National University of Agriculture, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Veterinary Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Kasetsart University Veterinary Teaching Hospital Hua-Hin, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Thailand.', 'Graduate School of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Science, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Center for Animal Disease Control, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200217,Germany,Transbound Emerg Dis,Transboundary and emerging diseases,101319538,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Diagnostic Tests, Routine', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Japan', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*veterinary', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Load']",2020/02/09 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tbed.13506 [doi]'],ppublish,Transbound Emerg Dis. 2020 Jul;67(4):1671-1676. doi: 10.1111/tbed.13506.

METHODS: For 149 patients with MDS, genomic DNA was amplified by PCR and subject to direct sequencing to identify variants of ASXL1, U2AF1, SF3B1, DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, NPM1, FLT3-ITD and C-KIT genes. RESULTS: ASXL1 variants were found among 37 patients (24.8%). Other commonly mutated genes included U2AF1 (22.8%), TET2 (11.4%), DNMT3A (9.4%), NPM1 (8.1%) and SF3B1 (6.0%). The frequency of concurrent U2AF1 and TET2 variants among patients with ASXL1 variants was slightly higher than that of wild-type patients. No significant difference was found in median age, MDS subtype, karyotype, peripheral leukocytes, hemoglobin, platelet levels, and bone marrow blast counts between the ASXL1-variant and the wild-type groups (P> 0.05). Twenty-nine patients harboring ASXL1 variants were followed up, 37.9% progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The rate of transformation in ASXL1-variant group was significantly higher than the wild-type group (37.9% vs. 14.1%, P< 0.01). CONCLUSION: ASXL1 showed a high frequency of variant among MDS patients, which was frequently accompanied with U2AF1 and TET2 variants. Compared with the wild type group, patients with ASXL1 variants were more likely to progress to AML.","['Chen, Meiyu', 'Liu, Jie', 'Chao, Hongying', 'Qin, Wei', 'Jiang, Naike', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Cen, Ling', 'Jiang, Yu', 'Cai, Xiaohui', 'Zhang, Ri', 'Wang, Qian']","['Chen M', 'Liu J', 'Chao H', 'Qin W', 'Jiang N', 'Lu X', 'Cen L', 'Jiang Y', 'Cai X', 'Zhang R', 'Wang Q']","[""Department of Hematology, Changzhou Second People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, Jiangsu 213000, China. chaohy2006@126.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics']",2020/02/09 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2020/02/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['940637023 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2020.02.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Feb 10;37(2):110-115. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2020.02.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Available treatment options in this aggressive disease are largely inefficient and patient outcomes are highly dissatisfactory. Current therapeutic strategies mainly employ the CD52-antibody alemtuzumab as the most active single agent. However, sustained remissions after sole alemtuzumab-based induction are exceptions. Responses after available second-line strategies are even less durable. More profound disease control or rare curative outcomes can currently only be expected after a consolidating allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in best first response. However, only 30-50% of patients are eligible for this procedure. Major advances in the molecular characterization of T-PLL during recent years have stimulated translational studies on potential vulnerabilities of the T-PLL cell. We summarize here the current state of ""classical"" treatments and critically appraise novel (pre)clinical strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Alemtuzumab-induced first remissions, accomplished in approximately 90% of patients, last at median approximately 12 months. Series on allo-HSCT in T-PLL, although of very heterogeneous character, suggest a slight improvement in outcomes among transplanted patients within the past decade. Dual-action nucleosides such as bendamustine or cladribine show moderate clinical activity as single agents in the setting of relapsed or refractory disease. Induction of apoptosis via reactivation of p53 (e.g., by inhibitors of HDAC or MDM2) and targeting of its downstream pathways (i.e., BCL2 family antagonists, CDK inhibitors) are promising new approaches. Novel strategies also focus on inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway with the first clinical data. Implementations of immune-checkpoint blockades or CAR-T cell therapy are at the stage of pre-clinical assessments of activity and feasibility. The recommended treatment strategy in T-PLL remains a successful induction by infusional alemtuzumab followed by a consolidating allo-HSCT in eligible patients. Nevertheless, long-term survivors after this ""standard"" comprise only 10-20%. The increasingly revealed molecular make-up of T-PLL and the tremendous expansion of approved targeted compounds in oncology represent a ""never-before"" opportunity to successfully tackle the voids in T-PLL. Approaches, e.g., those reinstating deficient cell death execution, show encouraging pre-clinical and first-in-human results in T-PLL, and urgently have to be transferred to systematic clinical testing.","['Braun, Till', 'von Jan, Jana', 'Wahnschaffe, Linus', 'Herling, Marco']","['Braun T', 'von Jan J', 'Wahnschaffe L', 'Herling M']","['Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, University of Cologne (UoC), 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, University of Cologne (UoC), 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, University of Cologne (UoC), 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center for Integrated Oncology (CIO), Aachen-Bonn-Cologne-Duesseldorf, University of Cologne (UoC), 50937, Cologne, Germany. marco.herling@uk-koeln.de.', 'Excellence Cluster for Cellular Stress Response and Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany. marco.herling@uk-koeln.de.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), UoC, 50937, Cologne, Germany. marco.herling@uk-koeln.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Forecasting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality/*trends', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/trends', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/adverse effects/mortality/*trends', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/09 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/02/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00566-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00566-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Apr;15(2):113-124. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00566-5.,,,,PMC7230055,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Alemtuzumab', '*BCL2 antagonists', '*HDAC', '*JAK/STAT inhibition', '*T cell lymphoma', '*T-PLL', '*p53 reactivation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, this review provides an approach to the patient with relapsed/refractory disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Over the last decade, the routine use of HCT as consolidative therapy and the development of FLT3 TKIs have significantly improved remission rates and overall survival. The value and challenges of MRD assessment in FLT3 disease are discussed and current mechanisms of relapse are explored, as are the ongoing questions in the field that current clinical trials are seeking to answer. FLT3-ITD mutations are common in acute myeloid leukemia and historically have been associated with a poor prognosis, but with the incorporation of FLT3 TKIs and routine use of allogeneic stem cell transplant as consolidative therapy, outcomes have improved dramatically. Ongoing research seeks to answer how and when to best use current therapies, and how to overcome resistance to FLT3 inhibition.","['Hunter, Bradley D', 'Chen, Yi-Bin']","['Hunter BD', 'Chen YB']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Intermountain Healthcare, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, 0 Emerson Place, Suite 118, Boston, MA, 02114, USA. ychen6@partners.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', '*Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism']",2020/02/09 06:00,2020/12/22 06:00,['2020/02/09 06:00'],"['2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-020-00558-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-020-00558-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2020 Feb;15(1):1-8. doi: 10.1007/s11899-020-00558-5.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3-ITD', '*TKI']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the discovery of the vitamins at the turn of the twentieth century, fat-soluble vitamin A was soon shown to be the essential factor. In the first half of the twentieth century, the role vitamin A plays in vision, as precursor to the light-sensitive visual pigment molecules in the photoreceptors was elegantly worked out, especially by George Wald and his colleagues. Beginning in the 1960s, with the recognition of the active metabolite of vitamin A, its acid form now called retinoic acid, the roles of vitamin A in maintaining overall health of an organism began to be explored, and this research continues to this day. Receptors activated by retinoic acid, the RARs and RXRs have been shown to regulate gene transcription in a surprisingly wide variety of biological processes from early growth and development to the maintenance of epithelial tissues in many organs, the regulation of the immune system, and even the modulation of synaptic function in the brain involved in mechanisms underlying memory and learning. Therapeutic uses for retinoic acid have been developed, including one for a specific form of leukemia. The story is by no means complete and it is likely more surprises await with regard to this remarkable molecule.","['Dowling, John E']",['Dowling JE'],"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Harvard University, 52 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA. dowling@mcb.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200207,Germany,J Comp Physiol A Neuroethol Sens Neural Behav Physiol,"Journal of comparative physiology.

We report 13 patients, 7 men and 6 women, with a median age of 65 years. Eleven patients presented with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, and two patients had therapy-related AML. Cytopenias were detected in all patients (11 pancytopenia and two bi-lineage cytopenia). Myelodysplastic changes were observed in all 11 patients with adequate cells to evaluate. Myelofibrosis was present in ten patients. All patients had a complex karyotype, including abnormalities of chromosomes 5, 7, 17, and hsr(21)(q22), and ten patients showed TP53 deletion and/or mutation. Eleven patients received AML-based chemotherapy, one of whom also received hematopoietic stem cell transplant. By the end of the last follow-up, eight patients died with median survival of 3.2 months, four patients were alive with persistent AML, and one was in complete remission. The median overall survival was 6 months for all patients. We conclude that AML with iAMP21 is often associated with cytopenias, myelodysplasia, a complex karyotype, TP53 mutation/deletion, and a poor prognosis despite current therapies.","['Xie, Wei', 'Xu, Jie', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Wang, Wei', 'Cameron Yin, C', 'Toruner, Gokce', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Tang, Guilin']","['Xie W', 'Xu J', 'Hu S', 'Li S', 'Wang W', 'Cameron Yin C', 'Toruner G', 'Tang Z', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Tang G']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. gtang@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200207,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2020/02/09 06:00,2021/07/09 06:00,['2020/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41379-020-0494-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41379-020-0494-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2020 Jul;33(7):1389-1397. doi: 10.1038/s41379-020-0494-3.

Integrated network analysis of cytosine methylation and expression datasets has the potential to provide deeper insights into the complex disease states and their causes than individual disconnected analyses. With the purpose of identifying reliable cancer-associated methylation signal in gene regions from leukemia patients, we present an integrative network analysis of differentially methylated (DMGs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The application of a novel signal detection-machine learning approach to methylation analysis of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data permitted a high level of methylation signal resolution in cancer-associated genes and pathways. This integrative network analysis approach revealed that gene expression and methylation consistently targeted the same gene pathways relevant to cancer: Pathways in cancer, Ras signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and Rap1 signaling pathway, among others. Detected gene hubs and hub sub-networks were integrated by signature loci associated with cancer that include, for example, NOTCH1, RAC1, PIK3CD, BCL2, and EGFR. Statistical analysis disclosed a stochastic deterministic relationship between methylation and gene expression within the set of genes simultaneously identified as DEGs and DMGs, where larger values of gene expression changes were probabilistically associated with larger values of methylation changes. Concordance analysis of the overlap between enriched pathways in DEG and DMG datasets revealed statistically significant agreement between gene expression and methylation changes. These results support the potential identification of reliable and stable methylation biomarkers at genes for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.","['Sanchez, Robersy', 'Mackenzie, Sally A']","['Sanchez R', 'Mackenzie SA']","['Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. rus547@psu.edu.', 'Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. sam795@psu.edu.', 'Department of Plant Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. sam795@psu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200207,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Interaction Maps/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2020/02/09 06:00,2020/11/13 06:00,['2020/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-58123-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-58123-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 7;10(1):2123. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-58123-2.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5246-1453'],['R01 GM134056/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,PMC7005804,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, at higher concentrations, TMQ0153 induced necroptotic cell death with accumulation of ROS, both preventable by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) pretreatment. At necroptosis-inducing concentrations, we observed increased ROS and decreased ATP and GSH levels, concomitant with protective autophagy induction. Inhibitors such as bafilomycin A1 (baf-A1) and siRNA against beclin 1 abrogated autophagy, sensitized CML cells against TMQ0153 and enhanced necroptotic cell death. Importantly, TMQ153-induced necrosis led to cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT) and ERp57 as well as the release of extracellular ATP and high mobility group box (HMGB1) demonstrating the capacity of this compound to release immunogenic cell death (ICD) markers. We validated the anti-cancer potential of TMQ0153 by in vivo inhibition of K562 microtumor formation in zebrafish. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that cellular stress and redox modulation by TMQ0153 concentration-dependently leads to different cell death modalities including controlled necrosis in CML cell models.","['Song, Sungmi', 'Lee, Jin-Young', 'Ermolenko, Ludmila', 'Mazumder, Aloran', 'Ji, Seungwon', 'Ryu, Heeju', 'Kim, HyeJin', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jung Weon', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Christov, Christo', 'Schnekenburger, Michael', 'Cerella, Claudia', 'Gerard, Deborah', 'Orlikova-Boyer, Barbora', 'Al-Mourabit, Ali', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Song S', 'Lee JY', 'Ermolenko L', 'Mazumder A', 'Ji S', 'Ryu H', 'Kim H', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Dicato M', 'Christov C', 'Schnekenburger M', 'Cerella C', 'Gerard D', 'Orlikova-Boyer B', 'Al-Mourabit A', 'Diederich M']","['College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'Departement SNCM (Substances Naturelles et Chimie Medicinale), ICSN-CNRS, LabEx LERMIT, Centre de Recherche de Gif-sur-Yvette, Avenue de la Terrasse (Bat. 27), 91190, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', ""Catholic University, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Banpo dong 505, Seocho Gu, Seoul, Korea."", 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', ""Service d'Histologie, Faculte de Medicine, Universite de Lorraine, and INSERM U1256 NGERE, 54000, Nancy, France."", 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9, rue Edward Steichen, L-2540, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.', 'Departement SNCM (Substances Naturelles et Chimie Medicinale), ICSN-CNRS, LabEx LERMIT, Centre de Recherche de Gif-sur-Yvette, Avenue de la Terrasse (Bat. 27), 91190, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. ali.almourabit@cnrs.fr.', 'College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul, 08626, Korea. marcdiederich@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200207,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Necroptosis/*drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Zebrafish']",2020/02/09 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/02/09 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2304-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2304-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Feb 7;11(2):109. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2304-8.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2722-8200', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0550-9538', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9308-8176']",,,PMC7007439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the differential effect of bcr-1 and bcr-3 isoforms of the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) transcript together with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation status on the outcome of newly diagnosed de novo APL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This cohort study included all patients diagnosed with APL at outpatient medical and pediatric oncology clinics of the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, from May 2012 to January 2018. RESULTS: The study included 118 patients with APL, 71 adults (60.2%) and 47 children (39.8%). Median (range) age was 25 (1.5-70) years. Children had significantly higher total leukocyte count (>/=10 x 10(9)/L), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and thrombocytopenia (< 40 x 10(9)/L) than adults (P = .04, .03, and .04, respectively), while the latter group had significantly higher hemorrhage than children (P = .04). FLT3-ITD mutation was detected in the whole group, children, and adults in 23.7%, 30.6%, and 24.6%, respectively. FLT3-ITD mutation was significantly associated with leukocytosis in the whole group (P = .039). bcr-3 was significantly associated with FLT3-ITD mutation in the whole APL cohort and in adults (P = .011, P = .022). All children (both bcr-1 and bcr-3) and all adult patients with bcr-3 experienced CR, while 22 (78.5%) of 28 patients with bcr-1 experienced CR (P = .04). APL patients with DIC and hemorrhage had significantly lower overall survival (P = .002 and < .001, respectively). Overall survival for APL in children was significantly better than in adults (P = .005). Multivariate analysis indicated that age was an independent prognostic variable affecting survival (hazard ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.3; P = .007) (adults had hazard ratio of death 2.6 times higher than children). DIC and FLT3-ITD were independent prognostic variables affecting survival in children with APL (hazard ratio = 12.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-104.61; P = .021; and hazard ratio = 5.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-26.95; P = .048, respectively). CONCLUSION: Age is an independent prognostic factor for APL. bcr-3 is significantly associated with FLT3-ITD in adults with APL. DIC and FLT3-ITD are adverse prognostic factors in children with APL. Despite children being at higher risk, outcome is better than in adults.","['Rasekh, Eman O', 'Elsayed, Ghada M', 'Madney, Youssef', 'El Gammal, Mosaad M']","['Rasekh EO', 'Elsayed GM', 'Madney Y', 'El Gammal MM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Medical Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.

Understanding current prognostic testing and treatment practices in this new era is critical. Beginning enrollment in 2015, informCLL is the first United States-based real-world, prospective, observational registry that initiated enrollment after approval of novel agents. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were age >/= 18 years, started CLL treatment within 30 days of enrollment, and provided consent. For this planned interim analysis, treatments were classified into 5 groups: ibrutinib, chemoimmunotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and other novel agents. RESULTS: Frequency of prognostic testing and treatment patterns are reported among 840 patients (459 previously untreated; 381 relapsed/refractory), enrolled largely (96%) from community practice settings. Testing for chromosomal abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization, TP53 mutation, or IGHV mutation status occurred infrequently among all patients (31%, 11%, and 11%, respectively). Chemoimmunotherapy was the most common treatment in previously untreated patients (42%), whereas ibrutinib was the most common treatment among relapsed/refractory patients (51%). Of patients who tested positive for del(17p) or TP53 mutation, 34% and 26% received chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. Among patients who did not have fluorescence in situ hybridization or TP53 mutation testing prior to enrollment, 33% and 32% received chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that prognostic testing rates were poor, and approximately one-third of high-risk patients (del[17p] and TP53) received chemoimmunotherapy, which is not aligned with current CLL treatment recommendations. This represents an opportunity to educate and alert health care professionals about the necessity of prognostic testing to guide optimal CLL treatment decisions.","['Mato, Anthony R', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline C', 'Ghosh, Nilanjan', 'Pagel, John M', 'Brander, Danielle M', 'Gutierrez, Meghan', 'Kadish, Karen', 'Tomlinson, Brian', 'Iyengar, Reethi', 'Ipe, David', 'Upasani, Sandhya', 'Amaya-Chanaga, Carlos I', 'Sundaram, Murali', 'Han, Jennifer', 'Giafis, Nick', 'Sharman, Jeff P']","['Mato AR', 'Barrientos JC', 'Ghosh N', 'Pagel JM', 'Brander DM', 'Gutierrez M', 'Kadish K', 'Tomlinson B', 'Iyengar R', 'Ipe D', 'Upasani S', 'Amaya-Chanaga CI', 'Sundaram M', 'Han J', 'Giafis N', 'Sharman JP']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.

However, the outcome still remains modest as compared to global standards due to significant barriers in recognition, diagnosis and cure. Data regarding comprehensive childhood cancer burden in country is lacking due to low and urban predominant coverage of population-based cancer registry programs. The available data shows lower incidence of childhood cancer incidence especially in leukaemia and CNS tumours which may suggest poor awareness of caregivers and delayed diagnosis with many ""missed cases"". Incidence data are also skewed towards male preponderance which suggests gender bias in seeking healthcare. The childhood cancer services in India are predominantly restricted to few tertiary care centres in major cities. The outcome in major groups of cancer is complicated by delayed and more advanced stage of presentation and poor supportive care during intensive treatment. Treatment refusal and abandonment remains major hurdles. Last few decades saw development of dedicated paediatric oncology services and training programs in the country. The development of InPOG (Indian Paediatric Oncology group) for conducting collaborative trials will lead to adoption of uniform treatment protocols suited for the country. Financial support through the government promoted health insurance and holistic support through philanthropic organizations have improved treatment adherence and outcome. Moving forward, the focus should be on strengthening the cancer registries for capturing nationwide data, improving awareness of childhood cancer among caregivers and healthcare workers for early recognition and improving accessibility of childhood cancer care services beyond major cities.","['Ganguly, Shuvadeep', 'Kinsey, Sally', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Ganguly S', 'Kinsey S', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, IRCH, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, University of Leeds, Honorary Consultant Paediatric Haematologist, Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, Leeds, UK.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, IRCH, AIIMS, New Delhi, India.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the incidence of various CL types in Japan using epidemiological data from a nationwide registration system for CL. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to participating hospitals, all of which had been approved to conduct residency programs for board-certified dermatologists by the Japanese Dermatological Association. Data from patients newly diagnosed with CL were collected electronically. RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2017, 2547 new patients with CL from the dermatological institutes were registered. In total, 2090 patients had primary CL and 453 had secondary CL. Those with primary CL included 1609 (77.0 %) patients with mature T- and natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasms, 442 (21.1 %) with B-cell neoplasms, and 39 (1.9 %) with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasms. Mycosis fungoides (MF) was the most common CL subtype in the present study (1003 patients, 48.0 %), and 72.4 % of MF patients had early-stage disease, similar to observations in previous studies on other cohorts. Primary cutaneous CD30+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma were the second and third most common subtypes, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared to that in our previous cohort (2007-2011), the number of registered T- and NK-cell CL cases decreased, whereas that of B-cell CL cases increased from 44.8-73.7 patients/year. These results provide insight into CL trends within the Japanese population, which might contribute to a better understanding of the disease.","['Fujii, Kazuyasu', 'Hamada, Toshihisa', 'Shimauchi, Takatoshi', 'Asai, Jun', 'Fujisawa, Yasuhiro', 'Ihn, Hironobu', 'Katoh, Norito']","['Fujii K', 'Hamada T', 'Shimauchi T', 'Asai J', 'Fujisawa Y', 'Ihn H', 'Katoh N']","['Department of Dermatology, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.

Bone marrow samples from 64 AML patients (9 with GS and 55 without GS) together with AML cell lines PL21, THP1, HL60, Kasumi-1, and KG-1 were used to elucidate the pathology of AML with GS. RNA-Seq analyses were performed on samples from seven AML patients with or without GS. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed significantly upregulated candidates on the cell surface of the GS group. Expression of the adhesion integrin alpha7 (ITGA7) was significantly higher in the GS group, as seen by RT-qPCR (p = 0.00188) and immunohistochemistry of bone marrow formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Flow cytometry revealed enhanced proliferation of PL21 and THP1 cells containing surface ITGA7 in the presence of laminin 211 and stimulated ERK phosphorylation; this effect was abrogated following ITGA7 knockdown or ERK inhibition. Overall, high ITGA7 expression was associated with poor patient survival (p = 0.0477). In summary, ITGA7 is highly expressed in AML with GS, and its ligand (laminin 211) stimulates cell proliferation through ERK signaling.

Using the t (15, 17) negative HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia model, we find that the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, roscovitine, augments signaling by an ATRA-induced macromolecular signalsome that propels differentiation and enhances ATRA-induced differentiation. Roscovitine co-treatment enhanced ATRA-induced expression of pS259- pS289/296/301- pS621-c-Raf, pS217/221-Mek, Src Family Kinases (SFKs) Lyn and Fgr and SFK Y416 phosphorylation, adaptor proteins c-Cbl and SLP-76, Vav, and acetylated 14-3-3 in the signalsome. Roscovitine enhanced ATRA-induced c-Raf interaction with Lyn, Vav, and c-Cbl. Consistent with signalsome hyper-activation, roscovitine co-treatment enhanced ATRA-induced G1/0 arrest and expression of differentiation markers, CD11b, ROS and p47 Phox. Because roscovitine regulated Lyn expression, activation and partnering, a stably transfected Lyn knockdown was generated from wt-parental cells to investigate its function in ATRA-induced differentiation. Lyn-knockdown enhanced ATRA-induced up-regulation of key signalsome molecules, c-Raf, pS259-c-Raf, pS289/296/301-c-Raf, Vav1, SLP-76, and Fgr, but with essentially total loss of pY416-SFK. Compared to ATRA-treated wt-parental cells, differentiation markers p47 phox, CD11b, G1/G0 arrest and ROS production were enhanced in ATRA-treated Lyn-knockdown stable transfectants, and addition of roscovitine further enhanced these ATRA-inducible markers. The Lyn-knockdown cells expressed slightly higher c-Raf, pS259-c-Raf, pS289/296/301-c-Raf, and SLP-76 than wt-parental cells, and this was associated with enhanced ATRA-induced upregulation of Fgr and cell differentiation, consistent with heightened signaling, suggesting that enhanced Fgr may have compensated for loss of Lyn to enhance differentiation in the Lyn-knockdown cells.","['Rashid, Asif', 'Duan, Xin', 'Gao, Feng', 'Yang, Mengsu', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Rashid A', 'Duan X', 'Gao F', 'Yang M', 'Yen A']","[""Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, People's Republic of China; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA."", ""The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biomedical Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, People's Republic of China.

At present, overwhelming evidence indicates that different genetic abnormalities are relevant to the pathogenesis of AML. Nevertheless, its exact molecular mechanism is still unknown. Recently, it was reported that lncRNAs play crucial roles in tumorigenesis. But, their role in the molecular pathogenesis of AML has not been extensively explored. GAS5, one of the earliest known lncRNAs, has an essential role in the formation and progression of multiple human cancers. It was recently demonstrated that GAS5 acts as a riborepressor of the Glucocorticoid receptor) GR) and abnormal levels of GAS5 may alter response of hematopoietic cells to glucocorticoids. GAS5 can have interaction with the GR that encoded by NR3C1 gene and inhibit its transcriptional activity. To test whether the genetic variants can be associated with AML risk, we genotyped rs55829688 (T > C) polymorphism in GAS5 and three NR3C1 SNPs namely rs6195, rs41423247 and rs6189/rs6190 in a population of 100 Iranian AML patients and 100 healthy subjects. The analysis of the data showed the frequency of alleles and genotypes of rs55829688 and rs6189/rs6190 polymorphisms did not differ between patients and healthy subjects. But, rs41423247 and rs6195 demonstrated a significant correlation with AML risk. The rs6195 was associated with higher AML susceptibility in the co-dominant (OR = 4.58, 95% CI = 2.11-9.981, P < .0001), dominant (OR = 4.55, 95% CI = 2.155-9.613, P < .0001), and over-dominant (OR = 4.43, 95% CI = 2.042-9.621, P < .0001) models. Also, the rs41423247 polymorphism was associated with higher risk of AML in co-dominant (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.171-4.242, P = .012) and dominant (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.192-5.142, P = .010) models. Furthermore, haplotype analysis (rs41423247, rs6189.rs6190, rs6195, and rs55829688 respectively) demonstrated that GGAT, CGGT, and GGGT haplotypes were associated with higher risk of AML in the studied population (p-values = .007, 0.042 and 0.044, respectively).

Here, we show that culturing ESCs in Activin A and BMP4, and in the absence of MEK1/2 inhibitor (ABC/L medium), establishes advanced stem cells derived from ESCs (esASCs). We demonstrate that esASCs contributed to germline lineages, full-term chimeras and generated esASC-derived mice by tetraploid complementation. We show that, in contrast to 2i/L-ESCs, esASCs display distinct molecular signatures and a stable hypermethylated epigenome, which is reversible and similar to serum-cultured ESCs. Importantly, we also derived novel ASCs (blASCs) from blastocysts in ABC/L medium.

Arsenic trioxide is a drug used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In the present study, we screened the synthetic histone H3 and H4 library in the presence of arsenite to understand the role of histone residues in arsenic toxicity. We identified residues of histone H3 and H4 crucial for arsenite stress response. The residues H3T3, H3G90, H4K5, H4G13, and H4R95 are required for the activation of Hog1 kinase in response to arsenite exposure. We showed that a reduced level of Hog1 activation increases the intracellular arsenic content in these histone mutants through the Fps1 channel. We have also noticed the reduced expression of ACR3 exporter in the mutants. The growth defect of mutants caused by arsenite exposure was suppressed in hyperosmotic conditions, in a higher concentration of glucose, and upon deletion of the FPS1 gene. The arsenite sensitive histone mutants also showed a lack of H3K4 methylation and reduced H4K16 acetylation. Altogether, we have identified the key residues in histone H3 and H4 proteins important for the regulation of Hog1 signaling, Fps1 activity, and ACR3 expression during arsenite stress.","['Thakre, Pilendra Kumar', 'Golla, Upendarrao', 'Biswas, Ashis', 'Tomar, Raghuvir Singh']","['Thakre PK', 'Golla U', 'Biswas A', 'Tomar RS']","['Laboratory of Chromatin Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal, Bhopal 462066, India.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Penn State College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, United States.', 'Environmental Geochemistry Laboratory, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal, Bhopal 462066, India.', 'Laboratory of Chromatin Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal, Bhopal 462066, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200207,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Arsenites/*toxicity', 'Histones/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Stress, Physiological/*drug effects']",2020/02/08 06:00,2021/07/03 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00471 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2020 Mar 16;33(3):817-833. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00471.

We aimed to determine the incidence of anxiolytics, hypnotics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics initiation around a diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Population-based cohort: Data were extracted from Systeme National des donnees de Sante (SNDS, the French health insurance database) at the regional level (Midi-Pyrenees area, 2.9 million inhabitants). All newly diagnosed patients treated by a CML tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) between 10/01/2011 and 04/01/2014 were included. Pre-CML (9 months before to 3 months before first TKI prescription-F-TKI) and CML (3 months before to 9 months after F-TKI) phases were defined. The main evaluation criterion was the initiation of PD during CML phase. Determinants associated with this incident PD use were studied through a logistic regression model. We compared pre-CML and CML healthcare consumption. The cohort included 103 patients (mean age of 60.8 years). PD initiation rate was 35.9%, anxiolytics being the most initiated PD (59.5%). Advanced age was associated with PD initiation (adjusted OR = 1.029, 95% CI = 1.001-1.056). The number of consultations during the pre-CML phase and female gender tended to be associated with increased risk of PD initiation in univariate analysis. For PD initiators, healthcare consumption was greater in CML but not in pre-CML phase. PD initiation is a frequent finding around a CML diagnosis. Its risk increases with age. It could be a way to identify a subgroup with higher healthcare consumption.","['Gauthier, Martin', 'Conte, Cecile', 'Palmaro, Aurore', 'Patras De Campaigno, Emilie', 'De Barros, Sandra', 'Huguet, Francoise', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Lapeyre-Mestre, Maryse', 'Despas, Fabien']","['Gauthier M', 'Conte C', 'Palmaro A', 'Patras De Campaigno E', 'De Barros S', 'Huguet F', 'Laurent G', 'Lapeyre-Mestre M', 'Despas F']","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole, 1 Avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex, France."", 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'UMR1027, Inserm, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'UMR1027, Inserm, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', ""INSERM CIC 1436 Toulouse, Centre d'Investigation Clinique de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, France."", 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'UMR1027, Inserm, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole, 1 Avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole, 1 Avenue Irene Joliot-Curie, 31059, Toulouse Cedex, France."", 'UMR1027, Inserm, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'UMR1027, Inserm, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', ""INSERM CIC 1436 Toulouse, Centre d'Investigation Clinique de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, France."", 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, CHU de Toulouse, 37 allees Jules Guesde, 31000, Toulouse, France.', 'UMR1027, Inserm, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pharmacologie Medicale et Clinique, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', ""INSERM CIC 1436 Toulouse, Centre d'Investigation Clinique de Toulouse, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200303,England,Fundam Clin Pharmacol,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,8710411,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Psychotropic Drugs)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Population Surveillance', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'/*statistics & numerical data"", 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Psychotropic Drugs/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",2020/02/08 06:00,2021/06/09 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/fcp.12544 [doi]'],ppublish,Fundam Clin Pharmacol. 2020 Oct;34(5):612-622. doi: 10.1111/fcp.12544.

This review provides biological and clinical rationale for current venetoclax based treatments in AML, addresses common adverse events encountered with venetoclax based therapy, and explores emerging clinical data regarding combinations of novel targeted therapeutics used in conjunction with venetoclax for the treatment of AML.","['Lachowiez, Curtis', 'DiNardo, Courtney D', 'Konopleva, Marina']","['Lachowiez C', 'DiNardo CD', 'Konopleva M']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, M.

Approximately, 2-10% of patients with CLL develop RT, most often as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. To assess the incidence of RT, we examined risk factors for RT and death among patients with RT in a nationwide CLL cohort (from 2008 to 2016). Among 3772 patients, 113 had biopsy-proven RT. With a median follow-up of 4.3 years, the 5-year cumulative incidence of RT was 2.8%. Advanced Binet stage (B/C) (p<.001), unmutated IGHV (p<.001), and del(17p) (p<.001) were independently associated with risk of developing RT. Half of the patients with RT (49%) were treatment-naive prior to transformation and demonstrated longer survival after RT compared to patients previously treated for CLL (6.1 vs. 2.8 years, p=.03). Whether this finding could be explained by a higher proportion of clonally unrelated RT among treatment-naive patients, remain to be addressed.","['Ben-Dali, Yasmin', 'Hleuhel, Mariam H', 'da Cunha-Bang, Caspar', 'Brieghel, Christian', 'Poulsen, Christian B', 'Clasen-Linde, Erik', 'Bentzen, Hans H N', 'Frederiksen, Henrik', 'Christiansen, Ilse', 'Nielsen, Linda H', 'Enggaard, Lisbeth', 'Helleberg, Marie', 'Clausen, Michael', 'Frederiksen, Mikael', 'Pedersen, Robert S', 'Niemann, Carsten U', 'Andersen, Michael A']","['Ben-Dali Y', 'Hleuhel MH', 'da Cunha-Bang C', 'Brieghel C', 'Poulsen CB', 'Clasen-Linde E', 'Bentzen HHN', 'Frederiksen H', 'Christiansen I', 'Nielsen LH', 'Enggaard L', 'Helleberg M', 'Clausen M', 'Frederiksen M', 'Pedersen RS', 'Niemann CU', 'Andersen MA']","['Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Roskilde University, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Sydvestjysk Sygehus, Esbjerg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, Hellerup, Denmark.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Sygehus Lillebaelt, Vejle, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Sygehus Soenderjylland, Sonderborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Hospitalsenheden Vest, Herning, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200207,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Biopsy', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/epidemiology', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology']",2020/02/08 06:00,2021/04/29 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2020.1719092 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jun;61(6):1435-1444. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2020.1719092.

METHODS: Tim-3 expression and coexpression with PD-1, CD244, and CD57 in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+T cells were analyzed by multicolored fluorescent flow cytometry in peripheral blood from 28 newly diagnosed, untreated AML patient and 12 cases with AML in complete remission, 23 healthy individuals served as control. RESULTS: Increasing Tim-3+CD244+ and Tim-3+CD57+ in CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells were found in AML and AML-CR groups in comparison with healthy controls. Similarly, increasing Tim-3 coexpression PD-1+ CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ T cells were found in AML group. A high tendency of PD-1+Tim-3+CD3+/CD4+/CD8+ T cells was detected in the AML-M4 subtype group followed by the M2 group, and a low tendency was found in the M3 group. Moreover, Tim-3+CD244+CD8+ T cells were found to be significantly higher in the M4 than that in M3 group. Dynamic changes of Tim-3+ T cells in AML patients who achieved CR after chemotherapy at different time points showed that Tim-3+ T cell subsets were evidently decreased; however, they remained at a higher level in most AML-CR patients. CONCLUSION: We made a novel observation on distribution of Tim-3+CD244+, Tim-3+CD57+, and Tim-3+PD-1+ T cells in patients with AML. Chemotherapy is incapable of resolving immunosuppression in some cases with AML in CR status.","['Tan, Jiaxiong', 'Huang, Shuxin', 'Huang, Jingying', 'Yu, Zhi', 'Chen, Youchun', 'Lu, Yuhong', 'Li, Yangqiu', 'Chen, Shaohua']","['Tan J', 'Huang S', 'Huang J', 'Yu Z', 'Chen Y', 'Lu Y', 'Li Y', 'Chen S']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200207,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (CD244 protein, human)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD57 Antigens/*genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/*genetics', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/08 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.13304 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2020 Jun;16(3):137-141. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13304.

Basal EPO levels maintain the optimum levels of circulating red blood cells. However, during hypoxia, EPO secretion and its expression is elevated drastically in renal interstitial fibroblasts, thereby increasing the number of erythroid progenitors and accelerating their differentiation to mature erythrocytes. A tight regulation of this pathway is therefore of paramount importance. The biological response to EPO is commenced through the involvement of its cognate receptor, EPOR. The receptor-ligand complex results in homodimerization and conformational changes, which trigger downstream signaling events and cause activation or inactivation of critical transcription factors that promote erythroid expansion. In recent years, recombinant human EPO (rEPO) has been widely used as a therapeutic tool to treat a number of anemias induced by infection, and chemotherapy for various cancers. However, several studies have uncovered a tumor promoting ability of EPO in man, which likely occurs through EPOR or alternative receptor(s). On the other hand, some studies have demonstrated a strong anticancer activity of EPO, although the mechanism still remains unclear. A thorough investigation of EPOR signaling could yield enhanced understanding of the pathobiology for a variety of disorders, as well as the potential novel therapeutic strategies. In this chapter, in addition to the clinical relevance of EPO/EPOR signaling, we review its anticancer efficacy within various tumor microenvironments.","['Liu, Wuling', 'Varier, Krishnapriya M', 'Sample, Klarke M', 'Zacksenhaus, Eldad', 'Gajendran, Babu', 'Ben-David, Yaacov']","['Liu W', 'Varier KM', 'Sample KM', 'Zacksenhaus E', 'Gajendran B', 'Ben-David Y']","['State Key Laboratory for Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Dr. A.L.M.

To analyze the common cause of death in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Methods and Materials. A retrospective descriptive study on children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who died at Hue Central Hospital between 2008 and 2018. All the patients were treated with the same protocol of modified Children's Cancer Group 1882 and 1881. Results. A total of 238 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were cared for at our center were enrolled. Of these, there were 74 deaths. Among the death group, the male-to-female ratio was 2.7:1. Twenty-six (35.1%) occurred in maintenance phase, 18 (24.3%) occurred in induction phase, and 9 (12.2%) occurred in delayed intensification. Infection was responsible for deaths in 32 of 74 (43.2%) cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in 3 of 32 infected cases (9.4%) and resistance to almost all antibiotics in our hospital. Relapse, abandonment, and bleeding were documented in 20 (27.0%), 7 (9.5%), and 6 (8.1%) cases, respectively. Twenty-seven (84.3%) patients had absolute neutrophil count <500/microL. Of 32 infectious deaths, pneumonia occurred in 40.6%. Regarding 20 relapse death, bone marrow was the major site of relapse and it occurred in 13 (65%) cases. And there were 65% patients with very early relapse. Conclusions. Infection is the major cause of mortality in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients in our study. To improve outcome, we should improve supportive care, especially prevention and control infection.","['Kiem Hao, Tran', 'Nhu Hiep, Pham', 'Kim Hoa, Nguyen Thi', 'Van Ha, Chau']","['Kiem Hao T', 'Nhu Hiep P', 'Kim Hoa NT', 'Van Ha C']","['Pediatric Center, Hue Central Hospital, Vietnam.', 'Pediatric Center, Hue Central Hospital, Vietnam.', 'Pediatric Center, Hue Central Hospital, Vietnam.', 'Pediatric Center, Hue Central Hospital, Vietnam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200122,United States,Glob Pediatr Health,Global pediatric health,101670224,,,,2020/02/08 06:00,2020/02/08 06:01,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/12/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2333794X20901930 [doi]', '10.1177_2333794X20901930 [pii]']",epublish,Glob Pediatr Health. 2020 Jan 22;7:2333794X20901930. doi: 10.1177/2333794X20901930. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5218-3529'],,['(c) The Author(s) 2020.'],PMC6977218,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'death', 'infection']",,,"['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that a high expression of SOX11 leads to alterations of gene expression that are typically associated with cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. A high expression is associated with DNA hypomethylation at the SOX11 locus and a favorable outcome.

Ocular symptoms can be the presenting signs of leukemia, they can appear after diagnosis has been established, or they can be the first manifestation of a relapse after remission. We report, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the ocular manifestation of a series of patients with ocular leukemia and the result of their treatment with intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) injections. This is a retrospective cohort study. The medical records of 12 consecutive patients with ocular leukemia (24 eyes, 11 eyes treated with MTX) treated at the Sheba Medical Center from January 2010 to December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Details on ocular inflammatory reaction and tumor cell infiltration at presentation and the end of follow-up were recorded as main outcome measures. The 12 patients included 7 women and 5 men (mean age +/- standard deviation at diagnosis 25.92 +/- 23.91 years, range 2-82 years). Eleven eyes of 6 patients were treated with intravitreal MTX injections. The indication for treatment was biopsy proven, tumor cell infiltration. The mean number of MTX injections was 3.37 +/- 5.35 (range 1-18). The mean follow-up was 27.08 +/- 36.79 months (range 1-93). All treated eyes showed improvement in the inflammatory reaction and tumor cell infiltration. In conclusion we found that Intravitreal MTX injections may be an effective therapeutic approach for eyes with intraocular leukemic tumor cell infiltration.","['Vishnevskia-Dai, Vicktoria', 'Sella King, Sara', 'Lekach, Ruth', 'Fabian, Ido Didi', 'Zloto, Ofira']","['Vishnevskia-Dai V', 'Sella King S', 'Lekach R', 'Fabian ID', 'Zloto O']","['Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel. vivida65@gmail.com.', 'The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. vivida65@gmail.com.', 'The Ophthalmology department, Meir Medical Center, Kfar-Saba, Israel.', 'The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.', 'The Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200206,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anterior Chamber/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Eye Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Eye Pain/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Intravitreal Injections', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Visual Acuity/*drug effects/physiology', 'Vitreous Body/pathology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/08 06:00,2020/11/20 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-020-58654-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-020-58654-8 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2020 Feb 6;10(1):1994. doi: 10.1038/s41598-020-58654-8.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9203-8097'],,,PMC7005017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Capitalizing on the CRISPR interference technology, we identified the second intron of IncRNA, PVT1, as a unique bona fide gained enhancer that restored MYC transcription independent of BRD4 recruitment in leukemia. A combined BETi and CDK7 inhibitor treatment abolished MYC transcription by impeding RNAPII loading without affecting PVT1-mediated chromatin looping at the MYC locus in BETi-resistant leukemia cells. Together, our findings have established the feasibility of targeting enhancer plasticity to overcome drug resistance associated with epigenetic therapies.","['Guo, Lei', 'Li, Jia', 'Zeng, Hongxiang', 'Guzman, Anna G', 'Li, Tingting', 'Lee, Minjung', 'Zhou, Yubin', 'Goodell, Margaret A', 'Stephan, Clifford', 'Davies, Peter J A', 'Dawson, Mark A', 'Sun, Deqiang', 'Huang, Yun']","['Guo L', 'Li J', 'Zeng H', 'Guzman AG', 'Li T', 'Lee M', 'Zhou Y', 'Goodell MA', 'Stephan C', 'Davies PJA', 'Dawson MA', 'Sun D', 'Huang Y']","['Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Translational Cancer Research, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Infectious Diseases, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Translational Cancer Research, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Center for Translational Cancer Research, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital & Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Centre for Cancer Research, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. dsun@tamu.edu.', 'Center for Epigenetics & Disease Prevention, Institute of Biosciences and Technology, Texas A&M University, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. yun.huang@tamu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200206,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Brd4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GSK1210151A)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PVT1 long-non-coding RNA, mouse)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (THZ1 compound)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase 7, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nuclear Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phenylenediamines/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2020/02/08 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-14604-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-14604-6 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 6;11(1):740. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14604-6.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7962-0517', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5950-9168']","['R01 GM112003/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL146852/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL134780/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA232017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7005144,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we present an approach to create isogenic pairs of cells that avoids single cell cloning, and screen these pairs with genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 libraries to generate genetic interaction maps. We query the anti-apoptotic genes BCL2L1 and MCL1, and the DNA damage repair gene PARP1, identifying both expected and uncharacterized buffering and synthetic lethal interactions. Additionally, we compare acute CRISPR-based knockout, single cell clones, and small-molecule inhibition. We observe that, while the approaches provide largely overlapping information, differences emerge, highlighting an important consideration when employing genetic screens to identify and characterize potential drug targets.

These translocations often occur in critical transcriptional/epigenetic regulators and contribute to malignant cell growth through alteration of normal gene expression. Despite this knowledge, the specific gene expression alterations that contribute to the development of leukemia remain incompletely understood. Here, through characterization of transcriptional regulation by the RUNX1-ETO fusion protein, we have identified Ras-association domain family member 2 (RASSF2) as a critical gene that is aberrantly transcriptionally repressed in t(8;21)-associated AML. Re-expression of RASSF2 specifically inhibits t(8;21) AML development in multiple models. Through biochemical and functional studies, we demonstrate RASSF2-mediated functions to be dependent on interaction with Hippo kinases, MST1 and MST2, but independent of canonical Hippo pathway signaling. Using proximity-based biotin labeling we define the RASSF2-proximal proteome in leukemia cells and reveal association with Rac GTPase-related proteins, including an interaction with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, DOCK2. Importantly, RASSF2 knockdown impairs Rac GTPase activation, and RASSF2 expression is broadly correlated with Rac-mediated signal transduction in AML patients. Together, these data reveal a previously unappreciated mechanistic link between RASSF2, Hippo kinases, and Rac activity with potentially broad functional consequences in leukemia.","['Stoner, Samuel A', 'Liu, Katherine Tin Heng', 'Andrews, Elizabeth T', 'Liu, Mengdan', 'Arimoto, Kei-Ichiro', 'Yan, Ming', 'Davis, Amanda G', 'Weng, Stephanie', 'Dow, Michelle', 'Xian, Su', 'DeKelver, Russell C', 'Carter, Hannah', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Stoner SA', 'Liu KTH', 'Andrews ET', 'Liu M', 'Arimoto KI', 'Yan M', 'Davis AG', 'Weng S', 'Dow M', 'Xian S', 'DeKelver RC', 'Carter H', 'Zhang DE']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. dez@ucsd.edu.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. dez@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. dez@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. dez@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200206,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RASSF2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RUNX1-IT1 long non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2020/02/08 06:00,2020/10/31 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2019/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-020-0282-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-020-0282-9 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2020 Feb 6;10(2):16. doi: 10.1038/s41408-020-0282-9.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4356-7480', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8295-876X']","['T15 LM011271/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007240/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DP5 OD017937/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA189452/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7005177,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Children's Oncology Group Phase III AAML1031 trial tested whether the addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy improves survival in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed AML. AAML1031 randomized patients younger than 30 years of age with de novo AML to standard treatment with or without bortezomib. All patients received the identical chemotherapy backbone with either four intensive chemotherapy courses or three courses followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for high-risk patients. For those randomized to the intervention arm, bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) was given on days 1, 4 and 8 of each chemotherapy course. For those randomized to the control arm, bortezomib was not administered. In total, 1,097 patients were randomized to standard chemotherapy (n=542) or standard chemotherapy with bortezomib (n=555). There was no difference in remission induction rate between the bortezomib and control treatment arms (89% vs 91%, P=0.531). Bortezomib failed to improve 3-year event-free survival (44.8+/-4.5% vs 47.0+/-4.5%, P=0.236) or overall survival (63.6+/-4.5 vs 67.2+/-4.3, P=0.356) compared with the control arm. However, bortezomib was associated with significantly more peripheral neuropathy (P=0.006) and intensive care unit admissions (P=0.025) during the first course. The addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy increased toxicity but did not improve survival. These data do not support the addition of bortezomib to standard chemotherapy in children with de novo AML.

Whether a higher dose of cytarabine would be more effective is unknown. Also, there is controversy whether high-dose cytarabine is better than an intermediate-dose combined with other drugs for post-remission therapy. In this open-label, randomized controlled, parallel group study, roles of intermediate-dose cytarabine were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects with AML age 15-55 years were randomized to receive daunorubicin, omacetaxine mepesuccinate, and conventional- or intermediate-dose cytarabine. Subjects achieving complete remission were randomized to receive 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine or 2 courses of intermediate-dose cytarabine with daunorubicin in the 1(st) and mitoxantrone in the 2(nd) course. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: 591 subjects were randomized to intermediate- (N = 295) or conventional-dose (N = 296) cytarabine group. Three-year DFSs were 67% [95% confidence interval (CI), 61-73] in the intermediate-dose cohort compared with 54% (95% CI, 48-61) in the conventional-dose cohort [Hazard Ratio (HR), 0.67; 95%CI, 0.51-0.89; P = 0.005). Three-year survivals were 68% (95%CI, 63-74) and 59% (95%CI, 53-65; HR, 0.720; 95%CI, 0.56-0.94; P = 0.014). Two courses of intermediate-dose cytarabine with daunorubicin or mitoxantrone resulted in similar DFS and survival as three courses of high-dose cytarabine when used for post-remission therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Induction therapy with intermediate-dose cytarabine with daunorubicin and omacetaxine mepesuccinate increases DFS and survival in persons with AML ages 15-55 years compared with conventional-dose cytarabine.See related commentary by Watts and Bradley, p. 3073.","['Wei, Hui', 'Wang, Ying', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Lin, Dong', 'Zhou, Chunlin', 'Liu, Bingcheng', 'Qiu, Shaowei',

Our retrospective study aimed to determine the effect of obesity on overall survival (OS) in AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: AML patients diagnosed at University of Nebraska Medical Center were divided into 3 groups according to body mass index (BMI): normal (18.5-25 kg/m(2)) or underweight (< 18.5 kg/m(2)); overweight (25-30 kg/m(2)); and obese (>/= 30 kg/m(2)). Chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and ANOVA were used to examine the association of BMI with baseline characteristics. Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) comorbidity index. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust P values. OS, defined as time from diagnosis to death from any cause, was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method; comparisons of survival curves were done using log-rank test. Cox regression analysis was performed to detect the effect of BMI on OS. RESULTS: Of 314 patients, 38% were obese, 68% received intensive chemotherapy, and 30% underwent HCT. Patient characteristics for all BMI groups were similar except greater HCT comorbidity index in obese patients. Actual body weight was used to calculate the chemotherapy dose in 92% of obese patients. The rates of receipt of HCT in normal, overweight, and obese groups were 33%, 32%, and 25%, respectively (P = .6). One-year OS values for normal/underweight, overweight, and obese groups was 42%, 45%, and 39%, respectively (P = .31). On multivariate analysis, obesity was associated with worse OS compared to normal-weight (hazard ratio = 0.6; 95% confidence interval, 0.4-0.9; P = .03) but not overweight patients. CONCLUSION: Obesity confers worse prognosis in AML. Differences in OS were not the result of differences in chemotherapy dose or receipt of HCT.","['Dhakal, Prajwal', 'Lyden, Elizabeth', 'Lee, Andrea', 'Michalski, Joel', 'Al-Kadhimi, Zaid S', 'Maness, Lori J', 'Gundabolu, Krishna', 'Bhatt, Vijaya Raj']","['Dhakal P', 'Lyden E', 'Lee A', 'Michalski J', 'Al-Kadhimi ZS', 'Maness LJ', 'Gundabolu K', 'Bhatt VR']","['Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE; Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.

It is a well-tolerated agent with some side-effects, the most common of which are atrial fibrillation, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection, fatigue, nausea, rash and cytopenias. Most of these toxicities are mild, although some have a severe clinical course. CASE REPORT: The case is here reported of a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient with ibrutinib-induced polyneuropathy. A 63-year-old male patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was given ibrutinib as a third line treatment regimen. After the 10th month of therapy he had progressive complaints of numbness and tingling in his legs. The patient was diagnosed as grade 3 sensorineural polyneuropathy with electromyography.Management and outcome: Considering that ibrutinib treatment may cause neuropathy, the ibrutinib was discontinued, after which the neuropathic complaints improved. However, the neck and axillary lymph nodes were enlarged and treatment had to be re-started therefore ibrutinib was started at a low dose and gradually increased. The patient is currently in the 14th month of treatment and still using ibrutinib without any severe side-effects. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, polyneuropathy as a unique side-effect of ibrutinib has not been previously reported. In addition to the well-known side effects of ibrutinib treatment, it should be kept in mind that polyneuropathy may also develop.","['Comert, Pinar', 'Albayrak, Murat', 'Yildiz, Abdulkerim', 'Sahin, Osman', 'Ozturk, Hacer Berna', 'Reis Aras, Merih']","['Comert P', 'Albayrak M', 'Yildiz A', 'Sahin O', 'Ozturk HB', 'Reis Aras M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Health Sciences, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20200206,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Polyneuropathies/*chemically induced', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",2020/02/08 06:00,2020/11/24 06:00,['2020/02/08 06:00'],"['2020/02/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155220903357 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Sep;26(6):1501-1504. doi: 10.1177/1078155220903357.

METHODS: A pool of 2059 annual effective doses corresponding to 272 job's positions occupied by nuclear medicine and radiology workers for a certain time period over 26 years in five Lithuanian hospitals was investigated in order to analyze the occupational exposure tendencies to medical staff. Requested data, measured in terms of whole body dose, personal dose equivalent Hp(10), was obtained from the National Register of Sources of Ionizing Radiation and Occupational Exposure. Considering that nuclear medicine staff is dealing with open sources/radioisotopes, doses to extremities, Hp(0.07), were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) of LiF:Mg, Ti type. Lifetime risk estimations for the development of specific cancer (thyroid cancer and leukemia) for exposed radiation workers were performed using risk models included in BEIR VII report (BEIR VII, 2006). The conservative assessment of the thyroid exposure was performed using RadRAT 4.1.1 tool. RESULTS: Doses to radiology technologists and radiology nurses were found to be highest over the years. However, their annual doses never exceeded dose limit of 20 mSv and were following the same decreasing tendency as the doses of other personnel. There was no increase of doses to nuclear medicine staff observed after installation of two new PET/CT machines, indicating increased radiation protection culture and application of relevant technical and protective measures by the staff. Measured fingertip doses were 2-3 times higher than the hand doses measured with TLD ring and were dependent on the type and frequency of the nuclear medicine examination procedure and on the type and activity of isotopes used for examination. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, retrospective dose evaluation for the cohort of medical radiation workers was performed in the country. It enabled estimation of lifetime attributable risk for the development of two cancer types: thyroid and leukemia cancer among occupationally exposed medical radiation staff. Projected risk was low, ~10(-5), however it was found that the risk of thyroid cancer for female staff was 5.7 times higher than for the males. Obtained results will be used for the predictive assessment of possible radiation induced health effects to occupationally exposed medical radiation workers.","['Adliene, D', 'Griciene, B', 'Skovorodko, K', 'Laurikaitiene, J', 'Puiso, J']","['Adliene D', 'Griciene B', 'Skovorodko K', 'Laurikaitiene J', 'Puiso J']","['Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas, Lithuania.

METHODS: There were 171 eligible patients. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 171 eligible patients between 21 and 27 hours after the last imatinib administration. Complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR) and complete molecular response (CMR) were used as metrics for efficacy. Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 genes, SLC22A4 (917 T>C, -248 C>G and -538 C>G), SLC22A5 (-945 T>G and -1889 T>C), SLCO1A2 (-361 G>A), SLCO1B3 (334 T>G and 699 G>A) and ABCG2 (421C>A) were selected for genotyping. RESULTS: Patients with CCyR achieve higher trough concentrations than those without CCyR (1478.18+/-659.83 vs 984.89+/-454.06 ng mL-1, p<0.001). Patients with MMR and CMR achieve higher trough concentrations than those without MMR and CMR, respectively (1486.40+/-703.38 vs 1121.17+/-527.14 ng mL-1, p=0.007; 1528.00+/-709.98 vs 1112.67+/-518.35 ng mL-1, p=0.003, respectively). Carriers of A allele in SLCO1A2 -361G>A achieve higher CCyR and MMR rates (p=0.047, OR=4.320, 95% CI: 0.924-20.206; p=0.042, OR=2.825, 95% CI: 1.016-7.853, respectively). Both trough concentrations and SLCO1A2 -361G>A genotypes are independent factors affecting imatinib efficacy. The positive and negative predictive values for CCyR are 71.01% and 68.75%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values for MMR are 62.86% and 69.70%, respectively.

In this French multicenter retrospective study of 33 patients, we investigated the clinical and therapeutic features of MG-associated scleromyxedema. Skin molecular signatures were analyzed using a transcriptomic approach. Skin symptoms included papular eruptions (100%), sclerodermoid features (91%), and leonine facies (39%). MG involved an immunoglobulin G isotype in all patients, with a predominant lambda light chain (73%). Associated hematologic malignancies were diagnosed in 4 of 33 patients (12%) (smoldering myeloma, n = 2; chronic lymphoid leukemia, n = 1; and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, n = 1). Carpal tunnel syndrome (33%), arthralgia (25%), and dermato-neuro syndrome (DNS) (18%) were the most common systemic complications. One patient with mucinous cardiopathy died of acute heart failure. High-dose IV immunoglobulin (HDIVig), alone or in combination with steroids, appeared to be quite effective in nonsevere cases (clinical complete response achieved in 13/31 patients). Plasma cell-directed therapies using lenalidomide and/or bortezomib with dexamethasone and HDIVig led to a significant improvement in severe cases (HDIVig refractory or cases with central nervous system or cardiac involvement). The emergency treatment of DNS with combined plasmapheresis, HDIVig, and high-dose corticosteroids induced the complete remission of neurological symptoms in 4 of 5 patients. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of 6 scleromyxedema skin samples showed significantly higher profibrotic pathway levels (transforming growth factor beta and collagen-1) than in healthy skin. Prospective studies targeting plasma cell clones and/or fibrotic pathways are warranted for long-term scleromyxedema management.","['Mahevas, Thibault', 'Arnulf, Bertrand', 'Bouaziz, Jean-David', 'Livideanu, Cristina Bulai', 'Osio, Amelie', 'Servy, Amandine', 'Cribier, Bernard', 'Sassolas, Bruno', 'Jachiet, Marie', 'Michel, Laurence', 'Aucouturier, Pierre', 'Lipsker, Dan', 'Frances, Camille', 'Sbidian, Emilie', 'Rybojad, Michel', 'Descamps, Vincent', ""D'Incan, Michel"", 'Humbert, Philippe', 'Beylot-Barry, Marie', 'Passeron, Thierry', 'de Moreuil, Claire', 'Taha, Ruba Y', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Dupuy, Alain', 'Barbarot, Sebastien', 'Debarbieux, Sebastien', 'Carpentier, Olivier', 'Brault, Fanny', 'Schmutz, Jean-Luc', 'Thomas-Beaulieu, Domitille', 'Modiano, Philippe', 'Zarnitsky, Charles', 'Lifermann, Francois', 'Baubion, Emilie', 'Limal, Nicolas', 'Le Bras, Fabien', 'Le Moigne, Marie', 'Tauber, Marie', 'Talbot, Alexis', ""Prud'homme, Romain"", 'Peltier, Sandy', 'De Masson, Adele', 'Battistella, Maxime', 'Bagot, Martine', 'Mekinian, Arsene', 'Fain, Olivier']","['Mahevas T', 'Arnulf B', 'Bouaziz JD', 'Livideanu CB', 'Osio A', 'Servy A', 'Cribier B', 'Sassolas B', 'Jachiet M', 'Michel L', 'Aucouturier P', 'Lipsker D', 'Frances C', 'Sbidian E', 'Rybojad M', 'Descamps V', ""D'Incan M"", 'Humbert P', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Passeron T', 'de Moreuil C', 'Taha RY', 'Hermine O', 'Dupuy A', 'Barbarot S', 'Debarbieux S', 'Carpentier O', 'Brault F', 'Schmutz JL', 'Thomas-Beaulieu D', 'Modiano P', 'Zarnitsky C', 'Lifermann F', 'Baubion E', 'Limal N', 'Le Bras F', 'Le Moigne M', 'Tauber M', 'Talbot A', ""Prud'homme R"", 'Peltier S', 'De Masson A', 'Battistella M', 'Bagot M', 'Mekinian A', 'Fain O']","['Sorbonne Universite, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Antoine, Service de Medecine Interne, Paris, France.', ""AP-HP, Hopital Saint Louis, Service d'Immuno-Hematologie, Universite de Paris, France."", 'AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Service de Dermatologie, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Departement de Dermatologie, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Service de Pathologie, AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Est Creteil, EpiDermE (EA7379) Creteil, France.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hopitaux Universitaires Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.', ""INSERM U1430, Centre d'Investigation Clinique (CIC), Creteil, France."", 'Clinique Dermatologique, Hopitaux Universitaires et Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Departement de Medecine Vasculaire, Medecine Interne et Pneumologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Brest, Hopital La Cavale Blanche, Brest, France.', 'AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Service de Dermatologie, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, U976, INSERM, Paris, France.', ""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM Unite Mixte de Recherche en Sante (UMRS) 938, Centre de Recherche St-Antoine (CRSA), AP-HP, Departement d'Immunologie Biologique, Hopital St-Antoine, Paris, France."", 'Clinique Dermatologique, Hopitaux Universitaires et Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Sorbonne Universite, AP-HP, Service de Dermatologie et Allergologie, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Est Creteil, EpiDermE (EA7379) Creteil, France.', 'Department of Dermatology, Hopitaux Universitaires Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.', ""INSERM U1430, Centre d'Investigation Clinique (CIC), Creteil, France."", 'AP-HP, Hopital Saint-Louis, Service de Dermatologie, Universite de Paris, Paris, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Bichat, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Service de Dermatologie, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Centre Hospitalier Estaing, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', ""Centre d'Etudes et de Recherche sur le Tegument, INSERM UMR 1098, Universite de Franche-Comte, Besancon, France."", 'Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Andre, CHU de Bordeaux, INSERM U1053, Universite de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', ""Universite Cote d'Azur, Service de Dermatologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Nice, Nice, France;

Limited data have evaluated the impact of the type, number, and patterns of TP53 mutations in response outcomes and prognosis of MDS. We evaluated the clinicopathologic characteristics, outcomes, and response to therapy of 261 patients with MDS and TP53 mutations. Median age was 68 years (range, 18-80 years). A total of 217 patients (83%) had a complex karyotype. TP53 mutations were detected at a median variant allele frequency (VAF) of 0.39 (range, 0.01-0.94). TP53 deletion was associated with lower overall response rate (ORR) (odds ratio, 0.3; P = .021), and lower TP53 VAF correlated with higher ORR to HMAs. Increase in TP53 VAF at the time of transformation was observed in 13 patients (61%), and previously undetectable mutations were observed in 15 patients (65%). TP53 VAF was associated with worse prognosis (hazard ratio, 1.02 per 1% VAF increase; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.03; P < .001). Integration of TP53 VAF and karyotypic complexity identified prognostic subgroups within TP53-mutant MDS. We developed a multivariable model for overall survival that included the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) categories and TP53 VAF. Total score for each patient was calculated as follows: VAF TP53 + 13 x IPSS-R blast score + 16 x IPSS-R cytogenetic score + 28 x IPSS-R hemoglobin score + 46 x IPSS-R platelet score. Use of this model identified 4 prognostic subgroups with median survival times of not reached, 42.2, 21.9, and 9.2 months. These data suggest that outcomes of patients with TP53-mutated MDS are heterogeneous and that transformation may be driven not only by TP53 but also by other factors.","['Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Benton, Christopher B', 'Class, Caleb A', 'Chien, Kelly S', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Alvarado, Yesid', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Daver, Naval', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Borthakur, Gautham', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Soltysiak, Kelly A', 'Pierce, Sherry R', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Montalban-Bravo G', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Benton CB', 'Class CA', 'Chien KS', 'Sasaki K', 'Naqvi K', 'Alvarado Y', 'Kadia TM', 'Ravandi F', 'Daver N', 'Takahashi K', 'Jabbour E', 'Borthakur G', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Konopleva M', 'Soltysiak KA', 'Pierce SR', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Patel KP', 'Kantarjian H', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Hematopathology, and.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Hematopathology, and.', 'Department of Hematopathology, and.', 'Department of Leukemia.', 'Department of Leukemia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S2473-9529(20)31494-4 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001101 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2020 Feb 11;4(3):482-495. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019001101.,,['T32 CA009666/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.'],PMC7013259,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We applied a simplified flow cytometric assay to identify patients with precursor B-cell ALL (B-ALL) at very low risk (VLR) of relapse and treated them with a reduced-intensity treatment plan (RELLA05). VLR criteria include favorable presenting features (age >/= 1 and < 10 years), white blood cell count of <50 x109/L, lack of extramedullary leukemia, and minimal residual disease level of <0.01% on remission induction day 19. Except for 2 doses of daunorubicin, treatment of patients with VLR B-ALL consisted of a combination of agents with relatively low myelotoxicity profiles, including corticosteroids, vincristine, L-asparaginase, methotrexate, and 6-mercaptopurine. Cyclophosphamide, systemic cytarabine, and central nervous system radiotherapy were not used. Of 454 patients with ALL treated at the Instituto de Medicina Integral Professor Fernando Figueira in Recife, Brazil, between December 2005 and June 2015, 101 were classified as having VLR B-ALL. There were no cases of death resulting from toxicity or treatment abandonment during remission induction. At a median follow-up of 6.6 years, there were 8 major adverse events: 6 relapses, 1 treatment-related death (from septicemia) during remission, and 1 secondary myeloid leukemia. The estimated 5-year event-free and overall survival rates were 92.0% +/- 3.9% and 96.0% +/- 2.8%, respectively. The 5-year cumulative risk of relapse was 4.24% +/- 2.0%.

Given that Peru's oncological pattern could illustrate those of other LA countries, we aimed at determining trends and changes in cancer-related mortality by age and sex in Peru between 2003 and 2016. METHODS AND RESULTS: A secondary data analysis using national deaths registries was conducted. Categories were created according to the 27 most frequent sites of presentation of cancer. We found that deaths attributed to cancer increased from 15.4% of all deaths in 2003 to 18.1% in 2016 (p<0.001). According to the cancer site, stomach cancer (19.1%) and lung cancer (11.5%) were the most frequent causes of death overall. In childhood (0 to 14 years), the two most frequent fatal cancers were leukemia (54.6% for boys and 53.5% for girls) and brain and nervous system tumors (19.4% for boys and 20.3% for girls). For teenagers and young male adults (15-49 years), stomach cancer (18.1%) and brain cancer (17.4%) were the leading causes of death; in their female counterparts, cervix uteri (20.0%) and breast cancer (16.1%) were the most mortal cancers. In adults (>/=50 years), stomach (20.9% for men and 18.6% for women) and lung (12.7% for men and 10.4% for women) were the leading contributors to the burden of cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Between the years 2003 and 2016, almost one fifth of deaths were attributed to cancer in Peru. Absolute and relative number of deaths due to cancer has increased in this period for both men and women; however, standardized mortality rates due to cancer have declined.","['Zafra-Tanaka, Jessica H', 'Tenorio-Mucha, Janeth', 'Villarreal-Zegarra, David', 'Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo', 'Bernabe-Ortiz, Antonio']","['Zafra-Tanaka JH', 'Tenorio-Mucha J', 'Villarreal-Zegarra D', 'Carrillo-Larco R', 'Bernabe-Ortiz A']","['CRONICAS Center of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'CRONICAS Center of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'CRONICAS Center of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'CRONICAS Center of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Centro de Estudios de Poblacion, Universidad Catolica los Angeles de Chimbote (ULADECH), Chimbote, Peru.', 'CRONICAS Center of Excellence in Chronic Diseases, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Peru.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200206,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Peru/epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/05/08 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0228867 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-14042 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Feb 6;15(2):e0228867. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228867. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-6834-1376'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '214185/Z/18/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']",,PMC7004369,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],['PLoS One. 2020 Mar 4;15(3):e0230271.

Although AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical cellular energy sensor, it has recently become clear that AMPK can act as a tumor regulator. Here, we assessed the expression of AMPK in primary ATL cells and the effects of dorsomorphin, an AMPK inhibitor, on primary ATL cells and HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. AMPK expression in acute and chronic ATL patients was significantly higher than in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers and healthy donors. Dorsomorphin induced apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ATL patients. Dorsomorphin also induced dose- and time-dependent apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Dorsomorphin increased the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced ataxia telangiectasia-mutated Ser1981 phosphorylation and p53 accumulation. These results indicated that dorsomorphin induces apoptosis via ROS-mediated DNA damage in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Furthermore, dorsomorphin suppressed the growth of human ATL tumor xenografts in NOD/SCID mice. Together, these data suggest that AMPK could be a candidate therapeutic target for ATL and that dorsomorphin could be a therapeutic agent for ATL.","['Aikawa, Akiyoshi', 'Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Uchida, Yuichiro', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Honda, Shin-Ichiro']","['Aikawa A', 'Kozako T', 'Uchida Y', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Ohsugi T', 'Honda SI']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kagoshima University Hospital, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Rakuno Gakuen University, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200220,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '10K52CIC1Z (dorsomorphin)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/05/18 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.15239 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2020 Sep;287(18):4005-4015. doi: 10.1111/febs.15239.

It was found that the overactivation or abnormality of B cell receptor (BCR) signal pathway closely related to the occurrence and development of various B cell tumors, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). As a key kinase in the BCR pathway, BTK inhibitors have obvious anti-tumor effect when its activity is being inhibitered. Currently, BTK inhibitors developed include the first-generation Ibrutinib and the second-generation Acalabrutinib, which can be targeted at the inhibition of BTK and its downstream signaling pathway, and have important therapeutic value for a variety of B-cell tumors, such as CLL and partial non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). However, its side effects and drug-resistance also gradually emerged, effective drug combination therapy has shown a certain clinical activity.

METHODS: The clinical, pathological features, treatment regimens and treatment response of 9 patients with BPDCN diagnosed and treated from January 1, 2013 to June 30,2019 in Xiangya Second Hospital of Central South University were analyzed respectively. RESULTS: The most common site of involvement in 9 patients with BPDCN was skin; the pathological features were involvement of dermis, and the highest positive immunohistochemical indexes rate were CD4, CD43, LCA, CD123, and VIM (all 100%), followed by CD56 and CD68, TDT, CD5, PAX-5, CD3, CD8, CD20; MPO and EBER of 9 patients were negative. However, Ki-67 of the 9 patients showed a medican of 77. 5% (40%-90%), which suggests that CD4, CD43, LCA, CD123, and VIM were the most sensitive antigens for diagnosing BPDCN. Of the 9 patients, 2 cases were lost to follow-up, 2 cases were untreated, and 5 cases were treated, in which 2 cases received treatment of regiment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 3 cases received treatment of regimen for lymphoma. The PR of clinical symptoms in the first cycle in 5 patients were 100%, and 1 patient has survived for 6 years since the disease was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: BPDCN is a rare and highly invasive lymphoid hematopoietic malignancy. The most common initial symptom of the patients is skin lesions. The most sensitive pathological indicators are CD4, CD43, LCA, VIM, and the BPDCN patients received treatment of regimens for lymphoid tumor show a better response rate.","['Wu, Ling-Zhen', 'Yu, Qian', 'Jiang, Yi', 'Peng, Hong-Ling']","['Wu LZ', 'Yu Q', 'Jiang Y', 'Peng HL']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410011, Hunan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410011, Hunan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410011, Hunan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha 410011, Hunan Province, China,E-mail: penghongling@csu.edu.cn.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)'],IM,"['Dendritic Cells', '*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Prognosis', '*Skin Neoplasms']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2020)01-0307-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.01.051 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Feb;28(1):307-313. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.01.051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dosage was adjusted by the endurance of patients. RESULTS: Until Nov 30, 2018, 7 out of 10 patients survived. The average survival time was 15.5+/-1.9 months. 1-year OS rate was 64.0%. Six patients appeared aGVHD, and four patients appeared cGVHD. CONCLUSION: The usage of decitabine combined with DLI in patients with relapsed MDS/AML and high-risk AML after allo-HSCT can prolong lives of patients, reduce relapsed rate, and provide the probability for long time survival.","['Wang, Qing-Yun', 'Liang, Ze-Yin', 'Dong, Yu-Jun', 'Yin, Yue', 'Wang, Qian', 'Liu, Wei', 'Xu, Wei-Lin', 'Li, Yuan', 'Ren, Han-Yun']","['Wang QY', 'Liang ZY', 'Dong YJ', 'Yin Y', 'Wang Q', 'Liu W', 'Xu WL', 'Li Y', 'Ren HY']","['Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China,E-mail: drliyuan75@163.com.', 'Department of HematologyThe First Hospital of Peking UniversityBeijing 100034China,E-mail: renhy0813@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)'],IM,"['Decitabine', 'Graft vs Host Disease', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Retrospective Studies']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2020)01-0248-07 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.01.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Feb;28(1):248-254. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.01.042.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 47 patients with low and moderate risk MDS treated with decitabine in our hospital. The course of treatment was 20 mg/(m(2).d)x5 d injected subcutaneously for 28 d as a course of treatment. After 3 to 4 courses of treatment, the therapeutic response and survival prognostic factors of patients were evaluated. RESULTS: According to the revised IWG standard, 18 patients (38.3%) achieved CR, 13 patients (27.7%) achieved PR, 7 patients (14.9%) showed hematological improvement, 7 patients (14.9%) died of pulmonary infection or myelosuppression, 2 patients transformed into acute myeloid leukemia. The median survival time of MDS patients was 26 months. The overall effective rate of decitabine regimen was 80.9% (38/47). The independent poor prognostic factors for survival were high IPSS grade, long course of MDS, early treatment for MDS, and elder. CONCLUSION: The long-term efficacy of decitabine in the treatment of low and moderate-risk MDS is definite. The clinical factors before treatment may predict the efficacy of decitabine in the treatment of MDS.","['Shu, Hua-E', 'Fang, Teng']","['Shu HE', 'Fang T']","[""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Chongqing Kaizhou District, Chongqing 405400, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The People's Hospital of Chongqing Kaizhou District, Chongqing 405400, China,E-mail: fangteng75@126.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine', 'Decitabine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2020)01-0214-04 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.01.036 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Feb;28(1):214-217. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2020.01.036.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mutations of RUNX1, DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, NPM1, FLT3-ITD and C-KIT in 170 patients with MDS were detected by direct and indirect sequencing of genomic DNA-PCR amplification products. RESULTS: The RUNX1 mutation was found in 23 patients (13.5 %, 23/170). Among the 170 patients, other most frequent mutation was TET2 (11.2%, 19/170), followed by mutations in DNMT3A (9.4%, 16/170), NPM1 (8.2%, 14/170), IDH2 (4.1%, 7/170)FLT3-ITD (2.9%, 5/170), IDH1 (1.7%, 3/170) and c-KIT (0.58%, 1/170). The most common coexisting mutations were TET2 (5/23). The RUNX1-mutated group showed significantly higher leukocyte levels, higher percentages of blast cells, higher incidences of leukemia transformation and lower platelet counts in comparison with RUNX1 non-mutation group (P0.05). whereas there were no statistically significant difference in age, MDS subtype, karyotype and hemoglobin level between 2 groups (P0.05). Seventeen patients harboring RUNX1 mutations were followed up and almost 47.05% (8/17) of the patients progressed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

METHODS: The clinical data of 112 newly diagnosed adult AML patients with positive NPM1 gene were collected and retrospectively analyzed. The correlation of the transcripts of NPM1 gene mutation with prognosis of patients was analyzed. RESULTS: In 112 AML patients, the median transcript level of NPM1 gene mutation accounted for 83.68% (5.86%-486.57%), FLT3-ITD mutation positive was found in 44 cases (39.29%), chromosomal abnormalities in 22 cases (19.64%) and complete remission in 96 cases (85.71%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the initial induction therapy and white blood cell count closely related with complete remission (P0.05). The median follow-up time was 22 (3-36) months, and the 3-year overall survival rate was 66.07% in 112 patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that both the high level of minimal residual disease at the initial complete remission and the high level of minimal residual disease after consolidation therapy were the independent risk factors for overall survival (P0.05).

METHODS: The effects of DHA on the proliferation of acute myeloid leukemia cells and the inhibitory effect of Z-VAD-FMK on the DHA-induced cell apoptosis were detected by CCK-8 assay. The expression level of cleaved-caspased 3 was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Western blot was used to quantify the protein expression of PTEN, p-Akt, AKT, beta-actin, and the apoptosis-associated proteins, such as C-PARP, Cleaved-caspase3 and Caspase3 respectively. RESULTS: DHA induced the AML cell apoptosis with concentration-dependent manner (rKasumi-1=-0.959, rKG-1=-0.956). The DHA could induce the accumulation of cleaved-caspase 3 and C-PARP in AML cells, activate PTEN gene and inhibited Akt phosphorylation. Apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK could partially restored the activity of DHA-inhibited cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Dihydroartemisinin induces AML cell apoptosis by inhibition of PTEN/AKT pathway.

METHODS: Seventy-seven ALL patients diagnosed in the first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University from 2018 to 2019 were selected. The immunotyping, fusion gene and gene mutation were detected by flow cytometry, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and next generation sequencing (NGS). RESULTS: Among 77 patients with ALL, 66 were B-ALL, 9 were T-ALL. CD7 and cCD3 were the most valuable for the diagnosis of T-ALL, CD19 and cCD79a were the most valuable for the diagnosis of B-ALL, and CD58, CD123 were highly expressed in B-ALL. Three fusion genes: BCR-ABL (20.8%), MLL-AF4 (5.19%) and E2A-PBX1 (2.60%) were detected by RT-PCR and 10 mutant genes were detected by NGS (the total detection rate was 33.47%). The highest mutation rates were IL-7R (6 cases), NOTCH1 (6 cases), TP53 (5 cases) and FLT-3 (4 cases). Patients with IL-7R, NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations showed poor response to induction chemotherapy.

METHODS: Real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of BTLA and its ligand HVEM mRNA in 11 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 11 normal donors. Flow cytometry was used to detect expression of BTLA and its HVEM on the cell surface of peripheral blood T lymphocytes and gammadelta T cells. RESULTS: The median values of BTLA and its ligand HVEM mRNA expression in peripheral blood of patients with CMML were 0.009% and 559.4%, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of normal controls (0.053% and 1031%)(P<0.001). The expression level of BTLA and HVEM on cell surface of peripheral lymphocytes was not significantly different from that in normal controls (P=0.3031 and 0.2576), however, the proportion of peripheral blood T lymphocytes in patients with CMML (median: 37.73%) was significantly lower than that in controls (median 69.23%)(P=0.0005).

METHODS: The specimens of 250 AML patients in first affiliated hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to November 2018 were collected and analyzed retrospectively. The mutation of 22 related genes were detected by using AML NGS chips. Then, the differences between elderly (>/=60 years old) and young adults (60 years old) were compared. RESULTS: The most frequent mutations of 250 patients were as follows: NPM1(22.4%), FLT3-ITD(18.8%), NRAS(17.2%), DNMT3A(14.4%), TET2(11.6%), IDH2(9.6%), Biallelic CEBPA(8.8%), Moallelic CEBPA(8.4%), KIT(8.4%), RUNX1(7.6%), IDH1(7.6%), ASXL1(6.0%), U2AF1(5.2%), SRSF2 (3.2%), SF3B1(3.2%), TP53(2.4%), KRAS(2.0%). The NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A mutation significantly increased in intermediate prognosis group while KIT significantly increased in favourable prognosis group. The TET2 and IDH2 mutation rate in elderly patients were significantly higher than that in young patients (21.8% vs 8.7%) (chi(2)=7.180, P=0.007) and (20.0% vs 6.7%) ( chi(2)=8.788, P=0.003) respectively.

Among the 25 patients, 15 patients suffered first-time hematological relapse (HR), and the other 10 patients showed first-time molecular relapse (MR). The patients with first-time replase were treated with ATO+ATRA+Anthracycline re-induction chemotherapy. The clinical features, complete remission (CR) rate, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and adverse events after re-induction therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: Fourteen of 15 hematological relapsed patients achieved the second-time hematological complete remission (CR2) after re-induction therapy except one patient died of bleeding complication during the re-induction. 8 of 14 patient showed molecular complete remission (CRm) after two cycles of therapy with this regimen. Totally, eleven out of the 14 HR patients were alive without disease till the last follow-up, and 3 of the 14 HR patients died because of bleeding complications. All of the 10 molecular relapsed patients received the second CRm after treated by the regimen.

In this setting, various clinical trials have recently explored novel therapeutic agents either used alone or in combination with intensive chemotherapy or low-intensity treatments.Areas covered: The current paper reviews the clinical development of glasdegib, a selective inhibitor of the Hedgehog signaling pathway through binding to its target SMO, for the treatment of AML.Expert opinion: Glasdegib confirmed its efficacy and showed an acceptable tolerability, especially when used in combination either with '3 + 7' chemotherapy or with low-intensity therapies. In 2018, glasdegib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with low-dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in patients older than 75 years or presenting with severe comorbidities.","['Thomas, Xavier', 'Heiblig, Mael']","['Thomas X', 'Heiblig M']","['Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud University Hospital, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hospices Civils de Lyon, Hematology Department, Lyon-Sud University Hospital, Pierre Benite, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200206,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'K673DMO5H9 (glasdegib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/05/29 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14656566.2020.1713094 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2020 Apr;21(5):523-530. doi: 10.1080/14656566.2020.1713094.

Relapse and acquired resistance to anticancer therapy constitute two actual issues that need to be overcome. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in regulating cancer progression. At present, many studies are attempting to uncover the potentials of modulating NO levels to improve the efficacy of currently available treatments against lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma. Recent Advances: It is becoming progressively clear that NO modulation may help hematological cancer management, either by targeting directly tumor cells or by driving the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. Critical Issues: NO is a dual molecule that can have a tumor-protecting or stimulating effect, depending on its local concentration. Moreover, NO is able to target a wide range of molecules involved in both cancer genesis and evolution. In this review, an overview of the recent findings regarding the pivotal role played by NO and nitric oxide synthase in cancer progression and anticancer therapy is presented, with particular focus on hematological malignancies. Future Directions: It is critical to establish the cancer-specific function of NO and critically drive its modulation to improve cancer management toward a personalized approach. This has a special importance in hematological tumors, where the urgency of finding eradicative therapies is constant. Antioxid.

A high-throughput screening approach was used to evaluate a library of natural products to determine the most synergistic combination in precursor-B cell acute lymphoblast leukemia. Dimethylaminoparthenolide and shikonin effectively inhibited proliferation resulting in cell death in primary and immortalized leukemia cells, while having negligible effects on normal cells. Dimethylaminoparthenolide and shikonin have been shown separately to inhibit cell survival and proliferative signaling and activate tumor suppressors and proapoptotic pathways. Untargeted metabolomics and metabolic flux analysis with stable isotopically labeled glucose and glutamine exhibited a global shift in metabolism following treatment. Pathway analysis indicated significant differences in amino acid, antioxidant, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and nucleotide metabolism. Together, dimethylaminoparthenolide and shikonin reduced the shunting of glycolytic intermediates into the pentose phosphate pathway for biosynthetic purposes. Similarly, the incorporation of glutamine and glutamine-derived metabolites into purine and pyrimidine synthesis was inhibited by the combination of dimethylaminoparthenolide and shikonin, effectively impeding biosynthetic pathways critical for leukemia cell survival. This approach demonstrates that a synergistic pair of compounds with malignant cell specificity can effectively target metabolic pathways crucial to leukemia cell proliferation and induce apoptosis.","['Sweeney, Shannon R', 'Collins, Meghan', 'Pandey, Renu', 'Chiou, Jennifer', 'Lodi, Alessia', 'Tiziani, Stefano']","['Sweeney SR', 'Collins M', 'Pandey R', 'Chiou J', 'Lodi A', 'Tiziani S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Oncology, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Oncology, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Oncology, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Oncology, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Oncology, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Oncology, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Institute for Cell and Molecular Biology, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.', 'Department of Nutritional Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200206,United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (LC-1 compound)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Citric Acid Cycle/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways/drug effects', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.23163 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2020 Apr;59(4):399-411. doi: 10.1002/mc.23163.

Phenytoin has been widely used but its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profile makes its use complicated. Levetiracetam is a safe, effective and well tolerated antiseizure drug with good results in epileptic patients. Objective To describe our experience using oral (p.o) levetiracetam 1000 mg every 12 h (q12h) as an antiseizure prophylaxis, evaluating its preventive effects and adverse event rates after a high-dose of intravenous (i.v.) busulfan, as part of the conditioning regimen Methods Retrospective study of patients who underwent an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant with a conditioning regimen based on high-dose of busulfan between January and November 2017. Results The study population comprised 36 patients, of whom 18 (50%) had acute myeloid leukemia as diagnosis. No seizures occurred in any patient. Levetiracetam was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions Our results suggest that giving levetiracetam at 1000 mg q12h p.o starting 12 h before the administration of i.v. busulfan until 48 h after the last dose, can be used as an alternative in the prevention of busulfan-induced seizures in adults.","['Chaguaceda, Cristian', 'Aguilera-Jimenez, Veronica', 'Gutierrez, Gonzalo', 'Roura, Judit', 'Riu, Gisela']","['Chaguaceda C', 'Aguilera-Jimenez V', 'Gutierrez G', 'Roura J', 'Riu G']","['Pharmacy Department, Hospital Clinic Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. cristianchaguaceda@gmail.com.', 'Pharmacy Department, Consorci Sanitari de Terrassa, Catalonia, Spain. cristianchaguaceda@gmail.com.', 'Pharmacy Department, Consorci Sanitari del Maresme, Mataro, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pharmacy Department, Hospital Clinic Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Pharmacy Department, Hospital Clinic Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200206,Netherlands,Int J Clin Pharm,International journal of clinical pharmacy,101554912,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '44YRR34555 (Levetiracetam)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anticonvulsants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Busulfan/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Levetiracetam/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seizures/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/02/07 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11096-020-00977-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11096-020-00977-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharm. 2020 Apr;42(2):351-354. doi: 10.1007/s11096-020-00977-7.

Chemotherapy with cytotoxic agents is the standard of care, but is associated with a high rate of adverse events. Elderly patients are frequently intolerant to such treatment, presenting a very poor prognosis. The hypomethylating agents (HMA) azacitidine or decitabine represent one of the main therapeutic alternatives for these patients. Isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors (IDH) constitute another therapeutic class with DNA methylation effects in AML. In this article, we review the use of first- and second-generation HMA and IDH inhibitors in AML. The data collected demonstrated that HMA are generally considered effective and safe for AML patients who are not eligible for standard chemotherapy. The combination of azacitidine or decitabine with venetoclax was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for older AML patients and those unfit for intense chemotherapy. IDH inhibitors also showed encouraging results for relapsed/refractory AML patients harboring an IDH mutation and received FDA approval. Therefore, recent studies have led to the emergence of new therapeutic options using HMA and IDH inhibitors for specific groups of AML patients, representing an important step in the treatment of this aggressive malignancy. New options should emerge from the ongoing studies in the coming years.","['Contieri, Bruna', 'Duarte, Bruno Kosa Lino', 'Lazarini, Mariana']","['Contieri B', 'Duarte BKL', 'Lazarini M']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Nicolau Street, 210, Diadema, CEP 09961-400, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Blood Transfusion Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Nicolau Street, 210, Diadema, CEP 09961-400, Brazil. lazarini@unifesp.br.', 'Hematology and Blood Transfusion Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. lazarini@unifesp.br.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200206,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Meta-Analysis as Topic', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-020-03938-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-020-03938-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):693-701. doi: 10.1007/s00277-020-03938-2.

Prior to the development of CAR-T, the only potential cure for patients with relapsed or refractory (RR) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Several CAR-T cell products have been studied in prospective clinical trials which ultimately have resulted in the approval of one anti-CD19 CAR-T cell product in pediatric RR ALL: tisagenlecleucel (CD3zeta and 41BB). While some patients achieve durable responses with CAR-T, lack of response and relapse remains clinical challenges. Reasons for sub-optimal response include lack of CAR-T cell persistence and target antigen down-regulation. Future CARs are under development to improve long-term persistence and to be able to overcome resistance mechanisms associated with the disease and the hostile tumor microenvironment. With evolving understanding about CARs and new constructs under investigation, there is optimism that future products will improve the safety and efficacy from the current standard of care.","['Badar, Talha', 'Shah, Nirav N']","['Badar T', 'Shah NN']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, 9200 W.

Here we give an overview of novel targeted agents used in therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as efforts to overcome resistance development, focusing on approved drugs since they gained high relevance in clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS: Novel agents moved to the forefront as a treatment strategy of CLL due to their outstanding efficacy, almost irrespectively of the underlying genetic features. Inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a key molecule in the B cell receptor pathway, achieved dramatic efficacy even in poor-risk and chemo-refractory patients. Further success was accomplished with venetoclax, which specifically inhibits anti-apoptotic BCL2 and induces apoptosis of CLL cells. Inhibition of BTK or BCL2 is very effective and induces prolongation of progression-free and overall survival. Approved combination treatments such as venetoclax or ibrutinib with obinutuzumab show high responses rates and long remission durations. However, evolution and selection of subclones with continuous treatment leads to resistance towards these novel drugs and disease relapse. Hence, comparison of sequential treatment with combinations and discontinuation of therapy are important aspects which need to be investigated.","['Scheffold, Annika', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan']","['Scheffold A', 'Stilgenbauer S']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Albert-Einstein Allee 23, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Albert-Einstein Allee 23, D-89081, Ulm, Germany.

METHODS: In this population-based case-control study of Danish children aged < 17 years old, 5078 childhood cancer cases diagnosed 1968-2016 were matched to cancer-free controls by birth year and sex (n = 123,228). Occupational livestock or animal dust exposure was identified using a job-exposure matrix. We employed multivariable conditional logistic regression models to estimate associations with offspring cancer for births 1968-2016 and 1989-2016, with the latter timeframe reflecting a period of presumed higher exposure due to changes in Danish farming practices. Sensitivity analyses considered place of birth (urban areas vs. rural areas and small towns). RESULTS: For births 1968-2016, paternal exposure from offspring birth to cancer diagnosis was associated with central nervous system tumors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.63) and germ cell tumors (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.05-3.27), while maternal pregnancy exposure was associated with astrocytoma (OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.00-3.57). For births 1989-2016, paternal exposure from offspring birth to cancer diagnosis was negatively associated with acute lymphoid leukemia (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.33-1.00). For births in rural areas only, maternal exposure from offspring birth to cancer diagnosis was positively associated with acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.09-4.29). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that paternal occupational animal exposure is associated with offspring germ cell tumors, and maternal pregnancy exposure with astrocytomas. Our results are mixed with respect to leukemia subtypes.","['Hall, Clinton', 'Hansen, Johnni', 'von Ehrenstein, Ondine S', 'He, Di', 'Olsen, Jorn', 'Ritz, Beate', 'Heck, Julia E']","['Hall C', 'Hansen J', 'von Ehrenstein OS', 'He D', 'Olsen J', 'Ritz B', 'Heck JE']","['Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA. jeheck@ucla.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200205,Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,"['0 (Dust)', '0 (Particulate Matter)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', '*Dust', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Livestock', 'Male', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Particulate Matter/adverse effects', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/03/16 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00420-020-01524-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s00420-020-01524-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2020 Jul;93(5):659-668. doi: 10.1007/s00420-020-01524-7.

However, we found that PRMT5 inhibition or depletion led to more genes being downregulated than upregulated, indicating that PRMT5 can also act as a transcriptional activator. Indeed, the global level of histone H3K27me3 increases in PRMT5 deficient cells. Although PRMT5 does not directly affect PRC2 enzymatic activity, methylation of histone H3 by PRMT5 abrogates its subsequent methylation by PRC2. Treating AML cells with an EZH2 inhibitor partially restored the expression of approximately 50% of the genes that are initially downregulated by PRMT5 inhibition, suggesting that the increased H3K27me3 could directly or indirectly contribute to the transcription repression of these genes. Indeed, ChIP-sequencing analysis confirmed an increase in the H3K27me3 level at the promoter region of a quarter of these genes in PRMT5-inhibited cells. Interestingly, the anti-proliferative effect of PRMT5 inhibition was also partially rescued by treatment with an EZH2 inhibitor in several leukemia cell lines. Thus, PRMT5-mediated crosstalk between histone marks contributes to its functional effects.","['Liu, Fan', 'Xu, Ye', 'Lu, Xiaoqing', 'Hamard, Pierre-Jacques', 'Karl, Daniel L', 'Man, Na', 'Mookhtiar, Adnan K', 'Martinez, Concepcion', 'Lossos, Izidore S', 'Sun, Jun', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Liu F', 'Xu Y', 'Lu X', 'Hamard PJ', 'Karl DL', 'Man N', 'Mookhtiar AK', 'Martinez C', 'Lossos IS', 'Sun J', 'Nimer SD']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Human Genetics, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Polycomb-Group Proteins)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Prmt5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.319 (Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Polycomb-Group Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein-Arginine N-Methyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['5728491 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkaa065 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2020 Apr 6;48(6):2956-2968. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkaa065.,,"['R01 CA166835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA240139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['(c) The Author(s) 2020.

Although ibrutinib is known to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cell growth in vitro, its impact on the treatment and metastasis of breast cancer is unclear. METHODS: Using an orthotopic mouse breast cancer model, we show that ibrutinib inhibits the progression and metastasis of breast cancer. RESULTS: Ibrutinib inhibited proliferation of cancer cells in vitro, and Ibrutinib-treated mice displayed significantly lower tumour burdens and metastasis compared to controls. Furthermore, the spleens and tumours from Ibrutinib-treated mice contained more mature DCs and lower numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which promote disease progression and are linked to poor prognosis. We also confirmed that ex vivo treatment of MDSCs with ibrutinib switched their phenotype to mature DCs and significantly enhanced MHCII expression. Further, ibrutinib treatment promoted T cell proliferation and effector functions leading to the induction of antitumour TH1 and CTL immune responses. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib inhibits tumour development and metastasis in breast cancer by promoting the development of mature DCs from MDSCs and hence could be a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of breast cancer.","['Varikuti, Sanjay', 'Singh, Bhawana', 'Volpedo, Greta', 'Ahirwar, Dinesh K', 'Jha, Bijay K', 'Saljoughian, Noushin', 'Viana, Agostinho G', 'Verma, Chaitenya', 'Hamza, Omar', 'Halsey, Gregory', 'Holcomb, Erin A', 'Maryala, Ritvik J', 'Oghumu, Steve', 'Ganju, Ramesh K', 'Satoskar, Abhay R']","['Varikuti S', 'Singh B', 'Volpedo G', 'Ahirwar DK', 'Jha BK', 'Saljoughian N', 'Viana AG', 'Verma C', 'Hamza O', 'Halsey G', 'Holcomb EA', 'Maryala RJ', 'Oghumu S', 'Ganju RK', 'Satoskar AR']","['Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH, USA. abhay.satoskar@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. abhay.satoskar@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200206,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Dendritic Cells/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/01/16 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-0743-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-0743-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2020 Mar;122(7):1005-1013. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0743-8.

In this paper we demonstrate that CDC25A level is controlled by a complex STAT5/miR-16 transcription and translation pathway working downstream of this receptor. First, we established by CHIP analysis that STAT5 is directly involved in FLT3-ITD-dependent CDC25A gene transcription. In addition, we determined that miR-16 expression is repressed by FLT3-ITD activity, and that STAT5 participates in this repression. In accordance with these results, miR-16 expression was significantly reduced in a panel of AML primary samples carrying the FLT3-ITD mutation when compared with FLT3wt cells. The expression of a miR-16 mimic reduced CDC25A protein and mRNA levels, and RNA interference-mediated down modulation of miR-16 restored CDC25A expression in response to FLT3-ITD inhibition. Finally, decreasing miR-16 expression partially restored the proliferation of cells treated with the FLT3 inhibitor AC220, while the expression of miR-16 mimic stopped this proliferation and induced monocytic differentiation of AML cells. In summary, we identified a FLT3-ITD/STAT5/miR-16/CDC25A axis essential for AML cell proliferation and differentiation.","['Sueur, Gabrielle', 'Boutet, Alison', 'Gotanegre, Mathilde', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Besson, Arnaud', 'Manenti, Stephane', 'Bertoli, Sarah']","['Sueur G', 'Boutet A', 'Gotanegre M', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Besson A', 'Manenti S', 'Bertoli S']","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe labellisee La Ligue contre le Cancer 2016, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe labellisee La Ligue contre le Cancer 2016, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Equipe labellisee La Ligue contre le Cancer 2016, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France."", 'Universite Toulouse III Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire du Controle de la Proliferation, Centre de Biologie Integrative, Universite de Toulouse, UPS and CNRS, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France. stephane.manenti@inserm.fr.', 'Equipe labellisee La Ligue contre le Cancer 2016, Toulouse, France. stephane.manenti@inserm.fr.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, CNRS ERL5294, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.

We demonstrate vast changes in clonality that both progress and reverse over time, and define five patterns of clonal dynamics: Monoclonal, Stable, Loss, Expansion and Burst. We also show that subclonal expansion in vivo correlates with a more adverse prognosis. Furthermore, clonal expansion enabled detection of very rare clones with AML driver mutations that were undetectable by sequencing at diagnosis, demonstrating that the vast majority of AML cases harbor multiple clones already at diagnosis. Finally, the rise and fall of related clones enabled deconstruction of the complex evolutionary hierarchies of the clones that compete to shape AML over time.","['Sanden, Carl', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Orsmark Pietras, Christina', 'Henningsson, Rasmus', 'Saba, Karim H', 'Landberg, Niklas', 'Thorsson, Hanna', 'von Palffy, Sofia', 'Pena-Martinez, Pablo', 'Hogberg, Carl', 'Rissler, Marianne', 'Gisselsson, David', 'Lazarevic, Vladimir', 'Juliusson, Gunnar', 'Agerstam, Helena', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Sanden C', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Orsmark Pietras C', 'Henningsson R', 'Saba KH', 'Landberg N', 'Thorsson H', 'von Palffy S', 'Pena-Martinez P', 'Hogberg C', 'Rissler M', 'Gisselsson D', 'Lazarevic V', 'Juliusson G', 'Agerstam H', 'Fioretos T']","['Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. carl.sanden@med.lu.se.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Radiation Physics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. thoas.fioretos@med.lu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200205,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-14106-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-14106-0 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 5;11(1):579. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-14106-0.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8931-9565', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8703-1173', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4946-6488', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6752-6507', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5640-4037', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0789-6431', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0301-426X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1782-4423']",,,PMC7002407,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these methods require large cohorts and underperform for low recurrence. Recently, ultra-deep sequencing has enabled accurate measurement of VAFs (variant-allele frequencies) for mutations, allowing the determination of evolutionary trajectories. Here, based solely on the VAF spectrum for an individual sample, we report on a method that identifies drivers and quantifies tumor growth. Drivers introduce perturbations into the spectrum, and our method uses the frequency of hitchhiking mutations preceding a driver to measure this. As validation, we use simulation models and 993 tumors from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium with previously identified drivers. Then we apply our method to an ultra-deep sequenced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumor and identify known cancer genes and additional driver candidates. In summary, our framework presents opportunities for personalized driver diagnosis using sequencing data from a single individual.","['Salichos, Leonidas', 'Meyerson, William', 'Warrell, Jonathan', 'Gerstein, Mark']","['Salichos L', 'Meyerson W', 'Warrell J', 'Gerstein M']","['Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA. pi@gersteinlab.org.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA. pi@gersteinlab.org.', 'Department of Computer Science, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA. pi@gersteinlab.org.', 'Center for Biomedical Data Science, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA. pi@gersteinlab.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200205,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', '*Models, Genetic', '*Mutation', 'Mutation Rate', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Oncogenes', 'Precision Medicine', 'Stochastic Processes']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/05/13 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-020-14407-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-020-14407-9 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2020 Feb 5;11(1):732. doi: 10.1038/s41467-020-14407-9.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0228-6885', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1323-4602', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9746-3719']","['R01 HG008126/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007205/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HG 008126/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | National', 'Institutes of Health (NIH)/International']",,PMC7002450,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATLL patients with aggressive subtypes have dismal outcomes. We demonstrate that ATLL cells co-opt an early checkpoint within the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) pathway, resulting in survival advantage. This early checkpoint revolves around an interaction between the deubiquitinase CYLD and its target RIPK1. The status of RIPK1 K63-ubiquitination determines cell fate by creating either a prosurvival signal (ubiquitinated RIPK1) or a death signal (deubiquitinated RIPK1). In primary ATLL samples and in cell line models, an increased baseline level of CYLD phosphorylation was observed. We therefore tested the hypothesis that this modification of CYLD, which has been reported to inhibit its deubiquitinating function, leads to increased RIPK1 ubiquitination and thus provides a prosurvival signal to ATLL cells. CYLD phosphorylation can be pharmacologically reversed by IKK inhibitors, specifically by TBK1/IKKepsilon and IKKbeta inhibitors (MRT67307 and TPCA). Both of the IKK sub-families can phosphorylate CYLD, and the combination of MRT67307 and TPCA have a marked effect in reducing CYLD phosphorylation and triggering cell death. ATLL cells overexpressing a kinase-inactive TBK1 (TBK1-K38A) demonstrate lower CYLD phosphorylation and subsequently reduced proliferation. IKK blockade reactivates CYLD, as evidenced by the reduction in RIPK1 ubiquitination, which leads to the association of RIPK1 with the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) to trigger cell death. In the absence of CYLD, RIPK1 ubiquitination remains elevated following IKK blockade and it does not associate with the DISC. SMAC mimetics can similarly disrupt CYLD phosphorylation and lead to ATLL cell death through reduction of RIPK1 ubiquitination, which is CYLD dependent. These results identify CYLD as a crucial regulator of ATLL survival and point to its role as a potential novel target for pharmacologic modification in this disease.","['Xu, Xin', 'Kalac, Matko', 'Markson, Michael', 'Chan, Mark', 'Brody, Joshua D', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Ang, Rosalind L', 'Legarda, Diana', 'Justus, Scott J', 'Liu, Feng', 'Li, Qingshan', 'Xiong, Huabao', 'Ting, Adrian T']","['Xu X', 'Kalac M', 'Markson M', 'Chan M', 'Brody JD', 'Bhagat G', 'Ang RL', 'Legarda D', 'Justus SJ', 'Liu F', 'Li Q', 'Xiong H', 'Ting AT']","['Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', ""Department of Geriatrics, Hematology & Oncology Ward, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, GuangDong, 510180, People's Republic of China."", 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY, 10032, USA.', 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', ""Department of Geriatrics, Hematology & Oncology Ward, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, GuangDong, 510180, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangzhou First People's Hospital, School of Medicine, South China University of Technology, GuangDong, 510180, People's Republic of China."", 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA.', 'Precision Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA. ting.adrian@mayo.edu.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, 10029, USA. ting.adrian@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, 55905, USA. ting.adrian@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200205,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '0 (TNFRSF1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (CYLD protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Death Domain Receptor Signaling Adaptor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Deubiquitinating Enzyme CYLD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitination']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/03/10 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2294-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2294-6 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Feb 5;11(2):94. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2294-6.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0850-6730', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6250-048X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0653-9923']","['P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052417/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI126036/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC7002447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple extracellular receptors and internal signaling nodes tightly regulate NK activation. Cyclin-dependent kinases of the mediator complex (CDK8 and CDK19) were described as a signaling intermediates in NK cells. Here, we report for the first time the development and use of CDK8/19 inhibitors to suppress phosphorylation of STAT1(S727) in NK cells and to augment the production of the cytolytic molecules perforin and granzyme B (GZMB). Functionally, this resulted in enhanced NK-cell-mediated lysis of primary leukemia cells. Treatment with the CDK8/19 inhibitor BI-1347 increased the response rate and survival of mice bearing melanoma and breast cancer xenografts. In addition, CDK8/19 inhibition augmented the antitumoral activity of anti-PD-1 antibody and SMAC mimetic therapy, both agents that promote T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Treatment with the SMAC mimetic compound BI-8382 resulted in an increased number of NK cells infiltrating EMT6 tumors. Combination of the CDK8/19 inhibitor BI-1347, which augments the amount of degranulation enzymes, with the SMAC mimetic BI-8382 resulted in increased survival of mice carrying the EMT6 breast cancer model. The observed survival benefit was dependent on an intermittent treatment schedule of BI-1347, suggesting the importance of circumventing a hyporesponsive state of NK cells. These results suggest that CDK8/19 inhibitors can be combined with modulators of the adaptive immune system to inhibit the growth of solid tumors, independent of their activity on cancer cells, but rather through promoting NK-cell function.","['Hofmann, Marco H', 'Mani, Rajeswaran', 'Engelhardt, Harald', 'Impagnatiello, Maria A', 'Carotta, Sebastian', 'Kerenyi, Marc', 'Lorenzo-Herrero, Seila', 'Bottcher, Jark', 'Scharn, Dirk', 'Arnhof, Heribert', 'Zoephel, Andreas', 'Schnitzer, Renate', 'Gerstberger, Thomas', 'Sanderson, Michael P', 'Rajgolikar, Girish', 'Goswami, Swagata', 'Vasu, Sumithira', 'Ettmayer, Peter', 'Gonzalez, Segundo', 'Pearson, Mark', 'McConnell, Darryl B', 'Kraut, Norbert', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Moll, Jurgen']","['Hofmann MH', 'Mani R', 'Engelhardt H', 'Impagnatiello MA', 'Carotta S', 'Kerenyi M', 'Lorenzo-Herrero S', 'Bottcher J', 'Scharn D', 'Arnhof H', 'Zoephel A', 'Schnitzer R', 'Gerstberger T', 'Sanderson MP', 'Rajgolikar G', 'Goswami S', 'Vasu S', 'Ettmayer P', 'Gonzalez S', 'Pearson M', 'McConnell DB', 'Kraut N', 'Muthusamy N', 'Moll J']","['Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria. marco.hofmann@boehringer-ingelheim.com.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria del Principado de Asturias (IISPA), IUOPA, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Functional Biology, Universidad de Oviedo, Instituto de Investigacion Biosanitaria del Principado de Asturias (IISPA), IUOPA, Oviedo, Spain.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200205,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK19 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK8 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/04/07 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-19-0789 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0789 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2020 Apr;19(4):1018-1030. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-19-0789.

To explore regulatory mechanisms, we developed a monoclonal antibody that selectively recognizes the phosphorylated form of Ser(484) (pS(484)) in kindlin-3. Activation of platelets, HEL megakaryocytic-like cells and BT549 breast cancer cells led to enhanced expression of pS(484) as assessed by immunofluorescence or Western blotting. In platelets, pS(484) rose rapidly and transiently upon stimulation. When a mutant form of kindlin-3, T(482)S(484)/AA kindlin-3, was transduced into mouse megakaryocytes, it failed to support activation of integrin alphaIIbbeta3, whereas wild-type kindlin-3 did. In MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells, expression of T(482)S(484)/AA kindlin-3 suppressed cell spreading, migration, invasion, and VEGF production. Wild-type kindlin-3 expressing cells markedly increased tumor growth in vivo, whereas T(482)S(484)/AA kindlin-3 significantly blunted tumor progression. Thus, our data establish that a unique phosphorylation event in kindlin-3 regulates its cellular functions.","['Bialkowska, Katarzyna', 'Sossey-Alaoui, Khalid', 'Pluskota, Elzbieta', 'Izem, Lahoucine', 'Qin, Jun', 'Plow, Edward F']","['Bialkowska K', 'Sossey-Alaoui K', 'Pluskota E', 'Izem L', 'Qin J', 'Plow EF']","['Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Sciences, Lerner Research Institute Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA plowe@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200205,United States,Life Sci Alliance,Life science alliance,101728869,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (FERMT3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (kindlin-3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', 'Breast Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cricetulus', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta Chains/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/metabolism']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3/3/e201900594 [pii]', '10.26508/lsa.201900594 [doi]']",epublish,Life Sci Alliance. 2020 Feb 5;3(3). pii: 3/3/e201900594. doi: 10.26508/lsa.201900594.

It was previously demonstrated that chronic IL-1beta exposure severely impaired hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal capability in mice and promoted leukemia cell growth in primary AML cells. However, the role of IL-1beta in the murine bone marrow (BM) niche remains unclear. Here, we explored the role of IL-1beta in the BM niche in Il-1r1(-/-) mice, chronic IL-1beta exposure mice and mixed lineage leukemia-AF9 fusion gene (MLL-AF9)-induced AML mice models. We demonstrated that IL-1R1 deficiency did not affect the function of HSCs or niche cells under steady-state conditions or during transplantation. Chronic exposure to IL-1beta decreased the expansion of Il-1r1(-/-) hematopoietic cells in Il-1r1(+/+) recipient mice. These results indicated that IL-1beta exposure impaired the ability of niche cells to support hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, we revealed that IL-1R1 deficiency in niche cells prolonged the survival of MLL-AF9-induced AML mice. The results of our study suggest that inhibition of the IL-1beta/IL-1R1 signaling pathway in the niche might be a non-cell-autonomous therapy strategy for AML.","['Wang, Yuxia', 'Sun, Xiaolu', 'Yuan, Shengnan', 'Hou, Shuaibing', 'Guo, Tengxiao', 'Chu, Yajing', 'Pang, Tianxiang', 'Luo, Hongbo R', 'Yuan, Weiping', 'Wang, Xiaomin']","['Wang Y', 'Sun X', 'Yuan S', 'Hou S', 'Guo T', 'Chu Y', 'Pang T', 'Luo HR', 'Yuan W', 'Wang X']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China; Department of Anesthesiology, Beijing Hospital, National Center of Gerontology, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematological Disorders, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.

This has thus expedited the search for alternativ therapies, and one of these is the exploitation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) towards control of tumor cells. The present study investigated the effect of human umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) on the proliferation of leukemic cells and gauged the transcriptomic modulation and the signaling pathways potentially affected by UC-MSCs. The inhibition of growth of leukemic tumor cell lines was assessed by proliferation assays, apoptosis and cell cycle analysis. BV173 and HL-60 cells were further analyzed using microarray gene expression profiling. The microarray results were validated by RT-qPCR and western blot assay for the corresponding expression of genes and proteins. The UC-MSCs attenuated leukemic cell viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner without inducing apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that the growth of tumor cells was arrested at the G0/G1 phase. The microarray results identified that HL-60 and BV173 share 35 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (same expression direction) in the presence of UC-MSCs. In silico analysis of these selected DEGs indicated a significant influence in the cell cycle and cell cycle-related biological processes and signaling pathways. Among these, the expression of DBF4, MDM2, CCNE2, CDK6, CDKN1A, and CDKN2A was implicated in six different signaling pathways that play a pivotal role in the anti-tumorigenic activity exerted by UC-MSCs. The UC-MSCs perturbate the cell cycle process of leukemic cells via dysregulation of tumor suppressor and oncogene expression.","['Sarmadi, Vahid Hosseinpour', 'Ahmadloo, Salma', 'Boroojerdi, Mohadese Hashem', 'John, Cini Mathew', 'Al-Graitte, Satar Jabbar Rahi', 'Lawal, Hamza', 'Maqbool, Maryam', 'Hwa, Ling King', 'Ramasamy, Rajesh']","['Sarmadi VH', 'Ahmadloo S', 'Boroojerdi MH', 'John CM', 'Al-Graitte SJR', 'Lawal H', 'Maqbool M', 'Hwa LK', 'Ramasamy R']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stem Cell & Immunity Research Group, Immunology Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Genetics Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stem Cell & Immunity Research Group, Immunology Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stem Cell & Immunity Research Group, Immunology Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Kerbala, Kerbala City, Iraq.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stem Cell & Immunity Research Group, Immunology Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Bauchi State University, Gadau, Itas-Gadau LGA, Bauchi State 751105 Nigeria.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stem Cell & Immunity Research Group, Immunology Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Medical Genetics Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stem Cell & Immunity Research Group, Immunology Laboratory, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Transplant,Cell transplantation,9208854,,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Ontology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Umbilical Cord/cytology']",2020/02/07 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0963689719885077 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Transplant. 2020 Jan-Dec;29:963689719885077. doi: 10.1177/0963689719885077.,['ORCID: 0000-0003-4227-0458'],,,PMC7444238,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cell cycle', '*gene expression profiling', '*leukemia', '*mesenchymal stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: To identify the support vital for a successful transition, we evaluated the parents' needs and the challenges they face when their children return to school. METHODS: This multi-institutional study was conducted by the Korean Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology. The written survey comprised 24 questions and was completed by 210 parents without an interviewer. RESULTS: Most parents (165 of 206) reported that their children experienced difficulties with physical status (n=60), peer relationships (n=30), academic performance (n=27), emotional/behavioral issues (n=11), and relationships with teachers (n=4) on reentering school. Parents wanted to be kept informed about and remain involved in their children's school lives and reported good parent-teacher communication (88 of 209, 42.1%). Parents reported that 83.1% and 44.9% of teachers and peers, respectively, displayed an adequate understanding of their children's condition. Most parents (197 of 208) answered that a special program is necessary to facilitate return to school after cancer therapy that offers emotional support (n=85), facilitates social adaptation (n=61), and provides tutoring to accelerate catch up (n=56), and continued health care by hospital outreach and school personnel (n=50). CONCLUSION: In addition to scholastic aptitude-oriented programs, emotional and psychosocial support is necessary for a successful return to school. Pediatric oncologists should actively improve oncology practices to better integrate individualized school plans and educate peers and teachers to improve health literacy to aid them in understanding the needs of children with cancer.","['Lee, Jun Ah', 'Lee, Jae Min', 'Park, Hyeon Jin', 'Park, Meerim', 'Park, Byung Kiu', 'Ju, Hee Young', 'Kim, Ji Yoon', 'Park, Sang Kyu', 'Lee, Young Ho', 'Shim, Ye Jee', 'Kim, Heung Sik', 'Park, Kyung Duk', 'Lim, Yeon-Jung', 'Chueh, Hee Won', 'Park, Ji Kyoung', 'Kim, Soon Ki', 'Choi, Hyoung Soo', 'Ahn, Hyo Seop', 'Hah, Jeong Ok', 'Kang, Hyoung Jin', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Lee, Mee Jeong']","['Lee JA', 'Lee JM', 'Park HJ', 'Park M', 'Park BK', 'Ju HY', 'Kim JY', 'Park SK', 'Lee YH', 'Shim YJ', 'Kim HS', 'Park KD', 'Lim YJ', 'Chueh HW', 'Park JK', 'Kim SK', 'Choi HS', 'Ahn HS', 'Hah JO', 'Kang HJ', 'Shin HY', 'Lee MJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Center for Pediatric Cancer, National Cancer Center, Goyang, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kyungpook National University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hanyang University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chonbuk National University Hospital, Jeonju, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Chungnam National University College of Medicine, Daejeon, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dong-A University College of Medicine, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Inje University Busan Paik Hospital, Busan, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Inha University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Daegu Fatima Hospital, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dankook University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20191114,Korea (South),Clin Exp Pediatr,Clinical and experimental pediatrics,101761234,,,,2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/07 06:01,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:01 [medline]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['kjp.2019.00696 [pii]', '10.3345/kjp.2019.00696 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Pediatr. 2020 Apr;63(4):141-145. doi: 10.3345/kjp.2019.00696.

It also focuses on the photodynamic detection (PDD) of hematopoietic malignancies and the recent progress of 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT/PDD, which can efficiently induce ATL leukemic cell-specific death with minor influence on normal lymphocytes. Further consideration of the ALA-PDT/PDD system along with the circulatory system regarding the clinical application in ATL and others will be discussed. ALA-PDT/PDD can be promising as a novel treatment modality that overcomes unmet medical needs with the optimization of PDT parameters to increase the effectiveness of the tumor-killing activity and enhance the innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses by the optimized immunogenic cell death.","['Oka, Takashi', 'Matsuoka, Ken-Ichi', 'Utsunomiya, Atae']","['Oka T', 'Matsuoka KI', 'Utsunomiya A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology & Respiratory Med., Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology & Respiratory Med., Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura General Hospital, Kagoshima 890-0064, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200202,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/07 06:01,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12020335 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12020335 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Feb 2;12(2). pii: cancers12020335. doi: 10.3390/cancers12020335.,,"['grant no. 22590312 and 25460437/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', 'grant no. 19ck0106254h0003/Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development']",,PMC7072618,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALA-PDT/PDD', 'ATL', 'GVHD', 'HTLV-1', 'PDD', 'PDT', 'allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'chemotherapy', 'immunotherapy']",,,"['T.O. declares research funding from Otsuka Medical Devices Co., Ltd., Japan.

The purpose of this study was the synthesis of potent GPx mimics with antioxidant and anticancer activity along with improved bioavailability, as a result of good solubility in protic solvents. As a result of our research, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimetics in the form of water-soluble benzeneseleninic acid salts were obtained. The procedure was based on the synthesis of 2-(N-alkylcarboxyamido)benzeneselenenic acids, through the oxidation of benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-ones or analogous arenediselenides with an amido group, which were further converted to corresponding potassium salts by the treatment with potassium tert-butanolate. All derivatives were tested as potential antioxidants and anticancer agents. The areneseleninic acid salts were significantly better peroxide scavengers than analogous acids and the well-known organoselenium antioxidant ebselen. The highest activity was observed for the 2-(N-ethylcarboxyamido)benzeneselenenic acid potassium salt. The strongest cytotoxic effect against breast cancer (MCF-7) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell lines was found for 2-(N-cyclohexylcarboxyamido)benzeneselenenic acid potassium salt and the 2-(N-ethylcarboxyamido)benzeneselenenic acid, respectively. The structure-activity correlations, including the differences in reactivity of benzeneseleninic acids and corresponding salts were evaluated.","['Obieziurska, Magdalena', 'Pacula, Agata J', 'Laskowska, Anna', 'Dlugosz-Pokorska, Angelika', 'Janecka, Anna', 'Scianowski, Jacek']","['Obieziurska M', 'Pacula AJ', 'Laskowska A', 'Dlugosz-Pokorska A', 'Janecka A', 'Scianowski J']","['Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University, 7 Gagarin Street, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University, 7 Gagarin Street, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University, 7 Gagarin Street, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University, 7 Gagarin Street, 87-100 Torun, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200202,Switzerland,Materials (Basel),"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",101555929,,,,2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/07 06:01,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:01 [medline]']","['ma13030661 [pii]', '10.3390/ma13030661 [doi]']",epublish,Materials (Basel). 2020 Feb 2;13(3). pii: ma13030661. doi: 10.3390/ma13030661.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-3868-2022'],['2019/03/X/ST4/00121/Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],,PMC7040810,,['NOTNLM'],"['amphiphilic compounds', 'antioxidant activity', 'antiproliferative activity', 'areneseleninic acid salts', 'areneseleninic acids']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PTP4A3 is overexpressed in leukemia cells and is related to cell proliferation. We previously found that HIF-1alpha was involved in benzene toxicity and PTP4A3 may be the target gene of HIF-1alpha via ChIP-seq. The aim of this study is to confirm the relationship between HIF-1alpha and PTP4A3 in benzene toxicity, as well as the function of PTP4A3 on cell toxicity induced by 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ). Our results indicate that HIF-1alpha could regulate PTP4A3 with in vivo and in vitro experiments. A cell line with suppressed PTP4A3 was established to investigate the function of PTP4A3 in 1,4-BQ toxicity in vitro. The results revealed that cell proliferation inhibition was more aggravated in PTP4A3 low-expression cells than in the control cells after 1,4-BQ treatment. The relative oxygen species (ROS) significantly increased in cells with inhibited PTP4A3, while the rise was inferior to the control cells at the 20 muM 1,4-BQ group. An increase in DNA damage was seen in PTP4A3 down-regulated cells at the 10 muM 1,4-BQ group, whereas the results reversed at the concentration of 20 muM. Moreover, the apoptosis rate increased higher in down-regulated PTP4A3 cells after 1,4-BQ exposure. In addition, PI3K/AKT pathway was significantly restrained in cells with inhibited PTP4A3 after 1,4-BQ treatment. Our results indicate that HIF-1alpha may regulate PTP4A3 to be involved in benzene toxicity. Inhibition of PTP4A3 could aggravate cell proliferation suppression and apoptosis by regulating PI3K/AKT pathway after 1,4-BQ treatment.","['Pu, Yunqiu', 'Sun, Fengxia', 'Sun, Rongli', 'Man, Zhaodi', 'Ji, Shuangbin', 'Xu, Kai', 'Yin, Lihong', 'Zhang, Juan', 'Pu, Yuepu']","['Pu Y', 'Sun F', 'Sun R', 'Man Z', 'Ji S', 'Xu K', 'Yin L', 'Zhang J', 'Pu Y']","['Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Environmental Medicine Engineering, Ministry of Education, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200201,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTP4A3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Benzene/toxicity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', '*Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph17030910 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph17030910 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2020 Feb 1;17(3). pii: ijerph17030910. doi: 10.3390/ijerph17030910.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-4974-4540'],,,PMC7037067,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Benzene', '*Cell proliferation', '*HIF-1alpha', '*PTP4A3']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently detected the expression of KIR2DL4 in human cultured mast cells established from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (PB-mast), in the human mast cell line LAD2, and in human tissue mast cells. Agonistic antibodies against KIR2DL4 negatively regulate the KIT-mediated and FcvarepsilonRI-mediated responses of PB-mast and LAD2 cells. In addition, agonistic antibodies and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G, a natural ligand for KIR2DL4, induce the secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor and serine proteases from human mast cells, which have been implicated in pregnancy establishment and cancer metastasis. Therefore, KIR2DL4 stimulation with agonistic antibodies and recombinant HLA-G protein may enhance both processes, in addition to suppressing mast-cell-mediated allergic reactions.","['Kataoka, Tatsuki R', 'Ueshima, Chiyuki', 'Hirata, Masahiro', 'Minamiguchi, Sachiko', 'Haga, Hironori']","['Kataoka TR', 'Ueshima C', 'Hirata M', 'Minamiguchi S', 'Haga H']","['Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200131,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (KIR2DL4 protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL4)', 'EC 3.4.- (Serine Proteases)']",IM,"['Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HLA-G Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Receptors, KIR2DL4/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Serine Proteases/metabolism']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2019/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms21030954 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms21030954 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2020 Jan 31;21(3). pii: ijms21030954. doi: 10.3390/ijms21030954.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-9211-0511'],"['23590437, 15K08362, 16K19080, 18K07014, and 19K16556/Japan Society for the', 'Promotion of Science']",,PMC7037260,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD158d', 'FcvarepsilonRI', 'KIR2DL4', 'KIT', 'allergic reaction', 'mast cell', 'pregnancy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breast cancer cells produce and encounter autocrine and paracrine cytokine signals in the bone microenvironment, which can influence their behavior in multiple ways. For example, these signals can promote the survival and dormancy of bone-disseminated cancer cells or stimulate proliferation. The interleukin-6 (IL-6) cytokine family, defined by its use of the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) co-receptor, includes interleukin-11 (IL-11), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), among others. These cytokines are known to have overlapping pleiotropic functions in different cell types and are important for cross-talk between bone-resident cells. IL-6 cytokines have also been implicated in the progression and metastasis of breast, prostate, lung, and cervical cancer, highlighting the importance of these cytokines in the tumor-bone microenvironment.

Methods: A total of 55 cases of acute leukemia (AL) at the myelosuppression phase after chemotherapy hospitalized in our hospital from August 2017 to March 2018 were enrolled, with 35 normal controls. The concentration of plasma coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) was detected by ELISA to determine the relationship between the plasma FXIII levels in AL patients at the myelosuppression phase after chemotherapy with bleeding events. Results: The level of FXIII in AL patients at the myelosuppression phase after chemotherapy was significantly lower than that in controls (P<0.001) . The level of FXIII was inversely related with the bleeding severity (the Spearman correlation coefficient -0.761) . Given the diagnosis cut-off point of FXIII concentration as 103.9 mug/L, the sensitivity of diagnosing bleeding in AL patients at the myelosuppression phase after chemotherapy was 0.939, and the specificity 0.909. Conclusion: AL patients at the myelosuppression phase after chemotherapy had low level of plasma FXIII, and patients with lower plasma FXIII associated with higher incidence and severity of bleeding. FXIII level was an independent influencing factor of bleeding in AL patients at the myelosuppression phase after chemotherapy.","['Wang, Y Z', 'Tan, B Y', 'Li, L', 'Li, Z J']","['Wang YZ', 'Tan BY', 'Li L', 'Li ZJ']","['Department of Hematology, First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Laboratory, First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Laboratory, First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Hospital of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Factor XIII', 'Factor XIII Deficiency', 'Hemorrhage', 'Humans', '*Leukemia']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/19 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.01.011 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jan 14;41(1):59-63. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.01.011.,,,,PMC7357909,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Bleeding event', 'Coagulation factor XIII', 'Myelosuppression']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 155 patients with non-favorable AML who received allo-HSCT in CR(1)/MRD(-) from January 2010 to March 2019. The survival data were compared between patients who received and those not received pre-transplant consolidation chemotherapy. Results: A total of 102 patients received pre-transplant consolidation chemotherapy (consolidation group) , and 53 cases directly proceeded to allo-HSCT when CR(1)/MRD(-) was achieved (nonconsolidation group) . The median ages were 39 (18-56) years old and 38 (19-67) years old, respectively. Five-year post-transplant overall survival [ (59.3+/-7.5) % vs (62.2+/-6.9) %, P=0.919] and relapse-free survival [ (53.0+/-8.9) % vs (61.6+/-7.0) %, P=0.936] were not significantly different between the two groups (consolidation vs nonconsolidation) . There was a weak relationship between consolidation therapy and cumulative incidence of relapse [consolidation: (21.9+/-5.4) % vs nonconsolidation: (18.3+/-6.0) %, P=0.942], as well as non-relapse mortality [consolidation: (22.4+/-4.3) % vs nonconsolidation: (28.4+/-6.5) %,P=0.464]. Multivariate analysis indicated that pre-transplant consolidation and the consolidation courses (< 2 vs >/=2 courses) did not have an impact on allo-HSCT outcomes. Conclusion: Allo-HSCT for candidate patients without further consolidation when CR(1)/MRD(-) was attained was feasible.","['Zhang, Y M', 'Zhang, Y', 'Ni, X', 'Gao, L', 'Qiu, H Y', 'Zhang, Y S', 'Tang, G S', 'Chen, J', 'Zhang, W P', 'Wang, J M', 'Yang, J M', 'Hu, X X']","['Zhang YM', 'Zhang Y', 'Ni X', 'Gao L', 'Qiu HY', 'Zhang YS', 'Tang GS', 'Chen J', 'Zhang WP', 'Wang JM', 'Yang JM', 'Hu XX']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, the Naval Medical University; Institute of Hematologic Disease of Chinese PLA, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.01.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2020 Jan 14;41(1):16-22. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2020.01.004.,,"['81770160, 81470321/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017BR012/Municipal Human Resources Development Program for Outstanding Leaders', 'in Medical Disciplines in Shanghai']",,PMC7357906,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Consolidation chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Minimal residual disease', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimal therapeutic approaches to adult patients with ETP-ALL are poorly characterized. In this study, we explore the efficacy and outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for ETP-ALL. Methods: The clinical data of 23 patients with ETP-ALL receiving allo-HSCT from 2010 to 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with ETP-ALL were diagnosed based on the characteristic immunophenotypes. Second-generation sequencing was done in all patients. As to the donors, 12 patients had haploidentical donors (Haplo-HSCT) , 7 HLA-matched sibling donors (Sib-HSCT) and 4 HLA-matched unrelated donors (URD-HSCT) . Before transplantation, 19 patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 4 patients without. Results: The main clinical features of ETP-ALL included high white blood cell counts in 5 patients, splenomegaly in 14, lymphadenopathy in 19, and thymus masses in 5. According to cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, 11 patients had gene mutations related to myeloid tumors, and 7 with high risk Karyotype. After first induction regimen, 14/23 patients achieved CR. 5 patients reached CR after more than 2 cycles of chemotherapy, while another 4 patients did not reach CR. After allo-HSCT, 22 patients were successfully implanted. The median time of granulocyte and platelet reconstitution was +12 and +19 days. One patient died of transplant-related infection at +14 days. The estimated 18-month overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates were (55.0+/-14.4) % and (48.1+/-14.7) % respectively. Transplant-related mortality was 4.3%. The median OS in patients achieving CR before transplantation was 20 months, however, that in patients without CR was only 13 months. OS and RFS between haplo-HSCT and sib-HSCT were comparable (P=0.460 and 0.420 respectively) . Conclusions: Allo-HSCT is an effective therapy in some patients with ETP-ALL. Salvage HSCT cannot overcome the poor outcome. Haplo-HSCT and sib-HSCT in ETP-ALL patients have the similar clinical outcome.","['Zhu, Y X', 'Zhu, M Q', 'Dai, H P', 'Liu, S N', 'Yin, J', 'Li, Z', 'Cui, Q Y', 'Zhu, X M', 'Wu, D P', 'Tang, X W']","['Zhu YX', 'Zhu MQ', 'Dai HP', 'Liu SN', 'Yin J', 'Li Z', 'Cui QY', 'Zhu XM', 'Wu DP', 'Tang XW']","['Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adult', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Dec 14;40(12):1021-1025. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.010.,,"['81270645/National Natural Science Foundation of China', 'BK20141202/Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province', 'H201125/Medical Scientific Research Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China', 'BE2017655/Social Development and Clinical Frontier Technology Project of Jiangsu', 'Province of China', 'SYS201457/Basic Research on the Application of Science and Technology Plan of', 'Suzhou']",,PMC7342676,,['NOTNLM'],"['Early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Clinical data of 4 patients, diagnosed as t-MNs secondary to APL at Hematology Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from October 2012 to January 2019, were collected retrospectively. T-MNs related literature was reviewed. Results: The 4 cases were all females, with the median age 42 (range 40-53) years old at the diagnosis of APL. Regarding the induction and consolidation regimens, 3 patients received all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) combined with anthracycline/anthraquinone and/or cytosine. One patient only received ATRA and other auxiliary drugs. Alkylating agents were not administrated. The 4 patients developed t-MNs 40 to 43 months after complete remission (CR) of APL, including 1 case of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) and 3 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) . The PML-RARalpha fusion genes were all negative when t-MNs developed. The three patients with t-AML were treated with 3 to 4 re-induction regimens, one of whom underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) after complete remission (CR) . One patient with t-MDS received hypomethylating agents. After a median follow-up of 54.5 (48-62) months, 2 patients with t-AML died, the median overall survival after t-MN was 12 (5-18) months. From 1989 to 2018, a total of 63 t-MN cases were reported in the literature. Therefore, 67 cases were analyzed when four patients in our center were added, including 27 males and 40 females with median age 52.5 (15-76) years. The median latency was 39 (12-126) months and the median overall survival after diagnosis of t-MN was 10 (1-39) months. Conclusions: Although rare, t-MNs may occur after successful control of APL. There are no existing guidelines for prevention and treatment of t-MNs, which have very poor prognosis. If cytopenia or other abnormalities of peripheral blood cells develop after 3 years of APL, t-MNs should be considered as a differential diagnosis.","['Wang, Z', 'Xu, M Z', 'Chen, Y F', 'Xue, F', 'Zhang, L', 'Hu, Y M', 'Li, C W', 'Li, S Z', 'Wang, J X', 'Mi, Y C']","['Wang Z', 'Xu MZ', 'Chen YF', 'Xue F', 'Zhang L', 'Hu YM', 'Li CW', 'Li SZ', 'Wang JX', 'Mi YC']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Instituteof Hematology & Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Arsenicals', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Oxides', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/19 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.007 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Dec 14;40(12):1008-1014. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.007.,,"['15ZXLCSY00010/Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission Grant', '2017ZX09304024/National Science and Technology Major project', '2018-I2M-AI-017/CAMS Innovation Fund for Medical Science']",,PMC7342672,,['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia, promyelocytic, acute', 'Myeloid neoplasm, therapy-related', 'Treatment efficacy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multivariate analyses showed that imatinib was an adverse factor associated with achieving CCyR (OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8, P=0.001) , MMR (OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.9, P=0.032) and MR(4.5) (OR=0.6, 95%CI 0.5-0.9, P=0.032) and poor FFS (OR=1.9, 95%CI 1.0-3.4, P=0.041) . In addition, Sokal score was an independent factor affecting cytogenetic and molecular responses, treatment failure, disease progression and survival. Male, WBC >/=100x10(9)/L or HGB<120 g/L at diagnosis were significantly associated with lower cytogenetic and molecular response rates and/or poor FFS. The severe hematologic adverse events were not associated with different TKIs. Conclusions: Nilotinib reaches to the faster and deeper cytogenetic and molecular responses and significantly improves FFS than imatinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP.","['Yu, L', 'Qin, Y Z', 'Lai, Y Y', 'Shi, H X', 'Huang, X J', 'Hou, Y', 'Jiang, Q']","['Yu L', 'Qin YZ', 'Lai YY', 'Shi HX', 'Huang XJ', 'Hou Y', 'Jiang Q']","[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.005 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Dec 14;40(12):996-1002. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.005.,,['81770161/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,PMC7342677,,['NOTNLM'],"['Imatinib', 'Leukemia, myeloid, chronic, BCR-ABL positive', 'Nilotinib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The clinical data of 105 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent allo-HSCT and recurrence-free survival>90 days from January 2010 to January 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. The bone marrow samples were collected at 15, 30, 60, 90, 180, 270, 360 days after transplantation. Donor chimerism was detected by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -PCR. Results: Of the 105 patients, 43 cases were male and 62 cases were female, with a median age of 38 (16-60) years. Till April 2019, the median follow-up was 843 (94-3 261) days. Ninety days after transplantation, 18 cases relapsed, 33 cases died, and 72 cases survived. The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate was (66.8+/-5.1) %, and the recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was (65.1+/-5.0) %. Pre-transplant disease status, pre-transplant minimal residual disease (MRD) , and 90 day post-transplantation chimerism were independent risk factors related to RFS. The risk of recurrence was significantly increased in patients with a donor chimerism rate </=97.24% at 90 days after transplantation[HR=6.921 (95%CI 2.669-17.950) , P<0.001], which was considered as a sign of early relapse. Conclusion: SNP-PCR is an applicable method for detecting donor chimerism in patients after allo-HSCT. Chimerism rate equal or less than 97.24% at 90 days after transplantation predicts a higher risk of relapse.","['Fei, Y', 'Hu, X X', 'Chen, Q', 'Huang, A J', 'Cheng, H', 'Ni, X', 'Qiu, H Y', 'Gao, L', 'Tang, G S', 'Chen, J', 'Zhang, W P', 'Yang, J M', 'Wang, J M']","['Fei Y', 'Hu XX', 'Chen Q', 'Huang AJ', 'Cheng H', 'Ni X', 'Qiu HY', 'Gao L', 'Tang GS', 'Chen J', 'Zhang WP', 'Yang JM', 'Wang JM']","['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Health Statistics, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Chimerism', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/07 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2020/02/07 06:00'],"['2020/02/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.004 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Dec 14;40(12):990-995. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.12.004.,,"['81530047, 81870143/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2017BR012/Municipal Human Resources Development Program for Outstanding Leaders', 'in Medical Disciplines in Shanghai']",,PMC7342688,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Chimerism', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Polymorphism', 'Single nucleotide']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Clinical data of pregnancy delivery in CML patients treated with NIL from March 2015 to January 2019 were retrospectively collected. Results: A total of 11 patients were recruited with median pregnancy age 28 (25-40) years. The median duration of NIL treatment before pregnancy was 34 (3-48) months. There were 12 pregnancies, included 2 planned ones and 10 (83.3%) unplanned. In the 10 unplanned patients, 9 (90.0%) received NIL 600 mg/d. The median exposure time were 4 (4-7) weeks. In eight patients with delivery outcomes, 5 cases had well-developed babies, 2 had spontaneous abortion and 1 case with an baby of syndactyly deformity, whose mother was exposed to NIL 600 mg/d for 7 weeks in the early trimester of pregnancy.

Methods: Clinical and fertility outcomes of male (from Jul. 1998 to Feb. 2018) and female CML (from Sep. 2009 to Feb. 2018) patients were retrospectively analyzed at Peking University People's Hospital. Results: A total of 49 male CML patients and their spouses were enrolled. Before their spouses conceived, 34 patients were receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib, 9 with nilotinib, and 6 with dasatinib. At the time of conception, the median age of these male patients was 32 years (range, 25-48 years) , and the median TKI treatment duration was 36 months (range, 0.2-198 months) . One male patient having achieved complete hematologic response yet discontinuing TKI for a year developed a disease progression to blast crisis. The other 48 patients sustained stable disease. The total conception times were 61 and finally 55 infants were born including one with premature birth, two with low birth weight, and one with hypospadias receiving surgery. The other 18 female patients after pregnancy were enrolled. Two patients developed spontaneous abortions. Two received induced abortions. Fourteen gave birth to healthy infants without congenital malformation. The interval from diagnosis of CML to initiation of TKI was 4 months (range, 0.3-16 months) . During a median follow-up of 45 months (range from 7-114 months) , the estimated complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) rate, major molecular response (MMR) rate and molecular response(4.5) (MR(4.5)) rate by 5 years were 88.9%, 85.3% and 35.1%, respectively.

Data on the long-term outcomes of patients with pretransplant nonhepatic malignancy (PTM) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) are scarce, although the recipients of other organs with PTM have been reported to have a poor survival. Fifteen patients with PTM (4.4%) among the 342 adult recipients were identified in our LDLT programs. The outcomes of the patients with PTM after LDLT were compared to those of patients without PTM in terms of the all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality (defined as mortality related to malignancy expect for hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or neuroendocrine tumor). The sites of PTM included the breast in six, stomach in two, and colon, lung, kidney, uterine, thyroid, larynx, and acute myelogenous leukemia in one each. The median interval from the PTM treatment to LDLT was 57 months (range, 2-298). The patients who received the curative treatment for PTM were selected as the recipients. No patients with PTM had recurrence during the follow-up period. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival rates were 100%, 92.9%, and 92.9% in the PTM group and 86.2%, 76.7%, and 68.5% in the non-PTM group, respectively (p = 0.142). Likewise, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the cancer-specific mortality. In conclusion, the patients with PTM had comparable outcomes with regard to mortality and cancer-specific mortality compared with those without PTM. This study showed that the patients with PTM can obtain an acceptable outcome after LDLT when carefully selected.","['Yamamoto, Hidekazu', 'Sambommatsu, Yuzuru', 'Ibuki, Sho', 'Shimata, Keita', 'Sugawara, Yasuhiko', 'Hibi, Taizo']","['Yamamoto H', 'Sambommatsu Y', 'Ibuki S', 'Shimata K', 'Sugawara Y', 'Hibi T']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200205,Japan,Biosci Trends,Bioscience trends,101502754,,IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Living Donors', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5582/bst.2019.01313 [doi]'],ppublish,Biosci Trends. 2020 Mar 16;14(1):42-47. doi: 10.5582/bst.2019.01313.

It remains unclear whether the population-level outcomes of APL have improved over time. METHODS: Using the SEER database, we identified patients aged >/=20 years with pathologically confirmed APL diagnosed in 2000 through 2014 and who were actively followed. Patients were stratified by diagnosis period into 3 groups (2000-2004, 2005-2009, and 2010-2014) to assess the temporal trends in overall survival (OS), cause-specific survival (CSS), and other outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 2,962 patients with a median age of 48 years (range, 20-96 years) were included. Hispanic patients constituted 21.5% of the cohort and the largest proportion (47.9%) of uninsured patients. The incidence of APL was 0.33 cases per 100,000 population per year. Incidence varied significantly by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis period. Survival was significantly higher for patients diagnosed in 2010 through 2014 compared with those diagnosed in 2005 through 2009 and in 2000 through 2004 (4-year OS, 73.4% vs 65.6% vs 57.3%, respectively; 4-year CSS, 78.3% vs 70.8% vs 60.8%, respectively). Early mortality improved significantly over time (2000-2004, 25.3%; 2005-2009, 20.6%; 2010-2014, 17.1%) and was higher in men and Hispanic patients. According to multivariate analysis, diagnosis before 2010 and unmarried status were associated with a higher mortality risk. Uninsured patients had a significantly higher early mortality without a significant difference in post-30-day CSS. No significant changes were noted in risk of secondary malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Population-level outcomes of APL have continued to improve over time. However, significant discrepancies in disease outcomes continue to exist, highlighting the need for more research.","['Guru Murthy, Guru Subramanian', 'Szabo, Aniko', 'Michaelis, Laura', 'Carlson, Karen-Sue', 'Runaas, Lyndsey', 'Abedin, Sameem', 'Atallah, Ehab']","['Guru Murthy GS', 'Szabo A', 'Michaelis L', 'Carlson KS', 'Runaas L', 'Abedin S', 'Atallah E']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program/statistics & numerical data', 'Salvage Therapy/*methods', 'Sex Factors', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.6004/jnccn.2019.7351 [doi]', 'jnccn19047 [pii]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2020 Feb;18(2):169-175. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2019.7351.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CAR T cells can induce substantial toxic effects, and the manufacture of the cells is complex. Natural killer (NK) cells that have been modified to express an anti-CD19 CAR have the potential to overcome these limitations. METHODS: In this phase 1 and 2 trial, we administered HLA-mismatched anti-CD19 CAR-NK cells derived from cord blood to 11 patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive cancers (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]). NK cells were transduced with a retroviral vector expressing genes that encode anti-CD19 CAR, interleukin-15, and inducible caspase 9 as a safety switch. The cells were expanded ex vivo and administered in a single infusion at one of three doses (1x10(5), 1x10(6), or 1x10(7) CAR-NK cells per kilogram of body weight) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy. RESULTS: The administration of CAR-NK cells was not associated with the development of cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity, or graft-versus-host disease, and there was no increase in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, over baseline. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Of the 11 patients who were treated, 8 (73%) had a response; of these patients, 7 (4 with lymphoma and 3 with CLL) had a complete remission, and 1 had remission of the Richter's transformation component but had persistent CLL. Responses were rapid and seen within 30 days after infusion at all dose levels. The infused CAR-NK cells expanded and persisted at low levels for at least 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among 11 patients with relapsed or refractory CD19-positive cancers, a majority had a response to treatment with CAR-NK cells without the development of major toxic effects.

In this unit, we present data regarding the use of a new, more efficient type of transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) for gene editing. Our group has generated bicistronic genes in which classical TALEN coding sequences are linked by 2A elements to different reporter molecules, such as fluorochromes (TALEN-F) or membrane receptors (TALEN-M). This structure results in two proteins transcribed from the same transcript, of which the second (the reporter) can be used as the target for selection by fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The application of these new TALEN genes allows a rapid enrichment of cells in which both members of the TALEN pair are active, thus eliminating the need for lengthy selection in culture and laborious characterization of a large number of clones.

The underlying mechanisms of such selective activation of fibroblasts are not understood. We propose that the intrinsic geometric heterogeneity of fibroblasts modulates the nuclear mechanotransduction of signals from the microenvironment, resulting in their selective activation. To test this, we developed an engineered 3D fibroblast tumor coculture system and used high resolution images to quantify multiple cell geometry sensitive nuclear morphological and chromatin organizational features. These features were then mapped to activation levels as measured by the nuclear abundance of transcription cofactor, megakaryoblastic leukemia, and protein levels of its target, alphaSMA. Importantly, our results indicate the presence of activation-""primed"" cell geometries that present higher activation levels, which are further enhanced in the presence of stimuli from cancer cells. Further, we show that by enriching the population of activation-primed cell geometric states by either increasing matrix rigidity or micropatterning primed cell shapes, fibroblast activation levels can be increased. Collectively, our results reveal important cellular geometric states that select for fibroblast activation within the heterogenous tumor microenvironment.","['Venkatachalapathy, Saradha', 'Jokhun, Doorgesh Sharma', 'Shivashankar, G V']","['Venkatachalapathy S', 'Jokhun DS', 'Shivashankar GV']","['Mechanobiology Institute and Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 117411, Singapore.', 'Mechanobiology Institute and Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 117411, Singapore.', 'Mechanobiology Institute and Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, 117411, Singapore.', 'FIRC Institute for Molecular Oncology, Milan 20139, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Paul Scherrer Institut, 5232 Villigen, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200205,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Shape', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Fibroblasts/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mechanotransduction, Cellular', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Spheroids, Cellular', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/06/03 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.E19-08-0420 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2020 Apr 1;31(8):803-812. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E19-08-0420.

However, limited intra-individual variability is a precondition for targeted dosing and the diagnosis of SI. METHODS: In the AIEOP-BFM acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 2009 trial, 2771 children with ALL were included and underwent ASNase-TDM in a central laboratory in Munster. Two biweekly administrations of pegylated ASNase during induction and a third dose during reinduction or the high-risk block, which was administered several weeks later, were monitored. We calculated (1) the incidence of SI; and (2) the predictivity of SI for SI after the subsequent administration. ASNase activities monitored during induction were categorized into percentiles at the respective sampling time points. These percentiles were used to calculate the intra-individual range of percentiles as a surrogate for intrapatient variability and to evaluate the predictivity of ASNase activity for the subsequent administration. RESULTS: The overall incidence of SI was low (4.9%). The positive predictive value of SI identified by one sample was </=21%. Confirmation of SI by a second sample indicated a high positive predictive value of 100% for biweekly administrations, but not for administration more than 17 weeks later. Sampling and/or documentation errors were risks for misdiagnosis of SI. High intra-individual variability in ASNase activities, with ranges of percentiles over more than 2 quartiles and low predictivity, was observed in approximately 25% of the patients. These patients were likely to fail dose individualization based on TDM data.

METHODS: This study reports the results of treatment of the ALLRE08 trial, a full pediatric trial for AYA aged 15-30 years with standard-risk (SR) ALL. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2018, 89 patients (38 adolescents [15-18 years] and 51 young adults [YA, 19-30 years], median age: 20 [15-29] years) were enrolled in the ALLRE08 trial. The complete response (CR) was 95%. Twenty-two patients were transferred to a high-risk (HR) protocol because of poor marrow response on day 14 (n = 20) or high-level of end-induction minimal residual response (MRD >/= 0.25%, n = 2). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 5 years was 35% (95%CI: 23%-47%), with significant differences between adolescents and YA: 13% (4%-28%) vs 52% (34%-67%), P = .012. No treatment-related mortality was observed in 66/66 patients following the ALLRE08 trial vs 3/23 patients moved to a HR trial. The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 74% (95%CI: 63%-85%), with significantly higher rates for adolescents vs YA: 87% (95%CI: 74%-100%) vs 63% (46%-80%), P = .021. Although CIR or OS were lower in patients who were transferred to a HR trial, the differences were not statistically significant (CIR: 34% [21%-47%] vs 37% [14%-61%]; OS: 78% [66%-90%] vs 61% [31%;91%]). CONCLUSION: A full pediatric trial is feasible and effective for AYA with Ph-neg, SR-ALL, with better results for adolescents than for YA. Outcome of patients with poor early response rescued with a HR trial was not significantly inferior.","['Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Martinez-Carballeira, Daniel', 'Gonzalez-Campos, Jose', 'Gil, Cristina', 'Barba, Pere', 'Garcia-Boyero, Raimundo', 'Coll, Rosa', 'Pedreno, Maria', 'Ribera, Jordi', 'Mercadal, Santiago', 'Vives, Susana', 'Novo, Andres', 'Genesca, Eulalia', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria', 'Bergua, Juan', 'Amigo, Maria-Luz', 'Vall-Llovera, Ferran', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Pilar', 'Calbacho, Maria', 'Garcia-Cadenas, Irene', 'Garcia-Guinon, Antoni', 'Sanchez-Sanchez, Maria-Jose', 'Cervera, Marta', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Ribera JM', 'Morgades M', 'Montesinos P', 'Tormo M', 'Martinez-Carballeira D', 'Gonzalez-Campos J', 'Gil C', 'Barba P', 'Garcia-Boyero R', 'Coll R', 'Pedreno M', 'Ribera J', 'Mercadal S', 'Vives S', 'Novo A', 'Genesca E', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Bergua J', 'Amigo ML', 'Vall-Llovera F', 'Martinez-Sanchez P', 'Calbacho M', 'Garcia-Cadenas I', 'Garcia-Guinon A', 'Sanchez-Sanchez MJ', 'Cervera M', 'Feliu E', 'Orfao A']","['Departments of Clinical Hematology, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol.

However, its action mechanism remains unclear. We previously reported that transcription factor 7 (TCF7) was increased in patients successfully treated with ECT. TCF7 regulates Wnt pathway, which regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Astrocytes play a role in adult hippocampal neurogenesis via neurogenic factors. Of astrocyte-derived neurogenic factors, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) activate Wnt pathway. In addition, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), released from excited neurons, activates astrocytes. Therefore, we hypothesized that ECT might increase LIF and/or FGF2 in astrocytes. To test this, we investigated the effects of ATP and electric stimulation (ES) on LIF and FGF2 expressions in astrocytes. METHODS: Astrocytes were derived from neonatal mouse forebrain and administered ATP and ES. The mRNA expression was estimated with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Protein concentration was measured with ELISA. RESULTS: ATP increased LIF, but not FGF2, expression. Multiple ES, but not single, increased LIF expression. Knockdown of P2X2 receptor (P2X2R) attenuated ATP-induced increase of LIF mRNA expression. In contrast, P2X3 and P2X4 receptors intensified it. CONCLUSION: P2X2R may mediate ATP-induced LIF expression in astrocytes and multiple ES directly increases LIF expression in astrocytes. Therefore, both ATP/P2X2R and multiple ES-induced increases of LIF expression in astrocytes might mediate the efficacy of ECT on psychiatric disorders. Elucidating detailed mechanisms of ATP/P2X2R and multiple ES-induced LIF expression is expected to result in the identification of new therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders.","['Maruyama, Soichiro', 'Boku, Shuken', 'Okazaki, Satoshi', 'Kikuyama, Hiroki', 'Mizoguchi, Yoshito', 'Monji, Akira', 'Otsuka, Ikuo', 'Sora, Ichiro', 'Kanazawa, Tetsufumi', 'Hishimoto, Akitoyo', 'Yoneda, Hiroshi']","['Maruyama S', 'Boku S', 'Okazaki S', 'Kikuyama H', 'Mizoguchi Y', 'Monji A', 'Otsuka I', 'Sora I', 'Kanazawa T', 'Hishimoto A', 'Yoneda H']","['Department of Psychiatry, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Saga University Faculty of Medicine, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Saga University Faculty of Medicine, Saga, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.', 'Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Osaka Medical College, Takatsuki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200305,Australia,Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,9513551,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X2)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Astrocytes/metabolism/*physiology', 'Electric Stimulation', '*Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrophysiological Phenomena/*physiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Prosencephalon/metabolism/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X2/metabolism']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/06/01 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pcn.12986 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2020 May;74(5):311-317. doi: 10.1111/pcn.12986.

This study aimed at developing a DBS sampling method for an accurate and precise prediction of radotinib plasma concentrations (Cp ) in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). METHODS: Dried blood spot and venous blood samples were simultaneously collected from fifty CML patients who had been receiving radotinib for at least a week. Radotinib concentrations were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Unmeasured Cp was predicted directly based on a Deming regression between DBS concentrations (CDBS ) and Cp . Unmeasured Cp was also predicted from CDBS corrected by each patient's haematocrit (Hct). Both prediction methods were evaluated for their accuracy and precision using Deming regression and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The Deming regression equation between CDBS and Cp was obtained as follows: Cp = 1.34CDBS + 4.26 (r(2) = .97). Cp was directly predictable using Cp,pred1 = 1.34CDBS + 4.26. With Hct correction, Cp was alternatively predictable using Cp,pred2 = CDBS / (1-Hct + Hct(2) ). The slopes of Deming regression line between predicted and measured Cp were 0.99 and 1.02 for the direct and Hct-corrected method, respectively. The mean biases (accuracy) were -0.44% and 1.6% with the 95% limits of agreement (precision) of -22.4% to 21.5% and -20.5% to 23.7%, respectively. More than 93% of predicted and measured Cp pairs had their differences within 20% of the mean of each pair in both methods. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: Radotinib CDBS are highly correlated with radotinib Cp. Radotinib Cp can be accurately and precisely predicted from CDBS using direct or Hct-corrected prediction methods.

Despite its essential role in AML treatment, relapse after allo-SCT is common and associated with a poor prognosis. There is longstanding interest in developing immunologic strategies to augment the GVL effect post-transplant to prevent relapse and improve outcomes. In addition to prophylactic maintenance strategies, the GVL effect can also be used in relapsed patients to reinduce remission. While immune checkpoint inhibitors and other novel immune-targeted agents have been successfully used in the post-transplant setting to augment the GVL effect and induce remission in small clinical trials of relapsed patients, exacerbations of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) have limited their broader use. Here we review advances in three areas of immunotherapy that have been studied in post-transplant AML: donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), immune checkpoint inhibitors, and other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and ligand receptor antagonists. We also discuss additional therapies with proposed immunologic mechanisms, such as hypomethylating agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors, and the FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib.","['Sterling, Cole', 'Webster, Jonathan']","['Sterling C', 'Webster J']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200219,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25750 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2020 May;95(5):529-547. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25750.

The MS can appear in all parts of the human body, but it is extremely rare in the tongue. Clinical case: The main symptoms were a pain in the tongue, asthenia, gingivorrhagia, fever. We found a tumor in the tongue, which was irregular in size and located in the posterior region of the right lateral edge of the tongue. The diagnosis of MS was made by the anatomopathological and immunohistochemical study, while the definite diagnosis of APL was confirmed by the molecular test. The treatment of APL was based on the administration of trans-retinoic acid 45mg/m(2) daily continuously and daunorubicin 60mg/m(2) every other day for 4 doses, with a favorable therapeutic response to APL and MS. Conclusion: Promyelocytic myeloid cells can infiltrate many organs extramedullary, such as the tongue, and this might precede bone marrow infiltration.

There are numerous genetic abnormalities in AML, many of which are prognostic, but an increasing number are targets for drug therapy. One of the most common genetic abnormalities in AML are activating mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3). As a receptor tyrosine kinase, FLT3 was the first targetable genetic abnormality in AML. The first generation of FLT3 inhibitors were broad-spectrum kinase inhibitors that inhibited FLT3 among other proteins. Although clinically active, first-generation FLT3 inhibitors had limited success as single agents. This led to the development of a second generation of more selective FLT3 inhibitors. This review focuses on quizartinib, a potent second-generation FLT3 inhibitor. We discuss the clinical trial development, mechanisms of resistance, and the recent FDA decision to deny approval for quizartinib as a single agent in relapsed/refractory AML.","['Fletcher, Luke', 'Joshi, Sunil K', 'Traer, Elie']","['Fletcher L', 'Joshi SK', 'Traer E']","['Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'School of Medicine, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR 97239, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200108,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S196568 [doi]', '196568 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2020 Jan 8;12:151-163. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S196568. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-2384-536X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2798-5762', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8844-2345']",['F30 CA239335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['(c) 2020 Fletcher et al.'],PMC6955578,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'QuANTUM', 'clinical trials', 'quizartinib', 'resistance']",,,"['Dr. Elie Traer reports consulting honorarium from Astellas, Agios, Daiichi', 'Sankyo, Abbvie, and ImmunoGen, outside the submitted work.

Methods: To explore the HKMT effect of another regulatory protein within the complex of proteins associated with Set 1 (COMPASS), we analyzed the H3K4me3 modification of the HOXC8 promoter under the action of ASH2L regulation. Small interfering RNA of ASH2L, chromatin immunoprecipitation, real-time-PCR (RT-PCR), and Western blotting were used to detect the expression of specific regions of the HOXC8 promoter, RBBP5, WDR5, MLL, and BRTF in two MLL-rearranged acute leukemia cell lines (RS4:11 and THP-1 cells). Results: The gene and protein expression levels of HOXC8 were significantly downregulated upon treatment with ASH2L-siRNA (as analyzed by targeting specific regions of the HOXC8 promoter located 0 and 3 kb (-3.0 kb) upstream of the transcriptional start site in RSH:11 cells; and -3.0 and -2.0 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, and +1.4 kb downstream of the transcriptional start site in THP-1 cells). The expression levels of the BRTF, RBBP5, WDR5, and MLL genes were significantly downregulated from the different transcriptional start sites of the HOXC8 promoter in the RSH:11 cell line (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the BPTF and RBBP5 genes were downregulated from the HOXC8 promoter in the THP-1 cell line (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Based on these results, we suggest a new concept of histone modification of the ASH2L protein in MLL-rearranged acute leukemia, which cannot carry out methyltransferase activity independently. The protein-protein interactions of ASH2L with other COMPASS members, such as MLL, WDR5, RBBP5, and chromatin remodeling factor BRTF, appear to be essential for its role in the activation of HOXC8 gene transcription.","['Wu, Yu-Jie', 'Li, Li-Xia', 'Liu, Lu', 'Zhao, Si-Shu', 'Qiu, Hai-Rong', 'Wang, Hui']","['Wu YJ', 'Li LX', 'Liu L', 'Zhao SS', 'Qiu HR', 'Wang H']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210011, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University (Jiangsu Provincial People Hospital), Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200114,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S221643 [doi]', '221643 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Jan 14;13:381-387. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S221643. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-0168-8017'],,['(c) 2020 Wu et al.'],PMC6969701,,['NOTNLM'],"['ASH2L', 'COMPASS complex', 'H3K4 trimethylation', 'HOXC8 gene', 'MLL-rearranged acute leukemia']",,,['The authors report no con fl icts of interest relating to this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a case of a 28-year-old male patient who was admitted with intense headache, vision disturbance and severe vomiting in June 2017. He had a history of neurosurgical tumor resection operation in April 2017, and the pathological diagnosis was intracranial myeloid sarcoma. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy had been conducted in May 2017, which demonstrated 5.5% blasts expressing CD13, CD33, CD34, CD117 and MPO, and the cytogenetic analysis demonstrated t(8;21)(q22;q22), and molecular studies showed a positive RUNX1-RUNX1T1 rearrangement. The diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t (8; 21) (q22; q22)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 was made, however, the patient refused to receive any systemic chemotherapy. Emergency cranial CT demonstrated a circular hyperdense mass (54mmx37mm), which was surrounded by hypodense peritumoral edema in the left cerebellar hemisphere, and the density of the lesions was uniform and the margin was clear. Idarubicin (12mg/m(2).dx3 days) combined with high-dose cytarabine (2g/m(2) q12hx3 days) was initiated for emergency chemotherapy. All of the above symptoms disappeared at the end of chemotherapy. On the first day after chemotherapy, the cranial CT indicated that the cranial lesion was markedly reduced (20mmx15mm), and on the sixth day after chemotherapy, the lesion was completely disappeared. Currently, there are no clear guidelines for the treatment of intracranial myeloid sarcoma, and our treatment approaches could provide a reference for this disease with such emergency situation.","['Zhou, Li', 'Zhang, Xinhui', 'Feng, Shanglong', 'Zhao, Na', 'Hu, Xing', 'Huang, Liangliang', 'Zheng, Changcheng']","['Zhou L', 'Zhang X', 'Feng S', 'Zhao N', 'Hu X', 'Huang L', 'Zheng C']","[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinic Pathology Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200109,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S230478 [doi]', '230478 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2020 Jan 9;13:237-241. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S230478. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0002-3668-3558', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1976-6415']",,['(c) 2020 Zhou et al.'],PMC6957092,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'myeloid sarcoma']",,,['The authors declare that there is no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Daunorubicin (DNR) is an indispensable drug for the treatment of MDS and AML. However, its side effects including cardiac toxicity and bone marrow suppression severely limit clinical application. Many researches reported high expression of CD123 antigen on high-risk MDS cells, so we constructed a novel drug delivery system comprising daunorubicin-loaded CdTe QDs conjugated with anti-CD123 mAbs (DNR-CdTe-CD123) to develop targeted combination chemotherapy for MDS. Methods: CdTe conjugated antiCD123 through amide bond, co-loaded with DNR with electrostatic bonding. Then, we determined characterization and release rate of DNR-CdTe-CD123. The therapeutic effect and side effect of drug delivery system were evaluated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results: CdTe showed appropriate diameter and good dispersibility and DNR was loaded into CdTes with high encapsulation efficiency and drug loading. The maximum drug loading and encapsulation efficiency were 42.08 +/- 0.64% and 74.52 +/- 1.81%, respectively, at DNR concentration of 0.2mg/mL and anti-CD123 mAbs volume of 5ul (100ug/mL). Flow cytometry (FCM) showed that CD123 antigen was highly expressed on MUTZ-1 cells, and its expression rate was 72.89 +/- 10.67%. In vitro experiments showed that the inhibition rate and apoptosis rate of MUTZ-1 cells treated with DNR-CdTe-CD123 were higher than those in the other groups (P<0.05). Compared with the other groups, the level of apoptosis-related protein (P53, cleaved caspase-9, Bax and cleaved caspase-3) were upregulated in DNR-CdTe-CD123 group (P<0.05). In vivo experiments, DNR-CdTe-CD123 can effectively inhibit the tumor growth of MDS-bearing nude mice and reduce the side effects of DNR on myocardial cells. Conclusion: The system of DNR-CdTe-CD123 enhances the therapeutic effects and reduce the side effects of DNR, thus providing a novel platform for MDS treatment.","['Guo, Dan', 'Xu, Peipei', 'Chen, Dangui', 'Wang, Lili', 'Zhu, Yudi', 'Zuo, Yifan', 'Chen, Bing']","['Guo D', 'Xu P', 'Chen D', 'Wang L', 'Zhu Y', 'Zuo Y', 'Chen B']","[""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200124,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cadmium Compounds)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'NQA0O090ZJ (Tellurium)', 'STG188WO13 (cadmium telluride)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cadmium Compounds/*chemistry', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Quantum Dots/chemistry', 'Tellurium/*chemistry', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S233395 [doi]', '233395 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2020 Jan 24;15:521-536. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S233395. eCollection 2020.,,,['(c) 2020 Guo et al.'],PMC6988587,,['NOTNLM'],"['CdTe', 'anti-CD123 monoclonal antibody', 'daunorubicin', 'drug delivery system', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a family member of transcription factors which promotes carcinogenesis in most human cancers. This effect on AML is accomplished through deregulation of several critical genes, such as B cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-XL) which is anti-apoptotic protein. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of curcumin (CUR) and thalidomide (THAL) on apoptosis induction and also the alteration of the mRNA expression level of STAT3 and BCL-XL mRNA on AML cell line compounds. Methods: The growth inhibitory effects of CUR and THAL and their combination were measured by MTT assay in U937 and KG-1 cell lines. The rates of apoptosis induction and cell cycle analysis were measured by concurrent staining with Annexin V and PI. The mRNA expression level of STAT3 and BCL-XL was evaluated by Real-Time PCR. Results: CUR inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in both KG-1 and U937 cells and this effect increased by combination with THAL. The expression level of STAT3 and BCL-XL was significantly down-regulated in KG-1 cells after treatment by CUR and THAL and their combination. Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggested that down-regulation of STAT3 and BCL-XL mRNA expression in response to CUR and THAL treatment lead to inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis.","['Mohammadi Kian, Mahnaz', 'Salemi, Mahdieh', 'Bahadoran, Mohammad', 'Haghi, Atousa', 'Dashti, Nasrin', 'Mohammadi, Saeed', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Babakhani, Davood', 'Nikbakht, Mohsen']","['Mohammadi Kian M', 'Salemi M', 'Bahadoran M', 'Haghi A', 'Dashti N', 'Mohammadi S', 'Rostami S', 'Chahardouli B', 'Babakhani D', 'Nikbakht M']","['Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Young Researchers & Elite Club Tehran Medical Sciences, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, School of Allied Health Sciences, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200115,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thalidomide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/12/23 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S228610 [doi]', '228610 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2020 Jan 15;14:185-194. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S228610. eCollection 2020.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-2826-9979', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6621-5424']",,['(c) 2020 Mohammadi Kian et al.'],PMC6970263,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-xL', 'STAT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'curcumin', 'thalidomide']",,,['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With improved survival rates, long-term treatment-related toxicities have become important, and the resulting complications can affect patients' emotion and behavior. This study aimed to 1) evaluate behavioral outcomes among survivors of childhood brain tumors, 2) compare behavioral outcomes among survivors of childhood brain tumors with survivors of childhood leukemia and healthy children, and 3) determine any demographic, disease, and/or treatment-related factors that could affect the behavioral outcomes of survivors of childhood brain tumors. METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted over a period of 1 year (June 1st, 2018-May 31st, 2019) in two tertiary referral centers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Thirty-eight survivors of childhood brain tumors aged 6 to 18 years old who had been off-treatment for at least 1 year and were in remission, 38 age- and gender-matched survivors of childhood leukemia who had been off-treatment for at least 1 year and were in remission, and 38 age- and gender-matched unrelated healthy children were recruited. The Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) parent report and Youth Self-Report (YSR) questionnaires were used to assess behavioral outcomes. RESULTS: Survivors of childhood brain tumors showed statistically significantly worse behavioral outcomes than healthy children for social problems and attention problems (p < 0.05, respectively). A significantly worse outcome was found for ""social problems"" (p < 0.05) in survivors of childhood brain tumors compared to survivors of childhood leukemia. Significant associations were also found between physical disability, visual impairment, education level of survivors, and father's occupation and behavioral outcomes among survivors of childhood brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood brain tumors in our center showed poor behavioral outcomes for social problems and attention problems. Thus, effective psychosocial support interventions tailored to individual patients as soon as treatment is completed are important to prevent potentially debilitating emotional problems.","['Alias, Hamidah', 'Morthy, Sasirekha Krisnan', 'Zakaria, Syed Zulkifli Syed', 'Muda, Zulaiha', 'Tamil, Azmi Mohd']","['Alias H', 'Morthy SK', 'Zakaria SZS', 'Muda Z', 'Tamil AM']","['Department of Pediatrics, UKM Medical Centre, Faculty of Medicine, The National University of Malaysia, Cheras, 56000, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. midalias@ppukm.ukm.edu.my.', 'Hospital Tunku Azizah, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, UKM Medical Centre, Faculty of Medicine, The National University of Malaysia, Cheras, 56000, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Institut Pediatrik, General Hospital Kuala Lumpur, The National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, The National University of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200205,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Brain Neoplasms/therapy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Humans', 'Malaysia', '*Survivors']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/05/15 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12887-020-1951-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12887-020-1951-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2020 Feb 5;20(1):53. doi: 10.1186/s12887-020-1951-3.,,,,PMC7001196,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Behavioral outcome', '*Brain tumor', '*Child behavior checklist', '*Survivors', '*Youth self Report']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although TAM also develops in neonates without constitutional trisomy 21, the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular characteristics of those patients are not fully understood. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and cytogenetic findings and GATA1 mutation status of 17 neonates with TAM and nonconstitutional trisomy 21 tested for GATA1 mutations at our institute, and compared the findings with those of 64 neonates with TAM and constitutional trisomy 21/DS. RESULTS: DS clinical features were observed in five of the 17 (29%) patients. In all patients, both trisomy 21 and GATA1 mutations were detected in diagnostic samples. Over a median follow-up of 33 (range, 0-139) months, early death (< 6 months of age) occurred in four patients (24%). Overall and event-free survivals were not significantly different between the patients with TAM and nonconstitutional trisomy 21 and those with TAM and constitutional trisomy 21/DS (five-year overall survival: 76% +/- 10% vs 53% +/- 13%, P = 0.40; five-year event-free survival: 55% +/- 13% vs 48% +/- 12%, P = 0.90). The five-year cumulative incidence of progression to myeloid leukemia of DS was also similar between the groups (21% vs 24%, P = 0.80). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TAM and nonconstitutional trisomy 21 exhibited similar biology and outcomes to those with TAM and constitutional trisomy 21/DS. The possibility of TAM should be considered even in phenotypically normal neonates with TAM symptoms, for appropriate management.","['Yuzawa, Kentaro', 'Terui, Kiminori', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Kanezaki, Rika', 'Kobayashi, Akie', 'Sato, Tomohiko', 'Kamio, Takuya', 'Kudo, Ko', 'Sasaki, Shinya', 'Endo, Mikiya', 'Ozono, Shuichi', 'Nomura, Keiko', 'Ito, Etsuro']","['Yuzawa K', 'Terui K', 'Toki T', 'Kanezaki R', 'Kobayashi A', 'Sato T', 'Kamio T', 'Kudo K', 'Sasaki S', 'Endo M', 'Ozono S', 'Nomura K', 'Ito E']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, Hirosaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200205,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Down Syndrome/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myelopoiesis/*genetics', 'Survival Rate']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/25 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.28188 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2020 Apr;67(4):e28188. doi: 10.1002/pbc.28188.

Inhibition of DUX4 may represent a therapeutic strategy for these diseases. By applying Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential Enrichment (SELEX), we identified aptamers against DUX4 with specific secondary structural elements conveying high affinity to DUX4 as assessed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence polarization techniques. Sequences analysis of these aptamers revealed the presence of two consensus DUX4 motifs in a reverse complementary fashion forming hairpins interspersed with bulge loops at distinct positions that enlarged the binding surface with the DUX4 protein, as determined by crystal structure analysis. We demonstrate that insertion of specific structural elements into transcription factor binding oligonucleotides can enhance specificity and affinity.","['Klingler, Christian', 'Ashley, Jon', 'Shi, Ke', 'Stiefvater, Adeline', 'Kyba, Michael', 'Sinnreich, Michael', 'Aihara, Hideki', 'Kinter, Jochen']","['Klingler C', 'Ashley J', 'Shi K', 'Stiefvater A', 'Kyba M', 'Sinnreich M', 'Aihara H', 'Kinter J']","['Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Health Technology, Technical University of Denmark, Kgs Lyngby, Denmark.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Neuromuscular Research Group, Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20200205,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (DUX4L1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PAX7 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX7 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aptamers, Nucleotide/*chemistry', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Models, Molecular', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Facioscapulohumeral/*metabolism', 'PAX7 Transcription Factor/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'SELEX Aptamer Technique/*methods']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/01/22 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/22 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fj.201902696 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 2020 Mar;34(3):4573-4590. doi: 10.1096/fj.201902696.

Here we report on demographic and gestational factors in a Taiwanese cohort. Our study included all children born in Taiwan 2004-2014 for whom there was a birth record (n = 2,079,037), of which 1900 children had been diagnosed with cancer prior to age 12. We conducted multivariable hazard regression to examine associations between demographic and gestational factors with cancer. Greater parity (family with 2+ older children) was related to acute myeloid leukemia [Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31, 3.55), central nervous system tumors (HR = 1.67, CI: 1.13, 2.48) and neuroblastoma (HR = 1.67, CI: 1.07, 2.63). Hepatoblastoma cases had a higher risk of low birth weight (<2,500 g; HR = 3.01, CI: 1.85, 4.91), very preterm birth (<33 weeks gestation; HR = 13.71, CI: 7.45, 25.23), plural pregnancies (HR = 2.37, CI: 1.10, 5.14) and both small (HR = 2.13, CI: 1.23, 3.67) and large (HR = 1.83, CI: 1.01, 3.32) for gestational age. Germ cell tumors were more common among children born in rural areas (HR = 1.63, CI: 1.02, 2.60). Despite that Taiwan has lower rates of both high and low birthweight compared to other developed nations, we observed several similar associations to those reported in Western Countries.

Nonetheless, the functional role of lncRNA T cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (TCL6) and its underlying mechanism in HCC remain unclear. Herein, we analyzed the expression of TCL6 and elucidated its mechanistic involvement in HCC. Bioinformatics analyses indicated TCL6 was evidently downregulated in HCC tissues compared with normal controls. TCL6 was downregulated while microRNA-106a-5p (miR-106a-5p) was upregulated in HCC cell lines. Moreover, knockdown or overexpression of TCL6 significantly raised or diminished the expression level of miR-106a-5p in HCC cells, similar to the effect of miR-106a-5p on TCL6 expression. Functionally, TCL6 inhibited the proliferative, migratory, and invasive potentials of HCC cells as analyzed by cell counting kit-8, scratch wound healing, and transwell assays, respectively. Conversely, miR-106a-5p exerted an opposite effect on the proliferative, migratory, and invasive potentials of HCC. RNA immune precipitation and luciferase reporter assays revealed TCL6 directly bound to miR-106a-5p and luciferase reporter assay verified phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was a target gene of miR-106a-5p. Mechanistically, TCL6 knockdown evidently reduced PTEN expression at both messenger RNA and protein levels, and miR-106a-5p inhibitor partially rescued this reduction effect in HCC cells. Additionally, western blot assays demonstrated miR-106a-5p downregulation or TCL6 overexpression promoted the protein level of PTEN, and suppressed the phosphorylation level of AKT, the protein level of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Collectively, these results revealed TCL6 as a tumor-suppressive lncRNA regulates PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via directly binding to miR-106a-5p in HCC. This mechanism provides a theoretical basis for HCC pathogenesis and a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC treatment.","['Luo, Li-Hua', 'Jin, Min', 'Wang, Lan-Qing', 'Xu, Guo-Jie', 'Lin, Zhen-Yu', 'Yu, Dan-Dan', 'Yang, Sheng-Li', 'Ran, Rui-Zhi', 'Wu, Gang', 'Zhang, Tao']","['Luo LH', 'Jin M', 'Wang LQ', 'Xu GJ', 'Lin ZY', 'Yu DD', 'Yang SL', 'Ran RZ', 'Wu G', 'Zhang T']","['Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Oncology II, The Central Hospital of Enshi Autonomous Prefecture, Enshi Clinical College of Wuhan University, Enshi, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Oncology II, The Central Hospital of Enshi Autonomous Prefecture, Enshi Clinical College of Wuhan University, Enshi, Hubei, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200205,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (MIRN106 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long noncoding RNA TCL6, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/03/12 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/12 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29544 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Sep;235(9):6154-6166. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29544.

The standard therapy for glioblastoma is maximal safe resection, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide. New approaches to treatment of glioblastoma, such as targeting metabolism, have been studied. The object of this study is to evaluate whether asparagine could be a new target for treatment of glioblastoma. METHODS: We investigated a potential treatment for glioblastoma that targets the amino acid metabolism. U251, U87, and SF767 glioblastoma cells were treated with L-asparaginase and/or 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON). L-asparaginase hydrolyzes asparagine into aspartate and depletes asparagine. L-asparaginase has been used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. DON is a glutamine analog that inhibits several glutamine-utilizing enzymes, including asparagine synthetase. RESULTS: Cell viability was measured after 72 h of treatment. MTS assay showed that L-asparaginase suppressed the proliferation of U251, U87, and SF767 cells in a dose-dependent manner. DON also inhibited the proliferation of these cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Combined treatment with these drugs had a synergistic antiproliferative effect in these cell lines. Exogenous asparagine rescued the effect of inhibition of proliferation by L-asparaginase and DON. The expression of asparagine synthetase mRNA was increased in cells treated with a combination of L-asparaginase and DON. This combined treatment also induced greater apoptosis and autophagy than did single-drug treatment. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the combination of L-asparaginase and DON could be a new therapeutic option for patients with glioblastoma.","['Ohba, Shigeo', 'Hirose, Yuichi']","['Ohba S', 'Hirose Y']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, 4701192, Japan. shigeo.ohba@gmail.com.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Fujita Health University, Toyoake, 4701192, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200204,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '03J0H273KZ (Diazooxonorleucine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/*administration & dosage', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diazooxonorleucine/*administration & dosage', 'Glioblastoma/*metabolism', 'Humans']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/11/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11060-019-03351-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11060-019-03351-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2020 Feb;146(3):469-475. doi: 10.1007/s11060-019-03351-4.

RO6839921 is an inactive pegylated prodrug of the oral MDM2 antagonist idasanutlin (active principle [AP]) that allows for IV administration. This phase 1 monotherapy study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RO6839921 in patients with AML. Primary objectives identified dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives assessed pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and antileukemic activity. A total of 26 patients received 120-300 mg AP of idasanutlin. The MTD was 200 mg, with DLTs at 250 (2/8 patients) and 300 mg (2/5). Treatment-related adverse events in >20% of patients were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and fatigue. Six deaths (23.1%) occurred, all unrelated to treatment. Pharmacokinetics showed rapid and near-complete conversion of the prodrug to AP and dose-proportional exposure across doses. Variability ranged from 30%-47% (22%-54% for idasanutlin). TP53 was 21 (87.5%) wild-type and 3 mutant (12.5%). The composite response rate (complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete hematologic recovery/morphological leukemia-free state [CRi/MLFS], or CR without platelet recovery [CRp]) was 7.7%. Antileukemic activity (CR, CRi/MLFS, partial response, hematologic improvement/stable disease) was observed in 11 patients (disease control rate, 42%): 10/11 were TP53 wild-type; 1 had no sample. p53 activation was demonstrated by MIC-1 induction and was associated with AP exposure. There was not sufficient differentiation or improvement in the biologic or safety profile compared with oral idasanutlin to support continued development of RO6839921.

However, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mechanisms to increase the efficacy of immunotherapeutic approaches have to be further elucidated. Targeting leukemic progenitor and stem cells (LPC/LSC) by specific CTL, for instance, in an adjuvant setting or in minimal residual disease, might be an option to prevent relapse of AML or to treat MRD. Therefore, we investigated the influence of immune checkpoint inhibitors on LAA-specific immune responses by CTL against leukemic myeloid blasts and colony-forming cells including leukemic progenitor cells (CFC/LPC). In functional immunoassays like CFU/CFI (colony-forming units/immunoassays) and ELISpot analysis, we detected specific LAA-directed immune responses against CFC/LPC that are postulated to be the source population of relapse of the disease. The addition of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) significantly increases LAA-directed immune responses against CFC/LPC, no effect is seen when ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) is added. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab does not improve the effect compared to nivolumab alone. The anti-PD1-directed immune response correlates to PD-L1 expression on progenitor cells. Our data suggest that immunotherapeutic approaches have the potential to target malignant CFC/LPC and anti-PD-1 antibodies could be an immunotherapeutic approach in AML. Moreover, combination with LAA-directed vaccination strategies might also open interesting application possibilities.","['Greiner, Jochen', 'Gotz, Marlies', 'Hofmann, Susanne', 'Schrezenmeier, Hubert', 'Wiesneth, Markus', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Schneider, Vanessa']","['Greiner J', 'Gotz M', 'Hofmann S', 'Schrezenmeier H', 'Wiesneth M', 'Bullinger L', 'Dohner H', 'Schneider V']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081, Ulm, Germany. greiner@diak-stuttgart.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Diakonie Hospital Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany. greiner@diak-stuttgart.de.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessia, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Clinical Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics Ulm, German Red Cross Blood Donation Service Baden-Wurttemberg - Hessia, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumorimmunology, Charite University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Helmholtzstr. 10, 89081, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200204,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Ipilimumab)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '31YO63LBSN (Nivolumab)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B7-H1 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Ipilimumab/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Nivolumab/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/04/21 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-020-02490-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-020-02490-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2020 Apr;69(4):629-640. doi: 10.1007/s00262-020-02490-2.

Glycolysis has been a popular topic of research in recent years, with increasing uptake and consumption of glucose. The present study aimed to investigate the glycolysis of tumor cells in patients with AML; in particular, how programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) regulates tumor cells glycolysis using real time PCR (RTPCR), western blotting and flow cytometry. PDL1 high expression predicted poor outcome in patients with AML in the public database Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. PDL1 expression was decreased in the samples from patients with AML with complete remission compared to that in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. In AML cell lines, glycolysisassociated genes ALDOA, PGK1, LDHA and HK2 were highly expressed in a PDL1 highexpressed cell line. Overexpressed PDL1 enhanced glucose consumption and the extracellular acidification rate, accompanied by decreased apoptosis and accumulation of cells in the S phase. In contrast, the apoptosis rate of tumor cells and the percentage of cells in the S phase were significantly increased following PDL1 knockdown in the THP1 cell line. HK2 and LDHA expression decreased after AML tumor cells were treated with Akt inhibitor or rapamycin. In addition, the PDL1overexpressed cell line (PDL1OV) MOLM13 exhibited rapid tumor progression. Glycolysisassociated genes were highly expressed in tumor tissues of PDL1OV MOLM13, with increased Ki67.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether an alternative treatment with tumor necrosis factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) that induces tumor cell death via the extrinsic apoptotic pathway may be effective against chemotherapyresistant urothelial cancer cell lines. The viability of the urothelial cancer cell line RT112 and its chemotherapyadapted sublines was investigated by MTT assay. The expression of antiapoptotic proteins was determined by western blotting and the individual roles of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP)1, cIAP2, xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and induced myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein (Mcl1) were investigated by siRNAmediated depletion. In particular, the bladder cancer sublines that were resistant to gemcitabine and cisplatin were crossresistant to TRAIL. Resistant cells displayed upregulation of antiapoptotic molecules compared with the parental cell line. Treatment with the second mitochondrial activator of caspases (SMAC) mimetic LCL161 that antagonizes cIAP1, cIAP2 and XIAP resensitized chemoresistant cells to TRAIL. The resensitization of tumor cells to TRAIL was confirmed by depletion of antiapoptotic proteins with siRNA. Collectively, the findings of the present study demonstrated that SMAC mimetic LCL161 increased the sensitivity of the parental cell line RT112 and chemotherapyresistant sublines to TRAIL, suggesting that inhibiting antiapoptotic molecules renders TRAIL therapy highly effective for chemotherapysensitive and resistant urothelial cancer cells.","['Vallo, Stefan', 'Stege, Henner', 'Berg, Maximilian', 'Michaelis, Martin', 'Winkelmann, Ria', 'Rothweiler, Florian', 'Cinatl, Jindrich Jr']","['Vallo S', 'Stege H', 'Berg M', 'Michaelis M', 'Winkelmann R', 'Rothweiler F', 'Cinatl J Jr']","['Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, D60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, D60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, D60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Centre for Molecular Processing and School of Biosciences, University of Kent, CT2 7NZ Canterbury, UK.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Frankfurt, D60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, D60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University Hospital Frankfurt, D60596 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200203,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (LCL161)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Caspase 3/drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Urothelium/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2020.7487 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2020 Apr;43(4):1331-1337. doi: 10.3892/or.2020.7487.

Strategies to reduce immunosuppression in order to prevent relapse have been offset by increases in severe GVHD and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). We recently validated the MAGIC algorithm probability (MAP) that predicts the risk for severe GVHD and NRM in asymptomatic patients using serum biomarkers. In this study we tested whether the MAP could identify patients whose risk for relapse is higher than their risk for severe GVHD and NRM. The multicenter study population (n = 1604) was divided into two cohorts: historical (2006-2015, n = 702) and current (2015-2017, n = 902) with similar NRM, relapse, and survival. On day 28 post-HCT, patients who had not developed GVHD (75% of the population) and who possessed a low MAP were at much higher risk for relapse (24%) than severe GVHD and NRM (16 and 9%); this difference was even more pronounced in patients with a high disease risk index (relapse 33%, NRM 9%). Such patients are good candidates to test relapse prevention strategies that might enhance GVL.","['Aziz, Mina D', 'Shah, Jay', 'Kapoor, Urvi', 'Dimopoulos, Christina', 'Anand, Sarah', 'Augustine,

In the second cycle, patients received cytarabine 1000 mg/m(2) twice daily on days 1-6 with or without lenalidomide (20 mg/day 1-21). The CR/CRi rates in the two arms were not different (69 vs. 66%).

However, this approach has evolved in the current era of drug development, with multiple other development pathways now being utilized. Indeed, treatment approaches designed on the basis of an improved understanding of cancer biology have led to unprecedented responses in early phase trials, sometimes resulting in drug approvals in the absence of large-scale trials. At the same time, improved molecular diagnostic technologies have led to the identification of ever-smaller patient subgroups for molecularly targeted therapy. Moreover, new FDA regulatory paradigms have enabled the rapid review and accelerated approval of certain drugs in the absence of survival data. Regulatory approvals based on large-cohort trials with surrogate or intermediate clinical end points or on non-inferiority trials, as well as new tumour-agnostic indications, also set important precedents in the field. In this Viewpoint, we asked two leading oncologists involved in clinical drug development, an expert in regulatory science and prescription drug policy and a prominent patient advocate, to provide their opinions on the implications of these changes in regulatory practices for patient care.","['Kurzrock, Razelle', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Kesselheim, Aaron S', 'Sigal, Ellen V']","['Kurzrock R', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Kesselheim AS', 'Sigal EV']","['Center for Personalized Cancer Therapy and the Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA, USA. rkurzrock@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA. hkantarjian@mdanderson.org.', ""Program On Regulation, Therapeutics, And Law (PORTAL), Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. akesselheim@bwh.harvard.edu."", 'Friends of Cancer Research, Washington, DC, USA. esigal@focr.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20200204,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

We previously developed a novel prognostic model, hematopoietic cell transplant composite-risk (HCT-CR) by incorporating the refined disease risk index (DRI-R) and hematopoietic cell transplant-comorbidity/age index (HCT-CI/Age) to predict post-transplant survival in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Here we aimed to validate and prove the generalizability of the HCT-CR model in an independent cohort of patients with hematologic malignancies receiving AHCT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Data of consecutive adult patients receiving AHCT for various hematologic malignancies were analyzed. Patients were stratified into four HCT-CR risk groups. The discrimination, calibration performance, and clinical net benefit of the HCT-CR model were tested. RESULTS: The HCT-CR model stratified patients into four risk groups with significantly different overall survival (OS). Three-year OS was 67.4%, 50%, 37.5%, and 29.9% for low, intermediate, high, and very high-risk group, respectively (P < 0.001). The HCT-CR model had better discrimination on OS prediction when compared with the DRI-R and HCT-CI/Age (C-index was 0.69 vs. 0.59 and 0.56, respectively, P < 0.001). The decision curve analysis showed that HCT-CR model provided better clinical utility for patient selection for post-transplant clinical trial than the ""treat all"" or ""treat none"" strategy and the use of the DRI-R and HCT-CI/Age model separately. CONCLUSIONS: The HCT-CR can be effectively used to predict post-transplant survival in patients with various hematologic malignancies. This composite model can identify patients who will benefit the most from transplantation and helps physicians in making decisions regarding post-transplant therapy to improve outcomes.","['Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Kongtim, Piyanuch', 'Hasan, Omar', 'Ramos Perez, Jorge M', 'Torres, Janet', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Ciurea SO', 'Kongtim P', 'Hasan O', 'Ramos Perez JM', 'Torres J', 'Rondon G', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. sciurea@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Center of Excellence in Clinical Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20200204,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/02/05 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2019/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/05 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-3919 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3919 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2020 May 15;26(10):2404-2410. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-3919.

The graft versus leukemia effect, driven by donor T cells, plays a major role in its curative potential. This effect is sometimes very evident when patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia relapse after AHCT and are treated with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs). We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 64 patients who received DLI between 2012 and 2017 in our center. The mean age of the patients was 59 years (range, 34-79). Fifty percent were male (n = 32). The mean follow-up time after AHCT was 50.17 months (range, 8-174). The indication for DLI were disease progression, mixed chimerism, minimal residual disease, and other etiologies in 43.8%, 40.7%, 14%, and 1.5% of patients, respectively. The most common diagnosis was acute leukemia, followed by multiple myeloma. Of all patients, 59.4% received a transplant from a related donor, 39% received a transplant from an unrelated donor, and 1.6% received a transplant from a haploidentical donor. Reduced-intensity conditioning AHCT was the most frequent regimen used (53%). DLI was given alone in 79.7% of patients. Prophylactic DLI was given at 30 days after transplantation in patients who received human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related human stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or 45 to 60 days post-transplant in patients receiving haploidentical HSCT or HLA-matched unrelated HSCT. Patients were treated without graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The use of DLI after transplantation remains a feasible procedure with rates of response >60%. Moreover, DLIs are well tolerated with a GVHD rate <10% in our series. We can hypothesize that in our experience the efficacy of this strategy does not rely on the induction of GVHD.","['Kerbage, Fouad', 'Sakr, Riwa', 'Lapierre, Valerie', 'Alexandrova, Kamelia', 'Coman, Tereza', 'Leroux, Severine', 'Lucas, Nolwenn', 'Pilorge, Sylvain', 'Solary, Eric', 'Bourhis, Jean-Henri', 'Castilla-Llorente, Cristina']","['Kerbage F', 'Sakr R', 'Lapierre V', 'Alexandrova K', 'Coman T', 'Leroux S', 'Lucas N', 'Pilorge S', 'Solary E', 'Bourhis JH', 'Castilla-Llorente C']","['Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.

Survival analyses were performed for NK-AML pediatric patients with different combinations of mutations.Results: We found that 28(12.7%) NK-AML patients harbored WT1 mutations. The positive rate of FLT3-ITD in the WT1-mutated group was higher than that in the WT1 wild-type group (P = 0.002). In contrast, WT1 mutation and NPM1 mutation were mutually exclusive (P = 0.013). Furthermore, the WT1-mutated group suffered lower rates of complete remission (CR) (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) but higher rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) (P = 0.003 and P = 0.021, respectively) after both one and two courses of induction chemotherapy. Patients with WT1 mutations had significantly worse overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in both univariate (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively) and multivariate survival analyses (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). The stratification analysis showed that for FLT3-ITD positive patients, WT1 mutations predicted shorter OS (P = 0.003) and EFS (P < 0.001).Conclusion: WT1 mutations conferred an independent poor prognosis for NK-AML pediatric patients.","['Xu, Jing', 'Zhang, Yaofang', 'Hu, Jinjun', 'Ren, Yan', 'Wang, Hongwei']","['Xu J', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu J', 'Ren Y', 'Wang H']","[""The Second Clinical Medical College, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, People's Republic of China."", ""The Second Clinical Medical College, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, People's Republic of China."", ""The Second Clinical Medical College, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, People's Republic of China."", ""The Second Clinical Medical College, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/02/06 06:00'],"['2020/02/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2020.1720102 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2020 Dec;25(1):79-84. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2020.1720102.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'NPM1 mutation', 'Normal karyotype', 'TCGA database', 'WT1 mutation', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical feature', 'prognosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the potential molecules that act as switch nodes in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is still elusive. Phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) has been shown to regulate leukocyte differentiation, while its role in autophagy/apoptosis toggle switch remains unexplored. In this study, we showed that sodium selenite switched protective autophagy to apoptosis in p53-wild type NB4 cells without obvious caspase-8/apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) axis activation, while induced autophagy-dependent caspase-8/AIF axis activation in p53-mutant Jurkat cells. Additionally, p53 was demonstrated as a positive regulator of PLSCR1. p53-dependent up-regulation of PLSCR1 accounted for the differential regulation of autophagy and apoptosis induced by sodium selenite. Furthermore, sodium selenite induced the release of AIF from mitochondria to cytosol with the facilitation of caspase-8 in Jurkat cells, while not in NB4 cells. The released AIF further enhanced autophagy flux through interacting with PLSCR1, which hereby resulting in the disassociation of PLSCR1 from Atg5-Atg12 complex. Our results indicate that PLSCR1 plays a critical role in p53-dependent regulation of autophagy and apoptosis in sodium selenite-treated leukemia cells. Manipulation of p53-PLSCR1 cascade might be beneficial to enhance the anti-tumor effects of sodium selenite.","['Shi, Kejian', 'An, Jiajia', 'Qian, Kun', 'Zhao, Xin', 'Li, Feng', 'Ma, Xiaowei', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhang, Yi']","['Shi K', 'An J', 'Qian K', 'Zhao X', 'Li F', 'Ma X', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang Y']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100053, PR China; Beijing Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopaedics, Beijing, 100035, PR China; State Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medicine Sciences & School of Basic Medicine, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100005, PR China.

In the emerging field of histone demethylase inhibitors, JMJD1C therefore became a potential target. Depletion of Jmjd1c expression significantly reduced cytokine-independent growth in an MPN cell line, indicating a role for JMJD1C in MPN disease maintenance. Here, we investigated a potential role for the demethylase in MPN disease initiation. We introduced a Cre-inducible JAK2V617F mutation into Jmjd1c knockout mice. We show that Jmjd1c is dispensable, both for healthy hematopoiesis as well as for JAK2V617F-driven MPN disease initiation. Jmjd1c knockout mice did not show any significant changes in peripheral blood composition. Likewise, introduction of JAK2V617F into Jmjd1c-/- mice led to a similar MPN phenotype as JAK2V617F in a Jmjd1c wt background. This indicates that there is a difference between the role of JMJD1C in leukemic stem cells and in MPN. In the latter, JMJC domain-containing family members may serve redundant roles, compensating for the loss of individual proteins.","['Staehle, Hans F', 'Heinemann, Johannes', 'Gruender, Albert', 'Omlor, Anne M', 'Pahl, Heike Luise', 'Jutzi, Jonas Samuel']","['Staehle HF', 'Heinemann J', 'Gruender A', 'Omlor AM', 'Pahl HL', 'Jutzi JS']","['Division of Molecular Hematology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200204,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 1.14.11.- (JMJD1c protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Embryonic Development', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0228362 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-29589 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2020 Feb 4;15(2):e0228362. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0228362. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0002-1977-153X'],,,PMC6999878,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate treatment outcomes, loss of lifetime and relapse risk in adult BL patients treated with intensive immunochemotherapy, retrospective clinic-based and population-based lymphoma registries from six countries were used to identify 264 real-world patients. The median age was 47 years and the majority had advanced-stage disease and elevated LDH. Treatment protocols were R-CODOX-M/IVAC (47%), R-hyper-CVAD (16%), DA-EPOCH-R (11%), R-BFM/GMALL (25%) and other (2%) leading to an overall response rate of 89%. The two-year overall survival and event-free survival were 84% and 80% respectively. For patients in complete remission/unconfirmed, the two-year relapse risk was 6% but diminished to 0.6% for patients reaching 12 months of post-remission event-free survival (pEFS12). The loss of lifetime for pEFS12 patients was 0.4 (95% CI: -0.7 to 2) months. In conclusion, real-world outcomes of adult BL are excellent following intensive immunochemotherapy. For pEFS12 patients, the relapse risk was low and life expectancy similar to that of a general population, which is important information for developing meaningful follow-up strategies with increased focus on survivorship and less focus on routine disease surveillance.","['Jakobsen, Lasse H', 'Ellin, Fredrik', 'Smeland, Knut B', 'Wasterlid, Tove', 'Christensen, Jacob H', 'Jorgensen, Judit M', 'Josefsson, Par L', 'Ovlisen, Andreas K', 'Holte, Harald', 'Blaker, Yngvild N', 'Grauslund, Jacob H', 'Bjorn, Jon', 'Molin, Daniel', 'Lagerlof, Ingemar', 'Smedby, Karin E', 'Colvin, Katherine', 'Thanarajasingam, Gita', 'Maurer, Matthew J', 'Habermann, Thomas M', 'Song, Kevin W', 'Zhu, Katie Y', 'Gerrie, Alina S', 'Cheah, Chan Y', 'El-Galaly, Tarec C']","['Jakobsen LH', 'Ellin F', 'Smeland KB', 'Wasterlid T', 'Christensen JH', 'Jorgensen JM', 'Josefsson PL', 'Ovlisen AK', 'Holte H', 'Blaker YN', 'Grauslund JH', 'Bjorn J', 'Molin D', 'Lagerlof I', 'Smedby KE', 'Colvin K', 'Thanarajasingam G', 'Maurer MJ', 'Habermann TM', 'Song KW', 'Zhu KY', 'Gerrie AS', 'Cheah CY', 'El-Galaly TC']","['Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences Lund, Oncology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine Solna, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Herlev Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell malignancies, Oslo, Norway.', 'KG Jebsen Centre for B-cell malignancies, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Roskilde Sygehus, Roskilde, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Experimental and Clinical Oncology, Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Division of Drug Research, Department of Medical and Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine Solna, Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, WA, Australia.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of BC, Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, BC Cancer, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, Pathwest Laboratory Medicine WA, Nedlands, Australia.', 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Crawley, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200204,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/01/13 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16425 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 May;189(4):661-671. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16425.

Implementation of continuous VI must assure a specific minimum incubation time, typically 60 min. To guarantee the minimum incubation time, we implemented a packed bed continuous viral inactivation reactor (CVIR) with narrow residence time distribution (RTD) for low pH incubation. We show that the RTD does not broaden significantly over a wide range of linear flow velocities-which highlights the flexibility and robustness of the design. Prolonged exposure to acidic pH has no impact on bed stability, assuring constant RTD throughout long term operation. The suitability of the packed bed CVIR for low pH inactivation is shown with two industry-standard model viruses, that is xenotropic murine leukemia virus and pseudorabies virus. Controls at neutral pH showed no system-induced VI. At low pH, significant VI is observed, even after only 15 min. Based on the low pH inactivation kinetics, the continuous process is equivalent to traditional batch operation. This study establishes a concept for continuous low pH inactivation and, together with previous reports, highlights the versatility of the packed bed reactor for continuous VI, regardless of the inactivation method.","['Martins, Duarte L', 'Sencar, Jure', 'Hammerschmidt, Nikolaus', 'Flicker, Andreas', 'Kindermann, Johanna', 'Kreil, Thomas R', 'Jungbauer, Alois']","['Martins DL', 'Sencar J', 'Hammerschmidt N', 'Flicker A', 'Kindermann J', 'Kreil TR', 'Jungbauer A']","['Austria Centre for Industrial Biotechnology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Austria Centre for Industrial Biotechnology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Austria Centre for Industrial Biotechnology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Virology, Global Pathogen Safety, Takeda, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Virology, Global Pathogen Safety, Takeda, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Virology, Global Pathogen Safety, Takeda, Vienna, Austria.', 'Austria Centre for Industrial Biotechnology, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Biotechnology, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200224,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,['0 (Biological Products)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Biological Products/chemistry/isolation & purification', '*Bioreactors', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/physiology', '*Virus Inactivation']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/07/13 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.27292 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2020 May;117(5):1406-1417. doi: 10.1002/bit.27292.

However, its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the correlation of miR-133 expression with clinical variables and prognosis in AML patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to analyze blood samples from 145 patients with AML and 70 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Decreased miR-133 levels were observed in AML patients and closely associated with aggressive clinical parameters, such as white blood cells and poor Karyotype subgroups. In addition, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that serum miR-133 could efficiently screen AML patients from normal controls with high sensitivity and specificity. More interestingly, serum miR-133 levels were remarkably elevated in the patients with favorable response after standard induction chemotherapy or achieving a complete remission. Furthermore, patients in the high serum miR-133 expression group had better overall survival and recurrence-free survival than those in the low serum miR-133 expression group. Meanwhile, multivariate analysis identified serum miR-133 as a significant independent predictor for survival. CONCLUSIONS: Low miR-133 expression was a common event and correlated with worse clinical outcome in AML, suggesting that serum miR-133 might serve as a promising indicator for the early detection and prognosis evaluation of AML.","['Zheng, Z-Z', 'Ma, Y-P', 'Wu, R-H', 'Rong, G', 'Li, C', 'Li, G-X', 'Ren, F-G', 'Xu, L-J']","['Zheng ZZ', 'Ma YP', 'Wu RH', 'Rong G', 'Li C', 'Li GX', 'Ren FG', 'Xu LJ']","['The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Shanxi Province, China. mayanping1988@sohu.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN133 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/02/13 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_202001_20060 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2020 Jan;24(2):777-783. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_202001_20060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In more than 55% of cases of human cancers, loss of the essential function of p53 protein is found. In numerous reports, it has been shown that small molecules (chemical compounds) can restore the suppressor function of the mutant p53 protein in tumor cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential anticancer activity of three newly synthesized olivacine derivatives. METHODS: The study was performed using two cell lines-CCRF/CEM (containing the mutant p53 protein) and A549 (containing a non-mutant, wild-type p53 protein). The cells were incubated with olivacine derivatives for 18 h and then assays were carried out: measurement of the amount of p53 and p21 proteins, detection of apoptosis, cell cycle analysis, and rhodamine 123 accumulation assay (evaluation of P-glycoprotein inhibition). Multiple-criteria decision analysis was used to compare the anticancer activity of the tested compounds. RESULTS: Each tested compound caused the reconstitution of suppressor activity of the p53 protein in cells with the mutant protein. In addition, one of the compounds showed significant antitumor activity in both wild-type and mutant cells. For all compounds, a stronger effect on the level of the p53 protein was observed than for the reference compound-ellipticine. CONCLUSIONS: The observed effects of the tested new olivacine derivatives (pyridocarbazoles) suggest that they are good candidates for new anticancer drugs.","['Gebarowski, Tomasz', 'Wiatrak, Benita', 'Gebczak, Katarzyna', 'Tylinska, Beata', 'Gasiorowski, Kazimierz']","['Gebarowski T', 'Wiatrak B', 'Gebczak K', 'Tylinska B', 'Gasiorowski K']","['Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 211, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 211, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland. benita.wiatrak@umed.wroc.pl.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 211, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Wroclaw Medical University, Borowska 211, 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20200108,Switzerland,Pharmacol Rep,Pharmacological reports : PR,101234999,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '5WSL5LL2C3 (olivacine)']",IM,"['A549 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'BALB 3T3 Cells', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ellipticines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s43440-019-00004-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s43440-019-00004-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Rep. 2020 Feb;72(1):214-224. doi: 10.1007/s43440-019-00004-1.

Specifically, in chronic myeloid leukemia, we have reported that high expression of the LMWPTP maintains Src and Bcr-Abl kinases in an activated status and the glucose metabolism is directed to lactate production and, in turn, favor the pentoses pathway (one of the key process for antioxidant and protective responses). In this present study, we investigated the possible correlation between the LMWPTP and autophagy. In resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells, the antioxidant response is supported by the glycolytic metabolism and antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and catalase, both favored by the LMWPTP. Therefore, when the cells were challenged by hydrogen peroxide treatment, the LMWPTP level goes down as well as SOD, and in turn, autophagy process was stimulated. The findings presented here reveal a novel aspect by which LMWPTP cooperates for the resistance of CML towards stressor stimuli.","['Faria, Alessandra V S', 'Clerici, Stefano P', 'de Souza Oliveira, Patricia F', 'Queiroz, Karla C S', 'Peppelenbosch, Maikel P', 'Ferreira-Halder, Carmen V']","['Faria AVS', 'Clerici SP', 'de Souza Oliveira PF', 'Queiroz KCS', 'Peppelenbosch MP', 'Ferreira-Halder CV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Tissue Biology, University of Campinas, UNICAMP, Campinas, SP, Brazil. carmenv@unicamp.br.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200204,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (ACP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*metabolism', '*Autophagy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/10/08 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-020-03690-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-020-03690-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2020 Mar;466(1-2):83-89. doi: 10.1007/s11010-020-03690-1.

Since silencing complementary targets may offer improved efficacy, this study was undertaken to identify non-viral carriers for combinatorial siRNA delivery for more effective therapy. METHODS: A library of lipid-substituted polymers from low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI), linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linoleic acid (alphaLA) with amide or thioester linkages was prepared and investigated for delivering Mcl-1, survivin and STAT5A siRNAs in breast cancer cells. RESULTS: The effective polymers formed 80-190 nm particles with similar zeta-potentials, but the serum stability was greater for complexes formed with amide-linked lipid conjugates. The LA and alphaLA substitutions, with the low molecular weight PEI (1.2 kDa and 2.0 kDa) were able to deliver siRNA effectively to cells and retarded the growth of breast cancer cells. The amide-linked lipid substituents showed higher cellular delivery of siRNA as compared to thioester linkages. Upon combinational delivery of siRNAs, growth of MCF-7 cells was inhibited to a greater extent with 2.0PEI-LA9 mediated delivery of Mcl-1 combined survivin siRNAs as compared to individual siRNAs. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the decrease in mRNA levels of target genes with specific siRNAs and 2.0PEI-LA9 was the most effective polymer for delivering siRNAs (either single or in combination). CONCLUSIONS: This study yielded effective siRNA carriers for combinational delivery of siRNAs. Careful choice of siRNA combinations will be critical since targeting individual genes might alter the expression of other critical mediators.","['Plianwong, Samarwadee', 'Thapa, Bindu', 'Kc, Remant Bahadur', 'Kucharski, Cezary', 'Rojanarata, Theerasak', 'Uludag, Hasan']","['Plianwong S', 'Thapa B', 'Kc RB', 'Kucharski C', 'Rojanarata T', 'Uludag H']","['Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Silpakorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Silpakorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Chemical & Material Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. hasan.uludag@ualberta.ca.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. hasan.uludag@ualberta.ca.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. hasan.uludag@ualberta.ca.', 'Chemical & Materials Engineering Department, 2-021 RTF, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. hasan.uludag@ualberta.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200203,United States,Pharm Res,Pharmaceutical research,8406521,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9002-98-6 (Polyethyleneimine)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Carriers/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'Humans', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Lipids', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Polyethyleneimine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Polymers/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Survivin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/12/18 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11095-020-2770-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11095-020-2770-9 [pii]']",epublish,Pharm Res. 2020 Feb 3;37(3):46. doi: 10.1007/s11095-020-2770-9.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1118-4170'],"['N/A/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', 'N/A/Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada', 'N/A/Breasy Cancer Foundation of Canada']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-apoptotic proteins', 'breast cancer', 'linoleic acid', 'lipopolymers', 'non-viral delivery', 'siRNA delivery']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a computational chemogenomics approach was used to identify new molecular targets and drugs for APL treatment. The transcriptional profiles induced by APL were compared with those induced by genetic or chemical perturbations. The genes that can reverse the transcriptional profiles induced by APL when perturbed were considered to be potential therapeutic targets for APL. Drugs targeting these genes or proteins are predicted to be able to treat APL if they can reverse the APL-induced transcriptional profiles. To improve the target identification accuracy of the above correlation method, we plotted the functional protein association networks of the predicted targets by STRING. The results determined PML, RARA, SPI1, HDAC3, CEBPA, NPM1, ABL1, BCR, PTEN, FOS, PDGFRB, FGFR1, NUP98, AFF1, and MEIS1 to be top candidates. Interestingly, the functions of PML, RARA, HDAC3, CEBPA, NPM1, ABL, and BCR in APL have been previously reported in the literature. This is the first chemogenomics analysis predicting potential APL drug targets, and the findings could be used to guide the design of new drugs targeting refractory and recurrent APL.","['Chen, Si', 'Li, Xiang', 'Ma, Shifan', 'Xing, Xinrui', 'Wang, Xiaobo', 'Zhu, Zhenyu']","['Chen S', 'Li X', 'Ma S', 'Xing X', 'Wang X', 'Zhu Z']","[""Department of Pharmacy, 967th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, 80 Shengli Road, Xigang district, Dalian, 116011, Liaoning, China."", 'School of Medicine, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, 325 Guohe road, Yangpu district, Shanghai, 200433, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, 325 Guohe road, Yangpu district, Shanghai, 200433, China.', ""Department of Pharmacy, 967th Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, 80 Shengli Road, Xigang district, Dalian, 116011, Liaoning, China. wxbbenson0653@sina.com."", 'School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, 325 Guohe road, Yangpu district, Shanghai, 200433, China. zzyzyfzhu@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200204,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Cheminformatics', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Drug Design', '*Drug Development', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcriptome']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/04/10 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03888-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03888-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2020 Apr;99(4):753-763. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03888-4.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of RSV on interleukin (IL)33induced inflammatory responses in mast cells and identify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL2H3) cells were stimulated with IL33 in the presence or absence of RSV. MTT, ELISA, reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR and western blot analyses were then performed in order to assess cytotoxicity, inflammatory cytokine production, suppression of tumorigenicity 2 receptor expression, protein expression involved in mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)kappaB signaling, respectively. Finally, rats were used to determine the biological effect of RSV in vivo. The results revealed that RSV inhibited cell viability and increased cytotoxicity in a dosedependent manner. Medium concentration of RSV (10 microM) treatment attenuated inflammatory cytokine production, such as IL6, IL13, tumor necrosis factoralpha and monocyte chemotactic protein1, and curbed IL33induced enhancement of immunoglobulin Emediated responses in RBL2H3 cells, which were associated with the suppression of NFkappaBmediated transcription and inhibition of P38 phosphorylation in response to IL33 stimulation, but not extracellular signal regulated kinase or JNK. Notably, RSV application also decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines in rats induced by IL33 injection, which was similar to the antiinflammatory effect in vitro. The data from the present study demonstrated that RSV played a regulatory role in antagonizing the effects of IL33 on mast cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that it has therapeutic potential in IL33mediated inflammatory diseases that are associated with mast cells.","['Xu, Yundan', 'Liu, Qiang', 'Guo, Xiaohong', 'Xiang, Lei', 'Zhao, Gang']","['Xu Y', 'Liu Q', 'Guo X', 'Xiang L', 'Zhao G']","['Department of Medical Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, Hubei 430065, P.R.

The AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t (16;16)(p13.1;q22) is associated with a high rate of complete remission (CR) and favorable overall survival (OS) when treated with high-dose Cytarabine. At the inversion breakpoints, deletion of 3'CBFB has been reported, but most of them were studied by chromosome and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. The genomic characteristics of such deletions remain largely undefined, hindering further understanding of the clinical significance of the deletions. Case presentation: We report here two AML cases with inv(16) and deletion of the 5'MYH11/3'CBFB gene fusion, which were characterized by chromosome, FISH, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analyses. Both cases have achieved CR for more than three years. Conclusions: Deletion of 3'CBFB in AML with inv(16) is also accompanied with deletion of 5'MYH11 in all the cases studied by SNP microarray, suggesting that 3'CBFB and 5'MYH11 were most likely deleted together as a fusion product of inv(16) instead of occurring separately. In concert with the findings of other published studies of similar patients, our study suggests that deletion of 5'MYH11/3'CBFB in AML with inv(16) may not have negative impact on the prognosis of the disease.","['Lv, Lili', 'Yu, Jingwei', 'Qi, Zhongxia']","['Lv L', 'Yu J', 'Qi Z']","['1Department of Oncology and Hematology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, China.grid.452829.0', '2Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.0000 0001 2297 6811grid.266102.1', '2Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.0000 0001 2297 6811grid.266102.1']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20200130,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-020-0474-9 [doi]', '474 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2020 Jan 30;13:4. doi: 10.1186/s13039-020-0474-9. eCollection 2020.,['ORCID: 0000-0001-7190-6457'],,['(c) The Author(s). 2020.'],PMC6990480,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML with inv(16)', ""Deletion of 5'MYH11/3'CBFB"", 'SNP microarray']",,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has also been found to be over-expressed in AML patients, with activating mutations in foetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), particularly those with internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), where it transactivates FLT3-ITD and confers resistance to treatment with FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). METHODS: We have previously described a pharmacological approach to treating FLT3-ITD-positive AML that relies on proteasome-mediated FLT3 degradation via inhibition of USP10, the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) responsible for cleaving ubiquitin from FLT3. RESULTS: Here, we show that USP10 is also a major DUB required for stabilisation of SYK. We further demonstrate that degradation of SYK can be induced by USP10-targeting inhibitors. USP10 inhibition leads to death of cells driven by active SYK or oncogenic FLT3 and potentiates the anti-leukemic effects of FLT3 inhibition in these cells. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that USP10 inhibition is a novel approach to inhibiting SYK and impeding its role in the pathology of AML, including oncogenic FLT3-positive AML. Also, given the significant transforming role SYK in other tumours, targeting USP10 may have broader applications in cancer.","['Yang, Jing', 'Meng, Chengcheng', 'Weisberg, Ellen', 'Case, Abigail', 'Lamberto, Ilaria', 'Magin, Robert S', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Gray, Nathanael', 'Liu, Suiyang', 'Stone, Richard', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Buhrlage, Sara', 'Griffin, James D']","['Yang J', 'Meng C', 'Weisberg E', 'Case A', 'Lamberto I', 'Magin RS', 'Adamia S', 'Wang J', 'Gray N', 'Liu S', 'Stone R', 'Sattler M', 'Buhrlage S', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02215, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02215, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02215, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02215, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02215, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, 02215, MA, USA. saraj_buhrlage@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. saraj_buhrlage@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. james_griffin@dfci.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20200204,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (USP10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Syk Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Ubiquitination', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/12/31 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-020-0731-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-020-0731-z [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2020 Apr;122(8):1175-1184. doi: 10.1038/s41416-020-0731-z.

Microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) arrest cells in mitosis and induce apoptotic cell death engaging the BCL2 network. Degradation of the antiapoptotic BCL2 family member MCL-1 is considered to set the time until onset of apoptosis upon MTA treatment. MCL1 degradation involves its interaction with one of its key binding partners, the proapoptotic BH3-only protein NOXA. Here, we report that the mitochondria-associated E3-ligase MARCH5, best known for its role in mitochondrial quality control and regulation of components of the mitochondrial fission machinery, controls the levels of MCL1/NOXA protein complexes in steady state as well as during mitotic arrest. Inhibition of MARCH5 function sensitizes cancer cells to the proapoptotic effects of MTAs by the accumulation of NOXA and primes cancer cells that may undergo slippage to escape death in mitosis to cell death in the next G1 phase. We propose that inhibition of MARCH5 may be a suitable strategy to sensitize cancer cells to antimitotic drug treatment.","['Haschka, Manuel D', 'Karbon, Gerlinde', 'Soratroi, Claudia', ""O'Neill, Katelyn L"", 'Luo, Xu', 'Villunger, Andreas']","['Haschka MD', 'Karbon G', 'Soratroi C', ""O'Neill KL"", 'Luo X', 'Villunger A']","['Institute for Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute for Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Institute for Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffet Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, Fred and Pamela Buffet Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, 68198, USA.', 'Institute for Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, 6020, Innsbruck, Austria. andreas.villunger@i-med.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, 1090, Vienna, Austria. andreas.villunger@i-med.ac.at.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, 1090, Vienna, Austria. andreas.villunger@i-med.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200203,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antimitotic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MARCHF5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antimitotic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', '*Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/09/24 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-020-0503-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-020-0503-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2020 Aug;27(8):2297-2312. doi: 10.1038/s41418-020-0503-6.

In 499 LRF CLL4 cases, a trial with >12 years follow-up, we employed targeted resequencing of 22 genes, identifying 623 mutations. After background mutation rate correction, 11/22 genes were recurrently mutated at frequencies between 3.6% (NFKBIE) and 24% (SF3B1). Mutations beyond Sanger resolution (<12% VAF) were observed in all genes, with KRAS mutations principally composed of these low VAF variants. Firstly, employing orthogonal approaches to confirm <12% VAF TP53 mutations, we assessed the clinical impact of TP53 clonal architecture. Whilst >/= 12% VAF TP53mut cases were associated with reduced PFS and OS, we could not demonstrate a difference between <12% VAF TP53 mutations and either wild type or >/=12% VAF TP53mut cases. Secondly, we identified biallelic BIRC3 lesions (mutation and deletion) as an independent marker of inferior PFS and OS. Finally, we observed that mutated MAPK-ERK genes were independent markers of poor OS in multivariate survival analysis. In conclusion, our study supports using targeted resequencing of expanded gene panels to elucidate the prognostic impact of gene mutations.","['Blakemore, Stuart J', 'Clifford, Ruth', 'Parker, Helen',

The molecular determinants of this pathogenic progression, however, remain largely undefined. Since liver tumorigenesis is driven by apoptosis, we examined the effect of overt hepatocyte apoptosis in a mouse model of NASH using mice lacking myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), a pro-survival member of the BCL-2 protein family. Hepatocyte-specific Mcl1 knockout (Mcl1(hep)) mice and control littermates were fed chow or FFC (high saturated fat, fructose, and cholesterol) diet, which induces NASH, for 4 and 10 months. Thereafter, liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and tumor development were evaluated biochemically and histologically. Mcl1(hep) mice fed with the FFC diet for 4 months displayed a marked increase in liver injury, hepatocyte apoptosis, hepatocyte proliferation, macrophage-associated liver inflammation, and pericellular fibrosis in contrast to chow-fed Mcl1(hep) and FFC diet-fed Mcl1-expressing littermates. After 10 months of feeding, 78% of FFC diet-fed Mcl1(hep) mice developed liver tumors compared to 38% of chow-fed mice of the same genotype. Tumors in FFC diet-fed Mcl1(hep) mice were characterized by cytologic atypia, altered liver architecture, immunopositivity for glutamine synthetase, and histologically qualified as HCC. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that excessive hepatocyte apoptosis exacerbates the NASH phenotype with enhancement of tumorigenesis in mice.","['Hirsova, Petra', 'Bohm, Friederike', 'Dohnalkova, Ester', 'Nozickova, Barbora', 'Heikenwalder, Mathias', 'Gores, Gregory J', 'Weber, Achim']","['Hirsova P', 'Bohm F', 'Dohnalkova E', 'Nozickova B', 'Heikenwalder M', 'Gores GJ', 'Weber A']","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. hirsova.petra@mayo.edu.', 'Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Diagnostics, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. hirsova.petra@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Mendel University in Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Division of Chronic Inflammation and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Pathology, University and University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Molecular Cancer Research (IMCR), University Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200203,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', '*Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Diet/adverse effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hepatitis/pathology', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver/injuries/pathology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/deficiency', 'Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/etiology/*pathology', 'Obesity/etiology/pathology']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/02/17 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-020-2283-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-020-2283-9 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2020 Feb 3;11(2):80. doi: 10.1038/s41419-020-2283-9.,"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0494-0924', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0073-3637']","['P30 DK084567/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK041876/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC6997423,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is mutated in various myeloid neoplasms including AML, especially at the Arg882. Recently, it has been found that DNMT3A mutations frequently coexisted with KMT2A-PTD and are associated with inferior outcomes. We aimed to understand the biological role of DNMT3A mutation in KMT2A-PTD-positive cells. Herein, we found that overexpression of DNMT3A mutants (MT) in KMT2A-PTD-positive EOL-1 cells augmented cell proliferation and clonogenicity. Serial colony replating assays indicated that DNMT3A-MT increased the self-renewal ability of Kmt2a-PTD-expressing mouse bone marrow cells with immature morphology. At 10 months post bone marrow transplantation, mice with the combined Kmt2a-PTD and DNMT3A-MT showed hepatosplenomegaly and leukocytosis with a shorter latency compared to control and DNMT3A-wild-type. Gene expression microarray analyses of bone marrow samples from human AML with KMT2A-PTD/DNMT3A-MT showed a stem cell signature and myeloid hematopoietic lineage with dysregulation of HOXB gene expression. In addition, human bone marrow AML cells carrying KMT2A-PTD/DNMT3A-MT showed abnormal growth and augmented self-renewal activity in primary cell culture. The present study provides information underlying the pathogenic role of DNMT3A-MT with KMT2A-PTD in proliferating advantage with augmentation of self-renewal activity in human leukemia, which may help to better understand the disease and to design better therapy for AML patients with these mutations.","['Bera, Rabindranath', 'Chiu, Ming-Chun', 'Huang, Ying-Jung', 'Huang, Gang', 'Lee, Yun-Shien', 'Shih, Lee-Yung']","['Bera R', 'Chiu MC', 'Huang YJ', 'Huang G', 'Lee YS', 'Shih LY']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', ""Divisions of Pathology and Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", 'School of Health Technologies, Ming Chuan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan. sly7012@adm.cgmh.org.tw.', 'Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan. sly7012@adm.cgmh.org.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200203,United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41389-020-0191-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41389-020-0191-6 [pii]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2020 Feb 3;9(2):7. doi: 10.1038/s41389-020-0191-6.,['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1866-7922'],"['MOST 103-2321-B-182-015, MOST 104-2321-B-182-005/Ministry of Science and', 'Technology, Taiwan (Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan)', 'NHRI-EX103-10003NI/National Health Research Institutes (NHRI)', 'MOHW103-TD-B-111-09/Ministry of Health and Welfare (Ministry of Health and', 'Welfare, Taiwan)', 'OMRPG380031, OMRPG3C0021, and 101-1409B/Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH)']",,PMC6997180,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While frontline chemotherapy regimens are generally very effective, the prognosis for patients whose leukemia returns remains poor. The presence of measurable residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow at the completion of induction therapy is the strongest predictor of relapse, suggesting that strategies to eliminate the residual leukemic blasts from this niche could reduce the incidence of recurrence. We have previously reported that toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists achieve durable T cell-mediated protection in transplantable cell line-based models of B cell precursor leukemia (B-ALL). However, the successful application of TLR agonist therapy in an MRD setting would require the induction of anti-leukemic immune activity specifically in the bone marrow, a site of the chemotherapy-resistant leukemic blasts. In this study, we compare the organ-specific depletion of human and mouse primary B-ALL cells after systemic administration of endosomal TLR agonists. Despite comparable splenic responses, only the TLR9 agonist induced strong innate immune responses in the bone marrow and achieved a near-complete elimination of B-ALL cells. This pattern of response was associated with the most significantly prolonged disease-free survival. Overall, our findings identify innate immune activity in the bone marrow that is associated with durable TLR-induced protection against B-ALL outgrowth.","['Jo, Sumin', 'Fotovati, Abbas', 'Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'van den Elzen, Peter', 'Seif, Alix E', 'Reid, Gregor S D']","['Jo S', 'Fotovati A', 'Duque-Afonso J', 'Cleary ML', 'van den Elzen P', 'Seif AE', 'Reid GSD']","[""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."", ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4H4, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20200110,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/06 06:01,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers12010169 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers12010169 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2020 Jan 10;12(1). pii: cancers12010169. doi: 10.3390/cancers12010169.,"['ORCID: 0000-0003-3739-6734', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1799-2582']",['MOP-126122/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada'],,PMC7016792,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'bone marrow', 'immunotherapy', 'innate immunity', 'minimal residual disease', 'toll-like receptor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MCL-1 inhibits apoptosis, which may be associated with resistance to cancer therapy. Therefore, in this study, the clinical role of MCL-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 80 patients with stage 1-3A NSCLC, who underwent surgery without preoperative treatment between 2010 and 2011. MCL-1 expression and Ki-67 index were determined via immunohistochemical staining. Apoptotic index (AI) was determined via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling. RESULTS: The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis (area under curve=0.6785) revealed that MCL-1 expression in 30.0% of the NSCLC tumor cells was a significant cut-off for predicting prognosis. Tumors were considered MCL-1-positive if staining was observed in >30% of the cells. Thirty-six tumors (45.0%) were MCL-1-positive. However, there were no significant differences between MCL-1 expression and clinical variables. AI was lower in MCL-1-positive (2.2+/-3.6%) than in MCL-1-negative (5.2+/-7.9%) tumors, although the difference was not significant (p=0.1080). The Ki-67 index was significantly higher in MCL-1-positive than in MCL-1-negative tumors (18.0% vs. 3.0%; p<0.001). Five-year survival rate was significantly worse in patients with MCL-1-positive tumors (68.3%) than in those with MCL-1-negative tumors (93.1%, p=0.0057). Univariate [hazard ratio (HR)=5.041, p=0.0013], and multivariate analyses revealed that MCL-1 expression was a significant prognostic factor (HR=3.983, p=0.0411). CONCLUSION: MCL-1 expression in NSCLC cells correlated inversely with AI and positively with Ki-67 index. MCL-1 may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target in NSCLC.","['Nakano, Takayuki', 'Go, Tetsuhiko', 'Nakashima, Nariyasu', 'Liu, Dage', 'Yokomise, Hiroyasu']","['Nakano T', 'Go T', 'Nakashima N', 'Liu D', 'Yokomise H']","['Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan dgliu@med.kagawa-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of General Thoracic Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kagawa University, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'ROC Curve']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2019/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2020/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2020/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['40/2/1007 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.14035 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2020 Feb;40(2):1007-1014. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.14035.,,,"['Copyright(c) 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'myeloid cell leukemia-1', 'non-small cell lung cancer', 'prognosis', 'survival']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these diseases arise from the hematopoietic system, the epigenetic mechanisms that drive these malignancies are quite different. Yet, in all of these tumors, somatic mutations in transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers are the most commonly mutated set of genes and result in multilayered disruption of the epigenome. Myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms generally manifest epigenetic allele diversity, which contributes to tumor cell population fitness regardless of the underlying genetics. Epigenetic therapies are emerging as one of the most promising new approaches for these patients. However, effective targeting of the epigenome must consider the need to restore the various layers of epigenetic marks, appropriate biological end points, and specificity of therapeutic agents to truly realize the potential of this modality.","['Duy, Cihangir', 'Beguelin, Wendy', 'Melnick, Ari']","['Duy C', 'Beguelin W', 'Melnick A']","['Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York 10021, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York 10021, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20201201,United States,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med,Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine,101571139,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mutation, Missense']",2020/02/06 06:00,2021/09/29 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2022/12/01 00:00 [pmc-release]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['cshperspect.a034959 [pii]', '10.1101/cshperspect.a034959 [doi]']",epublish,Cold Spring Harb Perspect Med. 2020 Dec 1;10(12). pii: cshperspect.a034959. doi: 10.1101/cshperspect.a034959.,,"['R35 CA220499/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UG1 CA233332/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA198089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA220499/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Copyright (c) 2020 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved.'],PMC7706582,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['2022/12/01 00:00'],,

However, while there is a great deal of evidence detailing the effects of COS and DEH on considerable signaling pathways and cellular functions, a global view of their mechanism of action remains elusive. This review systematically summarizes the antitumor activity and mechanism of COS and DEH in the recent reports, and discusses the effect of the key active part (alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone) of COS and DEH against cancer. Moreover, we also discuss the antineoplastic activity of COS and DEH derivatives to improve the cytotoxicity and safety index.

Studies have been associated this class of non-coding RNA with the development of several disease, among them the different types of leukemia. However, the results are contradictory. Thus, we performed a systematic review of the literature available in order to better understand the involvement of lncRNAs in the development of leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pubmed and Embase databases were used to identify all studies that evaluated the expression of one or more lncRNA between human samples (peripheral blood, bone marrow) with leukemia (cases) and without leukemia (controls). RESULTS: A total of 3675 articles were found in the databases, and after exclusion of articles that did not meet the eligibility criteria, 86 articles were included in this systematic review. In the 86 included studies, 3927 lncRNAs were differentially expressed between cases and controls. Among these, 110 lncRNAs were reported as being altered in samples from at least 2 studies and only 16 of them in >/=3 studies, which were selected for further evaluation. Of these, 12 lncRNAs were consistently dysregulated between cases and controls (CCAT1, CCDC26, CRNDE, HOTAIR, KCNQ5IT1, LINC00265, MALAT1, PVT1, SNHG5, TUG1: increased in cases, MEG3 and NEAT1: decreased in cases) in human samples of patients with some type of leukemia.

METHOD: The study was performed based on retrospective data from patients under acute lymphoid leukemia treatment in a general university hospital located in southern Brazil. Information on patients who used ASP from 2010 to 2017 was collected. Allergic reactions were identified in electronic medical records. RESULTS: Among the 98 patients included in the study, 16 (16.3 %) experienced an allergic reaction to native l-asparaginase (L-ASP). Of the 22 patients (22.4 %) that received only intravenous (IV) administration of l-ASP, 10 (62.5 %) had allergic reactions, while 48 patients (49 %) received intramuscular (IM) administration and 28 (28.6 %) received IV and IM administrations. The occurrence of allergic reactions differed between the groups (p< 0.001), and IV administration was associated with allergic reactions. Association was also observed between the severity of the reaction and the route of administration, with the IM route associated with grade 2 and IV route associated with grade 3. Occurrence of allergic reactions was higher when the commercial formulation of l-ASP, Leuginase(R), was used (p= 0.0009 in the analysis per patient and p= 0.0003 in the analysis per administration). CONCLUSIONS: The IV administration and commercial Leuginase(R) presentation were associated with more allergic reactions in the study population, which corroborates the findings in the literature. The IV route was also associated with higher severity of reactions in the present study.","['Battistel, Ana Paula', 'Rocha, Bruno Simas da', 'Santos, Maite Telles Dos', 'Daudt, Liane Esteves', 'Michalowski, Mariana Bohns']","['Battistel AP', 'Rocha BSD', 'Santos MTD', 'Daudt LE', 'Michalowski MB']","['Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.

MYB is therefore an attractive target for drug development in MYB-activated malignancies. Here, we employed a MYB-reporter cell line and identified the polyether ionophores monensin, salinomycin, and nigericin as novel inhibitors of MYB activity. As a proof of principle, we show that monensin affects the expression of a significant number of MYB-regulated genes in AML cells and causes down-regulation of MYB expression, loss of cell viability, and induction of differentiation and apoptosis. Furthermore, monensin significantly inhibits proliferation of primary murine AML cells but not of normal hematopoietic progenitors, reflecting a high MYB-dependence of leukemic cells and underscoring the efficacy of monensin in MYB-activated malignancies. Importantly, monensin also suppressed the viability and non-adherent growth of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) cells expressing MYB-NFIB fusion oncoproteins. Our data show that a single compound with significant MYB-inhibitory activity is effective against malignant cells from two distinct MYB-driven human neoplasms. Hence, monensin and related compounds are promising molecular scaffolds for development of novel MYB inhibitors.","['Yusenko, Maria V', 'Trentmann, Amke', 'Andersson, Mattias K', 'Ghani, Luca Abdel', 'Jakobs, Anke', 'Arteaga Paz, Mari-Francis', 'Mikesch, Jan-Henrik', 'Peter von Kries, Jens', 'Stenman, Goran', 'Klempnauer, Karl-Heinz']","['Yusenko MV', 'Trentmann A', 'Andersson MK', 'Ghani LA', 'Jakobs A', 'Arteaga Paz MF', 'Mikesch JH', 'Peter von Kries J', 'Stenman G', 'Klempnauer KH']","['Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149, Munster, Germany.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, Munster, Germany.', 'Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut fur Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP), Berlin, Germany.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Department of Pathology, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Institute for Biochemistry, Westfalische-Wilhelms-Universitat, D-48149, Munster, Germany.

However, some critical characteristics must be considered for a novel L-ASNase source to be effective as an antitumour drug. Accordingly, this article provides a critical analysis of the parameters and methods applied to estimate L-ASNase concentration, measure the L-ASNase and GLNase activities and kinetics, evaluate the enzyme preparations purity and define the antitumour activity against leukemic cells in vitro. Among the main features, the proposed new enzyme needs to present high affinity for L-asparagine; low percentage of glutaminase activity in relation to L-ASNase; high enzyme stability and half-life and mainly antileukemic activity when a low protein amount is applied. These parameters are discussed in an attempt to guide the consideration of an enzyme as a promising biopharmaceutical against ALL.","['Costa-Silva, T A', 'Costa, I M', 'Biasoto, H P', 'Lima, G M', 'Silva, C', 'Pessoa, A', 'Monteiro, G']","['Costa-Silva TA', 'Costa IM', 'Biasoto HP', 'Lima GM', 'Silva C', 'Pessoa A', 'Monteiro G']","['Department of Pharmaceutical and Biochemical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

METHODS: PROUD-PV and its extension study, CONTINUATION-PV, were phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label, trials done in 48 clinics in Europe. Patients were eligible if 18 years or older with early stage polycythaemia vera (no history of cytoreductive treatment or less than 3 years of previous hydroxyurea treatment) diagnosed by WHO's 2008 criteria. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ropeginterferon alfa-2b (subcutaneously every 2 weeks, starting at 100 mug) or hydroxyurea (orally starting at 500 mg/day). After 1 year, patients could opt to enter the extension part of the trial, CONTINUATION-PV. The primary endpoint in PROUD-PV was non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus hydroxyurea regarding complete haematological response with normal spleen size (longitudinal diameter of </=12 cm for women and </=13 cm for men) at 12 months; in CONTINUATION-PV, the coprimary endpoints were complete haematological response with normalisation of spleen size and with improved disease burden (ie, splenomegaly, microvascular disturbances, pruritus, and headache). We present the final results of PROUD-PV and an interim analysis at 36 months of the CONTINUATION-PV study (per statistical analysis plan). Analyses for safety and efficacy were per-protocol. The trials were registered on EudraCT, 2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV) and 2014-001357-17 (CONTINUATION-PV, which is ongoing). FINDINGS: Patients were recruited from Sept 17, 2013 to March 13, 2015 with 306 enrolled. 257 patients were randomly assigned, 127 were treated in each group (three patients withdrew consent in the hydroxyurea group), and 171 rolled over to the CONTINUATION-PV trial. Median follow-up was 182.1 weeks (IQR 166.3-201.7) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 164.5 weeks (144.4-169.3) in the standard therapy group. In PROUD-PV, 26 (21%) of 122 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and 34 (28%) of 123 patients in the standard therapy group met the composite primary endpoint of complete haematological response with normal spleen size. In CONTINUATION-PV, complete haematological response with improved disease burden was met in 50 (53%) of 95 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus 28 (38%) of 74 patients in the hydroxyurea group, p=0.044 at 36 months. Complete haematological response without the spleen criterion in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus standard therapy group were: 53 (43%) of 123 patients versus 57 (46%) of 125 patients, p=0.63 at 12 months (PROUD-PV), and 67 (71%) of 95 patients versus 38 (51%) of 74 patients, p=0.012 at 36 months (CONTINUATION-PV). The most frequently reported grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (seven [6%] of 127 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (four [3%] of 127 patients) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group, and leucopenia (six [5%] of 127 patients) and thrombocytopenia (five [4%] of 127 patients) in the standard therapy group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in three (2%) of 127 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and five (4%) of 127 patients in the hydroxyurea group. One treatment-related death was reported in the standard therapy group (acute leukaemia). INTERPRETATION: In patients with early polycythaemia vera, who predominantly presented without splenomegaly, ropeginterferon alfa-2b was effective in inducing haematological responses; non-inferiority to hydroxyurea regarding haematological response and normal spleen size was not shown at 12 months. However, response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b continued to increase over time with improved responses compared with hydroxyurea at 36 months. Considering the high and durable haematological and molecular responses and its good tolerability, ropeginterferon alfa-2b offers a valuable and safe long-term treatment option with features distinct from hydroxyurea.

Alternative splicing from a single PML gene generates 6 nuclear PML isoforms (PMLI to PMLVI) and one cytoplasmic isoform, PMLVII. Murine PML-null primary cells are resistant to TGF-beta-induced apoptosis. Cytoplasmic PML is an essential activator of TGF-beta signaling by increasing the phosphorylation of transcription factors SMAD2/3 while nuclear PML plays a role in TGF-beta-induced caspase 8 activation and apoptosis. TGF-beta targets nuclear PML by inducing its conjugation to SUMO. In the nucleus, PML is mainly expressed in the nucleoplasm with a small fraction in the nuclear matrix. In response to TGF-beta, PML and caspase 8 shift to the nuclear matrix, where both PML and caspase 8 colocalise within PML NBs. Here, we review the implication of cytoplasmic and nuclear PML isoforms in TGF-beta response.","['El-Asmi, Faten', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K']","['El-Asmi F', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']","['Inserm UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints Peres, 75006 Paris, France.', 'Inserm UMR-S 1124, Universite Paris Descartes, 45 rue des Saints Peres, 75006 Paris, France.']",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20200204,France,Med Sci (Paris),Medecine sciences : M/S,8710980,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/physiology']",2020/02/06 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2020/02/05 06:00'],"['2020/02/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1051/medsci/2019269 [doi]', 'msc190232 [pii]']",ppublish,Med Sci (Paris). 2020 Jan;36(1):50-56. doi: 10.1051/medsci/2019269.
