The 2008 International Workshop on CLL guidelines (IWCLL 2008) classified disease as CLL if the absolute B-cell count was >/=5 x 10(9)/L or as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) if the absolute B-cell count was <5 x 10(9)/L. The objective of the current study of Olmsted County, Minnesota, was to assess the effects of these changes on incidence rates and presentation from 2000 to 2010. METHODS: Using diagnostic indices available through the Rochester Epidemiology Project and the Mayo CLL database, the authors identified all patients with newly diagnosed CLL and high-count MBL from 2000 to 2010. Age-specific and sex-specific incidence rates were determined. RESULTS: According to NCI-WG 96 criteria, there were 115 patients with CLL and 8 patients with MBL during the period studied. Using the IWCLL 2008 classification, there were 79 patients with CLL and 40 patients with MBL. Rai stage distribution (low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk) using NCI-WG 96 criteria was 60.9%, 33.9%, and 5.2%, respectively, compared with 43%, 49.4%, and 7.6%, respectively, using IWCLL 2008 criteria. The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence rates (per 100,000) for CLL and MBL were 10.0 and 0.66, respectively, using NCI-WG 96 criteria versus 6.8 and 3.5, respectively, using IWCLL 2008 criteria. The median time to treatment according to NCI-WG 96 criteria was 9.2 years versus 6.5 years with IWCLL 2008 criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the IWCLL 2008 guidelines reduced the incidence of CLL, altered the distribution of initial Rai stage at diagnosis, and shortened the median time to treatment.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Call, Timothy G', 'Norman, Aaron D', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Achenbach, Sara J', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Ding, Wei', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Vachon, Celine M', 'Hallberg, Emily J', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Slager, Susan L']","['Call TG', 'Norman AD', 'Hanson CA', 'Achenbach SJ', 'Kay NE', 'Zent CS', 'Ding W', 'Cerhan JR', 'Rabe KG', 'Vachon CM', 'Hallberg EJ', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Slager SL']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['CA118444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG034676/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000135/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AG034676/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA118444/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA160345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140407,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'National Cancer Institute (U.S.)', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'United States']",PMC4124730,['NIHMS602753'],['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'epidemiology', 'incidence', 'monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis', 'natural history']",2014/04/09 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28690 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Jul 1;120(13):2000-5. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28690.

Here, we report the data from the 2-year follow-up of a phase 1/2 open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of bosutinib as second-line therapy in 288 patients with chronic phase CML resistant (n = 200) or intolerant (n = 88) to imatinib. The cumulative response rates to bosutinib were as follows: 85% achieved/maintained complete hematologic response, 59% achieved/maintained major cytogenetic response (including 48% with complete cytogenetic response), and 35% achieved major molecular response. Responses were durable, with 2-year estimates of retaining response >70%. Two-year probabilities of progression-free survival and overall survival were 81% and 91%, respectively. The most common toxicities were primarily gastrointestinal adverse events (diarrhea [84%], nausea [45%], vomiting [37%]), which were primarily mild to moderate, typically transient, and first occurred early during treatment. Thrombocytopenia was the most common grade 3/4 hematologic laboratory abnormality (24%). Outcomes were generally similar among imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant patients and did not differ with age. The longer-term results of the present analysis confirm that bosutinib is an effective and tolerable second-line therapy for patients with imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant chronic phase CML.

Anemia affects the course of disease, quality of life (QOL), and cognitive function of MDS patients. Erythroid-stimulating agents (ESAs) are effective; however, not all patients respond to ESAs. To evaluate the effectiveness of a biosimilar epoetin alpha (Binocrit) for the treatment of anemia in low-/intermediate-1 risk MDS patients and to evaluate the impact of ESAs on QOL and on cognitive function, 24 consecutive patients aged over 65 years were treated with Binocrit at 40,000 IU once a week for 12 weeks and were followed for at least 3 months. Responsive patients continued with 40,000 IU once a week for a further 12 weeks. Changes in QOL were assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An), while cognitive assessment was carried out by mini-mental state examination (MMSE). All patients completed 12 weeks of therapy. Sixteen patients (66.67 %) achieved an erythroid response (ER), 15 patients (62.5 %) became transfusion independent and remained free from transfusion requirement for at least 3 months, while two patients had reduction in transfusion requirement of at least four RBC transfusions/8 weeks compared with the pretreatment transfusion requirement. Seven patients were nonresponders (29.1 %), of whom four patients were low risk and three intermediate-I risk. Seven transfusion-independent patients were low risk, and eight were intermediate-1 risk. Median hemoglobin (Hb) values were significantly higher after treatment in responders (p < 0.001). ER was maintained after 24 weeks. Statistically significant positive correlations between improvement in Hb and variations in patients' mini-mental (Spearman's Rho = 0.54, p < 0.01) and FACT-An scores (Spearman's Rho = 0.59, p < 0.003) were demonstrated.

Prior to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) era, older age was considered an adverse prognostic factor and was included in two of the most used scoring systems for CML, the Sokal score and the Euro score. Moreover, older age was generally considered a limitation for the use of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, given the higher toxicity observed. After the introduction of TKIs, age lost much of its prognostic impact in patients in chronic phase (CP), and the EUTOS score, developed in patients treated with imatinib, did not identify age as a risk variable. However, most CML patients require life-long treatment; therefore, as patients age while taking a TKI, the complexity of the management of elderly patients may increase over time. To date, imatinib, the first TKI introduced, and two second-generation TKIs, nilotinib and dasatinib, have been approved in most Western countries for the first-line treatment of CML. These drugs differ in terms of efficacy, safety, and costs; therefore, knowledge of their characteristics is extremely relevant for optimal management of elderly CML patients.

A proteomic approach was used in an attempt to identify the drugs' molecular targets and their respective antiproliferative mode of action. Results suggested that the (a) growth inhibition effect occurs by G2/M cell cycle arrest via reduction of tubulin alpha and beta isomers and 14-3-3 protein gamma expression, followed by a decrease of apoptotic and inflammatory proteins, culminating in mitochondrial oxidative damage that triggered autophagy-associated cell death. Moreover, the decrease observed in the expression levels of several types of histones indicated that (a) might be disarming oncogenic pathways via direct modulation of the epigenetic machinery. Effects on cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis caused by (b) were confirmed.

We analysed ON incidence, risk factors and outcome in patients (pts) from our institution treated according to the CoALL 07-03 trial. METHODS: Between 01.09.2003 and 31.12.2009, 124 children aged 1-18 years were treated, 22 pts with ON (ARCO I-IV) were assessed by retrospective chart review. Follow-up data were collected as of March 2013. RESULTS: 5-year cumulative incidence of ON grade I-IV was 25%. Median age at ALL diagnosis with vs. without ON was 11 years vs. 4.4 years. In logistic multivariate regression analysis, age was the only independent risk factor for ON (p<0.01). 90.9% of the pts with ON presented with >/=2 bilaterally affected joints, most frequent the weight-bearing joints (95.5%). 77.2% developed ON >/= degrees III acc. to ARCO. 36.4% underwent core decompression, one patient bilateral total hip arthroplasty. As of March 2013, 12 pts still presented with ON-induced symptoms. DISCUSSION: Our data suggest an overall high incidence of ON in pts treated according to trial CoALL 07-03. Cumulative steroid dose in trial CoALL 07-03 was small, thus, the high CI might be triggered by other treatment-related and study population based risk factors. CONCLUSION: ON are a serious problem concerning long-term sequelae with major impact on activities of daily living. Further prospective evaluation is urgently needed to develop risk-adapted diagnostic strategies and preventive and interventional approaches for high-risk pts.",['(c) Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

On the basis of selective overexpression of peptidase inhibitor 16 in CB Tregs, we explored the related p53 pathway, which has been shown to negatively regulate miR15a/16 expression. Significantly lower levels of miR15a/16 were observed in CB Tregs when compared with conventional CB T cells (Tcons). In a xenogeneic GVHD mouse model, lower levels of miR15a/16 were also found in Treg recipients, which correlated with a better GVHD score. Forced overexpression of miR15a/16 in CB Tregs led to inhibition of FOXP3 and CTLA4 expression and partial reversal of Treg-mediated suppression in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction that correlated with the reversal of FOXP3 demethylation in CB Tregs. On the other hand, miR15a/16 knockdown in CB Tcons led to expression of FOXP3 and CTLA4 and suppression of allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation. Using a luciferase-based mutagenesis assay, FOXP3 was determined to be a direct target of miR15a and miR16. We propose that miR15a/16 has an important role in mediating the suppressive function of CB Tregs and these microRNAs may have a 'toggle-switch' function in Treg/Tcon plasticity.",,"['Liu, X', 'Robinson, S N', 'Setoyama, T', 'Tung, S S', ""D'Abundo, L"", 'Shah, M Y', 'Yang, H', 'Yvon, E', 'Shah, N', 'Yang, H', 'Konopleva, M', 'Garcia-Manero, G', 'McNiece, I', 'Rezvani, K', 'Calin, G A', 'Shpall, E J', 'Parmar, S']","['Liu X', 'Robinson SN', 'Setoyama T', 'Tung SS', ""D'Abundo L"", 'Shah MY', 'Yang H', 'Yvon E', 'Shah N', 'Yang H', 'Konopleva M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'McNiece I', 'Rezvani K', 'Calin GA', 'Shpall EJ', 'Parmar S']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

Pluripotency is maintained by a synergistic interplay between extrinsic stimuli and intrinsic circuitries, which allow sustainment of the undifferentiated and self-renewing state. Nevertheless, even though a lot of efforts have been made in the past years, the precise mechanisms regulating these processes remain unclear. One of the key extrinsic factors is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) that is largely used for the cultivation and derivation of mouse embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells. LIF acts through the LIFR/gp130 receptor and activates STAT3, an important regulator of mouse embryonic stem cell self-renewal. STAT3 is known to inhibit differentiation into both mesoderm and endoderm lineages by preventing the activation of lineage-specific differentiation programs. However, LIF activates also parallel circuitries like the PI3K-pathway and the MEK/ERK-pathway, but its mechanisms of action remain to be better elucidated.

Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have transformed the landscape of epigenomic analysis as we now have the ability to characterize the genome-wide distribution of chromatin modifications and DNA methylation using next-generation sequencing. To take full advantage of the throughput of next-generation sequencing, there are many methodologies that have been developed and many more that are currently being developed. Choosing the appropriate methodology is fundamental to the outcome of next-generation sequencing studies. In this review, published technologies and methodologies applicable to studying the methylome are presented.

Patients with an inherited host defect in thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) are at high risk for life-threatening toxicity if treated with conventional dosages, but the impact on antileukemic efficacy is less clear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated thiopurine-sensitive BCR-ABL+Arf-null Tpmt+/+ ALL in Tpmt+/+, +/-, or -/- recipient mice to test the impact of the host polymorphism on antileukemic efficacy. RESULTS: Median survival was similar in untreated mice of different Tpmt genotypes (16-18 days). However, in mice treated with low-dose mercaptopurine (such as tolerated by TPMT-/- patients), the difference in 30-day leukemia-free survival by Tpmt genotype was profound: 5% (+/-9%) for Tpmt+/+ mice, 47% (+/-26%) for Tpmt+/- mice, and 85% (+/-14%) for Tpmt-/- mice (P=5x10), indicating a substantial impact of host Tpmt status on thiopurine effectiveness. Among Tpmt+/+ recipient mice, leukemia-free survival improved with higher doses of mercaptopurine (similar to doses tolerated by wild-type patients) compared with lower doses, and at higher doses was comparable (P=0.6) to the survival of Tpmt-/- mice treated with the lower dose.

Promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies may serve a scaffolding role in viral progeny production. We analyzed the formation process of intranuclear viral inclusions by morphometry and assessed PML-NB alterations in the brains of 2 patients with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. By immunohistochemistry, proliferating cell nuclear antigen was most frequently detected in smaller nuclei; cyclin A was detected in larger nuclei. This suggests an S-to-G2 cell cycle transition in infected cells associated with nuclear enlargement. Sizes of PML-NBs were variable, but they were usually either small speckles 200 to 400 nm in diameter or distinct spherical shells with a diameter of 1 mum or more. By confocal microscopy, JC virus capsid proteins were associated with both small and large PML-NBs, but disruption of large PML-NBs was observed by ground-state depletion fluorescence nanoscopy. Clusters of progeny virions were also detected by electron microscopy.

The results of thermal shift assay validated the direct interactions between the two antibiotics and menin. The results of isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the equilibrium dissociation constant between menin and neomycin was approximately 15.6 muM.

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling can promote cell survival and is upregulated in solid tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), although these effects are context dependent. The role of PI3K in tumorigenesis combined with their amenability to specific inhibition makes them attractive drug targets. However, we observed that inhibition of PI3K in HCT116, DLD-1, and SW620 CRC cells did not induce apoptotic cell death. Moreover, these cells were relatively resistant to the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic ABT-737, which directly targets the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators. To test the hypothesis that PI3K inhibition lowers the apoptotic threshold without causing apoptosis per se, PI3K inhibitors were combined with ABT-737. PI3K inhibition enhanced ABT-737-induced apoptosis by 2.3- to 4.5-fold and reduced expression levels of MCL-1, the resistance biomarker for ABT-737. PI3K inhibition enhanced ABT-737-induced apoptosis a further 1.4- to 2.4-fold in CRC cells with small interfering RNA-depleted MCL-1, indicative of additional sensitizing mechanisms. The observation that ABT-737-induced apoptosis was unaffected by inhibition of PI3K downstream effectors AKT and mTOR, implicated a novel PI3K-dependant pathway. To elucidate this, an RNA interference (RNAi) screen of potential downstream effectors of PI3K signaling was conducted, which demonstrated that knockdown of the TEC kinase BMX sensitized to ABT-737. This suggests that BMX is an antiapoptotic downstream effector of PI3K, independent of AKT.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

There is considerable interpatient variation in the age of onset and leukemia/lymphoma type. The incomplete penetrance and variable age of onset may be attributable to several factors. These include competing mortality from other A-T-associated pathologies, particularly neurodegeneration and interstitial lung disease, allele-specific effects of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene mutations. There is also limited evidence from clinical observations and studies using Atm knockout mice that modifier genes may account for some variation in leukemia/lymphoma susceptibility. We have introgressed the Atm(tm1Awb) knockout allele (Atm(-)) onto several inbred murine strains and observed differences in thymic lymphoma incidence and latency between Atm(-/-) mice on the different strain backgrounds and between their F1 hybrids. The lymphomas that arose in these mice had a pattern of sequence gains and losses that were similar to those previously described by others. These results provide further evidence for the existence of modifier genes controlling lymphomagenesis in individuals carrying defective copies of Atm, at least in mice, the characterized Atm(-) congenic strain set provides a resource with which to identify these genes. In addition, we found that fewer than expected Atm(-/-) pups were weaned on two strain backgrounds and that there was no correlation between body weight of young Atm-/- mice and lymphoma incidence or latency.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

In many subtypes of AML the underlying causative genetic insults are not fully described. MicroRNAs are known to be dysregulated during oncogenesis. Overexpression of miR-155 is associated with some cancers, including haematological malignancies, and it has been postulated that miR-155 has an oncogenic role. This study investigated the effects of modulating miR-155 expression in human AML cells, and its mechanism of action. RESULTS: Analysis of miR-155 expression patterns in AML patients found that Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-wildtype AML has the same expression level as normal bone marrow, with increased expression restricted to AML with the FLT3-ITD mutation. Induction of apoptosis by cytarabine arabinoside or myelomonocytic differentiation by 1,23-dihydroxyvitaminD3 in FLT3-wildtype AML cells led to upregulated miR-155 expression. Knockdown of miR-155 by locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides in the FLT3-wildtype AML cells conferred resistance to cytarabine arabinoside induced apoptosis and suppressed the ability of cells to differentiate.Ectopic expression of miR-155 in FLT3-wildtype AML cells led to a significant gain of myelomonocytic markers (CD11b, CD14 and CD15), increase in apoptosis (AnnexinV binding), decrease in cell growth and clonogenic capacity.In silico target prediction identified a number of putative miR-155 target genes, and the expression changes of key transcription regulators of myeloid differentiation and apoptosis (MEIS1, GF1, cMYC, JARID2, cJUN, FOS, CTNNB1 and TRIB2) were confirmed by PCR. Assessment of expression of apoptosis-related proteins demonstrated a marked increase in cleaved caspase-3 expression confirming activation of the apoptosis cascade. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for an anti-leukaemic role for miR-155 in human FLT3-wildtype AML, by inducing cell apoptosis and myelomonocytic differentiation, which is in contrast to its previously hypothesized role as an oncogene. This highlights the complexity of gene regulation by microRNAs that may have tumour repressor or oncogenic effects depending on disease context or tissue type.",,"['Palma, Catalina A', 'Al Sheikha, Dima', 'Lim, Teck Khai', 'Bryant, Adam', 'Vu, Thi Thanh', 'Jayaswal, Vivek', 'Ma, David D F']","['Palma CA', 'Al Sheikha D', 'Lim TK', 'Bryant A', 'Vu TT', 'Jayaswal V', 'Ma DD']","[""Blood, Stem Cells and Cancer Research, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia. a.lafferty@amr.org.au.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140405,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4021368,,,,2014/04/09 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-4598-13-79 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-13-79 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2014 Apr 5;13:79. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-13-79.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MIRN155 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these non-native glycoproteins are actively recruited to budding virions, particularly other viral glycoproteins. This observation suggests that there may be a conserved mechanism underlying the recruitment of glycoproteins into viruses. If a conserved mechanism is used, diverse glycoproteins should localize to a single budding retroviral particle. On the other hand, if viral glycoproteins have divergent mechanisms for recruitment, the different glycoproteins could segregate into different particles. RESULTS: To determine if co-packaging occurs among different glycoproteins, we designed an assay that combines virion antibody capture and a determination of infectivity based on a luciferase reporter. Virions were bound to a plate with an antibody against one glycoprotein, and then the infectivity was measured with cells that allow entry only with a second glycoprotein. We tested pairings of glycoproteins from HIV, murine leukemia virus (MLV), Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Ebola virus. The results showed that glycoproteins that were actively recruited into virions were co-packaged efficiently with each other. We also tested cellular proteins and found CD4 also had a similar correlation between active recruitment and efficient co-packaging, but other cellular proteins did not. CONCLUSION: Glycoproteins that are actively incorporated into HIV-1 virions are efficiently co-packaged into the same virus particles, suggesting that the same general mechanism for recruitment may act in many viruses.",,"['Gregory, Devon A', 'Olinger, Grace Y', 'Lucas, Tiffany M', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Gregory DA', 'Olinger GY', 'Lucas TM', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, USA. marcjohnson@missouri.edu.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM110776/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AI073098/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM110776/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140403,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,IM,"['CD4 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",PMC3985584,,,,2014/04/09 06:00,2014/09/05 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2013/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1742-4690-11-28 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-11-28 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2014 Apr 3;11:28. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-11-28.,,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As prevention of the spread from infected animals is of primary importance in breaking the cycle of BLV transmission, it is important to know the pathophysiology of BLV infection in young animals, as they are the main source of animal movement. In this work, we determined the proviral load and antibody titers of infected newborn calves from birth to first parturition (36 months). RESULTS: All calves under study were born to infected dams with high proviral load (PVL) in blood and high antibody titers and detectable provirus in the colostrum. The PVL for five out of seven calves was low at birth. All animals reached PVLs of more than 1% infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), three at 3 months, one at 6 months, and one at 12 months. High PVLs persisted until the end of the study, and, in two animals, exceeded one BLV copy per cell. Two other calves maintained a high PVL from birth until the end of the study. Antibody titers were 32 or higher in the first sample from six out of seven calves. These decayed at 3-6 months to 16 or lower, and then increased again after this point. CONCLUSIONS: Calves infected during the first week of life could play an active role in early propagation of BLV to susceptible animals, since their PVL raised up during the first 12 months and persist as high for years.

Intensive medical treatment and a decline in physical activity may also result in reduced motor performance. Therefore, simple and inexpensive ways to promote physical activity and exercise are becoming an increasingly important part of children's cancer treatment. METHODS: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active video games in promotion of physical activity in children with cancer. The research is conducted as a parallel randomized clinical trial with follow-up. Patients between 3 and 16 years old, diagnosed with cancer and treated with vincristine in two specialized medical centers are asked to participate. Based on statistical estimates, the target enrollment is 40 patients. The intervention includes playing elective active video games and, in addition, education and consultations for the family. The control group will receive a general recommendation for physical activity for 30 minutes per day. The main outcomes are the amount of physical activity and sedentary behavior. Other outcomes include motor performance, fatigue and metabolic risk factors. The outcomes are examined with questionnaires, diaries, physical examinations and blood tests at baseline and at 2, 6, 12 and 30 months after the baseline. Additionally, the children's perceptions of the most enjoyable activation methods are explored through an interview at 2 months. DISCUSSION: This trial will help to answer the question of whether playing active video games is beneficial for children with cancer. It will also provide further reasoning for physical activity promotion and training of motor skills during treatment.

Circadian rhythm exhibits a 24-hour variation in physiological processes and behavior, such as hormone levels, metabolism, gene expression, sleep and wakefulness, and appetite. Disruption of circadian rhythm has been associated with various cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, and breast cancer. However, the expression of circadian clock genes in GC remains unexplored. METHODS: In this study, the expression profiles of eight circadian clock genes (PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1, CRY2, CKI, CLOCK, and BMAL1) of cancerous and noncancerous tissues from 29 GC patients were investigated using real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and validated through immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: We found that PER2 was significantly up-regulated in cancer tissues (p < 0.005). Up-regulated CRY1 expression was significantly correlated with more advanced stages (stage III and IV) (p < 0.05).

They deliver the cytotoxic agent and release it at the tumor with limited systemic exposure. AREAS COVERED: In this review, the authors summarize and discuss antibody conjugates in Phase II clinical trials in lymphoid malignancies. Furthermore, the article gives a critical overview of Phase II clinical trials of these therapies. EXPERT OPINION: ADCs have increased selectivity and a longer half-life in comparison to systemic chemotherapy. These agents improve the potency of chemotherapy by increasing the accumulation of the cytotoxic drug within neoplastic cells with reduced systemic effects. Improvements in cytotoxin selection and the use of partial antibodies have further improved the clinical value of ADCs. Newer ADCs currently in Phase II clinical trials show promise as treatments for several lymphoid malignancies, especially lymphoma, multiple myeloma and lymphoid leukemia. In the near future, the addition of ADCs to the armamentarium of anticancer drugs should offer novel and more targeted treatment strategies.",,"['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Robak, Ewa']","['Robak T', 'Robak E']","['Medical University of Lodz, Departments of Hematology and Dermatology , Ciolkowskiego 2 93-510 Lodz , Poland robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140407,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['A-dmDT390-bisFv', 'DCDT2980S', 'DCDTS4501A', 'SAR-3419', 'brentuximab vedotin', 'combotox', 'indatuximab ravtansine', 'inotuzumab ozogamicin', 'lorvotuzumab mertansine', 'milatuzumab-dox', 'moxetumomab pasudotox']",2014/04/09 06:00,2015/01/24 06:00,['2014/04/09 06:00'],"['2014/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543784.2014.908184 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2014 Jul;23(7):911-24. doi: 10.1517/13543784.2014.908184.

Revision is a process by which surface expression of the Vbeta5(+) TCR is down-regulated in response to Mtv-8 and recombination activating genes are expressed to drive rearrangement of the endogenous TCRbeta locus, effecting cell rescue through the expression of a newly generated, non-self-reactive TCR. In an effort to identify the microenvironment in which revision takes place, we show here that the proportion of T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and production of high-affinity antibody during a primary response are increased in Vbeta5 Tg mice in an Mtv-8-dependent manner. Revising T cells have a Tfh-like surface phenotype and transcription factor profile, with elevated expression of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), CXC chemokine receptor 5, programmed death-1, and other Tfh-associated markers. Efficient revision requires Bcl-6 and is inhibited by B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1. Revision completes less efficiently in the absence of signaling lymphocytic activation molecule-associated protein although initiation proceeds normally. These data indicate that Tfh formation is required for the initiation of revision and germinal-center interactions for its completion. The germinal center is known to provide a confined space in which B-cell antigen receptors undergo selection. Our data extend the impact of this selective microenvironment into the arena of T cells, suggesting that this fluid structure also provides a regulatory environment in which TCR revision can safely take place.",,"['Higdon, Lauren E', 'Deets, Katherine A', 'Friesen, Travis J', 'Sze, Kai-Yin', 'Fink, Pamela J']","['Higdon LE', 'Deets KA', 'Friesen TJ', 'Sze KY', 'Fink PJ']","['Department of Immunology and Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98109.']",['eng'],"['T32GM007270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI097950/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG13078/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG013078/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA009537/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140331,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Germinal Center/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic/immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/metabolism']",PMC3992682,,['NOTNLM'],"['Rag-mediated recombination', 'T-cell tolerance']",2014/04/08 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1321803111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1321803111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Apr 15;111(15):5652-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1321803111.

Although they initially present as hypoproliferative disorders, such as anemia, patients have elevated risk of hyperproliferative disease (cancer) by midlife. Here, this paradox is explored using the rpL10-R98S (uL16-R98S) mutant yeast model of the most commonly identified ribosomal mutation in acute lymphoblastic T-cell leukemia. This mutation causes a late-stage 60S subunit maturation failure that targets mutant ribosomes for degradation. The resulting deficit in ribosomes causes the hypoproliferative phenotype. This 60S subunit shortage, in turn, exerts pressure on cells to select for suppressors of the ribosome biogenesis defect, allowing them to reestablish normal levels of ribosome production and cell proliferation. However, suppression at this step releases structurally and functionally defective ribosomes into the translationally active pool, and the translational fidelity defects of these mutants culminate in destabilization of selected mRNAs and shortened telomeres. We suggest that in exchange for resolving their short-term ribosome deficits through compensatory trans-acting suppressors, cells are penalized in the long term by changes in gene expression that ultimately undermine cellular homeostasis.",,"['Sulima, Sergey O', 'Patchett, Stephanie', 'Advani, Vivek M', 'De Keersmaecker, Kim', 'Johnson, Arlen W', 'Dinman, Jonathan D']","['Sulima SO', 'Patchett S', 'Advani VM', 'De Keersmaecker K', 'Johnson AW', 'Dinman JD']","['Department of Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.']",['eng'],"['3 R01 GM053655-15S1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM053655/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2 RO1 GM53655/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2 R01 GM058859-11/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL119439/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM080201/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM080201/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM058859/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '334946/European Research Council/International']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140331,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', '*Models, Molecular', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Ribosomal Protein L10', 'Ribosomal Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Ribosome Subunits, Large, Eukaryotic/*pathology', 'Ribosomes/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae']",PMC3992666,,['NOTNLM'],"['L10/uL16', 'frameshifting']",2014/04/08 06:00,2014/06/05 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['1400247111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1400247111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Apr 15;111(15):5640-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1400247111.

Juss. var. siamensis Valeton (Siamese neem tree; Meliaceae). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data. All of these compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against leukemia (HL60), lung (A549), stomach (AZ521), and breast (SK-BR-3) cancer cell lines. Eleven compounds, 1, 2, 4-7, 13, 16, 17, 29, and 30, exhibited potent cytotoxicities against one or more cell lines with IC50 values in the range of 0.1-9.3 muM. Compound 16 induced apoptotic cell death in AZ521 cells upon evaluation of the apoptosis-inducing activity by flow cytometric analysis. Western blot analysis on AZ521 cells revealed that compound 16 activated caspases-3, -8, and -9, while increasing the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2. This suggested that 16 induced apoptosis via both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways in AZ521. In addition, upon evaluation of all compounds against the melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells induced with alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), 20 limonoids, i.e., 1-3, 6, 9-11, 18, 19, 21-29, 32, and 34, and two flavonoids, 35 and 36, exhibited melanogenesis-inhibitory activities, with no, or almost no, toxicities to the cells at lower and/or higher concentrations, which were more potent than the reference arbutin, a known melanogenesis inhibitor. Western blot analysis showed that nimbin (18) reduced the protein levels of microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, tyrosine-related protein 1 (TRP-1), and TRP-2 mostly in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that 18 inhibits melanogenesis on a alpha-MSH-stimulated B16 melanoma cells by, at least in part, inhibiting the expression of MITF, followed by decreasing the expression of tyrosinase, TRP-1, and TRP-2.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta AG, Zurich.']","['Manosroi, Aranya', 'Kitdamrongtham, Worapong', 'Ishii, Kenta', 'Shinozaki, Takuro', 'Tachi, Yosuke', 'Takagi, Mio', 'Ebina, Kodai', 'Zhang, Jie', 'Manosroi, Jiradej', 'Akihisa, Rima', 'Akihisa, Toshihiro']","['Manosroi A', 'Kitdamrongtham W', 'Ishii K', 'Shinozaki T', 'Tachi Y', 'Takagi M', 'Ebina K', 'Zhang J', 'Manosroi J', 'Akihisa R', 'Akihisa T']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand, (phone: +66-53-944338; fax: +66-53-894169).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Chem Biodivers,Chemistry & biodiversity,101197449,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azadirachta/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Limonins/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Plant Extracts/*chemistry', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Seeds/chemistry', 'alpha-MSH/pharmacology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Azadirachta indica', 'Cytotoxic activity', 'Limonoids', 'Melanogenesis-inhibitory activity', 'Siamese neem tree']",2014/04/08 06:00,2015/05/20 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2013/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cbdv.201300406 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biodivers. 2014 Apr;11(4):505-31. doi: 10.1002/cbdv.201300406.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Limonins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '581-05-5 (alpha-MSH)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the extensive genomic information now available on tumors it is possible to conduct analyses to reveal common genetic features across cancer types and to explore whether the established anatomy-based tumor classification is actually reflected on the genetic level, which might provide important guides to new therapeutic directions. Here, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the genetic similarity of tumors from 14 major cancer entities using somatic mutation data from 4,796 cases available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) based on all available genes as well as different cancer-related gene sets. Our analysis provides a systematic account of the genetic similarity network for major cancer types and shows that in about 43% of the cases on average, tumors of a particular anatomic site are genetically more similar to tumors from different organs and tissues (trans-similarity) than to tumors of the same origin (self-similarity). The observed similarities exist not only for carcinomas from different sites but are also present among neoplasms from different tissue origin, such as melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and glioblastoma. The current WHO cancer classification is therefore reflected on the genetic level by only about 57% of the tumors. These results provide a rationale to reconsider organ- and tissue-specificity in cancer and contribute to the discussion about whether personalized therapies targeting specific genetic alterations may be transferred to cancers from other anatomic sites with similar genetic properties.",['(c) 2014 UICC.'],"['Heim, D', 'Budczies, J', 'Stenzinger, A', 'Treue, D', 'Hufnagl, P', 'Denkert, C', 'Dietel, M', 'Klauschen, F']","['Heim D', 'Budczies J', 'Stenzinger A', 'Treue D', 'Hufnagl P', 'Denkert C', 'Dietel M', 'Klauschen F']","['Institute of Pathology, Charite Medical University Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140417,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['*Genome, Human', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', '*Organ Specificity']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['WHO cancer classification', 'cancer genetics', 'mutational cancer profiling', 'personalized medicine']",2014/04/08 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28882 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Nov 15;135(10):2362-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28882.

In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy of romiplostim in patients who had thrombocytopenia with low-risk/intermediate-1-risk MDS. METHODS: Patients who had thrombocytopenia with low-risk/intermediate-1-risk MDS (N = 250) were randomized 2:1 to receive romiplostim or placebo weekly for 58 weeks. RESULTS: The primary endpoint- the number of clinically significant bleeding events (CSBEs) per patient-had a hazard ratio for romiplostim:placebo of 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.05; P = .13). CSBEs were reduced significantly in the romiplostim group for patients who had baseline platelet counts >/=20 x 10(9) /L (P < .0001). For patients who had baseline platelet counts <20 x 10(9) /L, there was no difference in the number of CSBEs, but the platelet transfusion rates were higher in the placebo group (P < .0001), which may have affected the overall CSBE results in this group with severe thrombocytopenia. The incidence of bleeding events was reduced significantly in the romiplostim group (relative risk, 0.92), as were protocol-defined platelet transfusions (relative risk, 0.77). Platelet response rates according to 2006 International Working Group criteria were higher for the group that received romiplostim (odds ratio, 15.6). On the basis of interim data, an independent data monitoring committee advised halting study drug because of concerns regarding excess blasts and AML rates with romiplostim (interim hazard ratio, 2.51). At 58 weeks, the AML rates were 6% in the romiplostim group and 4.9% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-3.84), and the overall survival rates were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Romiplostim treatment in patients with low-risk/intermediate-1-risk MDS increased platelet counts and decreased the number of bleeding events and platelet transfusions. Although study drug was discontinued because of an initial concern of AML risk, survival and AML rates were similar with romiplostim and placebo.","['(c) 2014 Amgen, Inc.

We measured relative telomere length (RTL) and TERT expression levels in purified peripheral CD19(+) B-cells from seven healthy donors and 77 untreated CLLs in early stage disease (Binet A). Data were correlated with the major biological and cytogenetic markers, global DNA methylation (Alu and LINE-1), and clinical outcome. The expression profiles of telomere-associated genes were also investigated. RTL was decreased in CLLs as compared with controls (P < 0.001); within CLL, a progressive and significant RTL shortening was observed in patients from 13q- through +12, 11q-, and 17p- alterations; short telomeres were significantly associated with unmutated IGHV configuration and global DNA hypomethylation. Decreased RTL was associated with a shorter time to first treatment. A significant upregulation of POT1, TRF1, RAP1, MRE11A, RAD50, and RPA1 transcript levels was observed in CLLs compared with controls. Our study suggests that impairment of telomere/telomerase system represents an early event in CLL pathogenesis. Moreover, the correlation between telomere shortening and global DNA hypomethylation supports the involvement of DNA hypomethylation to increase chromosome instability.

This raised public concern about the risk of childhood leukaemia near nuclear power plants (NPPs). Since then, the topic has been well-studied, but methodological limitations make results difficult to interpret. Our review aims to: (1.) summarise current evidence on the relationship between NPPs and risk of childhood leukaemia, with a focus on the Swiss CANUPIS (Childhood cancer and nuclear power plants in Switzerland) study; (2.) discuss the limitations of previous research; and (3.) suggest directions for future research. There are various reasons that previous studies produced inconclusive results. These include: inadequate study designs and limited statistical power due to the low prevalence of exposure (living near a NPP) and outcome (leukaemia); lack of accurate exposure estimates; limited knowledge of the aetiology of childhood leukaemia, particularly of vulnerable time windows and latent periods; use of residential location at time of diagnosis only and lack of data on address histories; and inability to adjust for potential confounders. We conclude that risk of childhood leukaemia around NPPs should continue to be monitored and that study designs should be improved and standardised. Data should be pooled internationally to increase the statistical power. More research needs to be done on other putative risk factors for childhood cancer such as low-dose ionizing radiation, exposure to certain chemicals and exposure to infections. Studies should be designed to allow examining multiple exposures.",,"['Kuehni, C', 'Spycher, B D']","['Kuehni C', 'Spycher BD']","['University of Bern, Switzerland; kuehni@ispm.unibe.ch.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140402,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', '*Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Power Plants', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",,,,,2014/04/08 06:00,2014/09/19 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4414/smw.2014.13912 [doi]', 'smw-13912 [pii]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2014 Apr 2;144:w13912. doi: 10.4414/smw.2014.13912. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that cytokine effects may be modulated by EVs, the recently recognized conveyors of intercellular messages. In order to test this hypothesis, human monocyte cells were incubated with CCRF acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line-derived EVs with or without the addition of recombinant human TNF, and global gene expression changes were analyzed. EVs alone regulated the expression of numerous genes related to inflammation and signaling. In combination, the effects of EVs and TNF were additive, antagonistic, or independent. The differential effects of EVs and TNF or their simultaneous presence were also validated by Taqman assays and ELISA, and by testing different populations of purified EVs. In the case of the paramount chemokine IL-8, we were able to demonstrate a synergistic upregulation by purified EVs and TNF.

The seven-member STAT family is composed of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors that are activated by phosphorylation intertwined in a network with activation that ultimately leads to cell proliferation. An activated kinase enzyme phosphorylates one STAT factor or more, which shuttle to the nucleus to regulate gene expression, promoting cell survival. Somatic STAT3 mutations have been recently reported in large granular lymphocytic leukemia, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Furthermore, the relationship between BCL6 and STAT3 in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, particularly on the activated B-cell subtype, needs to be further explored. The search for therapeutic STAT3 inhibitors that abrogate the JAK/STAT pathway is currently under way.

Besides, BM-MSCs could protect ALL cells from drug-induced apoptosis. Then, we proved that BM-MSCs affect the cell cycle arrest effect of genotoxic agents on ALL cells via p21 down-regulation.

Utilizing the grounded theory method, we describe the adjustment of participants to the transition to ambulatory care. RESULTS: As outpatients, participants described adjusting to the intensity of ambulatory treatment and to the need to assume greater responsibility for their care. They also expressed a growing desire to understand their long-term care plan, compared to their preference to focus on the present prior to discharge, and they were struggling to construct a new sense of identity.

Recent studies have reported that Tregs and Tregs related cytokines can inhibit the antitumor activity of cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, but dendritic cells co-cultured CIK (DC-CIK) cells can be used for induction of a specific immune response by blocking of Tregs and TGF-beta, IL-10. As a novel identified cytokine, IL-35 is specially produced by Tregs and plays an essential role in immune regulation. However, it remains unknown whether IL-35 roles in tumor immunotherapy mediated by CIK and DC-CIK cells. In this study, we cultured CIK and DC-CIK cells from the same healthy adult samples, and investigated their phenotype, proliferation, cytotoxic activity against leukemia cell lines K562 and NB4 by FCM and CCK-8, measured IL-35, TGF-beta and IL-10 protein by ELISA, detected Foxp3, IL-35 and IL-35 receptor mRNA by Real-time PCR, respectively. We found Tregs and IL-35 concomitantly expanded by a time-dependent way during the generation of CIK cells, but DC significantly down-regulated the expression of them and simultaneously up-regulated the proliferation ability as well as cytotoxic activity of CIK cells against leukemia cell lines. Therefore, our data suggested that DC decreased concomitant expanded Tregs and Tregs related IL-35 in CIK cells and might contribute to improve their cytotoxicity against leukemia cells in vitro.",,"['Pan, Ying', 'Tao, Qianshan', 'Wang, Huiping', 'Xiong, Shudao', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Chen, Tianping', 'Tao, Lili', 'Zhai, Zhimin']","['Pan Y', 'Tao Q', 'Wang H', 'Xiong S', 'Zhang R', 'Chen T', 'Tao L', 'Zhai Z']","[""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, and Hematology Research Center, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140404,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/cytology/metabolism/*physiology']",PMC3976313,,,,2014/04/08 06:00,2015/06/16 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2013/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0093591 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-52057 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 4;9(4):e93591. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0093591. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (interleukin-35, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given that the bone marrow (BM) hypoxic microenvironment supports hematopoietic stem cells, we investigated whether hypoxia similarly contributes to LSC persistence. Importantly, we found that although breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-ABL1 kinase remained effectively inhibited by imatinib under hypoxia, apoptosis became partially suppressed. Furthermore, hypoxia enhanced the clonogenicity of CML cells, as well as their efficiency in repopulating immunodeficient mice, both in the presence and absence of imatinib. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1-alpha), which is the master regulator of the hypoxia transcriptional response, is expressed in the BM specimens of CML individuals. In vitro, HIF1-alpha is stabilized during hypoxia, and its expression and transcriptional activity can be partially attenuated by concurrent imatinib treatment. Expression analysis demonstrates at the whole-transcriptome level that hypoxia and imatinib regulate distinct subsets of genes. Functionally, knockdown of HIF1-alpha abolished the enhanced clonogenicity during hypoxia. Taken together, our results suggest that in the hypoxic microenvironment, HIF1-alpha signaling supports LSC persistence independent of BCR-ABL1 kinase activity. Thus, targeting HIF1-alpha and its pathway components may be therapeutically important for the complete eradication of LSCs.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ng, King Pan', 'Manjeri, Aditi', 'Lee, Kian Leong', 'Huang, Weijie', 'Tan, Soo Yong', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Poellinger, Lorenz', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Ng KP', 'Manjeri A', 'Lee KL', 'Huang W', 'Tan SY', 'Chuah CT', 'Poellinger L', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore;', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School, Singapore;', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore;', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School, Singapore;', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School, Singapore; Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore;', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore; Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Solna, Sweden;', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Program, Duke-National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School, Singapore; Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre, Singapore; and Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140404,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', '*Cell Hypoxia', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,2014/04/08 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40179-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-07-511907 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 May 22;123(21):3316-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-07-511907.

We also identified somatic RRAS mutations (p.Gly39dup and p.Gln87Leu) in 2 of 110 cases of non-syndromic juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia, a childhood myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disease caused by upregulated RAS signalling, defining an atypical form of this haematological disorder rapidly progressing to acute myeloid leukaemia. Two of the three identified mutations affected known oncogenic hotspots of RAS genes and conferred variably enhanced RRAS function and stimulus-dependent MAPK activation. Expression of an RRAS mutant homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans enhanced RAS signalling and engendered protruding vulva, a phenotype previously linked to the RASopathy-causing SHOC2(S2G) mutant.

This phase II study investigated the efficacy and safety of radotinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance and/or intolerance to BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Patients received radotinib 400 mg twice daily for 12 cycles based on results from the phase I trial. The primary end point was rate of major cytogenetic response by 12 months. A total of 77 patients were enrolled. Major cytogenetic response was achieved in 50 (65%; cumulative 75%) patients, including 36 (47%) patients with complete cytogenetic response by 12 months. Median time to major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response were 85 days and 256 days, respectively. Major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response rates were similar between imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant patients, but were higher in patients without BCR-ABL1 mutations. Overall and progression-free survival rates at 12 months were 96.1% and 86.3%, respectively. All newly-occurring or worsening grade 3/4 hematologic abnormalities included thrombocytopenia (24.7%) and anemia (5.2%); grade 3/4 drug-related non-hematologic adverse events included fatigue (3.9%), asthenia (3.9%), and nausea (2.6%). The most common biochemistry abnormality was hyperbilirubinemia (grade 3/4 23.4%), and 12 of 18 cases were managed with dose modification. Study findings suggest radotinib is effective and well tolerated in chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance and/or intolerance to BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors and may represent a promising alternative for these patients.

In order to investigate the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on quercetin-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells, we used flow cytometry to detect cell apoptosis. The expressions of LKB1, phosphorylated AMPK (p-AMPK), and Cox-2 protein were detected in HL-60 cells and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by western blot. The expressions of LKB1, p-AMPK, and Cox-2 were detected in HL-60 cells after culture with quercetin. The expressions of p-AMPK were detected in HL-60 cells after culture with AMPK inhibitor Compound C. Then, the expressions of LKB1, p-AMPK, and Cox-2 were detected in HL-60 cells after culture with quercetin alone or quercetin + Compound C. It was found that there was no significant difference in LKB1 between PBMCs and HL-60. p-AMPK in PBMCs was higher than that in HL-60, while Cox-2 was lower. After culture of HL-60 with quercetin, p-AMPK was increased, Cox-2 was decreased, but LKB1 remained unchanged. After culture of HL-60 with Compound C, p-AMPK was decreased. There was no significant difference in LKB1 between the quercetin-alone and the quercetin + Compound C groups. p-AMPK decreased more significantly, while Cox-2 increased more significantly in the quercetin + Compound C groups than those in the quercetin-alone groups. Taken together, these findings suggested that quercetin activates AMPK expression in HL-60 cells independent of LKB1 activation, inhibits Cox-2 expression by activating AMPK, and further regulates the Bcl-2-dependent pathways of apoptosis to exert its anti-leukemia effect.",,"['Xiao, Jie', 'Niu, Guomin', 'Yin, Songmei', 'Xie, Shuangfeng', 'Li, Yiqing', 'Nie, Danian', 'Ma, Liping', 'Wang, Xiuju', 'Wu, Yudan']","['Xiao J', 'Niu G', 'Yin S', 'Xie S', 'Li Y', 'Nie D', 'Ma L', 'Wang X', 'Wu Y']","['Department of Hematology, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510120, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140404,China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AMP-activated protein kinase', 'cyclooxygenase-2', 'leukemia', 'quercetin']",2014/04/08 06:00,2014/12/30 06:00,['2014/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['gmu014 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmu014 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2014 May;46(5):394-400. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmu014.

However, how these hypoxia-related miRNAs modulate tumor progression is still unclear. Therefore, the patterns of miRNA in colorectal carcinoma cell lines in response to hypoxia or not were first screened and the hypoxia-induced repression of the miR-15-16 cluster was confirmed. Then, this repression was found to be associated with high tumor stage and poor prognosis in colorectal carcinoma and is shown to promote tumor angiogenesis and metastasis by the loss of restriction of its target gene, fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2). Moreover, the general and alterative promoters of the miR-15-16 host (deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 2, DLEU2) were mapped, and three c-Myc/Max binding sites in response to the hypoxia-induced repression of miR-15-16 were further identified. Finally, an enhanced stability of c-Myc/Max heterodimer promoted by increased hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF-2alpha) was validated, and we also verified that the enhancement contributed to the hypoxia-induced repression of miR-15-16. In brief, the c-Myc-mediated transcriptional repression of miR-15-16 in hypoxia is induced by increased HIF-2alpha and promoted tumor angiogenesis and hematogenous metastasis by the further loss of post-transcriptional inhibition of FGF2.

Numerous disease states have been linked to dysfunction of these compartments or 'nuclear bodies'. Recent advances have shed light on the formation and maintenance of key structures, including nucleoli, splicing speckles, paraspeckles, Cajal bodies, histone locus bodies and promyelocytic leukemia bodies.

To investigate the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of EMR for AML and ALL, we performed a retrospective analysis of 362 patients with AL who underwent allo-HSCT at the First affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between January 2001 and March 2012. Compared with patients with AML, those with ALL had a higher incidence of EMR (12.9% versus 4.6%; P = .009). The most common site of EMR was the central nervous system, especially in the ALL group. Multivariate analyses identified the leading risk factors for EMR in the patients with AML as advanced disease status at HSCT, hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis, history of extramedullary leukemia before HSCT, and a total body irradiation-based conditioning regimen, and the top risk factors for EMR in the patients with ALL as hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis, adverse cytogenetics, and transfusion of peripheral blood stem cells. The prognosis for EMR of AL is poor, and treatment options are very limited; however, the estimated 3-year overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in patients with AML compared with those with ALL (0 versus 18.5%; P = .000). The characteristics of post-allo-HSCT EMR differed between the patients with AML and those with ALL, possibly suggesting different pathogenetic mechanisms for EMR of AML and EMR of ALL after allo-HSCT; further investigation is needed.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we investigated the effects and mechanistic pathways of ART in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a condition that commonly progresses to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Human MDS SKM-1 cells, primary bone marrow (PBM) mononuclear cells from patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) or MDS-AML (MDS cell group), and PBM stromal cells from three patients without hematological diseases (non-MDS cell group) were cultured for 24, 48, or 72 h with or without various ART concentrations. CCK-8, western blot, JC-1 fluorescence, and Annexin-V/Propidium iodide (PI) labeling were used to assess cell proliferation, protein levels, mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMPs) and apoptosis, respectively. ART administration dose- and time-dependently inhibited SKM-1 proliferation. At 24, 48, and 72 h, ART IC(5)(0) values were 89.92, 4.24, and 1.28 mumol/L, respectively. ART only significantly inhibited proliferation in the MDS cell group, but it has little impact on proliferation of non-MDS cells. ART decreased MMPs, and dose-dependently induced SKM-1 cell apoptosis, peaking at 82.9% when treated with 200 mumol/L ART for 24h. Caspase-3 and -9 activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio and apoptosis inducing factor nuclear localization were implicated in apoptosis. Our results indicate that ART effectively induces apoptosis in SKM-1 cells through both caspase-dependent and -independent mitochondrial pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Overproduction of niche factors such as CDH2 (N-Cadherin), IGFBP2, VEGFA, and LIF is associated with the ability of MDS MSCs to enhance MDS expansion. These factors represent putative therapeutic targets in order to disrupt critical hematopoietic-stromal interactions in MDS. Finally, healthy MSCs adopt MDS MSC-like molecular features when exposed to hematopoietic MDS cells, indicative of an instructive remodeling of the microenvironment. Therefore, this patient-derived xenograft model provides functional and molecular evidence that MDS is a complex disease that involves both the hematopoietic and stromal compartments.

Furthermore, in-depth clonal analysis of an animal that developed leukemia after transplantation of HOXB4-modified bone marrow cells showed that dominant clones could be detected as early as 6 months posttransplant using the genomic analysis technique detailed here. Parallel analysis of the cord blood transplant macaque showed no such sites. These findings demonstrate the ability to study the use of gene-modified and expanded cord blood cells in a NHP model.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite intensive research, the mechanism(s) underlying GC resistance remain poorly understood. Recent studies suggested an important role for the pro-survival BCL-2 family member MCL1 in GC resistance in MLL-rearranged ALL. METHODS: We exposed GC-resistant MLL-rearranged SEMK2 cells to potent MCL1-inhibiting agents, including gossypol, AT-101, rapamycin, SU9516 and obatoclax (GX15-070) and determined GC sensitisation using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Using Western blotting we analysed the protein expression of most BCL-2 family members in MLL-rearranged SEMK2 cells after treatment with potent MCL-1 inhibiting agents. RESULTS: Only gossypol and its synthetic analogue AT-101 induced GC sensitivity in MLL-rearranged ALL cells. Remarkably, the GC-sensitising effects of gossypol and AT-101 appeared not to be mediated by down-regulation MCL1 or other anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, but rather involved up-regulation of multiple pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, in particular that of BIM and BID. CONCLUDING REMARKS: In conclusion, gossypol and AT-101 induce GC sensitivity in MLL-rearranged ALL cells, most likely mediated by the activation of BID and BIM without the necessity to down-regulate anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members like MCL1. Hence, co-administration of either gossypol or AT-101 during GC treatment of GC-resistant MLL-rearranged ALL patients may overcome GC resistance and improve prognosis in this high-risk childhood leukaemia.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: cross-sectional study, from January 2011 to December 2012. The secretions of nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed in children younger than 21 years with acute respiratory infections. Patients were treated at the Grupo em Defesa da Crianca Com Cancer (Grendacc) and University Hospital (HU), Jundiai, SP. The rapid test was used for detection of influenza virus (Kit Biotrin, Inc. Ireland), and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (FTD, Respiratory pathogens, multiplex Fast Trade Kit, Malta) for detection of influenza virus (H1N1, B), rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus. The prevalence of viral infection was estimated and association tests were used (chi(2) or Fisher's exact test). RESULTS: 104 samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate and blood were analyzed. The median age was 12 +/- 5.2 years, 51% males, 68% whites, 32% had repeated ARIs, 32% prior antibiotic use, 19.8% cough, and 8% contact with ARIs. A total of 94.3% were in good general status. Acute lymphocytic leukemia (42.3%) was the most prevalent neoplasia. Respiratory viruses were detected in 50 samples: rhinoviruses (23.1%), respiratory syncytial virus AB (8.7%), and coronavirus (6.8%). Co-detection occurred in 19% of cases with 2 viruses and in 3% of those with 3 viruses, and was more frequent between rhinovirus and coronavirus 43. Fever in neutropenic patients was observed in 13%, of which four (30.7) were positive for viruses. There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: the prevalence of respiratory viruses was relevant in the infectious episode, with no increase in morbidity and mortality. Viral co-detection was frequent in patients with cancer and ARIs.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier', 'Editora Ltda.

AML with inv(3)/t(3;3) is associated with aberrant expression of the stem-cell regulator EVI1. Applying functional genomics and genome-engineering, we demonstrate that both 3q rearrangements reposition a distal GATA2 enhancer to ectopically activate EVI1 and simultaneously confer GATA2 functional haploinsufficiency, previously identified as the cause of sporadic familial AML/MDS and MonoMac/Emberger syndromes. Genomic excision of the ectopic enhancer restored EVI1 silencing and led to growth inhibition and differentiation of AML cells, which could be replicated by pharmacologic BET inhibition.

It is the most common acute leukemia affecting adults,and its incidence increases with age. Acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. As the leukemic cells keep filling the bone marrow, symptoms of the disease started to appear: fatigue, bleeding, increased frequency of infections, and shortness of breath. Cardiac tamponade or pericardial tamponade is an acute medical condition in which the accumulation of pericardial fluid prevents the function of the heart. Signs and symptoms include Beck triad (hypotension, distended neck veins, and muffled heart sounds), paradoxus pulses, tachycardia, tachypnea, and breathlessness. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade are rare and severe complications of leukemia; they often develop during the radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or infections in the course of leukemia. This study sought to assess the fatal cardiac tamponade as the first manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found no reports in the literature linking these 2 clinical entities. Although the patient had no signs or diagnosis of AML previously, this case was remarkable for the rapidly progressive symptoms and the fatal outcome.

When the PFP recurred, additional diagnostic tests were performed. The resulting immunohistochemical profile included CD3 positivity in a few reactive T lymphocytes; positivity for myeloperoxidase in atypical cells; and focal positivity for CD34 and proto-oncogene c-kit proteins in neoplastic cells, thus confirming the suspicion of mastoid infiltration caused by relapsed AML.

METHODS: To determine the adult acute leukemia detection rate of the various criteria, we recorded complete blood count (CBC) test results from consecutive patients with leukemia (130 hospitalized patients and 96 outpatients) and from consecutive patients without leukemia (34,827 hospitalized and 33,695 outpatients). RESULTS: Basic criteria for a reflex review (hemoglobin, platelets, and a five-part differential) detected 91% of new hospital leukemia patients (118 of 130) compared to 75% (72 of 96) outpatients. No cases were missed if we did reflex testing when there was either one of the basic criteria or an increased proportion of large unstained cells (LUC), but five cases were missed using the blast flag instead of the LUC. Adding the LUC to basic criteria resulted in the detection of all cases of acute leukemia. The cost of detection of one case of acute leukemia was 1029 and 425 peripheral smear reviews in hospital and outpatients, respectively.

The quality of response to treatment, assessed in terms of detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), has been consistently associated with prognosis and clinical outcome in patients with AML. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of analyzing MRD in bone marrow using 4-color multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) in 29 patients with AML before and after allo-SCT. Eighteen patients who were shown to be MRD-negative [</=0.1% leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs)] by MFC at transplantation and underwent allo-SCT had lower rates of relapse (15% vs. 66%, P = 0.045), better overall 1-yr survival (83% vs. 52%, P = 0.021) and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (P = 0.032) than patients who were MRD-positive (>0.1%). All post-transplant MRD-positive patients underwent a therapeutic intervention after transplant (tapering of immunosuppression, donor lymphocyte infusion, or re-transplant) with the intention of preventing relapse. Disease was controlled and MRD disappeared in five of these patients. Disease recurred in the other seven patients.

However, whether pre-B ALL blasts directly respond to IL-15 is unknown. Here, we show that most pre-B ALL primary samples and cell lines express IL-15 and components of its receptor and that primary pre-B ALL cells show increased growth in culture in response to IL-15. Investigation of mechanisms of action using IL-15-responsive SD-1 cells shows this growth advantage is maximal under low-serum conditions, mimicking those found in cerebrospinal fluid. IL-15 also upregulates PSGL-1 and CXCR3, molecules associated with CNS trafficking. Investigation of downstream signaling pathways indicates that IL-15 induces signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and to a lesser extent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) phosphorylation. The IL-15-mediated growth advantage is abolished by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK), PI3K, and NF-kappaB inhibitors but preserved in the presence of STAT5 inhibition.

Despite the manufacturer's product information reporting minimal systemic effects of topical tacrolimus, this has not been evaluated in patients with cutaneous GVHD and with occlusive dressings. We describe two patients with cutaneous GVHD who developed toxic tacrolimus levels after receiving several applications of tacrolimus ointment along with occlusive dressings to enhance skin effectiveness. The first patient was a 62-year-old woman with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and developed chronic GVHD involving 70% of her body surface area. Her GVHD treatment plan consisted of oral corticosteroids, oral tacrolimus, topical corticosteroids, topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice/day, emollient creams, intravenous rituximab, and photopheresis. The patient's tacrolimus trough levels rose rapidly over the course of 6 days from less than 2 ng/ml to 23 ng/ml, despite oral tacrolimus dosage adjustments. The second patient was a 25-year-old man who developed severe, chronic skin GVHD after undergoing allogeneic sibling bone marrow transplantation for AML. In addition to intravenous corticosteroids, corticosteroid creams, and oral tacrolimus, the patient also received topical tacrolimus twice/day with occlusive dressings. Over the course of 2 days, his tacrolimus trough levels increased from 7.10 ng/ml to 22.10 ng/ml. Although improvement was noted in both patients' skin GVHD with application of the occlusive dressings, the practice was discontinued due to increased and erratic systemic tacrolimus absorption. These case reports suggest that substantial use of topical tacrolimus with occlusive dressings in patients with cutaneous GVHD may contribute to increased systemic absorption resulting in toxic tacrolimus levels. Based on the findings from our two patients as well as published case reports, systemic absorption appears to increase with greater skin permeability, skin barrier dysfunction, amount of body surface area applied, and use of occlusive dressings. When one or more of these factors are present, it may be prudent to monitor tacrolimus levels.","['(c) 2014 Pharmacotherapy Publications, Inc.']","['Olson, Katherine A', 'West, Kathleen', 'McCarthy, Philip L']","['Olson KA', 'West K', 'McCarthy PL']","['Department of Pharmacy Services, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20140403,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,IM,"['Administration, Cutaneous', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occlusive Dressings', 'Skin Absorption', 'Skin Diseases/pathology', 'Tacrolimus/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Transplant Recipients']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['drug absorption', 'graft-versus-host disease', 'tacrolimus']",2014/04/05 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/phar.1418 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2014 Jun;34(6):e60-4. doi: 10.1002/phar.1418.

We investigated the effect of EGCG on phloxine B (PhB)-induced photocytotoxicity in human T lymphocytic leukemia Jurkat cells. EGCG significantly potentiated PhB-induced photocytotoxic effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activity induction in Jurkat cells. Catalase attenuated the enhanced cytotoxicity by EGCG, suggesting the involvement of extracellularly produced hydrogen peroxide. Indeed, EGCG significantly enhanced extracellular hydrogen peroxide formation induced by photo-irradiated PhB. The EGCG also enhanced intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) gene expression, all of which are involved in PhB-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that EGCG is capable of potentiating photodynamic therapy responses, presumably through the intracellular oxidative stress-sensitive JNK/IFN-gamma pathway by exogenous hydrogen peroxide formation.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Qi, Hang', 'Abe, Naomi', 'Zhu, Beiwei', 'Murata, Yoshiyuki', 'Nakamura, Yoshimasa']","['Qi H', 'Abe N', 'Zhu B', 'Murata Y', 'Nakamura Y']","['School of Food Science and Technology, Dalian Polytechnic University, Dalian, 116034, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140403,England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Prohibitins', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate', 'c-Jun N-terminal kinase', 'interferon-gamma', 'phloxine B', 'photodynamic therapy', 'reactive oxygen species']",2014/04/05 06:00,2015/04/01 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.5152 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2014 Oct;28(10):1486-91. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5152.

Multivariate analysis revealed that three variables had a significant impact on treatment-free survival: minimal residual disease (P<0.001), IGHV status (P<0.001) and beta2-microglobulin levels (P=0.012). With regards to overall survival, factors predictive of an unfavorable outcome were minimal residual disease positivity (P=0.014), together with advanced age (P<0.001), unmutated IGHV status (P=0.001), TP53 mutations (P<0.001) and elevated levels of beta2-microglobulin (P=0.003).

While emerging data suggest leukemias as possible targets of oncolytic attenuated measles virus, it is unknown whether measles virus can eradicate disseminated leukemia, in particular pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We evaluated the efficacy of attenuated measles virus against a large panel of pediatric xenografted and native primary acute lymphoblastic leukemias ex vivo, and against four different acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenografts of B-lineage in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice. Ex vivo, attenuated measles virus readily spread among and effectively killed leukemia cells while sparing normal human blood cells and their progenitors. In immunodeficient mice with disseminated acute lymphoblastic leukemia a few intravenous injections of attenuated measles virus sufficed to eradicate leukemic blasts in the hematopoietic system and to control central nervous system disease resulting in long-term survival in three of the four xenografted B-lineage leukemias. Differential sensitivity of leukemia cells did not require increased expression of the measles entry receptors CD150 or CD46 nor absence of the anti-viral retinoic acid-inducible gene I/melanoma differentiation associated gene-5 /interferon pathway.

RESULTS: Compared to the U.S. general population, mortality from all causes, all cancer, and cardiovascular diseases was decreased, but mortality from aircraft accidents was highly elevated. Mortality was elevated for malignant melanoma but not for non-chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CNS cancer mortality increased with an increase in cumulative radiation dose. CONCLUSIONS: Cockpit crew had a low all-cause, all-cancer, and cardiovascular disease mortality but elevated aircraft accident mortality.

SRPX2 is considered to promote cellular migration and adhesion in cancers. Our objective was to evaluate the relative expression of the SRPX2 gene and to determine whether such expression correlates with outcomes in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: Surgical specimens of cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa obtained from 227 patients with previously untreated gastric cancer were examined. SRPX2 mRNA expression levels of cancer tissue and adjacent normal mucosa were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We evaluated the clinicopathological significance of the relative expression of SRPX2 in patients with gastric cancer. RESULTS: SRPX2 expression was higher in cancer tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa (P < 0.001). On analysis of the relations between gene expression and clinicopathological factors, SRPX2 expression correlated with tumor size and distant metastasis. Overall survival was significantly lower in patients whose tumors had high SRPX2 expression than in those who had low SRPX2 expression (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that high SRPX2 expression was an independent predictor of survival (HR = 2.028, 95% CI = 1.265-3.251). CONCLUSIONS: SRPX2 expression was significantly higher in gastric cancer tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa, and overexpression of the SRPX2 gene is considered a useful independent predictor of outcomes in patients with gastric cancer.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yamada, Takanobu', 'Oshima, Takashi', 'Yoshihara, Kazue', 'Sato, Tsutomu', 'Nozaki, Akito', 'Shiozawa, Manabu', 'Ota, Mitsuyoshi', 'Yoshikawa, Takaki', 'Akaike, Makoto', 'Numata, Kazushi', 'Rino, Yasushi', 'Kunisaki, Chikara', 'Tanaka, Katsuaki', 'Imada, Toshio', 'Masuda, Munetaka']","['Yamada T', 'Oshima T', 'Yoshihara K', 'Sato T', 'Nozaki A', 'Shiozawa M', 'Ota M', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Akaike M', 'Numata K', 'Rino Y', 'Kunisaki C', 'Tanaka K', 'Imada T', 'Masuda M']","['Gastroenterological Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama-shi, Kanagawa-ken, Japan; Department of Surgery, Yokohama City University, Yokohama-shi, Kanagawa-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140402,United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,IM,"['Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['SRPX2', 'gastric cancer', 'prognosis']",2014/04/05 06:00,2014/06/25 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jso.23602 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 2014 Jun;109(8):836-40. doi: 10.1002/jso.23602.

With a view to providing insight in this area we pooled individual level data from 13 case-control studies participating in the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC). Occupational data were harmonized to a compatible format. Pooled individual analyses were undertaken using unconditional logistic regression. Using exposure data from mothers of 8,236 cases, and 14,850 controls, and from fathers of 8,169 cases and 14,201 controls the odds ratio (OR) for maternal exposure during pregnancy and the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 1.01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78, 1.30] and for paternal exposure around conception 1.20 (95% 1.06, 1.38).

Our finding of a significantly increased risk of AML in the offspring with maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy is consistent with previous reports.

Qualitative interviews with 24 key individuals in six state-level partnerships explored partnership characteristics that influenced selection and use of evidence-based interventions among low-income, rarely or never screened women. Guided by diffusion of innovations theory and the Lasker and Weiss partnership functioning model, interviews about the intervention centered on (a) knowledge surrounding evidence base; (b) identification, selection, and adoption; (c) planning and adaptation; (d) implementation; and (e) partnership reflections and impact. Using grounded theory and content analysis, data revealed that lack of communication and high partner turnover hindered adoption and adaptation, whereas failure of partnership leaders to engage local stakeholders and lack of sufficient funds hampered implementation. Delivery of evidence-based interventions was more effective when partnerships included local partners in early decision making and when coaches were introduced to facilitate strategic thinking about translating evidence-based interventions into practice.

We tested these hypotheses in a large population-based case-control study (SETIL) primarily designed to evaluate the role of electromagnetic fields in childhood hematopoietic malignancies. METHODS: From 1998 to 2003, we enrolled 602 incident cases of ALL from 14 Italian Regions, and 918 controls were individually matched by birthdate, sex, and area of residence. Cases (n = 557) and controls (n = 855) with complete information were analyzed; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) were estimated with logistic regression models conditioned on matching variables and adjusted by birth order, birthweight, duration of breastfeeding, parental age at delivery, education, and occupational exposure to benzene. RESULTS: No evidence associating paternal smoking in the conception period or maternal smoking during the pregnancy with ALL was found. An association of ALL with maternal exposure to SHS during pregnancy (adjusted OR for mothers exposed more than 4 h/day = 2.18, 95 % CI 1.39-3.42) was observed, but recall bias cannot be excluded. Exposure of the children to SHS was associated with ALL only in unadjusted analysis (unadjusted OR for highly exposed children = 1.64; 95 % CI 1.10-2.45). CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support the hypothesis that parental active smoking is associated with ALL. We found very weak evidence of increased risk of ALL for children exposed to SHS.

Prior to adoptive transfer they have to be expanded in vitro to reach therapeutically sufficient numbers. So far, no universal method exists for selective in vitro expansion of engineered T lymphocytes. In order to overcome this problem and for proof of concept we incorporated a novel unique peptide sequence of ten amino acids as epitope (E-Tag) into the binding domains of two novel chimeric antigen receptors (ECARs) directed against either prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) for the treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) or CD33 for the treatment of acute myeloide leukemia (AML). The epitope tag then was utilized for expanding ECAR engrafted T cells by triggering the modified T cells via a monoclonal antibody directed against the E-Tag (Emab). Moreover, the E-Tag served as an efficient selection epitope for immunomagnetic isolation of modified T cells to high purity. ECAR engrafted T cells were fully functional and mediated profound anti-tumor effects in the respective models of PCa or AML both in vitro and in vivo.

How HTLV-1 establishes latency and reactivates is unclear. Here we show that most HTLV-1-infected HeLa cells become senescent. By contrast, when NF-kappaB activity is blocked, senescence is averted, and infected cells continue to divide and chronically produce viral proteins. A small population of infected NF-kappaB-normal HeLa cells expresses low but detectable levels of Tax and Rex, albeit not Gag or Env. In these ""latently"" infected cells, HTLV-1 LTR trans-activation by Tax persists, but NF-kappaB trans-activation is attenuated due to inhibition by HBZ, the HTLV-1 antisense protein. Furthermore, Gag-Pol mRNA localizes primarily in the nuclei of these cells. Importantly, HBZ was found to inhibit Rex-mediated export of intron-containing mRNAs. Over-expression of Rex or shRNA-mediated silencing of HBZ led to viral reactivation. Importantly, strong NF-kappaB inhibition also reactivates HTLV-1. Hence, during HTLV-1 infection, when Tax/Rex expression is robust and dominant over HBZ, productive infection ensues with expression of structural proteins and NF-kappaB hyper-activation, which induces senescence. When Tax/Rex expression is muted and HBZ is dominant, latent infection is established with expression of regulatory (Tax/Rex/HBZ) but not structural proteins. HBZ maintains viral latency by down-regulating Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation and senescence, and by inhibiting Rex-mediated expression of viral structural proteins.",,"['Philip, Subha', 'Zahoor, Muhammad Atif', 'Zhi, Huijun', 'Ho, Yik-Khuan', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Philip S', 'Zahoor MA', 'Zhi H', 'Ho YK', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA115884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA140963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA140963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140403,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Latency/*physiology']",PMC3974842,,,,2014/04/05 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004040 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-13-02671 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 Apr 3;10(4):e1004040. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004040. eCollection 2014 Apr.,,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (rex Protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we provide a rationale for a drug repositioning strategy to blunt integrin activation in AML cells and restore their sensitivity to chemotherapy. Specifically, we demonstrate that the nontoxic tellurium compound AS101, currently being evaluated in clinical trials, can abrogate the acquired resistance of AML. Mechanistic investigations revealed that AS101 caused redox inactivation of adjacent thiols in the exofacial domain of VLA-4 after its ligation to stromal fibronectin. This effect triggered cytoskeletal conformational changes that decreased PI3K/Akt/Bcl2 signaling, an obligatory step in chemosensitization by AS101. In a mouse xenograft of AML derived from patient leukemic cells with high VLA-4 expression and activity, we demonstrated that AS101 abrogated drug resistance and prolonged survival in mice receiving chemotherapy. Decreased integrin activity was confirmed on AML cells in vivo. The chemosensitizing activity of AS101 persisted in hosts with defective adaptive and innate immunity, consistent with evidence that integrin deactivation was not mediated by heightening immune attack.

We quantified tumor burden in blood, lymph nodes (LNs), spleen and bone marrow, assessed phenotypic changes of circulating cells and measured whole-blood viscosity. With just one dose of ibrutinib, the average increase in ALC was 66%, and in>40% of patients the ALC peaked within 24 h of initiating treatment. Circulating CLL cells on day 2 showed increased Ki67 and CD38 expression, indicating an efflux of tumor cells from the tissue compartments into the blood. The kinetics and degree of the treatment-induced lymphocytosis was highly variable; interestingly, in patients with a high baseline ALC the relative increase was mild and resolution rapid. After two cycles of treatment the disease burden in the LN, bone marrow and spleen decreased irrespective of the relative change in ALC.

Heparanase expression was markedly increased following addition of doxycycline (Dox) to the culture medium of CAG human myeloma cells infected with the inducible heparanase gene construct, resulting in increased colony number and size in soft agar. Moreover, tumor xenografts produced by CAG-heparanase cells were markedly increased in mice supplemented with Dox in their drinking water compared with control mice maintained without Dox. Consistently, we found that heparanase induction is associated with decreased levels of CXCL10, suggesting that this chemokine exerts tumor-suppressor properties in myeloma. Indeed, recombinant CXCL10 attenuated the proliferation of CAG, U266 and RPMI-8266 myeloma cells.

There are a number of reasons for this, but key among them is the considerable heterogeneity of this disease and the paucity of molecular markers that can be used to predict clinical outcomes and responsiveness to different therapies. The recent large-scale sequencing of AML genomes is now providing opportunities for patient stratification and personalized approaches to treatment that are based on individual mutational profiles. It is particularly notable that studies by The Cancer Genome Atlas and others have determined that 44% of patients with AML exhibit mutations in genes that regulate methylation of genomic DNA. In particular, frequent mutation has been observed in the genes encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), as well as Tet oncogene family member 2. This review will summarize the incidence of these mutations, their impact on biochemical functions including epigenetic modification of genomic DNA and their potential usefulness as prognostic indicators. Importantly, the presence of DNMT3A, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations may confer sensitivity to novel therapeutic approaches, including the use of demethylating agents. Therefore, the clinical experience with decitabine and azacitidine in the treatment of patients harboring these mutations will be reviewed. Overall, we propose that understanding the role of these mutations in AML biology will lead to more rational therapeutic approaches targeting molecularly defined subtypes of the disease.",,"['Im, A P', 'Sehgal, A R', 'Carroll, M P', 'Smith, B D', 'Tefferi, A', 'Johnson, D E', 'Boyiadzis, M']","['Im AP', 'Sehgal AR', 'Carroll MP', 'Smith BD', 'Tefferi A', 'Johnson DE', 'Boyiadzis M']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140404,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC4234093,['NIHMS632983'],,,2014/04/05 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2014/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014124 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.124 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Sep;28(9):1774-83. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.124.

We confirm that >60% of the samples analyzed are characterized by high pathway phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, however, we show here that targeting Akt and mTOR with the specific inhibitors Akti 1/2 and Torin1, alone or in combination, result in paradoxical Akt phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling in 70% of the samples. Indeed, we demonstrate that cropping Akt or mTOR activity can stabilize the Akt/mTOR downstream effectors Forkhead box O and insulin receptor substrate-1, which in turn potentiate signaling through upregulation of the expression/phosphorylation of selected growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activation of RTKs in turn reactivates PI3K and downstream signaling, thus overruling the action of the drugs.

Although CTL-mediated cytotoxicity has been widely studied for many years, the rate at which virus-infected cells are killed in vivo by the CTL response is poorly understood. To date the rate of CTL killing in vivo has been estimated for three virus infections but the estimates differ considerably, and killing of HIV-1-infected cells was unexpectedly low. This raises questions about the typical anti-viral capability of CTL and whether CTL killing is abnormally low in HIV-1. We estimated the rate of killing of infected cells by CD8+ T cells in two distinct persistent virus infections: sheep infected with Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) and humans infected with Human T Lymphotropic Virus type 1 (HTLV-1) which together with existing data allows us to study a total of five viruses in parallel. Although both BLV and HTLV-1 infection are characterised by large expansions of chronically activated CTL with immediate effector function ex vivo and no evidence of overt immune suppression, our estimates are at the lower end of the reported range. This enables us to put current estimates into perspective and shows that CTL killing of HIV-infected cells may not be atypically low. The estimates at the higher end of the range are obtained in more manipulated systems and may thus represent the potential rather than the realised CTL efficiency.",,"['Elemans, Marjet', 'Florins, Arnaud', 'Willems, Luc', 'Asquith, Becca']","['Elemans M', 'Florins A', 'Willems L', 'Asquith B']","['Section of Immunology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology, Universite de Liege and GIGA, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, Liege, Belgium.', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology, Universite de Liege and GIGA, Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech, Liege, Belgium.', 'Section of Immunology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['G0601072/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/J007439/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140403,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cattle', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/immunology/virology']",PMC3974637,,,,2014/04/05 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003534 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-13-00954 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2014 Apr 3;10(4):e1003534. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003534. eCollection 2014 Apr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand how epigenetic modification alters miRNA expression in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) in different environments, we analyzed the connections between H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 modification and the expression of miRNAs in LPS- and TGF-beta-conditioned moDCs. RESULTS: In moDCs, H3K4me3 modification was strongly associated with the expression of activating miRNAs, whereas H3K27me3 was related to repressive miRNAs. The regulation of miRNA expression by H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 was further confirmed by silencing or inhibiting methyltransferases or methylation-associated factors in LPS- and TGF-beta-conditioned moDCs. siRNAs targeting H3K4me3-associated mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) and retinoblastoma binding protein 5 (RBBP5) reduced H3K4me3 enrichment and downregulated miRNA expression; conversely, silencing H3K27me3-associated enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and embryonic ectoderm development (EED) genes upregulated the DC-associated miRNAs. However, LPS-mediated miRNAs were often associated with H3K4me3 redistribution from the transcription start site (TSS) to the miRNA-coding region. Silencing LPS-associated NF-kappaB p65 and CBP/p300 not only inhibited H3K4m3 redistribution but also reduced miRNA expression. LPS-upregulated RBBP4 and RBBP7, which are involved in chromatin remodeling, also affected the redistribution of H3K4me3 and reduced the expression of miRNAs. CONCLUSION: In LPS- and TGF-beta-conditioned moDCs, miRNAs may be modulated not only by H3K4m3 and H3K27me3 modification but also by redistribution of H3K4me3 around the transcriptional start site of miRNAs. Thus, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 epigenetic modification may play an important role in regulating DC differentiation and function in the presence of tumor or inflammatory environments.",,"['Mei, Shiyue', 'Liu, Yuanhang', 'Bao, Yue', 'Zhang, Yuan', 'Min, Siping', 'Liu, Yifei', 'Huang, Yun', 'Yuan, Xidi', 'Feng, Yue', 'Shi, Jiandang', 'Yang, Rongcun']","['Mei S', 'Liu Y', 'Bao Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Min S', 'Liu Y', 'Huang Y', 'Yuan X', 'Feng Y', 'Shi J', 'Yang R']","['Department of Immunology, Nankai University School of Medicine, Nankai University, Tianjin, P.

A shedding mechanism is presumed to have a key role in the functions of LR11, but the evidence for this has not yet been demonstrated. Tetraspanin CD9 has been recently shown to regulate the ADAM17-mediated shedding of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on the cell surface. Here, we investigated the role of CD9 on the shedding of LR11 in leukocytes. LR11 was not expressed in THP-1 monocytes, but it was expressed and released in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced THP-1 macrophages (PMA/THP-1). Confocal microscopy showed colocalization of LR11 and CD9 proteins on the cell surface of PMA/THP-1. Ectopic neo-expression of CD9 in CCRF-SB cells, which are LR11-positive and CD9-negative, reduced the amount of sLR11 released from the cells. In contrast, incubation of LR11-transfected THP-1 cells with neutralizing anti-CD9 monoclonal antibodies increased the amount of sLR11 released from the cells. Likewise, the PMA-stimulated release of sLR11 increased in THP-1 cells transfected with CD9-targeted shRNAs, which was negated by treatment with the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001. These results suggest that the tetraspanin CD9 modulates the ADAM17-mediated shedding of LR11 in various leukemia cell lines and that the association between LR11 and CD9 on the cell surface has an important role in the ADAM17-mediated shedding mechanism.",,"['Tsukamoto, Shokichi', 'Takeuchi, Masahiro', 'Kawaguchi, Takeharu', 'Togasaki, Emi', 'Yamazaki, Atsuko', 'Sugita, Yasumasa', 'Muto, Tomoya', 'Sakai, Shio', 'Takeda, Yusuke', 'Ohwada, Chikako', 'Sakaida, Emiko', 'Shimizu, Naomi', 'Nishii, Keigo', 'Jiang, Meizi', 'Yokote, Koutaro', 'Bujo, Hideaki', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki']","['Tsukamoto S', 'Takeuchi M', 'Kawaguchi T', 'Togasaki E', 'Yamazaki A', 'Sugita Y', 'Muto T', 'Sakai S', 'Takeda Y', 'Ohwada C', 'Sakaida E', 'Shimizu N', 'Nishii K', 'Jiang M', 'Yokote K', 'Bujo H', 'Nakaseko C']","['1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan [3] Division of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan [3] Division of Transfusion Medicine and Cell Therapy, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical-Laboratory and Experimental-Research Medicine, Toho University Medical Center Sakura Hospital, Sakura, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical-Laboratory and Experimental-Research Medicine, Toho University Medical Center Sakura Hospital, Sakura, Japan.', '1] Department of Hematology, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan [2] Department of Clinical Cell Biology and Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140404,United States,Exp Mol Med,Experimental & molecular medicine,9607880,IM,"['ADAM Proteins/*metabolism', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'LDL-Receptor Related Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Tetraspanin 29/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3944444,,,,2014/04/05 06:00,2014/09/26 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/10 00:00 [revised]', '2013/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['emm2013161 [pii]', '10.1038/emm.2013.161 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Mol Med. 2014 Apr 4;46:e89. doi: 10.1038/emm.2013.161.,,"['0 (LDL-Receptor Related Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (SORL1 protein, human)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Employing human colorectal cancer (HT29) and leukemia (EOL-1) cell lines we could demonstrate an anti-adhesive effect for SDA in vitro. Under physiological shear stress conditions in a laminar flow adhesion assay, SDA inhibited dynamic tumor cell adhesion to immobilized E- or P-selectin. The stability of SDA for more than two hours allowed its application in cell-cell adhesion assays in cell culture medium. When adhesion of HT29 cells to TNFalpha-stimulated E-selectin presenting human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells was analyzed, inhibition via SDA could be demonstrated as well.

Here, we showed that the contribution of LIF for murine implantation was dependent on the strains of mice (ICR, C57BL/6J (B6), ddY, BALB/c, DBA/2Cr and MF1 strains). Inhibition of LIF during the implantation period caused severe disruption of embryo implantation in B6 and MF1 strains. Implantation was partly disrupted in other strains, but some embryos were implanted successfully. We speculated that other IL6 family members compensate for LIF actions on implantation in ICR, ddY, BALB/c, and DBA/2Cr strains. Indeed, the expression level of Ctf1 was upregulated by blockage of LIF function. CT-1 (encoded by Ctf1) treatment induced successful implantation without LIF in delayed implantation mice (ICR and B6) via phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the uterine luminal epithelium. Simultaneous inhibition of LIF and CT-1 did not block implantation completely in ICR mice, indicating that embryo implantation in this strain was robustly protected by LIF, CT-1 and other potential STAT3 activators.

The aim of this study was to investigate the antioxidant status of children and adolescents who had received ALL therapy, and to test the hypothesis that selenium (Se) inadequacy is correlated with reduced defenses against oxidative stress in this population. METHODS: This case-control study involved 24 patients between ages 5 and 13 y who had been treated successfully for ALL (ALL group) and 60 children of similar age and socioeconomic background with no clinical history of leukemia (control group). Dietary intake of Se was evaluated by the 24-h recall method, and the concentrations of Se in plasma, erythrocytes, and urine determined. Antioxidant status was assessed by analysis of the oxidative stress markers, namely, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA), alpha-tocopherol, and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG). RESULTS: There were no between-group differences with respect to plasma (P = 0.122), erythrocyte (P = 0.202), urinary (P = 0.608), or dietary (P = 0.757) levels of Se. GPx activity was significantly (P < 0.001) reduced in the ALL group compared with the control group, whereas SOD activity and MDA concentrations were similar. The concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and 8-oxo-dG were significantly increased in the ALL group compared with the control group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.031, respectively). CONCLUSION: All participants were Se inadequate, but such inadequacy was not correlated with reduced defenses against oxidative stress. However, individuals of the ALL group were with increased oxidative stress compared with the control group, possibly due to previous disease and to intensive polychemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

While PTN has been reported to be expressed in many types of tumors as well as at high serum concentrations in patients with many types of cancer, to date, there has been no report that PTN is expressed in leukemia, especially in lymphocytic leukemia. We isolated the CD19(+) subset of B cells from peripheral blood from healthy adults, B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) patients, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients and examined these cells for PTN mRNA and protein expression. We used immunocytochemistry, western blotting, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to show that PTN protein is highly expressed in CD19(+) B cells from B-ALL and B-CLL patients, but barely expressed in B cells from healthy adults. We also examined PTN expression at the nucleic acid level using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and northern blotting and detected a high levels of PTN transcripts in the CD19(+) B cells from both groups of leukemia patients, but very few in the CD19(+) B cells from the healthy controls. Interestingly, the quantity of the PTN transcripts correlated with the severity of disease. Moreover, suppression of PTN activity with an anti-PTN antibody promoted apoptosis of cells from leukemia patients and cell lines SMS-SB and JVM-2.

Risk factors relating to routes of hematogenous transmission such as the use of shared hypodermic needles, shared reproductive examination sleeves, and natural breeding were associated with BLV within-herd prevalence. Few US dairy producers know the prevalence of BLV-infected cattle in their herds or are aware of the insidious economic impact of BLV or the options for BLV control.

We found that CXCR4-receptor expression was increased in paediatric precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP-ALL) cells compared with normal mononuclear haematopoietic cells (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, high CXCR4-expression correlated with an unfavourable outcome in BCP-ALL (5-year cumulative incidence of relapse +/- standard error: 38.4% +/- 6.9% in CXCR4-high versus 12% +/- 4.6% in CXCR4-low expressing cases, P < 0.0001). Interestingly, BM levels of the CXCR4-ligand (CXCL12) were 2.7-fold lower (P = 0.005) in diagnostic BCP-ALL samples compared with non-leukaemic controls. Induction chemotherapy restored CXCL12 levels to normal. Blocking the CXCR4-receptor with Plerixafor showed that the lower CXCL12 serum levels at diagnosis could not be explained by consumption by the leukaemic cells, nor did we observe an altered CXCL12-production capacity of BM-mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) at this time-point. We rather observed that a very high density of leukaemic cells negatively affected CXCL12-production by the BM-MSC while stimulating the secretion levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). These results suggest that highly proliferative leukaemic cells are able to down-regulate secretion of cytokines involved in homing (CXCL12), while simultaneously up-regulating those involved in haematopoietic mobilization (G-CSF). Therefore, interference with the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis may be an effective way to mobilize BCP-ALL cells.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['van den Berk, Lieke C J', 'van der Veer, Arian', 'Willemse, Marieke E', 'Theeuwes, Myrte J G A', 'Luijendijk, Mirjam W', 'Tong, Wing H', 'van der Sluis, Inge M', 'Pieters, Rob', 'den Boer, Monique L']","['van den Berk LC', 'van der Veer A', 'Willemse ME', 'Theeuwes MJ', 'Luijendijk MW', 'Tong WH', 'van der Sluis IM', 'Pieters R', 'den Boer ML']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology/Haematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140404,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['BM-MSC', 'CXCL12', 'CXCR4', 'Plerixafor', 'paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia']",2014/04/05 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/04/05 06:00'],"['2013/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12883 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Jul;166(2):240-9. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12883.

We analysed BTK expression and function in HCL and analysed the effects of ibrutinib on HCL cells. We demonstrated uniform BTK protein expression in HCL cells. Ibrutinib significantly inhibited HCL proliferation and cell cycle progression. Accordingly, ibrutinib also reduced HCL cell survival after BCR triggering with anti-immunoglobulins and abrogated the activation of kinases downstream of the BCR (PI3K and MAPK). Ibrutinib also inhibited BCR-dependent secretion of the chemokines CCL3 and CCL4 by HCL cells. Interestingly, ibrutinib inhibited also CXCL12-induced signalling, a key pathway for bone marrow homing.

To clear possible reasons for BM failure, we observed a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia who died of hematopoietic failure one year after apparently successful allo-HSCT. METHODS: The patient was a 44 year old male. Allo-HSCT was successful after 40 days, and 100% of marrow cells were of donor's origin. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) began at the 60th day with involvement of multiple organs. He died of marrow failure on the 360th day after allo-HSCT. RESULTS: We identified the origin of the patient's lymphocytes by a donor's specific HLA locus, and a dominant T-cell clone by spectratyping of the TCRVB subfamily on T-cells. The patient's dominant CD8+ cells were separated by magnetic beads and incubated with donor's cells or patient's leukemic cells to evaluate their cytolytic specificity. TCRalpha and TCRbeta cDNAs were cloned from the dominant CD8+ T-cells, transfected into Jurkat cells, and characterized the cytolytic specificity of the transfected Jurkat cells. In the period of 60 to 120th day after allo-HSCT, blood CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased and fluctuated in the range of 60 to 90%, CD3+CD4+ cells fluctuated in the range of 5 to 18%, and CD4+CD25+ cells accounted for between 3 to 13%. Spectratyping of the 24 TCRVbeta subfamilies in blood lymphocytes demonstrated a dominant TCRVbeta13.1 clone with HLA-A*0201 of donor origin. The dominant CD8+ cells separated by magnetic beads showed cytolytic specificity to donor's blood mononuclear cells (BMCs), but not to patient's fibroblasts. Jurkat cells containing the cDNAs of TCRalpha and TCRbeta chains cloned from the dominant CD8+ cell clone had cytolytic activity against donor's BMCs, patient's leukemic cells, and BMCs from an unrelated subject accounting for 43%, 15%, and 0.42%, respectively. The dominant lymphocyte clone of donor's origin with CD3+CD8+ TCRVbeta13.1 markers in the patient may have been determinant in the hematopoiesis failure.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated cytotoxicity of different crude solvent extracts from C. calcitrans and N. oculata against various cancer cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was carried out to screen the cytotoxic effects of hexane (Hex), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate, and methanol extract from C. calcitrans and N. oculata toward various cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry cell cycle was used to determine the cell cycle arrest while the mode of cell death was investigated through acridine orange/propidium iodide (AOPI) staining, Annexin V-Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) and Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated d-UTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assays. Expression profile of apoptotic and proliferative-related genes was then determined using the multiplex gene expression profiler (GeXP). RESULTS: Crude ethyl acetate (CEA) extract of C. calcitrans inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 cells, with IC50 of 60 mug/mL after 72 h of treatment. Further studies were conducted to determine the mode of cell death at various concentrations of this extract: 30, 60 and 120 mug/mL. The mode of cell death was mainly apoptosis as shown through apoptosis determination test. The expression data from GeXP showed that caspase-4 was upregulated while B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2(Bcl-2) was down regulated. Thus, caspase-4 induction endoplasmic reticulum death pathway is believed to be one of the mechanisms underlying the induction of apoptosis while Bcl-2 induced S and G2/M cell cycle phase arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells.

The expression of livin was analyzed in 80 patients with newly diagnosed childhood ALL using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The results of the study revealed that the expression levels of livin were higher in patients with favorable prognostic factors. Furthermore, livin expression was associated with a favorable early response to chemotherapy (leukemic blast <25% day 7 bone marrow response) (P = 0.001). Patients with high livin expression were associated with significantly higher CR rate (P = 0.02) and lower mortality rate (P = 0.05) than those with low livin expression. Kaplan-Meier curves demonstrated that high livin expression was associated with significantly longer DFS (P = 0.004) and overall survival (P = 0.02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that livin expression was independent favorable prognostic factor for OS and DFS (P = 0.05 and P = 0.01, respectively).

Among the various viral proteins, the FeLV env-gene product (SU) and the envelope transmembrane protein p15E were considered promising candidates for the serological diagnosis of FeLV infection. Thus, we evaluated p15E and three other FeLV antigens, namely, a recombinant env-gene product, whole FeLV, and a short peptide from the FeLV transmembrane protein, for their potential to detect FeLV infection. To evaluate possible exposure of cats to FeLV, we tested serum and plasma samples from experimentally and naturally infected and vaccinated cats for the presence of antibodies to these antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The serological results were compared with the p27 and proviral real-time PCR results. We found that p15E displayed a diagnostic sensitivity of 95.7% and a specificity of 100% in experimentally infected cats. In naturally infected cats, p15E showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 77.1% and a specificity of 85.6%. Vaccinated cats displayed minimal antibody levels to p15E, suggesting that anti-p15E antibodies indicate infection rather than vaccination. The other antigens turned out to be too unspecific. The lower specificity in cats exposed to FeLV under field conditions may be explained by the fact that some cats become infected and seroconvert in the absence of detectable viral nucleic acids in plasma. We conclude that p15E serology may become a valuable tool for diagnosing FeLV infection; in some cases, it may replace PCR.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

The described mechanism by which MLL-AF6, through constitutive self-association and in cooperation with DOT-1L, activates aberrant gene expression does not explain the biological differences existing between t(6;11)-rearranged and other MLL-positive patients nor their different clinical outcome. Here, we show that AF6 is expressed in the cytoplasm of healthy bone marrow cells and controls rat sarcoma viral oncogene (RAS)-guanosine triphosphate (GTP) levels. By contrast, in MLL-AF6-rearranged cells, AF6 is found localized in the nucleus, leading to aberrant activation of RAS and of its downstream targets. Silencing MLL-AF6, we restored AF6 localization in the cytoplasm, thus mediating significant reduction of RAS-GTP levels and of cell clonogenic potential. The rescue of RAS-GTP levels after MLL-AF6 and AF6 co-silencing confirmed that MLL-AF6 oncoprotein potentiates the activity of the RAS pathway through retention of AF6 within the nucleus. Exposure of MLL-AF6-rearranged AML blasts to tipifarnib, a RAS inhibitor, leads to cell autophagy and apoptosis, thus supporting RAS targeting as a novel potential therapeutic strategy in patients carrying t(6;11). Altogether, these data point to a novel role of the MLL-AF6 chimera and show that its gene partner, AF6, is crucial in AML development.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Manara, Elena', 'Baron, Emma', 'Tregnago, Claudia', 'Aveic, Sanja', 'Bisio, Valeria', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Pigazzi, Martina']","['Manara E', 'Baron E', 'Tregnago C', 'Aveic S', 'Bisio V', 'Bresolin S', 'Masetti R', 'Locatelli F', 'Basso G', 'Pigazzi M']","['Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, Instituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;', 'Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, Instituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;', 'Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, Instituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;', 'Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, Instituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;', 'Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, Instituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;', 'Women and Child Health Department, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, Instituto di Ricerca Pediatrica, University of Padova, Padova, Italy;', 'Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Bologna, Ospedale ""S.

Disruption to cooperative assemblage could underlie repression of tumor suppressor genes in leukemia cells. Mechanisms of cooperation and its disruption were therefore examined for PU.1 and RUNX1, transcription factors that cooperate to activate hematopoietic differentiation genes. PU.1 is highly expressed in leukemia cells, whereas RUNX1 is frequently inactivated by mutation or translocation. Thus, coregulator interactions of Pu.1 were examined by immunoprecipitation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry/Western blot in wild-type and Runx1-deficient hematopoietic cells. In wild-type cells, the NuAT and Baf families of coactivators coimmunoprecipitated with Pu.1. Runx1 deficiency produced a striking switch to Pu.1 interaction with the Dnmt1, Sin3A, Nurd, CoRest, and B-Wich corepressor families. Corepressors of the Polycomb family, which are frequently inactivated by mutation or deletion in myeloid leukemia, did not interact with Pu.1. The most significant gene ontology association of Runx1-Pu.1 co-bound genes was with macrophages, therefore, functional consequences of altered corepressor/coactivator exchange were examined at Mcsfr, a key macrophage differentiation gene. In chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, high level Pu.1 binding to the Mcsfr promoter was not decreased by Runx1 deficiency. However, the Pu.1-driven shift from histone repression to activation marks at this locus, and terminal macrophage differentiation, were substantially diminished. DNMT1 inhibition, but not Polycomb inhibition, in RUNX1-translocated leukemia cells induced terminal differentiation. Thus, RUNX1 and PU.1 cooperate to exchange corepressors for coactivators, and the specific corepressors recruited to PU.1 as a consequence of RUNX1 deficiency could be rational targets for leukemia differentiation therapy.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Gu, Xiaorong', 'Hu, Zhenbo', 'Ebrahem, Quteba', 'Crabb, John S', 'Mahfouz, Reda Z', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Crabb, John W', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen']","['Gu X', 'Hu Z', 'Ebrahem Q', 'Crabb JS', 'Mahfouz RZ', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Crabb JW', 'Saunthararajah Y']","['From the Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, and.', 'From the Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, and.', 'From the Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Ophthalmic Research, Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 and.', 'From the Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, and.', 'the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'Department of Ophthalmic Research, Cole Eye Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio 44195 and.', 'From the Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, and saunthy@ccf.org.']",['eng'],"['UL1 RR024989/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA138858/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000439/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1RR024989/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140402,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Co-Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4031539,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromatin Modifying Enzymes', 'Enhanceosome', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Epigenetics', 'Leukemogenesis', 'Protein Complexes', 'Protein Interactome', 'Transcription Coactivators', 'Transcription Regulation', 'Transcription Repressor']",2014/04/04 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/04/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38687-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.562447 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 May 23;289(21):14881-95. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.562447.

PROCEDURES: We analyzed the CPD of 405 blood samples containing more than 10% blasts that were randomly divided into test and validation sets. With the test set, we produced a model for categorizing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), using ranges of the CPD and regarding the remainder as non-APL acute myeloid leukemia. We verified these models against the validation set. RESULTS: In the test set, we formulated a 21-parameter model which identified 43 of 47 ALL cases (91.5% sensitivity) and ruled out 151 of 156 other leukemia cases (96.8% specificity), and a 13-parameter model which distinguished all 10 APL cases (100% sensitivity) and excluded 193 other leukemia cases (100% specificity).

As these cells differ essentially in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and plasmalogen concentration in the membrane, we have carried out systematic investigations in artificial systems of various compositions. The results for model leukaemia cell membrane were compared with data acquired for systems imitating normal leucocytes. Our results show that the level of plasmalogens significantly modulates the influence of the single-chained phospholipids on the investigated systems. The experiments confirmed also that the interactions of ether lipids with a model membrane of HL-60 cells (in biological tests sensitive to ED) have opposite character when compared with K-562, being resistant to ED. Moreover, the values of the parameters characterizing monolayers serving as membrane models (strength of interactions, monolayers fluidity and morphology) proved both sensitivity of these cells to ED and lack of their susceptibility towards PAF. Interestingly, it has been found that lyso-PAF, which is usually described as an inactive precursor of PAF, displays a stronger effect on HL-60 model membranes than ED.",,"['Flasinski, Michal', 'Hac-Wydro, Katarzyna', 'Wydro, Pawel', 'Dynarowicz-Latka, Patrycja']","['Flasinski M', 'Hac-Wydro K', 'Wydro P', 'Dynarowicz-Latka P']","['Faculty of Chemistry, Department of Environmental Chemistry, Jagiellonian University, , Gronostajowa 3, 30-387 Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140402,England,J R Soc Interface,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",101217269,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Membranes, Artificial', 'Neoplasms/chemistry/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phospholipid Ethers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Plasmalogens/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology']",PMC4006236,,['NOTNLM'],"['Brewster angle microscopy', 'Langmuir monolayers', 'plasmalogens', 'single-chained ether lipids']",2014/04/04 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/04/04 06:00'],"['2014/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['rsif.2013.1103 [pii]', '10.1098/rsif.2013.1103 [doi]']",epublish,J R Soc Interface. 2014 Apr 2;11(95):20131103. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2013.1103.

Micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) play pivotal oncogenic and tumour-suppressor roles in tumour development and progression. However, little is known about the potential role of miRNAs in avian leukosis tumours. We have found a novel tumour-suppressor miRNA, gga-miR-375, associated with avian leukosis tumorigenesis by miRNA microarray in a previous report. We have also previously studied the biological function of gga-miR-375; Overexpression of gga-miR-375 significantly inhibited DF-1 cell proliferation, and significantly reduced the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) by repressing the activity of a luciferase reporter carrying the 3'-untranslated region of YAP1. This indicates that gga-miR-375 is frequently downregulated in avian leukosis by inhibiting cell proliferation through YAP1 oncogene targeting. Overexpression of gga-miR-375 markedly promoted serum starvation induced apoptosis, and there may be the reason why the tumour cycle is so long in the infected chickens. In vivo assays, gga-miR-375 was significantly downregulated in chicken livers 20 days after infection with ALV-J, and YAP1 was significantly upregulated 20 days after ALV-J infection (P<0.05). We also found that expression of cyclin E, an important regulator of cell cycle progression, was significantly upregulated (P<0.05). Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (DIAP1), which is related to caspase-dependent apoptosis, was also significantly upregulated after infection. Our data suggests that gga-miR-375 may function as a tumour suppressor thereby regulating cancer cell proliferation and it plays a key role in avian leukosis tumorigenesis.",,"['Li, Hongxin', 'Shang, Huiqing', 'Shu, Dingming', 'Zhang, Huanmin', 'Ji, Jun', 'Sun, Baoli', 'Li, Hongmei', 'Xie, Qingmei']","['Li H', 'Shang H', 'Shu D', 'Zhang H', 'Ji J', 'Sun B', 'Li H', 'Xie Q']","['College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, P R China; Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, P R China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, P R China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Livestock and Poultry Breeding, Guangzhou, P R China.', 'United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agriculture Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan, United States of America.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, P R China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, P R China; Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, P R China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, P R China; Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, P R China.', 'College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, P R China; Key Laboratory of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, P R China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140402,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Avian Leukosis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Avian Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Fibroblasts', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3973669,,,,2014/04/04 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/04/04 06:00'],"['2013/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0090878 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-47062 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 2;9(4):e90878. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0090878. eCollection 2014.,,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amphotropic retroviral vectors (RVs) used for TCR transduction for this purpose are considered safe in principle. Despite this, TCR-coding and packaging vectors could theoretically recombine to produce replication competent vectors (RCVs), and transduced T-cell preparations must be proven free of RCV. To eliminate the need for RCV testing, we transduced human T cells with ecotropic RVs so potential RCV would be non-infectious for human cells. We show that transfection of synthetic messenger RNA encoding murine cationic amino-acid transporter 1 (mCAT-1), the receptor for murine retroviruses, enables efficient transient ecotropic transduction of human T cells. mCAT-1-dependent transduction was more efficient than amphotropic transduction performed in parallel, and preferentially targeted naive T cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that ecotropic TCR transduction results in antigen-specific restimulation of primary human T cells.

Physiologically active retinoids mediate transcriptional effects on cells through interactions with retinoic acid (RARs) and retinoid-X (RXR) receptors. Chromosomal translocations involving the RARalpha gene, which lead to impaired retinoid signaling, are implicated in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), alone and in combination with arsenic trioxide (ATO), restores differentiation in APL cells and promotes degradation of the abnormal oncogenic fusion protein through several proteolytic mechanisms. RARalpha fusion-protein elimination is emerging as critical to obtaining sustained remission and long-term cure in APL. Autophagy is a degradative cellular pathway involved in protein turnover. Both ATRA and ATO also induce autophagy in APL cells. Enhancing autophagy may therefore be of therapeutic benefit in resistant APL and could broaden the application of differentiation therapy to other cancers. Here we discuss retinoid signaling in hematopoiesis, leukemogenesis, and APL treatment. We highlight autophagy as a potential important regulator in anti-leukemic strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The study was designed to evaluate differences in patients' PML-NBs response to stress factors like a cancerous disease and ionizing radiation exposure dependent on age. METHODS: In order to clarify the role of PML-NBs in the aging process, we examined peripheral blood monocytes of 134 cancer patients and 41 healthy individuals between 22 and 92 years of age, both before and after in vitro irradiation. Additionally, we analyzed the samples of the cancer patients after in vivo irradiation. Cells were immunostained and about 1600 cells per individual were analyzed for the presence of PML- and gammaH2AX foci. RESULTS: The number of existing PML-NBs per nucleus declined with age, while the number of gammaH2AX foci increased with age. There was a non-significant trend that in vivo irradiation increased the number of PML-NBs in cells of young study participants, while in older individuals PML-NBs tended to decrease.

This study analyzes both TET2 expression and mutations in 48 CLL patients. TET2 expression was analyzed by exon arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology was applied to investigate the presence of TET2 variations. Overexpression of TET2 was observed in B-cell lymphocytes from CLL patients compared with healthy donors (P = 0.004). In addition, in CLL patients, an overexpression of TET2 was also observed in the clonal B cells compared with the nontumoral cells (P = 0.002). However, no novel mutations were observed.

RESULTS: PJ34 alone at 0.2-0.4 muM did not influence the examined parameters. Vorinostat alone at 1.0-2.5 muM reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis rate, lowered psim and increased the percentage of sub-G1 cells in all cell lines. Incubation with both drugs caused further inhibition of proliferation and increase in apoptosis associated with a decrease in psim and sub-G1 arrest in HL60, MOLT4 and K562 cells, but not in U937 cells.

Cytarabine uses hENT1 and dCK for its activation. We hypothesized that cytarabine-resistant leukemia cells retain sensitivity to clofarabine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells and cytarabine-resistant variant HL/ara-C20 cells were used in the present study. RESULTS: Despite 20-fold cytarabine resistance, the HL/ara-C20 cells exhibited only a 6-fold resistance to clofarabine compared to HL-60 cells. The intracellular concentration of the triphosphate metabolite of cytarabine was reduced to 1/10, and that of clofarabine was halved in the HL/ara-C20 cells. hENT1 and dCK were reduced, but hCNT3 and dGK were not altered in the HL/ara-C20 cells, which might contribute to their retained capability to produce intracellular triphosphate metabolite of clofarabine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various markers of metabolic activity, mitotic disruption and cytokinesis were used to assess the effectiveness of the drugs in the HL-60 tumor cell system. The ability of annulated indoles to alter the polymerizations of purified tubulin and actin were monitored in cell-free assays and were compared to the effects of drugs known to disrupt the dynamic structures of the mitotic spindle and cleavage furrow. RESULTS: With one exception, annulated indoles inhibited the metabolic activity of HL-60 tumor cells in the low-micromolar range after two and four days in culture but these anti-proliferative effects were weaker than those of jasplakinolide, a known actin binder that blocks cytokinesis. After 24-48 h, antiproliferative concentrations of annulated indoles increased the mitotic index of HL-60 cells similarly to vincristine and stimulated the formation of many bi-nucleated cells, multi-nucleated cells and micronuclei, similarly to taxol and jasplakinolide, suggesting that these antitumor compounds might increase mitotic abnormality, induce chromosomal damage or missegregation, and block cytokinesis. Since annulated indoles mimicked the effect of vincristine on tubulin polymerization, but not that of taxol, these compounds might represent a new class of microtubule de-stabilizing agents that inhibit tubulin polymerization. Moreover, annulated indoles remarkably increased the rate and level of actin polymerization similarly to jasplakinolide, suggesting that they might also stabilize the cleavage furrow to block cytokinesis. CONCLUSION: Although novel derivatives with different substitutions must be synthesized to elucidate structure-activity relationships, identify more potent antitumor compounds and investigate different molecular targets, annulated indoles appear to interact with both tubulin to reduce microtubule assembly and actin to block cytokinesis, thereby inducing bi- and multinucleation, resulting in genomic instability and apoptosis.",,"['Perchellet, Jean-Pierre H', 'Perchellet, Elisabeth M', 'Singh, Chingakham Ranjit', 'Monnett, Meghan T', 'Studer, Elizabeth R', 'Thornton, Paul D', 'Brown, Neil', 'Hill, David', 'Neuenswander, Ben', 'Lushington, Gerald H', 'Santini, Conrad', 'Buszek, Keith R']","['Perchellet JP', 'Perchellet EM', 'Singh CR', 'Monnett MT', 'Studer ER', 'Thornton PD', 'Brown N', 'Hill D', 'Neuenswander B', 'Lushington GH', 'Santini C', 'Buszek KR']","['Anti-Cancer Drug Laboratory, Kansas State University, Division of Biology, Ackert Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506-4901, U.S.A. jpperch@ksu.edu.']",['eng'],"['P50 GM069663/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069711/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokinesis/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Protein Multimerization/drug effects', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",PMC4618554,['NIHMS708494'],['NOTNLM'],"['Annulated indoles', 'actin polymerization', 'cells with mitotic figures', 'cytokinesis', 'several nuclei and micronuclei', 'tubulin polymerization', 'tumor cell proliferation']",2014/04/03 06:00,2014/06/16 06:00,['2014/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/16 06:00 [medline]']",['34/4/1643 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2014 Apr;34(4):1643-55.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Tubulin)', '8724FJW4M5 (indole)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AF10 coiled-coil domain, which is crucial for the leukemogenic effect, has been shown to interact with GAS41, a protein previously identified as the product of an amplified gene in glioblastoma. Using sequential synthetic peptides, we mapped the potential AF10/GAS41 interaction site, which was subsequently be used as scaffold for a library targeting the AF10 coiled-coil domain. Using phage display, we selected a peptide that binds the AF10 coiled-coil domain with higher affinity than the respective coiled-coil region of wild-type GAS41, as demonstrated by phage ELISA, CD, and PCAs. Furthermore, we were able to successfully deploy the inhibitory peptide in a mammalian cell line to lower the expression of Hoxa genes that have been described to be overexpressed in these leukemias. This work dissects molecular determinants mediating AF10-directed interactions in leukemic fusions comprising the N-terminal parts of the proteins MLL or CALM and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of AF10.

The cytologic complete response (CR) rate was 92.3 % after induction. At this time point, the molecular CR rate was 73.9%.

In order to expand upon this observation, the established chronic myelogenous leukemia cell lines KU812 and MEG-01 were treated with imatinib and the effect on several anti-oxidant proteins was determined. The levels of GPx-1 were significantly increased following treatment with imatinib. This increase was not due to altered steady-state mRNA levels, and appeared to be dependent on the expression of Bcr-Abl, as no increases were observed following imatinib treatment of cells that did not express the fusion protein. The nutrient-sensing signaling protein, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), can be activated by Bcr-Abl and its activity regulates the translation of many different proteins.

METHODS: A total of 15 AML patients and 15 healthy subjects (blood donors) were studied. Serum samples were analyzed by biochip based immunoassays on the Evidence Investigator analyzer. This approach allows multi-analytical determination from a single sample. T-tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In newly diagnosed AML patients, we found significant increase (p < 0.01) in serum VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, L-selectin, and significant increase (p < 0.05) in serum IL-6, IL-8. No significant differences were found in the levels of other evaluated cytokines and adhesion molecules. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that serum levels of specific cytokines and adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1, E-selectin, L-selectin, IL-6, IL-8) are significantly altered in patients with newly diagnosed AML, showing activity of the disease. Whether these alterations could serve as a prognostic marker for AML is not known.

However, MRD alone does not adequately predict relapse in all patients. To improve upon the ability to identify patients likely to relapse, we evaluated risk factors, in addition to MRD, that may be associated with development of post-transplantation relapse. In this single institution, retrospective cohort study of children with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome who had undergone a first allogeneic transplantation and had pretransplantation MRD evaluation, 40 of 93 patients (43%) experienced relapse. Univariate analysis demonstrated that African American race, high initial white blood cell count, central nervous system (CNS) disease at diagnosis, short first complete remission, nonmyeloablative (NMA) conditioning, lack of remission, and MRD before transplantation were associated with worse relapse-free survival (RFS). In a Cox multivariable analysis, CNS disease (P = .009), lack of remission (P = .01), and NMA conditioning (P = .04) were independently associated with inferior RFS. Among those in a morphologic complete remission who underwent a myeloablative transplantation, having both CNS disease at diagnosis (specifically in acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and MRD positivity was an independent risk factor predictive of relapse, which has not been previously reported. Results from our study support the existence of risk factors complimentary to pretransplantation MRD.

Patient characteristics and transplantation characteristics, including treatment-related mortality, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival, were collected and analyzed for both univariate and multivariate outcomes. With median follow-up of 115 (allogeneic) and 72 months (autologous), 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) favored autologous with 63% (49% to 75%), compared with allogeneic at 50% (44% to 57%) (P = .10). OS was 75% (63% to 85%) versus 54% (48% to 61%) (P = .002), for autologous and allogeneic transplantation, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed significantly worse DFS after allogeneic HCT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16 to 3.06; P = .011) and age > 40 years (HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.44 to 3.67; P = .0005). OS was significantly worse after allogeneic HCT (HR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.52 to 4.65; P= .0006); age > 40 (HR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.95 to 5.54; P < .001), and first complete remission < 12 months (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.26; P = .021). Positive pre-HCT PML-RAR proportional, variant status in 17 of 114 allogeneic and 6 of 41 receiving autologous transplantation did not influence relapse, treatment failure, or survival in either group. The survival advantage for autografting was attributable to increased treatment-related mortality (TRM) in the allogeneic group of 30% compared to 2% in the autologous group, in addition to the added mortality associated with GVHD. We conclude that autologous HCT yields superior OS for APL in CR2. Long-term DFS in autologous recipients, even with minimal residual disease-positive grafts, remains an important subject for further study.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

These effects were associated with downregulated donor T cell expression of tissue-specific homing and chemokine receptors, marked reduction of donor T cell migration into GVHD target tissues, and deletion of CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). MLN CD103(+) DCs and peripheral lymph node (PLN) DCs include CCR7(+) and CCR7(-) subsets, but the role of these DC subsets in regulating donor T cell expression of homing and chemokine receptors remain unclear. Here, we show that recipient CCR7(+), but not CCR7(-), DCs in MLN induced donor T cell expression of gut-specific homing and chemokine receptors in a retinoid acid-dependent manner. CCR7 regulated activated DC migration from tissue to draining lymph node, but it was not required for the ability of DCs to induce donor T cell expression of tissue-specific homing and chemokine receptors. Finally, anti-CD3 treatment depleted CCR7(+) but not CCR7(-) DCs by inducing sequential expansion and apoptosis of CCR7(+) DCs in MLN and PLN. Apoptosis of CCR7(+) DCs was associated with DC upregulation of Fas expression and natural killer cell but not T, B, or dendritic cell upregulation of FasL expression in the lymph nodes. These results suggest that depletion of CCR7(+) host-type DCs, with subsequent inhibition of donor T cell migration into GVHD target tissues, can be an effective approach in prevention of acute GVHD and preservation of GVL effects.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

They represent about 10 new cases per year in France and preferentially affect males. JMML are all stem cell diseases the common denominator of which is RAS pathway dysregulation, due to mutations in RAS (NRAS, KRAS) or RAS regulatory components (PTPN11, NF1 or CBL). This leads to an hypersensivity of myeloid progenitors to GM-CSF (granulo-macrophagic colony stimulating factor) which induces in turn excessive monocytic and macrophagic proliferation in blood and bone marrow. All organs can be infiltrated by this monocytic proliferation leading to multisystemic failure. Blast crisis with transformation into acute myeloid leukemia occurs in one third of patients. A salient feature of JMML is their frequent association with predisposition syndromes such as Noonan syndrome, neurofibromatosis and CBL syndrome, which are developmental diseases associated with a constitutional RAS pathway deregulation, now grouped under the name RASopathies. Clinical heterogeneity makes JMML diagnosis difficult. Splenomagaly is the most constant sign. Palor, adenopathy, respiratory or cutaneous symptoms can also be present. Blood smear shows monocytosis (>1x10(9)/L) presence of myeloid progenitors and abnormal basophils. The demonstration of an endogeneous in vitro growth of myeloid progenitors although not very specific can help JMML diagnosis. Nowadays, genetic typing has to be included in the workup of JMML diagnosis and allows to evidence a mutation in more than 90% of cases. JMML have a poor prognosis. The only curative treatment is bone marrow transplantation but approximately 35% of patients relapse. JMML clinical course is highly heterogeneous and unpredictable.

MLN4924, a selective NAE inhibitor, has displayed preclinical anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo, and promising clinical activity has been reported in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies. Here, we sought to understand the mechanisms of resistance to MLN4924. K562 and U937 leukemia cells were exposed over a 6 month period to MLN4924 and populations of resistant cells (R-K562(MLN), R-U937(MLN)) were selected. R-K562(MLN) and R-U937(MLN) cells contain I310N and Y352H mutations in the NAE catalytic subunit UBA3, respectively. Biochemical analyses indicate that these mutations increase the enzyme's affinity for ATP while decreasing its affinity for NEDD8. These mutations effectively contribute to decreased MLN4924 potency in vitro while providing for sufficient NAE function for leukemia cell survival. Finally, R-K562(MLN) cells showed cross-resistance to other NAE-selective inhibitors, but remained sensitive to a pan-E1 (activating enzyme) inhibitor.

However, immune tolerance mechanisms that normally protect healthy tissues from autoimmune effects prevent the development of effective antitumor immunity. Tumors use several different immunosuppressive mechanisms to evade otherwise effective T-cell responses. A growing number of immune evasion mechanisms have been characterized mainly in solid tumors. In hematological malignancies, less is known about how different immune escape mechanisms influence tumor immune evasion and the extent of their impact on ongoing immune responses. The present review highlights the potential role of three well-defined immunosuppressive mechanisms in hematological malignancies: (i) inhibitory T-cell pathways (especially programmed death ligand 1/programmed death 1 (PD-L1/PD-1)), (ii) regulatory immune cells, and (iii) metabolic enzymes such as indoeamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The possible therapeutic targeting of these pathways is also discussed. Exciting new strategies that might affect future antileukemia immunotherapy include monoclonal antibodies that block inhibitory T-cell pathways (PD-1/PD-L1) and the prevention of tryptophan depletion by IDO inhibitors. Furthermore, the clinical effect of several chemotherapeutic drugs may arise from the targeting of immunosuppressive cells. Evidence for a new feedback mechanism to suppress the function of regulatory immune cells was recently provided by the identification and characterization of spontaneous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against regulatory immune cells. Such specific CTLs may be immensely useful in anticancer immunotherapy (for example, by anticancer vaccination). The targeting of one or more immunosuppressive pathways may be especially interesting in combination with antileukemic immunotherapy in cases in which immunosuppressive mechanisms antagonize the desired effects of the therapy.",,"['Andersen, M H']",['Andersen MH'],"['Department of Hematology, Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (CCIT), Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140318,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['B7-H1 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunotherapy', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",,,,,2014/04/03 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014108 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Sep;28(9):1784-92. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.108.

The participation of toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signaling in MDS is well documented. Increased TLR signaling leads to the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB, which mediates inflammation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. In addition, the TLR pathway induces the expression of miRNAs which participate in the fine-tuning of the inflammatory response. miRNAs also regulate other biological processes, including hematopoiesis. miR-125a and miR-125b are known modulators of hematopoiesis and are abnormally expressed in several hematologic malignancies. However, little is known about their role in MDS. NF-kappaB-activating ability has been described for both miRNAs. We studied the role of miR-125a/miR-125b in MDS and their relationship with TLR signaling and hematopoietic differentiation. Our results indicate that miR-125a is significantly overexpressed in MDS patients and correlates negatively with patient survival. Expression of miR-99b, which is clustered with miR-125a, is also directly correlated with prognosis of MDS. Both miR-125a and miR-99b activated NF-kappaB in vitro; however, we observed a negative correlation between miR-99b expression and the levels of TLR2, TLR7 and two downstream genes, suggesting that NF-kappaB activation by the miRNA cluster occurs in the absence of TLR signaling. We also show that TLR7 is negatively correlated with patient survival in MDS. In addition, our data suggest that miR-125a may act as an NF-kappaB inhibitor upon TLR stimulation. These results indicate that miR-125a is involved in the fine-tuning of NF-kappaB activity and that its effects may depend on the status of the TLR pathway. Furthermore, we observed that miR-125a inhibits erythroid differentiation in leukemia and MDS cell lines. Therefore, this miRNA could serve as a prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target in MDS.",,"['Ganan-Gomez, Irene', 'Wei, Yue', 'Yang, Hui', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Calin, George', 'Boyano-Adanez, Maria Del Carmen', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Ganan-Gomez I', 'Wei Y', 'Yang H', 'Pierce S', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Calin G', 'Boyano-Adanez Mdel C', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Systems Biology, University of Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Systems Biology, University of Alcala, Alcala de Henares, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140401,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Erythropoiesis/drug effects/genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Multigene Family', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptors/metabolism']",PMC3972113,,,,2014/04/03 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2014/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0093404 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-48538 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Apr 1;9(4):e93404. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0093404. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MIRN99 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', '0 (mirnlet7 microRNA, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: University-associated infertility clinics. PATIENT(S): Women with UI for more than 1 year and healthy control women. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial biopsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Time to pregnancy was compared between patients with UI who were evaluated for endometrial LIF protein as well as alphanubeta3 integrin expression. Endometrium was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and messenger RNA by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR) in samples from women with UI as well as healthy control women. RESULT(S): Leukemia inhibitor factor was expressed in epithelial cells in a cyclic fashion in controls, and overall expression in the secretory phase was similar between controls and women with UI, whereas alphanubeta3 integrin expression was reduced. However, using quantitative real-time PCR, LIF messenger RNA abundance was 4.4-fold lower in women with low levels of alphanubeta3 integrin expression compared with samples with normal integrins. By immunohistochemistry, alphanubeta3 integrin expression was always lacking when the histology was out of phase, whereas LIF expression was only negative in a subset of those samples. Reduced endometrial LIF expression was strongly associated with poor reproductive outcomes. CONCLUSION(S): Endometrial LIF expression peaks in the midsecretory phase and is reduced in some women with UI. The use of LIF in combination with alphanubeta3 integrin as biomarkers appears to be superior to integrin testing alone when evaluating endometrial receptivity, primarily because of its earlier pattern of expression during the secretory phase.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Reproductive Medicine.

In this study, the incidence, clinical features, and prognosis of 92 Chinese children with T-ALL treated using the Beijing Children's Hospital-2003 and Chinese Childhood Leukaemia Group-2008 protocols were analysed. NOTCH1 mutations were found in 42% of T-ALL patients and were not associated with clinical features, prednisone response, and minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 33 and 78. However, proline, glutamate, serine, threonine (PEST)/transactivation domain (TAD) mutations were associated with younger age (15/16 mutant vs. 48/76 wild-type, P = 0.018) and more central nervous system involvement (4/16 mutant vs. 3/76 wild-type, P = 0.016); while heterodimerization domain (HD) mutations were associated with KMT2A-MLLT1 (MLL-ENL; 4/30 mutant vs. 1/62 wild-type, P = 0.037). Furthermore, prognosis was better in patients with NOTCH1 mutations than in those with wild-type NOTCH1 (5-year event-free survival [EFS] 92.0 +/- 4.5% vs. 64.0 +/- 7.1%; P = 0.003). Long-term outcome was better in patients carrying HD mutations than in patients with wild-type HD (5-year EFS 89.7 +/- 5.6% vs. 69.3 +/- 6.2%; P = 0.034). NOTCH1 mutations and MRD at day 78 were independent prognostic factors. These findings indicate that NOTCH1 mutation predicts a favourable outcome in Chinese paediatric patients with T-ALL on the BCH-2003 and CCLG-2008 protocols, and may be considered a prognostic stratification factor.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Gao, Chao', 'Liu, Shu-Guang', 'Zhang, Rui-Dong', 'Li, Wei-Jing', 'Zhao, Xiao-Xi', 'Cui, Lei', 'Wu, Min-Yuan', 'Zheng, Hu-Yong', 'Li, Zhi-Gang']","['Gao C', 'Liu SG', 'Zhang RD', 'Li WJ', 'Zhao XX', 'Cui L', 'Wu MY', 'Zheng HY', 'Li ZG']","[""Beijing Key Laboratory of Paediatric Haematology Oncology, Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Ministry of Education, National Key Discipline of Paediatrics, Haematology and Oncology Centre, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140402,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['T cells', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'clinical studies', 'paediatrics', 'prognostic factors']",2014/04/03 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/04/03 06:00'],"['2013/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12866 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Jul;166(2):221-8. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12866.

In human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), TP53-dependent tumour suppression is typically disabled via biallelic ARF deletions. In murine models, loss of Arf (Cdkn2a) or Tp53 markedly accelerates the onset of Myc-induced lymphoblastic malignancies. In zebrafish, no ARF ortholog has been identified, but the sequence of ARF is very poorly conserved evolutionarily, making it difficult to exclude the presence of a zebrafish ARF ortholog without functional studies. Here we show that tp53 mutations have no significant influence on the onset of myc-induced T-ALL in zebrafish, consistent with the lack of additional effects of Tp53 loss on lymphomagenesis in Arf-deficient mice. By contrast, irradiation leads to complete T-ALL regression in tp53 wild-type but not homozygous mutant zebrafish, indicating that the tp53-dependent DNA damage response is intact. We conclude that tp53 inactivation has no impact on the onset of myc-induced T-ALL in the zebrafish, consistent with the lack of a functional ARF ortholog linking myc-induced oncogene stress to tp53-dependent tumour suppression.

Until recently, molecular characterization of MLN was mainly based on cytogenetics/fluorescence in situ hybridization, allele copy number, and mRNA expression, approaches that yielded scanty gene mutation information. Use of massive parallel sequencing technologies has changed this outcome, and now many gene mutations have been discovered. Some of these are considerably frequent in, and substantially specific to, distinct MLN subtypes, and occur at single or several hotspots. They include the V600E BRAF mutation in hairy cell leukemia, the L265P MYD88 mutation in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, the G17V RHOA mutation in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, and the Y640F//D661Y/V/H/I//N647I STAT3 mutations in T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia. Detecting these mutations is highly valuable in diagnosing MLN subtypes. Defining these mutations also sheds light on the molecular pathogenesis of MLN, furthering development of molecular targeting therapies.

We observed a higher risk of developing ALL for rs10519612 CC, rs17007695 TC and rs17007695 CC genotype carriers. There was increased risk for T-cell type in patients with the rs10519612 CC genotype. Notably, increased risk to develop B-cell type was found with rs17007695 TC and CC genotypes. There was no impact on overall survival or disease-free survival at 3 years.

It is the sixth most common malignancy in the country in both males and females. The aim of this study was to document some epidemiological features of leukemia in the Northwest of Iran. METHODS: The study subjects (n=669, including 377 males and 292 females) comprised all leukemia cases registered/notified to the clinical and pathology centers of Tabriz and Ardebil cities, from 2003 to 2006. All patients were classified using the ICD-10 based coding system (C91-C95, C77 and C42). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were calculated to assess the statistical significance of the data. RESULTS: Annual incidence of leukemia was 3.7 [95% CI: 3.3-4.0] and 4.9 [95% CI: 4.2-5.6] per 100 000 population in Tabriz and Ardebil, respectively, with an overall case fatality rate of 13.5 percent [95% CI: 10.8-16.0]. The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.23. Myeloid leukemia (C92) and Hematopoetic and Reticuloendothelial system (C42) accounted proportionally for more than 47 percent of cases in the region. Over the study period, the annual occurrence of leukemia in the region increased from 3.9 [95% CI: 3.4-4.5] to 4.1 [95% CI: 3.5-4.6] per 100 000 population (P>0.1). CONCLUSIONS: The data from this cross-sectional study of leukemia in the North-West of Iran may be used as the baseline information to establish a population-based registry of hema-tologic disorders in the area for health care and research purposes.

METHODS: We reviewed 109 patients with MDS or CMML with a median age of 67 years, treated with a clofarabine-based chemotherapy as frontline (n = 38) or salvage (n = 71) therapy. A total of 58 (53%) patients received salvage therapy after clofarabine failure: 13 allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT), 18 high-dose cytarabine-containing regimen, 10 hypomethylating agents and 17 investigational treatments. RESULTS: Eight patients achieved complete remission (CR) and three had stable disease for an overall response rate of 19%. With a median follow-up of 3 months from clofarabine failure, 12 patients (11%) remained alive, 5 remain in CR, 4 of them after ASCT. The median overall survival post clofarabine failure was 4 months with a 1-year survival rate of 23%. CONCLUSIONS: This outcome is predictable, with patients with high-risk disease at the time of clofarabine failure having the worse survival. To date, patients with MDS continue to have a short survival after failure of all available therapies. Ultimately, patients who are candidates for additional treatments should be offered novel approaches. In conclusion, the outcome of patients with MDS and CMML post clofarabine failure is poor.

We further analyzed the expression levels of the genes encoding hub proteins, using Oncomine database, to determine their significance in leukemogenesis. Of the forty two hub genes, we observed that sixteen genes were underexpressed and eleven genes were overexpressed in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic samples in comparison to their expression levels in normal cells. Of these, we found three novel genes which have not been reported earlier- KAT2B, PSEN1 (underexpressed) and CDH2 (overexpressed).These three identified genes may provide new insights into the abnormal hematopoietic process observed in Leukemia as these genes are involved in Notch signaling and cell adhesion processes.

METHODS: New Zealand white rabbits were used in this study. A hinged corneal flap (160-microm thick) was created with a microkeratome, and -3.0 diopter excimer laser ablation was performed. Expressions of MIF mRNA in the corneal epithelial cells and surrounding inflammatory cells were analyzed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at 48 hours after LASIK. After LASIK surgery, the rabbits were topically given either 1) a balanced salt solution (BSS), 2) MIF (100 ng/mL) alone, or 3) a combination of nerve growth factor (NGF, 100 ug/mL), neurotrophine-3 (NT-3, 100 ng/mL), interleukin-6 (IL-6, 5 ng/mL), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, 5 ng/mL) four times a day for three days. Preoperative and postoperative corneal sensitivity at two weeks and at 10 weeks were assessed using the Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer. RESULTS: Expression of MIF mRNA was 2.5-fold upregulated in the corneal epithelium and 1.5-fold upregulated in the surrounding inflammatory cells as compared with the control eyes. Preoperative baseline corneal sensitivity was 40.56 +/- 2.36 mm. At two weeks after LASIK, corneal sensitivity was 9.17 +/- 5.57 mm in the BSS treated group, 21.92 +/- 2.44 mm in the MIF treated group, and 22.42 +/- 1.59 mm in the neuronal growth factors-treated group (MIF vs. BSS, p < 0.0001; neuronal growth factors vs. BSS, p < 0.0001; MIF vs. neuronal growth factors, p = 0.815). At 10 weeks after LASIK, corneal sensitivity was 15.00 +/- 9.65, 35.00 +/- 5.48, and 29.58 +/- 4.31 mm respectively (MIF vs. BSS, p = 0.0001; neuronal growth factors vs. BSS, p = 0.002; MIF vs. neuronal growth factors, p = 0.192). Treatment with MIF alone could achieve as much of an effect on recovery of corneal sensation as treatment with combination of NGF, NT-3, IL-6, and LIF.

Apoptosis was assessed by examining nuclear morphology and quantifying phosphatidylserine externalization, and alterations in cellular morphology were analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy for fluorescent analysis. Flow cytometry was used in the analysis of cell cycle, mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase pathways. RESULTS: Griseofulvin could inhibit the growth of K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner with a mean (SD) inhibitory concentration of 50% value of 15.38 (1.35) mug/mL compared with untreated controls. Apoptosis was induced in K562 cells (38.35% [2.73%]; P < 0.01) by griseofulvin with the observation of both an increase in phosphatidylserine level and accumulation of chromatin nucleation in griseofulvintreated cells. In addition, cell-cycle analysis using propidium iodide staining suggested a significant G2/M accumulation (increase from mean 17.64% [4.49%] to 48.29 [1.89%]; P < 0.01) as a result of griseofulvin treatment. Flow cytometry analysis found that griseofulvin treatment was associated with the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane in K562 cells. Furthermore, increased activities of caspase-3 by 22.15-fold (P < 0.01) and caspase-9 by 16.73-fold (P < 0.01) were observed in K562 cells after griseofulvin treatment compared with the untreated control; a decrease of caspase-8 activity was also observed, but the change was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that griseofulvin inhibited growth of K562 cells and induced cell apoptosis through cell-cycle arrest and mitochondrial membrane potential decrease as well as caspase-3 and -9 activation. Further testing is needed to evaluate the potential of griseofulvin as a candidate in the chemotherapy of hematologic malignancies.",,"['Zhong, Ning', 'Chen, Hankui', 'Zhao, Quanlin', 'Wang, Hongwei', 'Yu, Xin', 'Eaves, Ashley M', 'Sheng, Weihua', 'Miao, Jingcheng', 'Cui, Fengmei', 'Wang, Jinzhi']","['Zhong N', 'Chen H', 'Zhao Q', 'Wang H', 'Yu X', 'Eaves AM', 'Sheng W', 'Miao J', 'Cui F', 'Wang J']","[""Department of Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Kunshan City, Kunshan, China."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'The Affiliated Hospital, Shandong Tradition Chinese Medicine University, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Wuxi Blood Center, Wuxi, Jiangshu, China.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, School of Medicine, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,"Current therapeutic research, clinical and experimental",0372621,,,PMC3969622,,['NOTNLM'],"['K562 cells', 'apoptosis', 'caspase-3', 'caspase-9', 'griseofulvin']",2010/12/01 00:00,2010/12/01 00:01,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2010/11/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2010/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2010/12/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S0011-393X(10)80004-9 [doi]', 'S0011-393X(10)80004-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 2010 Dec;71(6):384-97. doi: 10.1016/S0011-393X(10)80004-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These are mainly hematological malignancies, and recurrent chromosome translocations are commonly detected in such cases. On the other hand, while secondary epithelial malignancies have sometimes been reported, chromosome translocations in these epithelial malignancies have not. A 33-year-old man who had been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and treated with chemotherapy almost 20 years earlier was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. After chromosomal rearrangement of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene was detected in this adenocarcinoma, he responded to treatment with crizotinib. It was therefore concluded that this echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 gene-anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene-positive lung adenocarcinoma was a secondary epithelial malignancy.","['(c) The Author 2014.

MT189 is a new derivative of MT119, a previously reported colchicine site-binding antitubulin agent. In this study, MT189 was demonstrated to retain the property of MT119 in disrupting microtubulin via binding to the colchicine site, causing mitotic arrest and inducing apoptosis, and to display 8.7-fold enhanced proliferative inhibition in a panel of cancer cells. MT189 was shown to elicit in vivo anticancer effects on MDA-MB-231 xenografts in nude mice, and the tumor growth was suppressed by 35.9% over 14 days. MT189 led to degradation of MCL-1, a member of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein family. Its overexpression reduced but its silenced expression increased the apoptotic induction followed by the treatment with MT189. Moreover, the treatment with MT189 caused activation of the MEKK1/TAK1-MKK4-JNK signaling pathway. The activated JNK resulted in phosphorylation of MCL-1, which facilitated its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Our results show that MT189 inhibits microtubulin polymerization by binding to the colchicine site.

Herein, we describe a potent CDK9 inhibitor, LY2857785, that significantly reduces RNAP II CTD phosphorylation and dramatically decreases MCL1 protein levels to result in apoptosis in a variety of leukemia and solid tumor cell lines. This molecule inhibits the growth of a broad panel of cancer cell lines, and is particularly efficacious in leukemia cells, including orthotopic leukemia preclinical models as well as in ex vivo acute myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient tumor samples.

Whole genome sequencing of human ETP-ALL cases has identified recurrent mutations in signaling, histone modification, and hematopoietic development genes but it remains to be determined which of these abnormalities are sufficient to initiate leukemia. We show that activating mutations in the interleukin-7 receptor identified in human pediatric ETP-ALL cases are sufficient to generate ETP-ALL in mice transplanted with primitive transduced thymocytes from p19(Arf-/-) mice. The cellular mechanism by which these mutant receptors induce ETP-ALL is the block of thymocyte differentiation at the double negative 2 stage at which myeloid lineage and T lymphocyte developmental potential coexist. Analyses of samples from pediatric ETP-ALL cases and our murine ETP-ALL model show uniformly high levels of LMO2 expression, very low to undetectable levels of BCL11B expression, and a relative lack of activating NOTCH1 mutations. We report that pharmacological blockade of Jak-Stat signaling with ruxolitinib has significant antileukemic activity in this ETP-ALL model.

Inasmuch as weight varies substantially over treatment, we hypothesized its impact on EFS is instead determined by cumulative time spent at an extreme weight during therapy and on TRT by weight at the time of toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cohort of 2,008 children treated for high-risk ALL in Children's Oncology Group study CCG-1961, we determined the effect on EFS of cumulative time receiving therapy at an extreme weight (either obese or underweight) between end of induction and start of maintenance therapy. We also evaluated the association between weight category and incidence and patterns of TRT during 13,946 treatment courses. RESULTS: Being obese or underweight at diagnosis and for >/= 50% of the time between end of induction and start of maintenance therapy resulted in inferior EFS (hazard ratios, 1.43 and 2.30, respectively; global P < .001). Normalization of weight during that period resulted in mitigation of this risk comparable to never being obese or underweight. Obese or underweight status at start of each treatment course was significantly associated with specific patterns of TRT. CONCLUSION: Influence of weight extremes on EFS and TRT is not set at diagnosis as previously reported but is moderated by subsequent weight status during intensive postinduction treatment phases. These observations suggest that weight is a potentially addressable risk factor to improve EFS and morbidity in pediatric ALL.",,"['Orgel, Etan', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Malvar, Jemily', 'Seibel, Nita L', 'Ladas, Elena', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Freyer, David R']","['Orgel E', 'Sposto R', 'Malvar J', 'Seibel NL', 'Ladas E', 'Gaynon PS', 'Freyer DR']","[""Etan Orgel, Jonathan Jaques Children's Cancer Center, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach; Etan Orgel, Paul S.

Results showed that LIF supplementation (25 ng/ml) enhanced nuclear maturation of intact cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) compared to the vehicle control. Similar results were observed in denuded oocytes, indicating that LIF directly influences oocyte development. LIF-treated oocytes showed a higher cortical-granule-migration rate and increased expression of CD9, a tetraspanin transmembrane protein essential for fertilization. After in vitro fertilization, oocytes receiving LIF supplementation exhibited a higher cleavage rate and yielded a significantly higher number of blastocysts. To further dissect the molecular mechanism underlying this LIF-induced bovine oocyte maturation phenotype, we examined the involvement of two signaling cascades, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK3/1)- and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-dependent pathways. Western blot results revealed that LIF phosphorylated MAPK3/1 and STAT3. Inhibition of MAPK3/1 activation with MEK inhibitor U0126 only partially blocked LIF-induced nuclear maturation, although it attenuated oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. Inhibition of JAK/STAT3 activation with a specific pharmacological inhibitor completely abolished the LIF-response in bovine oocyte. In summary, these data revealed a novel role for LIF in bovine oocyte maturation subsequent embryonic development.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mo, Xianhong', 'Wu, Guoquan', 'Yuan, Dianshuai', 'Jia, Baoyu', 'Liu, Cong', 'Zhu, Shien', 'Hou, Yunpeng']","['Mo X', 'Wu G', 'Yuan D', 'Jia B', 'Liu C', 'Zhu S', 'Hou Y']","[""State Key Laboratory for Agrobiotechnology, College of Biological Sciences, China Agricultural University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140521,United States,Mol Reprod Dev,Molecular reproduction and development,8903333,IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cattle', 'Female', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Oocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,2014/04/02 06:00,2015/04/08 06:00,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mrd.22327 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Reprod Dev. 2014 Jul;81(7):608-18. doi: 10.1002/mrd.22327.

The PAXgene Bone Marrow RNA System (BM system) is a newly developed system, and its clinical usefulness as a stabilizer for the cellular RNA in BM and peripheral blood was investigated with respect to the quality of RNA extracted using this system. A quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was carried out using total RNA extracted with the BM system, which showed that total RNA was more stable in the BM system than in the conventional system, indicating that the BM system can be applied to RT-PCR. The BM system enabled us to detect Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1) more effectively than the conventional system.

APL is a relatively rare blood disease that is highly curable with current treatment strategies; however, patient outcomes are heterogeneous in countries with limited resources. Promyelocytic leukemia accounts for 20-25% of all AML cases in Latin American countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a study from July 2007 to July 2012 and applied the IC-APL2006 protocol. This case study reports the results from eleven patients with AML M3 (five males and six females). In all cases, the diagnoses were made by aspirating bone marrow and evaluating the t(15:17) or t(11:17) transcript. In eight cases, the molecular biology-based diagnostics for the PLM-RARa transcript were positive, and they were negative in two cases. One patient was positive for the PLZF-RARa transcript. RESULTS: The mean WBC at the time of diagnosis was 10.1 x 10(9)/L, and the mean platelet count was 17.1 x 10(9)/L. The mean percentage of abnormal promyelocytes in the bone marrow aspirates was 68%. Of the eleven patients, four presented with disseminated intravascular coagulation. All of the patients began treatment with transretinoic acid (ATRA) (45 mg/m(2)/day), which led to 4 cases of ATRA syndrome. There were 2 relapses, and the patient died in one case. The remaining ten patients were alive after the median follow-up period of 33.6 months (range from 11 to 60 months). CONCLUSION: The authors report on a series of cases involving pediatric patients with AML M3 seen at a single institution; the patients were stratified and treated with a standard protocol to obtain satisfactory results. Although the number of patients is limited, the health outcomes are relevant. To our knowledge, this is the first series of pediatric APL patients in Mexico who were treated with the IC-APL2006 protocol.",,"['Dorantes-Acosta, Elisa', 'Medina-Sanson, Aurora', 'Jaimes-Garcia, Yanet', 'Lopez-Martinez, Briceida']","['Dorantes-Acosta E', 'Medina-Sanson A', 'Jaimes-Garcia Y', 'Lopez-Martinez B']","['Departamento de Hemato-Oncologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",,,,,2014/04/02 06:00,2014/05/14 06:00,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2012/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2013 Sep-Oct;65(5):392-8.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An in vitro experimental model was established by treating human leukemia K562 and breast cancer MCF-7 cells with different schedules of DOX with or without surface P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor verapamil (VER). The cellular heterogeneity in DOX uptake was quantitatively examined by single-cell analysis using capillary electrophoresis coupled with laser-induced fluorescence detection. The corresponding cytotoxic effect was tested by cellular morphology, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium and flow cytometry assays. The expression of cellular membrane surface P-gp was determined by flow cytometry. Results showed that the cellular heterogeneity exists in DOX uptake. The single-high DOX schedule leads to lower uptake heterogeneity and higher mean drug uptake. The cellular heterogeneity in DOX uptake was found to be negatively correlated with drug cytotoxicity and surface P-gp expression, with r = -0.7680 to ~ -0.9587. VER reduces the cellular variation in DOX uptake, suggesting that surface P-gp may be one of the causes of the cellular heterogeneity in DOX uptake. This research demonstrates the importance of quantitative study of cellular heterogeneity in drug uptake and its potential application in drug schedule design, response prediction and therapy modulation.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Deng, Bin', 'Wang, Zhi-Ming', 'Zhou, Zi-Hao', 'Liu, Yi-Meng', 'Yang, Xi-Liang', 'Song, Jian', 'Xiao, Yu-Xiu']","['Deng B', 'Wang ZM', 'Zhou ZH', 'Liu YM', 'Yang XL', 'Song J', 'Xiao YX']","['Key Laboratory of Combinatorial Biosynthesis and Drug Discovery (Wuhan University), Ministry of Education, and Wuhan University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Wuhan, 430071, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140331,England,Biomed Chromatogr,Biomedical chromatography : BMC,8610241,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/analysis/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/analysis/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['capillary electrophoresis', 'cellular heterogeneity', 'doxorubicin', 'pharmacological effect', 'single-cell analysis']",2014/04/02 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/bmc.3181 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Chromatogr. 2014 Oct;28(10):1393-401. doi: 10.1002/bmc.3181.

In this phase 2 study, newly diagnosed older acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients were randomized 2:1 to first-line CPX-351 or 7+3 treatment. The goal was to determine efficacy and identify patient subgroups that may benefit from CPX-351 treatment. Response rate (complete remission + incomplete remission) was the primary end point, with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary end points. The 126 patients entered were balanced for disease and patient-specific risk factors. Overall, CPX-351 produced higher response rates (66.7% vs 51.2%, P = .07), meeting predefined criteria for success (P < .1). Differences in EFS and OS were not statistically significant. A planned analysis of the secondary AML subgroup demonstrated an improved response rate (57.6% vs 31.6%, P = .06), and prolongation of EFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.59, P = .08) and OS (HR = 0.46, P = .01).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the epidemiology and outcome of children treated in the Pediatric Oncology Unit of Gabriel Toure Teaching Hospital in Bamako (Mali), six years after it opened. METHODS: Retrospective study of the files of all children aged 15 and younger diagnosed with cancer and treated by chemotherapy between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2010. RESULTS: The study included 690 children. Their mean age was 24 months. The time from observation of first symptoms to consultation was less than 3 months in 200 cases (29%), from 3 to 10 months in 256 (37.1%), and more than 10 months in 234 (33.9%).

Evidence suggests that tumor suppressor genes other than ATM are likely to be involved in CLL with del(11q). A microRNA (miR) cluster including the miR-34b and miR-34c genes is located, among other genes, within the commonly deleted region (CDR) at 11q. Interestingly, these miRs are part of the TP53 network and have been shown to be epigenetically regulated. In this study, we investigated the expression and methylation status of these miRs in a well-characterized cohort of CLL, including cases with/without 11q-deletion. We show that the miR-34b/c promoter was aberrantly hypermethylated in a large proportion of CLL cases (48%, 25/52 cases). miR-34b/c expression correlated inversely to DNA methylation (P = 0.003), and presence of high H3K37me3 further suppressed expression regardless of methylation status. Furthermore, increased miR-34b/c methylation inversely correlated with the presence of 11q-deletion, indicating that methylation and del(11q) independently silence these miRs. Finally, 5-azacytidine and trichostatin A exposure synergistically increased the expression of miR-34b/c in CLL cells, and transfection of miR-34b or miR-34c into HG3 CLL cells significantly increased apoptosis.

METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 90 individuals, and DNA was extracted from the PBMCs to measure the proviral load and to amplify the HTLV-1 FLG from two overlapping fragments. The amplified PCR products were subjected to deep sequencing. The sequencing data were assembled, aligned, and mapped against the HTLV-1 genome with sufficient genetic resemblance and utilized for further phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: A high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis instrument was used to obtain an average of 3210- and 5200-fold coverage of the partial (n = 14) and FLG (n = 76) data from the HTLV-1 strains, respectively. The results based on the phylogenetic trees of consensus sequences from partial and FLGs revealed that 86 (95.5%) individuals were infected with the transcontinental sub-subtypes of the cosmopolitan subtype (aA) and that 4 individuals (4.5%) were infected with the Japanese sub-subtypes (aB). A comparison of the nucleotide and amino acids of the FLG between the three clinical settings yielded no correlation between the sequenced genotype and clinical outcomes. The evolutionary relationships among the HTLV sequences were inferred from nucleotide sequence, and the results are consistent with the hypothesis that there were multiple introductions of the transcontinental subtype in Brazil. CONCLUSIONS: This study has increased the number of subtype aA full-length genomes from 8 to 81 and HTLV-1 aB from 2 to 5 sequences. The overall data confirmed that the cosmopolitan transcontinental sub-subtypes were the most prevalent in the Brazilian population.

OBJECTIVES: Analyze all patients with acute leukemia and IA of less than 18 years of age, diagnosed between January 1996 and December 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cases were identified from the pediatric database for demographic details, disease characteristics, and IA-related data. RESULTS: Among 356 patients with acute leukemia, 34 were identified to have proven/probable IA (5/29) with a relative incidence of 9% (28/310) and 13% (6/46) among acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia, respectively. Incidence of IA was significantly higher after 2004 especially among ALL patients; older patients with hyperglycemia and high-risk disease were more predisposed. None of the risk factors or type of antifungal treatment predicted mortality. The 120-day aspergillus-attributable mortality rate was 14.7%.

Treatment with chemotherapy can be intensive or nonintensive and can also be life-threatening since only relatively few patient-specific and leukemia-specific factors are considered in current protocols. We have already presented a mathematical model for one intensive chemotherapy cycle with intravenous (i.v.) daunorubicin (DNR), and cytarabine (Ara-C). This model is now extended to nonintensive subcutaneous (SC) Ara-C and for a standard intensive chemotherapy course (four cycles), consistent with clinical practice. Model parameters mainly consist of physiological patient data, indicators of tumor burden and characteristics of cell cycle kinetics. A sensitivity analysis problem is solved and cell cycle parameters are identified to control treatment outcome. Simulation results using published cell cycle data from two acute myeloid leukemia patients are presented for a course of standard treatment using intensive and nonintensive protocols. The aim of remission-induction therapy is to debulk the tumor and achieve normal BM function; by treatment completion, the total leukemic population should be reduced to at most 10(9) cells, at which point BM hypoplasia is achieved. The normal cell number should be higher than that of the leukemic, and a 3-log reduction is the maximum permissible level of population reduction.

We found that stable expression of PRL-3 confers cytokine independence and growth advantage of AML cells. However, how PRL-3 mediates these functions in AML is not known. To comprehensively screen for PRL3-regulated proteins in AML, we performed SILAC-based quantitative proteomics analysis and discovered 398 significantly perturbed proteins after PRL-3 overexpression. We show that Leo1, a component of RNA polymerase II-associated factor (PAF) complex, is a novel and important mediator of PRL-3 oncogenic activities in AML. We described a novel mechanism where elevated PRL-3 protein increases JMJD2C histone demethylase occupancy on Leo1 promoter, thereby reducing the H3K9me3 repressive signals and promoting Leo1 gene expression. Furthermore, PRL-3 and Leo1 levels were positively associated in AML patient samples (N=24; P<0.01). On the other hand, inhibition of Leo1 reverses PRL-3 oncogenic phenotypes in AML. Loss of Leo1 leads to destabilization of the PAF complex and downregulation of SOX2 and SOX4, potent oncogenes in myeloid transformation.

We found that Vav1 and SLP-76 associate with CD38 in two cell lines, and that these proteins complex with Lyn, a Src family kinase (SFK) upregulated by ATRA. SFK inhibitors PP2 and dasatinib, which enhance ATRA-induced differentiation, were used to evaluate the involvement of Lyn kinase activity in CD38-driven signaling. Cells treated with ATRA for 48h followed by one hour of PP2 incubation show SFK/Lyn kinase inhibition. We observed that Lyn inhibition blocked c-Cbl and p85/p55 PI3K phosphorylation driven by the anti-CD38 agonistic mAb IB4 in ATRA-treated HL-60 cells and untreated CD38+ transfectants. In contrast, cells cultured for 48h following concurrent ATRA and PP2 treatment did not show Lyn inhibition, suggesting ATRA regulates the effects on Lyn. 48h of co-treatment preserved CD38-stimulated c-Cbl and p85/p55 PI3K phosphorylation indicating Lyn kinase activity is necessary for these events. In contrast another SFK inhibitor (dasatinib) which blocks Lyn activity with ATRA co-treatment prevented ATRA-induced c-Cbl phosphorylation and crippled p85 PI3K phosphorylation, indicating Lyn kinase activity is important for ATRA-propelled events potentially regulated by CD38. We found that loss of Lyn activity coincided with a decrease in Vav1/Lyn/CD38 and SLP-76/Lyn/CD38 interaction, suggesting these molecules form a complex that regulates CD38 signaling. Lyn inhibition also reduced Lyn and CD38 binding to p85 PI3K, indicating CD38 facilitates a complex responsible for PI3K phosphorylation. Therefore, Lyn kinase activity is important for CD38-associated signaling that may drive ATRA-induced differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, we identified ZYJ-34c, a modified histone deacetylase inhibitor that showed significantly higher antitumor activity in vivo than the FDA-approved drug suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. We aimed to investigate its exact mechanism of action. Activity of ZY-34c against human erythroleukemic (K562) cells, human myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells, and primary leukemic cells were investigated in vitro using proliferation assays, cell cycle assays, apoptosis assays, RNA interference, promoter acetylation assays, and assays of transcription of related molecules. ZYJ-34c strongly inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells compared with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. Primary leukemic cells isolated from patients with acute myeloid leukemia were more sensitive to ZYJ-34c. The 50% growth-inhibitory concentrations of ZYJ-34c and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid were 2.95+/-0.75 and 4.45+/-0.29 mumol/l for K562 cells treated for 48 h, respectively. We found that ZYJ-34c caused more significant G1 cell cycle arrest than suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, in a time-dependent manner. ZYJ-34c-induced hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4 around the promoter region of p21. P21 RNA interference markedly impaired ZYJ-34c-induced or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid-induced G1 cell cycle arrest. In addition, levels of bcr-abl mRNA and protein in K562 cells decreased after treatment with either suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or ZYJ-34c; moreover, ZYJ-34c had a higher inhibition activity. ZYJ-34c could represent a novel pharmacological agent with potential benefit for patients with leukemia.",,"['Yang, Hua', 'Xu, Wenfang', 'Li, Yan', 'Lan, Peixiang', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Zhang, Yingjie', 'Zhang, Cai']","['Yang H', 'Xu W', 'Li Y', 'Lan P', 'Zhang J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang C']","[""aInstitute of Immunopharmacology & Immunotherapy, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences bDepartment of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Shandong University, Jinan cDepartment of Immunology, Taishan Medical University, Tai'an, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,,,2014/04/02 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000101 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2014 Aug;25(7):767-77. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000101.,,"['0', '(2-(2-(3,3-dimethylbutanamido)-3-methylpentanoyl)-7-(2-(hydroxyamino)-2-oxoethoxy', ')-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamide)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H19 was highly expressed in Bcr-Abl-transformed cell lines and primary cells derived from patients in a Bcr-Abl kinase-dependent manner. Silencing H19 expression sensitized leukemic cells to undergo imatinib-induced apoptosis and inhibited Bcr-Abl-induced tumor growth.

CTNNA1 expression is regulated by methylation and histone deacetylation. However, the clinical significance of CTNNA1 methylation in AML is rarely known. The present study was aimed to investigate the methylation status of CTNNA1 promoter region using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and its clinical relevance in Chinese AML patients. Patients with CTNNA1 hypermethylation had significantly lower level of CTNNA1 transcript than those without CTNNA1 hypermethylation (P=0.031). The relationship of CTNNA1 methylation with clinical parameters was evaluated. Aberrant hypermethylation of CTNNA1 gene was found in 23.9% (37/155) AML cases. The status of CTNNA1 methylation was not correlated with the mutations of seven genes (FLT3-ITD, NPM1, C-KIT, IDH1/IDH2, DNMT3A, N/K-RAS and C/EBPA). There was no significant difference in the rates of complete remission (CR) between patients with and without CTNNA1 methylation. Although the overall survival (OS) time of the CTNNA1-methylated AML was shorter than that of CTNNA1-unmethylated group (6 months vs 9 months), the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.681).

However, anti-panCD44 can interfere with hematopoiesis. Therefore we explored, whether a CD44 variant isoform (CD44v)-specific antibody can inhibit leukemia growth without attacking hematopoiesis. As a model we used CD44v10 transfected EL4 thymoma cells (EL4-v10). METHODS: The therapeutic efficacy of anti-panCD44 and anti-CD44v10 was evaluated after intravenous application of EL4/EL4-v10. Ex vivo and in vitro studies evaluated the impact of anti-panCD44 and anti-CD44v10 as well as of EL4 and EL4-v10 on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in cocultures with bone marrow stroma cells with a focus on adhesion, migration, cell cycle progression and apoptosis resistance. RESULTS: Intravenously injected EL4-v10 grow in bone marrow and spleen. Anti-panCD44 and, more pronounced anti-CD44v10 prolong the survival time. The higher efficacy of anti-CD44v10 compared to anti-panCD44 does not rely on stronger antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or on promoting EL4-v10 apoptosis. Instead, EL4 compete with HSC niche embedding. This has consequences on quiescence and apoptosis-protecting signals provided by the stroma. Anti-panCD44, too, more efficiently affected embedding of HSC than of EL4 in the bone marrow stroma. EL4-v10, by catching osteopontin, migrated on bone marrow stroma and did not or weakly interfere with HSC adhesion. Anti-CD44v10, too, did not affect the HSC--bone marrow stroma crosstalk. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic effect of anti-panCD44 and anti-CD44v10 is based on stimulation of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The superiority of anti-CD44v10 is partly due to blocking CD44v10-stimulated osteopontin expression that could drive HSC out of the niche. However, the main reason for the superiority of anti-CD44v10 relies on neither EL4-v10 nor anti-CD44v10 severely interfering with HSC--stroma cell interactions that, on the other hand, are affected by EL4 and anti-panCD44. Anti-panCD44 disturbing HSC embedding in the osteogenic niche weakens its therapeutic effect towards EL4. Thus, as far as leukemic cells express CD44v isoforms, the therapeutic use of anti-panCD44 should be avoided in favor of CD44v-specific antibodies.",,"['Erb, Ulrike', 'Megaptche, Amelie Pajip', 'Gu, Xiaoyu', 'Buchler, Markus W', 'Zoller, Margot']","['Erb U', 'Megaptche AP', 'Gu X', 'Buchler MW', 'Zoller M']","['Department of Tumor Cell Biology, University Hospital of Surgery, Heidelberg, Germany. m.zoeller@uni-hd.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140331,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Thymoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection']",PMC4022365,,,,2014/04/02 06:00,2015/01/03 06:00,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-8722-7-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-7-29 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2014 Mar 31;7:29. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-7-29.,,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumour-releasing immunosuppressive factor promotes tumour growth and transforms the tumour resident M1 phenotype of macrophage to M2 phenotype (TAMs) that promotes tumour progression by downregulating the expression of different surface receptor including CD172alpha and CD47. Recent studies have reported that CD172alpha and CD47 are involved in the pathogenesis and promote malignancies such as lymphoma, leukaemia, melanoma, lung cancer and multiple myeloma, and their expression varies during infection and malignancies. Autologous Hsp70 is well recognized for its role in activating macrophages leading to enhance production of inflammatory cytokines. It has been observed that Hsp70 derived from normal tissues do not elicit tumour immunity, while Hsp70 preparation from tumour cell was able to elicit tumour immunity. However, the role of exogenous autologous hsp70 on the formation of giant cells is completely unknown. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to investigate the effect of Hsp70-peptide complex on the expression of CD172alpha and CD47 receptors in normal peritoneal macrophages (NMO) and TAMs. Finding shows that the expression of CD172alpha and CD47 enhances in TAMs and it reverts back the suppressed function of TAMs into M1 state of immunoregulatory phenotype that promotes tumour regression by enhanced multinucleation and phagocytosis of malignant cells and significantly enhances the homotypic fusion of macrophages and polykaryon formation in vitro by enhancing the expression of SIRPalpha and IAP.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Gautam, P K', 'Acharya, A']","['Gautam PK', 'Acharya A']","['Department of Zoology, Faculty of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Animals', 'CD47 Antigen/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*physiology', 'Lymphoma', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis/genetics/*physiology']",,,,,2014/04/02 06:00,2014/08/07 06:00,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12180 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2014 Jul;80(1):22-35. doi: 10.1111/sji.12180.,,"['0 (CD47 Antigen)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Ptpns1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequently described DC vaccine is being matured with a cocktail containing prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 DC). However, even though PGE2 DCs express both costimulatory and migratory receptors, their IL-12p70-prodcution is low, leading to an insufficient Th1 immune response. As an alternative, alpha-type-1 polarized DCs (alphaDC1s) have shown a superior production of IL-12p70 and subsequent activation of effector cells. From chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients, alphaDC1s can be generated to induce a functional Th1-immune response. Yet, another costimulatory receptor, CD70, appears to be essential for optimal DC function by promotion of T cell survival and function. So far, PGE2 is suggested as one of the most important factors for the induction of CD70 expression on DCs. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether alphaDC1s have the ability to express functional CD70. We found that CD70 expression on alphaDC1s could be upregulated in the same manner as PGE2 DCs. In an allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction, we found that antibody-blocking of CD70 on alphaDC1s from controls reduced effector cell proliferation although this could not be found when using CLL alphaDC1s. Nevertheless, CD70-blocking of alphaDC1s from both controls and patients with CLL had a negative influence on the production of both IL-12p70 and the Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma, while the production of the Th2 cytokine IL-5 was enhanced. Together, this study further suggests that alphaDC1s should be considered as a suitable candidate for clinical antitumour vaccine strategies in patients with CLL.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Junevik, K', 'Werlenius, O', 'Fogelstrand, L', 'Karlsson-Parra, A', 'Andersson, P-O']","['Junevik K', 'Werlenius O', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Karlsson-Parra A', 'Andersson PO']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['CD27 Ligand/analysis/*physiology', 'Cell Polarity', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Dinoprostone/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/physiology']",,,,,2014/04/02 06:00,2014/07/30 06:00,['2014/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/sji.12172 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 2014 Jun;79(6):415-22. doi: 10.1111/sji.12172.,,"['0 (CD27 Ligand)', '0 (CD70 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of NOS3 mRNA was tested in 72 patients of known genotype for NOS3 894 G>T. The clinical characteristics of these patients were obtained from medical records.

After adjusting for age, gender, leucocyte count, haemoglobin level, platelet level, French, American and Britain (FAB) classification, lactate dehydrogenase levels, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, nucleophosmin gene and fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene, multivariate survival analysis showed that the NOS3 894 G>T polymorphism appeared to be a predicting factor for OS (P = 0.014; hazard ratio = 1.856). However, no significant associations between the NOS3 894 G>T polymorphism and relapse-free survival and relapse in patients with AML were observed.

BACKGROUND: The cells of the adult Leydig cell lineage may reside in the peritubular compartment of the testis. This suggestion is supported by the facts that the rodent peritubular cells can be differentiated toward this lineage and that cAMP enhances their steroidogenic potential. METHODS: Human testicular biopsies, and derived HTPCs, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. After stimulation by forskolin or platelet-derived growth factor-BB, quantitative RT-PCR was used to compare the levels of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in steroidogenesis and steroid production was analyzed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the peritubular cells that form the outer part of the tubular wall express platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha. Furthermore, the pluripotency markers (POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1, GATA-binding protein 4), stem Leydig cell markers (platelet derived growth factor receptor-A, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor), and mRNAs encoding proteins involved in steroidogenesis (nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 1; steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; CYP11A1; CYP17A1; 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) were expressed by the HTPCs. Stimulation with forskolin increased the expression of the steroidogenic markers, which was accompanied by the production of pregnenolone and progesterone by HTPCs in vitro. Treatment with platelet-derived growth factor-BB induced expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein.

For a practical diagnostics application, any sensing system must show an absence of nonselective detection of abundant proteins in the fluid matrix. Because lysozyme is an abundant protein in these body fluids (e.g., around 21.4 and 7 mug/mL of lysozyme is found in human milk and saliva from healthy individuals, and more than 15 or even 100 mug/mL in patients suffering from leukemia, renal disease, and sarcoidosis), it may interfere with detections and quantification if it has strong interaction with GO. Therefore, one fundamental question that needs to be addressed before any development of GO based diagnostics method is how GO interacts with lysozyme. In this study, GO has demonstrated a strong interaction with lysozyme. This interaction is so strong that we are able to subsequently eliminate and separate lysozyme from aqueous solution onto the surface of GO. Furthermore, the strong electrostatic interaction also renders the selective adsorption of lysozyme on GO from a mixture of binary and ternary proteins.

In this strategy, the rGO-DEN can not only enhance the electron transfer ability but also provide a multivalent recognition interface for the conjugation of Con A that avoids the weak carbohydrate-protein interaction and dramatically improves the cell capture efficiency and the sensitivity of the biosensor for cell surface glycan. The high-affinity aptamer- and HRP-modified gold nanoparticles provide an ultrasensitive electrochemical probe with excellent specificity. As proof-of-concept, the detection of CCRF-CEM cell (human acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and its surface N-glycan was developed. It has demonstrated that the as-designed biosensor can be used for highly sensitive and selective cell detection and dynamic evaluation of cell surface N-glycan expression. A detection limit as low as 10 cells mL(-1) was obtained with excellent selectivity. Moreover, this strategy was also successfully applied for N-glycan expression inhibitor screening.

Biological reasons for that wide variation in clinical course and survival rates in CLL patients are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of spontaneous apoptosis of CLL cells in vitro determined at presentation of disease, in prediction of treatment requirements and evolution of the CLL. METHODS: Malignant B cells were isolated from the whole blood of 30 newly diagnosed CLL patients and cultured for 24 hours in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% of serum obtained from the same CLL patient. Cells were later fixed and processed for embedding in Epon, or cell smears were prepared and stained with TUNEL technique. RESULTS: Ten-year follow-up revealed that patients with lower percentage of cells in apoptosis at presentation of disease had significant longer time treatment initiation (log rank test p < 0.05). On the contrary, apoptosis of CLL cells was not shown to have significant impact on survival of patients (Kaplan Meier log rank test p > 0.05).

We recently found that rapamycin could induce G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of K562 cells through inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. However, whether rapamycin has synergistic effects with other drugs in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) therapies remain unclear. Therefore, we examined the effect of rapamycin combined with celecoxib on K562 cells in vitro. The survival rates showed a significant decrease in rapamycin + celecoxib treatment group. The combination treatment also increased the G0/G1 phase cells as compared to rapamycin or celecoxib treatment alone (P < 0.05), accompanied with the decreased population of S phase cells. Meanwhile, the rate of apoptosis was 15.87 +/- 2.21 % in rapamycin + celecoxib treatment group, significantly higher than that in mono treatment group (P < 0.05). Western blot and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the expressions of mTOR, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K were all significantly decreased in K562 cells after rapamycin + celecoxib treatment (P < 0.05). In conclusion, rapamycin combined with celecoxib could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and decrease the expressions of mTOR, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K.

METHODS: We evaluated the risk of developing second benign brain tumors among 2,038,074 1-year minimum cancer survivors compared to expected risk in the general population between 1973 and 2007 in nine population-based cancer registries in the NCI's surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program. Excess risk was estimated using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for all second benign brain tumors and specifically for second meningiomas and acoustic neuromas diagnosed during 2004-2008. RESULTS: 1,025 patients were diagnosed with a second primary benign brain tumor, of which second meningiomas composed the majority (n = 745). Statistically significant increases in risk of developing a second meningioma compared to the general population were observed following first cancers of the brain [SIR = 19.82; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 13.88-27.44], other central nervous system (CNS) (SIR = 9.54; CI 3.10-22.27), thyroid (SIR = 2.05; CI 1.47-2.79), prostate (SIR = 1.21; CI 1.02-1.43), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (SIR = 42.4; CI 23.18-71.13). Statistically significant decreases in risk were observed following first cancers of the uterine corpus (SIR = 0.63; CI 0.42-0.91) and colon (SIR = 0.56; CI 0.37-0.82). Differences in risk between patients initially treated with radiotherapy versus non-irradiated patients were statistically significant for second meningioma after primary cancers of the brain (p Het < 0.001) and ALL (p Het = 0.02). No statistically significant increased risks were detected for second acoustic neuromas (n = 114) following any first primary tumor.

In a multivariate analysis, p53-positive immunohistochemistry was the strongest independent predictor of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (P=0.0035). Pyrosequencing analysis of laser-microdissected cells with strong p53 expression confirmed the TP53 mutation, whereas cells with moderate expression predominantly had wild-type p53. This study validates p53 immunohistochemistry as a strong and clinically useful predictive tool in patients with lower-risk del(5q) myelodysplastic syndromes. This study was based on data from the MDS 004 trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00179621).",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Saft, Leonie', 'Karimi, Mohsen', 'Ghaderi, Mehran', 'Matolcsy, Andras', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Kulasekararaj, Austin', 'Gohring, Gudrun', 'Giagounidis, Aristoteles', 'Selleslag, Dominik', 'Muus, Petra', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Mittelman, Moshe', 'Bowen, David', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Fu, Tommy', 'Backstrom, Jay', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'MacBeth, Kyle J', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Saft L', 'Karimi M', 'Ghaderi M', 'Matolcsy A', 'Mufti GJ', 'Kulasekararaj A', 'Gohring G', 'Giagounidis A', 'Selleslag D', 'Muus P', 'Sanz G', 'Mittelman M', 'Bowen D', 'Porwit A', 'Fu T', 'Backstrom J', 'Fenaux P', 'MacBeth KJ', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Sweden Department of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', ""King's College Hospital, London, UK."", ""King's College Hospital, London, UK."", 'Institute for Cell and Molecular Pathology, Medical University Hannover, Germany.', 'Marien Hospital Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'AZ ST-Jan Brugge AV, Brugge, Belgium.', 'Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Hospital Universitaria La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv, Israel.', ""St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Toronto General Hospital, Ontario, Canada.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', ""Service d'Hematologie Seniors, Hopital St Louis, Universite Paris 7, France."", 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Sweden eva.hellstrom-lindberg@ki.se.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140328,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Disease Progression', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Patient Outcome Assessment', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC4040908,,,,2014/04/01 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/04/01 06:00'],"['2014/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.098103 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.098103 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Jun;99(6):1041-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.098103.

The in vitro anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory activities of these oils were investigated, and the EO which was found to have the strongest activity of the 20 EOs examined, was investigated further to identify its components and bioactive compounds. The in vitro anti-allergic activity was determined by measuring the release of beta-hexosaminidase from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells treated with the calcium ionophore, A23187. The in vitro anti-inflammatory activity was determined by measuring the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in RAW264.7 murine macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide. Among the EOs examined, lemongrass [Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf] elicited the strongest anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects. A principal component of this EO is citral (3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-al) (74.5%), a mixture of the stereoisomers, geranial (trans-citral, 40.16%) and neral (cis-citral, 34.24%), as determined by chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. The activities of citral and geranial are similar to those of lemongrass EO. These compounds elicited significant in vivo anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects, suppressing an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-induced passive cutaneous anaphylactic reaction in mice and a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced inflammatory mouse ear edema, respectively.

However, the regulatory mechanism of BCL10 in OSCC progression is still unknown. Here, we showed that knockdown of endogenous BCL10 could significantly reduce cell migration and invasion abilities, retard cell proliferation by G0/G1 phase accumulation and inhibit tumorigenicity in vivo. In molecular level, we identified S100P as a crucial downstream effector of BCL10-inhibited OSCC progression by high-throughput microarray analysis. S100P messenger RNA and protein expression levels were significantly diminished in silenced-BCL10 clones, and transfected S100P expression plasmids restored migration, invasion, proliferation abilities and tumorigenicity in shBCL10 transfectants. Furthermore, we provided evidence that BCL10 regulated S100P expression through signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Knockdown of BCL10 decreased S100P promoter activity, but showed no effect in truncated STAT1/ATF4 S100P promoter.

We previously identified a target gene, LPP/miR-28 (LIM domain containing preferred translocation partner in lipoma), induced by constitutive activation of STAT5, but not by transient cytokine-activated STAT5. miR-28 exerts negative effects on thrombopoietin receptor signaling and platelet formation. Here, we demonstrate that, in transformed hematopoietic cells, STAT5 and p53 must be synergistically bound to chromatin for induction of LPP/miR-28 transcription. Genome-wide association studies show that both STAT5 and p53 are co-localized on the chromatin at 463 genomic positions in proximal promoters. Chromatin binding of p53 is dependent on persistent STAT5 activation at these proximal promoters. The transcriptional activity of selected promoters bound by STAT5 and p53 was significantly changed upon STAT5 or p53 inhibition. Abnormal expression of several STAT5-p53 target genes (LEP, ATP5J, GTF2A2, VEGFC, NPY1R and NPY5R) is frequently detected in platelets of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients, but not in platelets from healthy controls. In conclusion, persistently active STAT5 can recruit normal p53, like in the case of MPN cells, but also p53 mutants, such as p53 M133K in human erythroleukemia cells, leading to pathologic gene expression that differs from canonical STAT5 or p53 transcriptional programs.",,"['Girardot, M', 'Pecquet, C', 'Chachoua, I', 'Van Hees, J', 'Guibert, S', 'Ferrant, A', 'Knoops, L', 'Baxter, E J', 'Beer, P A', 'Giraudier, S', 'Moriggl, R', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Green, A R', 'Constantinescu, S N']","['Girardot M', 'Pecquet C', 'Chachoua I', 'Van Hees J', 'Guibert S', 'Ferrant A', 'Knoops L', 'Baxter EJ', 'Beer PA', 'Giraudier S', 'Moriggl R', 'Vainchenker W', 'Green AR', 'Constantinescu SN']","['1] Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium [2] de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium [3] Institute of Molecular Genetics, CNRS UMR5535, Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', '1] Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium [2] de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', '1] Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium [2] de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', '1] Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium [2] de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Biotechnology and Cell Signalling, UMR 7242, Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, ESBS, Illkirch Cedex, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', '1] Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium [2] de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium [3] Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', ""1] Institut Gustave Roussy, INSERM U1009, Villejuif, France [2] AP-HP, Universite Paris XII, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, PRB Cellulotheque hematologie, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France."", 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy, INSERM U1009, Villejuif, France.', 'Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', '1] Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium [2] de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['12765/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'F 2807/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'F 4707/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140331,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC4924606,['EMS68729'],,,2014/04/01 06:00,2015/06/11 06:00,['2014/04/01 06:00'],"['2012/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/11 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201460 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2014.60 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Mar 5;34(10):1323-32. doi: 10.1038/onc.2014.60.

We performed a targeted knockdown (KD) screen of PI modulator genes in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and identified candidates required to sustain proliferation or prevent apoptosis. One of these, the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase, type II, alpha (PIP4K2A) regulates cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate (PtsIns5P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). We found PIP4K2A to be essential for the clonogenic and leukemia-initiating potential of human AML cells, and for the clonogenic potential of murine MLL-AF9 AML cells. Importantly, PIP4K2A is also required for the clonogenic potential of primary human AML cells. Its KD results in accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN1A and CDKN1B, G(1) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Both CDKN1A accumulation and apoptosis were partially dependent on activation of the mTOR pathway. Critically, however, PIP4K2A KD in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, both murine and human, did not adversely impact either clonogenic or multilineage differentiation potential, indicating a selective dependency that we suggest may be the consequence of the regulation of different transcriptional programs in normal versus malignant cells.

We have shown that Hsp32, also known as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), serves as survival factor and potential target in Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia. We here report that primary cells and cell lines derived from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) express Hsp32 mRNA and the Hsp32 protein in a constitutive manner. Highly enriched CD34+/CD38- ALL stem cells also expressed Hsp32. Two Hsp32-targeting drugs, pegylated zinc protoporphyrine (PEG-ZnPP) and styrene maleic acid-micelle-encapsulated ZnPP (SMA-ZnPP), induced apoptosis and growth arrest in the BCR/ABL1+ cell lines, in Ph- lymphoblastic cell lines and in primary Ph+ and Ph- ALL cells. The effects of PEG-ZnPP and SMA-ZnPP on growth of leukemic cells were dose-dependent. In Ph+ ALL, major growth-inhibitory effects of the Hsp32-targeting drugs were observed in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant cells.

We investigated the significance of platelet parameters in thrombocytopenic patients. Thrombocytopenic patients (platelet <100 x 10/mul) who were newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia and primary immune thrombocytopenia were enrolled, and platelet, mean platelet volume, platelet distribution width, platelet crit, mean platelet component, mean platelet mass, and large platelet count were measured, and the percentages of large platelets were calculated. The parameters were also measured in the reference population. The mean values of each parameter were as follows: platelet, 259 x 10/mul; mean platelet volume, 7.9 fl; platelet distribution width, 51.3%; platelet crit, 0.20%; mean platelet component, 26.0 g/dl; mean platelet mass, 1.9 pg; large platelet, 4.7 x 10/mul; large platelet percentage, 1.7%.

Nanog plays an important role in early development and is essential to induce natural pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Inducible gain-of-function systems allowing a precise control over time and dosage of Nanog activity would be highly desirable to study its vital role in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency at molecular level. Here we engineered a recombinant cell permeable version of Nanog by fusing it with the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Nanog-TAT can be readily expressed in and purified from E. coli and binds to a consensus Nanog DNA sequence. At cellular level it enhances proliferation and self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Nanog-TAT together with LIF acts synergistically as judged by enhanced clonogenicity and activation of an Oct4-promoter-driven GFP reporter gene. Furthermore Nanog-TAT, in the absence of LIF, promotes pluripotency by inhibiting endodermal specification in a Stat3-independent manner. Our results demonstrate that Nanog protein transduction is an attractive tool allowing control over dose and time of addition to the cells for studying the molecular control of pluripotency without genetic manipulation.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

The exact mechanisms of HSC mobilization are still not clear and the efficacy of the procedure is hardly predictable. Ligand-receptor interactions of adhesion molecules, such as SDF1/CXCR4, VLA4/VCAM-1, or CD44/osteopontin, play an important role in homing of HSC in the hematopoietic niche. There is some evidence that disruption of the ligand-receptor complex leads to the egress of HSCs to the peripheral blood. The aim of the present study was the evaluation of constitutive polymorphism of genes encoding cytokines and receptors present in the HSC niche and their impact on the efficacy of mobilization of HSCs in patients with hematological malignancies. We enrolled 110 patients (60 females and 50 males) in the study. The median age of the patients was 55 (range, 22 to 69) years. The group consisted of patients with multiple myeloma (n = 74), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 19), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 15), or acute myeloid leukemia (n = 2). The mobilization procedures comprised chemotherapy and subsequent granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) at a dose of 10 mug/kg daily. The poor mobilizers group was defined according to Italian National Bone Marrow Transplant Registry criteria: patients with peak CD34(+) in the peripheral blood < 20/muL or total yield < 2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg body weight in maximum 3 aphereses. Genotyping was performed using standard PCR-based assays. The group of patients (N = 108) who achieved minimal threshold for collections (CD34(+) at least 10/muL) proceeded to apheresis. The median total yield of CD34(+) in this group was 5.6 x 10(6) cells/kg body weight, whereas the median number of cells collected during the first apheresis was 3.3 x 10(6) cells/kg body weight. Median number of days of G-CSF treatment before first apheresis was 10. Fifteen patients fulfilled the criteria for poor mobilizer. The group of poor mobilizers had higher frequency of TT genotype in rs13347 (CD44) gene (CC+ CT versus TT P = .047). Patients homozygous for T allele had a lower total yield of CD34(+) cells/kg body weight than the group with allele C (median, 3.7 x 10(6)/kg versus 5.8 x 10(6)/kg; P = .019) and a lower number of CD34(+) cells gathered during first apheresis (.95 x 10(6)/kg versus 3.3 x 10(6)/kg, P = .04). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the CD44 TT genotype was the only factor associated with 5-fold higher risk of poor mobilization (P = .037). Polymorphic variants of CXCR4 and VCAM-1 did not significantly influence the efficacy of HSCs mobilization in our group of patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that among investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), only CD44 rs13347 has an impact on the efficacy of HSCs mobilization in patients with hematologic malignancies. CD44 SNPs analysis may be helpful for predicting the poor mobilizers population who may benefit from newer modalities using adhesion molecules inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the only therapy with proven curative potential. However, most patients with MF are in their 6th or 7th decade of life, and only some of these patients have been considered suitable transplantation candidates. The development of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens with limited toxicity has allowed clinicians to offer ASCT to a growing number of older patients. The availability of Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitors allows clinicians to provide symptom relief and improved quality of life for MF patients. These drugs may also affect the decision regarding, in particular, the timing of ASCT. Future studies need to address the role of JAK1/2 inhibitors in patients who are transplantation candidates and determine their role before and, possibly, after transplantation.

Before HSCT, JCV DNA was detected in 7 of 30 urine, 5 of 30 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and 6 of 30 plasma samples. Although JC viruria remained stable after HSCT with detection in 5 of 21 samples, viremia was detected in only 1 of 22 plasma and none of 22 PBMC samples 12 to 18 months after HSCT.

Forty of 93 patients (43%) who underwent a first allogeneic HCT and had systematic pretransplantation and post-transplantation MRD evaluations at +30, +60, +90, +180 days and +1 and +2 years post-transplantation experienced relapse. The median time to relapse was 4.8 months post-transplantation, with a median survival of 4 months post-relapse. Despite frequent, systematic, routine post-HCT disease restaging evaluation, 31 patients (78%) presented with overt disease at the time of relapse. Seven patients with acute leukemia who had post-transplantation MRD presented at a median of 1 month post-transplantation. Owing to rapid disease progression or treatment-related mortality, there was no improvement in survival in those patients whose leukemia was detected in a state of MRD post-transplantation.

Current standard practices for treatment of HCC are less than satisfactory because of metastasis and recurrence. In addition to treating acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), arsenic trioxide (As2O3) also suppresses other solid tumors, such as HCC. However, the effects of As2O3 on the migration/invasion potential of liver cancer cells and the molecular mechanisms underlying in remain unclear. Here we found that As2O3 attenuated the migration/invasion potential of HCC cell lines by blocking matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities and inducing a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Indeed, As2O3 elevated the expression of microRNA-491 (miR-491) via demethylation. On one hand, as a target miRNA of MMP9, miR-491 decreased the MMP9 expression. On the other hand, miR-491 blocked the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which transcriptionally inactivated MMP2 and induced a MET (as determined by the increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expressions of snail, slug, and vimentin). Knockdown of miR-491 abolished the As2O3-induced MMPs inactivation, MET, and the migration/invasion potential of HCC cell lines. By understanding a novel mechanism how As2O3 inhibits the migration/invasion potential of liver cancer cells, our study may help to identify potential therapeutic targets for liver cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AZA is used for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. However, some patients demonstrate resistance to AZA, the mechanisms of which are not fully elucidated. We therefore sought to better characterize the molecular mechanism of AZA resistance using an in vitro model of AZA resistance. We established AZA-resistant cell lines by exposing the human leukemia cell lines U937 and HL-60 to clinical concentrations of AZA, and characterized these cells. AZA-resistant cells showed a down-regulation of the DNMT3A protein, in correlation with their marked genome-wide DNA hypomethylation. Furthermore, genes involved in pyrimidine metabolism were down-regulated in both AZA-resistant cell lines; AZA sensitivity was restored by inhibition of CTP synthase. Of note is that the DNA damage response pathway is constitutively activated in the AZA-resistant cell lines, but not in the parental cell lines. Inhibition of the DNA damage response pathway canceled the AZA resistance, in association with an increase in apoptotic cells. We found that the molecular mechanism underlying AZA resistance involves pyrimidine metabolism and the DNA damage response through ATM kinase. This study therefore sheds light on the mechanisms underlying AZA resistance, and will enable better understanding of AZA resistance in patients undergoing AZA treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We observed that imperatorin suppresses tumor cell growth through inducing apoptosis, and imperatorin is more effective in induction of multidrug-resistant human liver cancer cells in vitro. We further determined that imperatorin induces apoptosis through both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway. At the molecular level, we identified Mcl-1 as the molecular target of imperatorin and determined that imperatorin induces proteosome-dependent Mcl-1 degradation to release Bak and Bax to trigger apoptosis in liver cancer cells. Consistent with its in vitro apoptosis induction activity, imperatorin exhibited potent activity against multidrug-resistant liver cancer xenograft growth in vivo.

About 15-18% Philadelphia positive CML patients have gene deletions around the translocation breakpoints on 9q34.1. The microRNAs (miRNAs), namely miR-219-2 and miR-199b, centromeric to the ABL1 gene are frequently lost in CML patients. We have designed a study to determine miR-219-2 and miR-199b expression levels which would help to understand the prognosis of imatinib therapy. A total of 150 CML patients were analyzed to identify 9q deletion. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using BCR/ABL dual color, dual fusion probe to study the signal pattern and BAC probes for miR-199b and miR-219-2 (RP11-339B21 and RP11-395P17) to study the miRNA deletions. The expression level of miRNA was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). FISH analysis revealed 9q34.1 deletion in 34 (23%) CML patients. The deletions were not detected using BAC probes for miRNAs in 9q deleted patients. The expression analysis showed down-regulation of miR-199b and miR-219-2 in the 9q deleted patients (34 CML) as compared to a pool of patients without deletion. However, miR-199b (9q34.11) was significantly (p=0.001) down-regulated compared to miR-219-2. The follow-up study showed that the miR-199b was found to be strongly associated with imatinib resistance, as 44.11% patients showed resistance to imatinib therapy. Hence, the deletion in 9q34.1 region (ABL) plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. Eventually, miRNAs can provide new therapeutic strategies and can be used as a prognostic indicator.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The high expression level of RPS27a was reported in solid tumors, and we found that the expression level of RPS27a was up-regulated in advanced-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute leukemia (AL) patients. In this study, we explored the function of RPS27a in leukemia cells by using CML cell line K562 cells and its imatinib resistant cell line K562/G01 cells. It was observed that the expression level of RPS27a was high in K562 cells and even higher in K562/G01 cells. Further analysis revealed that RPS27a knockdown by shRNA in both K562 and K562G01 cells inhibited the cell viability, induced cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phases and increased cell apoptosis induced by imatinib. Combination of shRNA with imatinib treatment could lead to more cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 expression in RPS27a knockdown cells. Further, it was found that phospho-ERK(p-ERK) and BCL-2 were down-regulated and P21 up-regulated in RPS27a knockdown cells. In conclusion, RPS27a promotes proliferation, regulates cell cycle progression and inhibits apoptosis of leukemia cells.

Dimethylation of H3K4 requires a sub-complex including WRAD (WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30), which binds to each SET1 family member forming a minimal core complex that is required for multiple lysine methylation. We recently demonstrated that WRAD is a novel histone methyltransferase that preferentially catalyzes H3K4 dimethylation in a manner that is dependent on an unknown non-active-site surface from the MLL1 SET domain. Recent genome sequencing studies have identified a number of human disease-associated missense mutations that localize to the SET domains of several MLL family members. In this investigation, we mapped many of these mutations onto the three-dimensional structure of the SET domain and noticed that a subset of MLL2 (KMT2D, ALR, MLL4)-associated Kabuki syndrome missense mutations map to a common solvent-exposed surface that is not expected to alter enzymatic activity. We introduced these mutations into the MLL1 SET domain and observed that all are defective for H3K4 dimethylation by the MLL1 core complex, which is associated with a loss of the ability of MLL1 to interact with WRAD or with the RbBP5/Ash2L heterodimer. Our results suggest that amino acids from this surface, which we term the Kabuki interaction surface or KIS, are required for formation of a second active site within SET1 family core complexes.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The patient reported dyspnoea and a productive cough for 3 months, treated by antibiotics and steroids without improvement. Thoracic CT-scan showed alveolar condensations and multiple nodular lesions. All microbiological samples were negative and the evolution was fatal within 72 hours despite empirical antibiotic therapy and noninvasive ventilation. Post-mortem lung biopsies gave a diagnosis of mucinous and non-mucinous bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma with typical lepidic growth pattern of tumor cells and discrete septal thickening but no fibrosis, inflammation or local invasion.

LGL leukemia is thought to arise from chronic antigen stimulation, which drives long-term cell survival through the activation of survival signaling pathways and suppression of pro-apoptotic signals. These include Jak-Stat, Mapk, Pi3k-Akt, sphingolipid, and IL-15/Pdgf signaling.

Susceptibility to gastric and duodenal digestion was also evaluated. The results showed that walnuts subjected to pressure treatment at 256 kPa, 138 degrees C, were able to diminish the IgE cross-linking capacity on effector cells more efficiently than high pressure treated walnuts.

METHODS: Wiring codes were calculated for participating cases, n=310; and non-participating cases, n=66; as well as for three control groups: first-choice participating, n=174; first-choice non-participating, n=252; and replacement (non-first choice participating controls), n=220. RESULTS: Participating controls tended to be of higher socioeconomic status than non-participating controls, and lower socioeconomic status was related to higher wire-codes. The odds ratio (OR) for developing childhood leukemia associated with high wire-codes was 1.18 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.64) when all cases were compared to all first-choice controls (participating and non-participating). The OR for developing childhood leukemia in the high current category was 1.43 (95% CI: 0.91, 2.26) when participating cases were compared to first-choice participating controls, but no associations were observed when participating cases were compared to non-participating controls (OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.57) or to replacement controls (OR=1.06, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.60).

Although B-lymphocyte circulation plays an important role in these processes and is essential for normal immune responses, little is known about S1P receptors in human B cells. OBJECTIVE: To explore their function and signaling, we studied B-cell lines and primary B cells from control subjects, patients with leukemia, patients with S1P receptor inhibitor-treated MS, and patients with primary immunodeficiencies. METHODS: S1P receptor expression was analyzed by using multicolor immunofluorescence microscopy and quantitative PCR. Transwell assays were used to study cell migration. S1P receptor internalization was visualized by means of time-lapse imaging with fluorescent S1P receptor fusion proteins expressed by using lentiviral gene transfer. B-lymphocyte subsets were characterized by means of flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Showing that different B-cell populations express different combinations of S1P receptors, we found that S1P1 promotes migration, whereas S1P4 modulates and S1P2 inhibits S1P1 signals. Expression of CD69 in activated B lymphocytes and B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia inhibited S1P-induced migration. Studying B-cell lines, normal B lymphocytes, and B cells from patients with primary immunodeficiencies, we identified Bruton tyrosine kinase, beta-arrestin 2, LPS-responsive beige-like anchor protein, dedicator of cytokinesis 8, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein as critical signaling components downstream of S1P1. CONCLUSION: Thus S1P receptor signaling regulates human B-cell circulation and might be a factor contributing to the pathology of MS, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and primary immunodeficiencies.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Present study reports the medicinal efficacy of S. xanthocarpum fruit as antioxidant, anticancer and anti HIV agents. METHODS: Extracts were prepared using Soxhlet apparatus and partially characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Total flavonoid content was determined spectrophotometrically. Reducing power, DPPH radical scavenging activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays were used for measurement of antioxidant potential. Cytotoxic (SRB assay) and anti-HIV RT inhibition (RT assay kit, Roche) activities were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: TLC revealed the diversity of phytoconstituents in various sequential extracts of S. xanthocarpum fruit. Total flavonoid contents in extracts ranged between 10.22-162.49 mug quercetin equivalent/mg. Spectroscopic scanning of water soluble phenolics showed maximum absorbance at 250 and 280 nm. Polar extracts displayed potent radical scavenging activity (>80%). Several sub-fractions (spots) of extracts separated on TLC plates also exhibited powerful radical scavenging activity. Considerable reducing power was observed in extracts. Hexane fraction provided 55% lipoprotection in rat kidney homogenate. Non-polar extracts exhibited appreciable cytotoxic activity (70-91%) against leukemia (THP-1) and lung cancer (HOP-62) cell lines. Lower inhibitory activity was observed in extracts against HIV Reverse Transcriptase enzyme.

However, little is known about the expression and prognostic value of miR-96 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of miR-96 expression with clinicopathological features and prognosis of AML. METHODS: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed to evaluate the expression levels of miR-96 in mononuclear cells from bone marrow or peripheral blood specimens in 86 patients with newly diagnosed AML. RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, miR-96 expression was significantly downregulated in patients with newly diagnosed AML (P < 0.001). In analysis of 14 diagnosis/CR-paired samples, the expression level of miR-96 was found markedly elevated in patients after treatment than before (P < 0.001). Moreover, lower levels of miR-96 were associated with a higher white blood cell count, bone marrow blast count (P < 0.001 and 0.022, respectively), and lower hemoglobin and platelet count (P = 0.036 and 0.033, respectively). Although the low-expression group seemed to have a lower CR rate (53.85% vs 70.0%), there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.213). The low-expression group had a lower relapse-free survival (RFS) (P = 0.038) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.022) compared with the high-expression group during a median follow-up of 20 months. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that the expression of miR-96 was downregulated in newly diagnosed AML patients and associated with leukemic burden, as well as RFS and OS. This suggests that miR-96 detection might become a potential biomarker of prognosis and monitoring in AML.

CD133+ HCC cells exhibit liver CSC-like properties, and CSC differentiation-inducing therapy may lead these cells to lose their self-renewal ability and may induce terminal differentiation, which may in turn allow their malignant potential to be controlled. Because arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) increases remission rates and prolongs survival among patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia by inducing differentiation and apoptosis of leukemic cells, we hypothesized that As(2)O(3) might also inhibit HCC recurrence and prolong survival time after hepatectomy by inducing differentiation of HCC CSCs. METHODS: We evaluated the As(2)O(3) induced differentiation of human HCC CSCs and its mechanism in vitro, and we investigated the effects of treatment with As(2)O(3) on recurrence rates and median survival in a mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: We found that As(2)O(3) induced HCC CSC differentiation by down-regulating the expression of CD133 and some stemness genes, thus inhibiting the cells' self-renewal ability and tumorigenic capacity without inhibiting their proliferation in vitro. In vivo experiments indicated that As(2)O(3) decreased recurrence rates after radical resection and prolonged survival in a mouse model. As(2)O(3), which shows no apparent toxicity, may induce HCC CSC differentiation by down-regulating the expression of GLI1. CONCLUSIONS: We found that As(2)O(3) induced HCC CSC differentiation, inhibited recurrence, and prolonged survival after hepatectomy by targeting GLI1expression.

The pathogenesis of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is not well understood, although the neoplasm demonstrates frequent deletion of tumor suppressor genes, including RB1, CDKN1B, CDKN2A, and TP53. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a clinically aggressive tumor that often initially presents as cutaneous lesions and subsequently progresses to bone marrow involvement and leukemic dissemination. It is characterized by enhanced expression of CD56, CD4, and CD123, which can be detected by flow cytometry/immunohistochemistry. The differential diagnoses include myeloid sarcoma/acute myeloid leukemia, T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, NK-cell lymphoma/leukemia, and some mature T-cell lymphomas/leukemias.

Those that provide the malignant cells with significant advantage are collectively referred to as driver mutations and those that do not, are the passenger mutations. Accordingly, analytical criteria to distinguish driver mutations from passenger mutations have been recently suggested. Recent studies revealed mutations in interleukin-7 receptor-alpha (IL7R) gene in 10% of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients and in only a few cases of pediatric B-ALL. IL7R mutations are also frequently found in patients with lung cancer, but whereas in pediatric T-ALL IL7R mutations are ""drivers"" (consisting of gain-of-function mutations within a narrow 50-base pair interval at exon 6 that confer cytokine-independent cell growth and promote tumor transformation), in lung cancer, mutations are substitution mutations randomly distributed across the gene and are probably only ""passenger"" events. Because the treatment response of adult T-ALL is significantly poorer than that of childhood T-ALL and because exon 6 IL7R mutations play a role in the pathogenesis of childhood T-ALL, we sought to determine how the pattern of IL7R mutations varies between adult and childhood T-ALL. To that end, we sequenced the 50-base pair interval in exon 6 of the IL7R of DNA obtained from bone marrow samples of 35 randomly selected adult patients with T-ALL. Our analysis revealed that none of these 35 samples carried an IL7R mutation in exon 6.

Based on molecular modeling studies, performed using the crystal structure of Haemophilus haemolyticus cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferase (MHhaI C5 DNMT), which suggested that the quinoline and the aminopyridimine moieties of SGI-1027 are important for interaction with the substrates and protein, we designed and synthesized 25 derivatives. Among them, four compounds-namely the derivatives 12, 16, 31 and 32-exhibited activities comparable to that of the parent compound. Further evaluation revealed that these compounds were more potent against human DNMT3A than against human DNMT1 and induced the re-expression of a reporter gene, controlled by a methylated cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, in leukemia KG-1 cells. These compounds possessed cytotoxicity against leukemia KG-1 cells in the micromolar range, comparable with the cytotoxicity of the reference compound, SGI-1027. Structure-activity relationships were elucidated from the results. First, the presence of a methylene or carbonyl group to conjugate the quinoline moiety decreased the activity. Second, the size and nature of the aromatic or heterocycle subsitutents effects inhibition activity: tricyclic moieties, such as acridine, were found to decrease activity, while bicyclic substituents, such as quinoline, were well tolerated. The best combination was found to be a bicyclic substituent on one side of the compound, and a one-ring moiety on the other side. Finally, the orientation of the central amide bond was found to have little effect on the biological activity.

In addition, EEHDW triggered an arrest of HL-60 cells at G0/G1 phase and sub-G1 population (apoptotic cells). EEHDW provoked DNA condensation and DNA damage in HL-60 cells. The activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were elevated in EEHDW-treated HL-60 cells.

Herein, we report, for the first time, the discovery of a series of 5-(2-(phenylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl)thiazole-2(3H)-one derivatives as Mnk inhibitors. Several derivatives demonstrate very potent Mnk2 inhibitory activity. The most active and selective compounds were tested against a panel of cancer cell lines, and the results confirm the cell-type-specific effect of these Mnk inhibitors.

Despite its efficiency against AML cells, the emergence of drug resistance due to prolonged chemotherapy in most patients is still a major obstacle. Several studies have shown that drug resistance mechanisms alter the sensitivity of leukemia cells to immune system effector cells. To investigate this phenomenon, parental acute myeloid cell lines, HL-60 and KG-1, were continuously exposed to increasing doses of cytarabine in order to establish equivalent resistant cell lines, HL-60(R) and KG-1(R). Our data indicate that cytarabine-resistant cells are more susceptible to natural killer (NK)-mediated cell lysis as compared with parental cytarabine-sensitive cells. The increased susceptibility correlates with the induction of UL-16 binding proteins (ULBP) 1/2/3 and NK group 2, member D (NKG2D) ligands on target cells by a mechanism involving c-Myc induction. More importantly, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that ULBP1/3 are direct targets of c-Myc. Using drug-resistant primary AML blasts as target cells, inhibition of c-Myc resulted in decreased expression of NKG2D ligands and the subsequent impairment of NK cell lysis.

Besides the loss of DC progenitors, pan-hematopoietic Cbfb-deficient mice also lack CD105(+) erythroid progenitors, leading to severe anemia at 3 to 4 months of age. Instead, Cbfb deficiency results in aberrant progenitor differentiation toward granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), resulting in a myeloproliferative phenotype with accumulation of GMPs in the periphery and cellular infiltration of the liver. Expression of the transcription factor Irf8 is severely reduced in Cbfb-deficient progenitors, and overexpression of Irf8 restors DC differentiation.

To expand upon the understanding of the potential of ceria as a biomaterial, porous ceria, fabricated via direct foaming, was investigated to assess its biocompatibility and its ability to scavenge free radicals. A mouse osteoblast (7F2) cell line was cultured with the ceria foams to determine the extent of the foams' toxicity. Toxicity assessments indicate that mouse osteoblasts cultured directly on the ceria scaffold for 72 h did not show a significant (p > 0.05) increase in toxicity, but rather show comparable toxicity to cells cultured on porous 45S5 Bioglass. The in vitro inflammatory response elicited from porous ceria foams was measured as a function of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secreted from a human monocytic leukemia cell line. Results indicate that the ceria foams do not cause a significant inflammatory response, eliciting a response of 27.1 +/- 7.1 pg mL(-1) of TNF-alpha compared to 36.3 +/- 5.8 pg mL(-1) from cells on Bioglass, and 20.1 +/- 2.9 pg mL(-1) from untreated cells. Finally, we report cellular toxicity in response to free radicals from tert-butyl hydroperoxide with and without foamed ceria. Our preliminary results show that the foamed ceria is able to decrease the toxic effect of induced oxidative stress. Collectively, this study demonstrates that foamed ceria scaffolds do not activate an inflammatory response, and show potential free radical scavenging ability, thus they have promise as an orthopedic biomaterial.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ball, Jordan P', 'Mound, Brittnee A', 'Monsalve, Adam G', 'Nino, Juan C', 'Allen, Josephine B']","['Ball JP', 'Mound BA', 'Monsalve AG', 'Nino JC', 'Allen JB']","['Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140305,United States,J Biomed Mater Res A,Journal of biomedical materials research.

We demonstrate that cell cycle-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is important in switching cells from mitotic arrest to apoptosis during MIAs treatment. Overexpression of non-degradable cyclin B1 sustained CDK1 activation and mitotic arrest, followed by caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. CDK1 is responsible for the phosphorylation of several pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins during MIAs treatment. CDK1-mediated Bcl-2 serine 70 phosphorylation enhances its pro-apoptotic function, whereas CDK1-mediated Bad serine 128 phosphorylation promotes apoptosis. Blockage of CDK1 activity with a specific pharmacological inhibitor suppresses Mcl-1 phosphorylation, degradation and its anti-apoptotic function.

METHODS: In the current study, among 103 children treated on the AML02 protocol between October 2002 and October 2008 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the authors retrospectively assessed the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the frequency of febrile neutropenia, clinically or microbiologically confirmed infections (including bacteremia), and antibiotic resistance, as well as on the results of nasal and rectal surveillance cultures. Initially, patients received no prophylaxis or oral cephalosporin (group A). The protocol was then amended to administer intravenous cefepime alone or intravenous vancomycin plus either oral cephalosporin, oral ciprofloxacin, or intravenous cefepime (group B). RESULTS: There were 334 infectious episodes. Patients in group A had a significantly greater frequency of documented infections and bacteremia (both P < .0001) (including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia; P = .0003 and .001, respectively) compared with patients in group B, especially viridans streptococcal bacteremia (P = .001). The incidence of febrile neutropenia without documented infection was not found to be different between the 2 groups. Five cases of bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) occurred in group B (vs none in group A), without related mortality. Two of these cases were preceded by positive VRE rectal surveillance cultures. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is feasible in children with acute myeloid leukemia and reduces the frequency of documented infection but not of febrile neutropenia. Despite the emergence of VRE bacteremia, the benefits favor antibiotic prophylaxis. Creative approaches to shorten the duration of prophylaxis and thereby minimize resistance should be explored.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Inaba, Hiroto', 'Gaur, Aditya H', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Flynn, Patricia M', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Avutu, Viswatej', 'Marszal, Lindsay N', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Hayden, Randall T', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E']","['Inaba H', 'Gaur AH', 'Cao X', 'Flynn PM', 'Pounds SB', 'Avutu V', 'Marszal LN', 'Howard SC', 'Pui CH', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Hayden RT', 'Rubnitz JE']","[""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee; Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA02394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140326,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis/adverse effects/methods/statistics & numerical data/trends', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/*microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Candidiasis/diagnosis', 'Cefepime', 'Cephalosporins/administration & dosage', 'Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ciprofloxacin/administration & dosage', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nose/microbiology', 'Outpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Rectum/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vancomycin/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",PMC4063871,['NIHMS591027'],['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'antibiotics', 'children', 'infection', 'prophylaxis']",2014/03/29 06:00,2014/08/13 06:00,['2014/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28688 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Jul 1;120(13):1985-92. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28688.

L-securinine induces apoptosis in the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 indicating its potential as an efficient natural antitumor drug with low toxicity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the apoptotic effects of L-securinine on HL-60 cells and to explore its potential underlying molecular mechanism(s) as an antitumor agent. HL-60 cells were cultured with L-securinine. The proliferation and changes in cell morphology were evaluated by cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and electron microscopy, respectively. Induction of apoptosis and cell cycle progression were investigated by flow cytometry. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR). L-securinine decreased the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with IC50 values at 24, 48 and 72 h post-treatment of 47.88, 23.85 and 18.87 micromol/l, respectively. Numerous apoptotic bodies were observed in the HL-60 cells treated with 25 micromol/l L-securinine for 48 h. L-securinine at 12.5, 25 and 50 micromol/l increased the rate of apoptosis in HL-60 cells, and G1/S phase progression was retarded. Furthermore, L-securinine induced downregulation of PI3K, AKT and mTOR gene expression and upregulation of PTEN gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, L-securinine induces apoptosis and inhibition of cell cycle progression in HL-60 cells by modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway gene expression. These observations indicate the potential of L-securinine as an antitumor agent.",,"['Han, Shuwen', 'Zhang, Gang', 'Li, Maidong', 'Chen, Dongyun', 'Wang, Ying', 'Ye, Wencai', 'Ji, Zhaoning']","['Han S', 'Zhang G', 'Li M', 'Chen D', 'Wang Y', 'Ye W', 'Ji Z']","['Department of Oncology, Wannan Medical College, Wuhu, Anhui, P.R.

In a mixed-effect model, testing for such a centre effect consists in testing to zero a random centre effect variance component. It has been shown that the usual asymptotic chi(2) distribution of the likelihood ratio and score statistics under the null does not necessarily hold. In the case of censored data, mixed-effects Cox models have been used to account for random effects, but few works have concentrated on testing to zero the variance component of the random effects. We propose a permutation test, using random permutation of the cluster indices, to test for a centre effect in multilevel censored data. Results from a simulation study indicate that the permutation tests have correct type I error rates, contrary to standard likelihood ratio tests, and are more powerful. The proposed tests are illustrated using data of a multicentre clinical trial of induction therapy in acute myeloid leukaemia patients.","['Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Biard, L', 'Porcher, R', 'Resche-Rigon, M']","['Biard L', 'Porcher R', 'Resche-Rigon M']","['Service de Biostatistique et Information Medicale, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, F-75010 Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot - Paris 7, Sorbonne Paris Cite, F-75010 Paris, France; INSERM, ECSTRA Team, UMR-S 1153, F-75010 Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140328,England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/*methods', '*Proportional Hazards Models']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['centre effects', 'likelihood ratio test', 'penalized likelihood', 'proportional hazards', 'random effects', 'score test']",2014/03/29 06:00,2015/05/01 06:00,['2014/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/sim.6153 [doi]'],ppublish,Stat Med. 2014 Jul 30;33(17):3047-57. doi: 10.1002/sim.6153.

Certain researchers hypothesized that the opposite role of gap junctions may be associated with the injury extent, which has been demonstrated to be highly correlated with occlusion duration. In order to examine this hypothesis directly, the effects of octanol, a frequently used drug, were examined to investigate the role of gap junctions, in rats following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 30 min/2 h and 24 h reperfusion, respectively. Octanol significantly reduced the infarct volume following 2 h of occlusion concomitant with lower neurological deficits, whereas it enlarged the infarct volume following 30 min of occlusion. Consistently, octanol attenuated the number of transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region following 2 h of occlusion, while opposite effects were observed for 30 min of occlusion. Further immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the expression of B-cell leukemia-2 (Bcl-2, anti-apoptotic protein) was upregulated and that Bcl-2-associated X (Bax, proapoptotic protein) was downregulated following 2 h of occlusion in the octanol group compared with the ischemic group. Conversely, octanol downregulated the expression of the Bcl-2 protein concomitant with increased Bax protein following 30 min of occlusion.

The present study sought to investigate the effect of silencing HO-1 on the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to ATO to determine the potential for therapeutic applications. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated interference was used to silence HO-1 in MG63 cells. Viability, apoptosis, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) of the cells were assessed to evaluate the sensitivity of the cells to ATO as well as the potential mechanisms responsible. shRNA-mediated interference prevented the induction of HO-1, increased cell death, and increased intracellular ROS levels in MG63 cells upon treatment with ATO. Silencing HO-1 increased the susceptibility of MG63 cells to the chemotherapeutic drug ATO by enhancing intracellular accumulation of ROS.

Identification of the proteins regulating differentiation is essential to understand how they are altered in malignancies. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a biphasic disease initiated by an alteration taking place in hematopoietic stem cells. CML progresses to a blast crisis (BC) due to a secondary differentiation block in any of the hematopoietic lineages. However, the molecular mechanisms of CML evolution to T-cell BC remain unclear. Here, we have profiled the changes in DNA methylation patterns in human samples from BC-CML, in order to identify genes whose expression is epigenetically silenced during progression to T-cell lineage-specific BC. We have found that the CpG-island of the ENGRAILED-2 (EN2) gene becomes methylated in this progression. Afterwards, we demonstrate that En2 is expressed during T-cell development in mice and humans. Finally, we further show that genetic deletion of En2 in a CML transgenic mouse model induces a T-cell lineage BC that recapitulates human disease. These results identify En2 as a new regulator of T-cell differentiation whose disruption induces a malignant T-cell fate in CML progression, and validate the strategy used to identify new developmental regulators of hematopoiesis.",,"['Abollo-Jimenez, Fernando', 'Campos-Sanchez, Elena', 'Toboso-Navasa, Amparo', 'Vicente-Duenas, Carolina', 'Gonzalez-Herrero, Ines', 'Alonso-Escudero, Esther', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Segura, Victor', 'Blanco, Oscar', 'Martinez-Climent, Jose Angel', 'Sanchez-Garcia, Isidro', 'Cobaleda, Cesar']","['Abollo-Jimenez F', 'Campos-Sanchez E', 'Toboso-Navasa A', 'Vicente-Duenas C', 'Gonzalez-Herrero I', 'Alonso-Escudero E', 'Gonzalez M', 'Segura V', 'Blanco O', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Sanchez-Garcia I', 'Cobaleda C']","['Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer; CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca; Campus M. de Unamuno; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL); Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa; CSIC/Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; Campus de Cantoblanco; Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa; CSIC/Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; Campus de Cantoblanco; Madrid, Spain; Current affiliation: Immunity and Cancer Laboratory; London Research Institute; Cancer Research UK; London, UK.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer; CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca; Campus M. de Unamuno; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL); Salamanca, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer; CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca; Campus M. de Unamuno; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL); Salamanca, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer; CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca; Campus M. de Unamuno; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL); Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca; Salamanca, Spain.', 'Bioinformatics Unit; Center for Applied Medical Research; University of Navarra; Pamplona, Spain.', 'Departamento de Anatomia Patologica; Universidad de Salamanca; Salamanca, Spain.', 'Division of Oncology; Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA); University of Navarra; Pamplona, Spain.', 'Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer; CSIC/ Universidad de Salamanca; Campus M. de Unamuno; Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL); Salamanca, Spain.', 'Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa; CSIC/Universidad Autonoma de Madrid; Campus de Cantoblanco; Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['R01 CA109335/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140325,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",PMC4111718,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'T-cell development', 'blast crisis', 'chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'engrailed-2']",2014/03/29 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/03/29 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['28629 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.28629 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(11):1717-26. doi: 10.4161/cc.28629.

However, to our knowledge, few studies have explored the effects of these compounds on human leukemia cell lines. In this study, five arylnaphthalene lignans including 6'-hydroxy justicidin A (HJA), 6'-hydroxy justicidin B (HJB), justicidin B (JB), chinensinaphthol methyl ether (CME) and Taiwanin E methyl ether (TEME) were isolated from Justicia procumbens and their effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of the human leukemia K562 cell line were investigated then used to assess structure-activity relationships. To achieve these aims, cytotoxicity was assayed using the MTT assay, while intracellular SOD activity was detected using the SOD Activity Assay kit. Apoptosis was measured by both the using a cycle TEST PLUS DNA reagent kit as well as the FITC Annexin V apoptosis detection kit in combination with flow cytometry. Activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis was evaluated using a FITC active Caspase-3 apoptosis kit and flow cytometry. The results indicated that HJB, HJA and JB significantly inhibited the growth of K562 cells by decreasing both proliferation and SOD activity and inducing apoptosis. The sequence of anti-proliferative activity induced by the five tested arylnaphthalenes by decreasing strength was HJB > HJA > JB > CME > TEME. HJB, HJA and JB also decreased SOD activity and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Activation of caspase-3 further indicated that HJB, HJA and JB induced caspase-dependent intrinsic and/or extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Together, these assays suggest that arylnaphthalene lignans derived from Justicia procumbens induce apoptosis to varying degrees, through a caspase-dependent pathway in human leukemia K562 cells. Furthermore, analysis of structure-activity relationships suggest that hydroxyl substitution at C-1 and C-6' significantly increased the antiproliferative activity of arylnaphthalene lignans while a methoxyl at C-1 significantly decreased the effect.",,"['Luo, Jiaoyang', 'Hu, Yichen', 'Kong, Weijun', 'Yang, Meihua']","['Luo J', 'Hu Y', 'Kong W', 'Yang M']","['Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, P.R.

Usually these breaks are rapidly and faithfully repaired, but occasionally different chromosomes, or different regions of the same chromosome, are fused to each other. Some of these aberrant chromosomal translocations yield functional recombinant genes, which have been implicated as the cause of a number of lymphomas, leukemias, sarcomas, and solid tumors. Reliable methods are needed for the in situ detection of the transcripts encoded by these recombinant genes. We have developed just such a method, utilizing single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (sm-FISH), in which approximately 50 short fluorescent probes bind to adjacent sites on the same mRNA molecule, rendering each target mRNA molecule visible as a diffraction-limited spot in a fluorescence microscope. Utilizing this method, gene fusion transcripts are detected with two differently colored probe sets, each specific for one of the two recombinant segments of a target mRNA; enabling the fusion transcripts to be seen in the microscope as distinct spots that fluoresce in both colors. We demonstrate this method by detecting the BCR-ABL fusion transcripts that occur in chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and by detecting the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion transcripts that occur in Ewing's sarcoma cells.

Meloxicam, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, has shown potential therapeutic effects against HCC, but the mechanisms accounting for its anti-cancer activities remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Meloxicam inhibited the ability of human HCC cells expressing higher levels of COX-2 to migrate, invade, adhere and form colonies through upregulating the expression of E-cadherin and downregulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2. Meloxicam induced cell apoptosis by upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins including Bax and Fas-L, and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins including survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), through inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT. Addition of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the major product of COX-2, could abrogate the effects of meloxicam on the expression of survivin and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), but not Bax and Fas-L, indicating that meloxicam induces cell apoptosis via both COX-2-dependent and -independent pathways. Meloxicam also induced cell autophagy by upregulating Beclin 1 and light chain 3-II. Specific inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine and chloroquine had little effect on cell apoptosis but could enhance the pro-apoptotic effects of meloxicam by further upregulating the expression of Bax. CONCLUSIONS: Meloxicam executes its antitumor effects by targeting the COX-2/MMP-2/E-cadherin, AKT, apoptotic and autophagic pathways in COX-2-dependent and -independent pathways, and inhibition of cell autophagy could help to overcome the resistance to meloxicam-induced apoptosis in HCC.",,"['Dong, Xiaofeng', 'Li, Rui', 'Xiu, Peng', 'Dong, Xuesong', 'Xu, Zongzhen', 'Zhai, Bo', 'Liu, Feng', 'Jiang, Hongchi', 'Sun, Xueying', 'Li, Jie', 'Qiao, Haiquan']","['Dong X', 'Li R', 'Xiu P', 'Dong X', 'Xu Z', 'Zhai B', 'Liu F', 'Jiang H', 'Sun X', 'Li J', 'Qiao H']","['Department of General Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', ""Department of General Surgery, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, China."", 'Department of General Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'The Hepatosplenic Surgery Center, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'The Hepatosplenic Surgery Center, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'The Hepatosplenic Surgery Center, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Hepatosplenic Surgery Center, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China; Department of Molecular Medicine and Pathology, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Department of General Surgery, Qianfoshan Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.', 'The Hepatosplenic Surgery Center, Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140327,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cadherins/genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Meloxicam', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP2 Subtype/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thiazines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",PMC3968044,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2015/12/22 06:00,['2014/03/29 06:00'],"['2013/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092864 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-43958 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 27;9(3):e92864. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092864. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (PTGER2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E, EP2 Subtype)', '0 (Thiazines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'VG2QF83CGL (Meloxicam)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An accurate diagnosis is the basis of the possible selection of the most appropriate therapy. The most important parameters for an accurate prognosis and therapy are the biological characteristics of the disease, the clinical presentation, the fragility of the patient and the presence of comorbidities. MDS are mainly geriatric diseases and the presence of comorbidities and patient's poor performance status adversely affect the prognosis. Our group has proposed a system to identify the patients who have low probabilities to achieve benefit from treatment with azacitidine. A number of validated prognostic scores exist in MDS. The most widely used, although dated, is the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). On IPSS scores we still base therapeutic choices. Recently a revised IPSS has been built on a larger cohort of patients still to be further validated, also in MDS treated patients. We at present can predict response to azacitidine and survival in patients treated with this drug. The goals of MDS therapy are for low-risk patients: improving quality of life through the improvement of hematopoiesis and for high risk patients: prolong survival and delay progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Currently, according to the calculated IPSS risk of the patient, age, biological parameters and comorbidities we may propose individualized therapies, which may vary from watch-and-wait to hypomethylating agent therapy, to an allogeneic transplant.

Here, we report that CD34(+) progenitors from patients with CML at diagnosis are selectively targeted by the cytokine/alarmin interleukin (IL)-33. Indeed, CML CD34(+) progenitors upregulate their cell surface expression of the IL-33-specific receptor chain ST2, proliferate and produce cytokines in response to IL-33, conversely to CD34(+) cells from healthy individuals. Moreover, ST2 overexpression is normalized following imatinib mesylate therapy, whereas IL-33 counteracts in vitro imatinib mesylate-induced growth arrest in CML CD34(+) progenitors via reactivation of the STAT5 pathway, thus supporting the notion that IL-33 may impede the antiproliferative effects of imatinib mesylate on CD34(+) progenitors in CML. Clinically, the levels of circulating soluble ST2, commonly considered a functional signature of IL-33 signaling in vivo, correlate with disease burden. Indeed, these elevated peripheral concentrations associated with a high Sokal score predictive of therapeutic outcome are normalized in patients in molecular remission. Finally, we evidenced a facilitating effect of IL-33 on in vivo maintenance of CD34(+) progenitors from patients with CML by using xenotransplant experiments in immunodeficient NOG mice, and we showed that engraftment of mouse BCR-ABL-transfected bone marrow progenitors was less efficient in IL-33-deficient mice compared with wild-type recipients. Taken together, our results provide evidence that IL-33/ST2 signaling may represent a novel cytokine-mediated mechanism contributing to CML progenitor growth and support a role for this pathway in CML maintenance and imatinib mesylate resistance.",['(c)2014 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Levescot, Anais', 'Flamant, Stephane', 'Basbous, Sara', 'Jacomet, Florence', 'Feraud, Olivier', 'Anne Bourgeois, Elvire', 'Bonnet, Marie-Laure', 'Giraud, Christine', 'Roy, Lydia', 'Barra, Anne', 'Chomel, Jean-Claude', 'Turhan, Ali', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Girard, Jean-Philippe', 'Gombert, Jean-Marc', 'Herbelin, Andre']","['Levescot A', 'Flamant S', 'Basbous S', 'Jacomet F', 'Feraud O', 'Anne Bourgeois E', 'Bonnet ML', 'Giraud C', 'Roy L', 'Barra A', 'Chomel JC', 'Turhan A', 'Guilhot F', 'Girard JP', 'Gombert JM', 'Herbelin A']","[""Authors' Affiliations: INSERM UMR S935, Poitiers and Villejuif;

For instance, the single-stranded RNA genome of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) is C-rich and G-poor and that of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is A-rich and C-poor. Animal retroviruses add further variation to this unexplained, but many times remarkable virus-specific property. We previously described that the nucleotide bias is even more extreme in the unpaired regions of the structured HIV-1 RNA genome, which has been probed by SHAPE technology. We now document that the same trend is apparent for the MFold-predicted RNA structure of HIV-1 RNA and subsequently investigated the predicted structures of the RNA genomes of other retroviruses. We conclude that all virus-specific signatures are enhanced for the unpaired nucleotides in the RNA genome. Consequently, the differences in nucleotide count between the diverse human and animal retroviruses are further exposed in the single stranded genome regions. We used a skew analysis to visualize these striking differences in nucleotide usage. Evolutionary events responsible for these nucleotide signatures will be discussed.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Standard care of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) requires lifelong medication with oral therapy and regular follow-up. The success of CML treatment, therefore, depends on a high degree of patient involvement and motivation, as well as strong collaboration between patients and healthcare providers. Oncology nurses can support patients with CML from the time of diagnosis to the end of treatment to ensure they maintain high levels of involvement in their care. At the author's center, patients who most actively collaborate with their physicians in treatment decisions take personal responsibility for the quality of their care and show good adherence to treatment.

In a subset of patients, circulating MCs are detectable. A major differential diagnosis to MCL is myelomastocytic leukemia (MML). Although criteria for both MCL and MML have been published, several questions remain concerning terminologies and subvariants. To discuss open issues, the EU/US-consensus group and the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (ECNM) launched a series of meetings and workshops in 2011-2013. Resulting discussions and outcomes are provided in this article. The group recommends that MML be recognized as a distinct condition defined by mastocytic differentiation in advanced myeloid neoplasms without evidence of SM. The group also proposes that MCL be divided into acute MCL and chronic MCL, based on the presence or absence of C-Findings. In addition, a primary (de novo) form of MCL should be separated from secondary MCL that typically develops in the presence of a known antecedent MC neoplasm, usually aggressive SM (ASM) or MC sarcoma. For MCL, an imminent prephase is also proposed. This prephase represents ASM with rapid progression and 5%-19% MCs in BM smears, which is generally accepted to be of prognostic significance. We recommend that this condition be termed ASM in transformation to MCL (ASM-t). The refined classification of MCL fits within and extends the current WHO classification; and should improve prognostication and patient selection in practice as well as in clinical trials.","['(c) The Author 2014.

One possible approach is the bispecific T-cell-engaging (BiTE, a registered trademark of Amgen) antibody AMG 330 with dual specificity for CD3 and the sialic acid-binding lectin CD33 (SIGLEC-3), which is frequently expressed on the surface of AML blasts and leukemic stem cells. AMG 330 binds with low nanomolar affinity to CD33 and CD3epsilon of both human and cynomolgus monkey origin. Eleven human AML cell lines expressing between 14,400 and 56,700 CD33 molecules per cell were all potently lysed with EC(50) values ranging between 0.4 pmol/L and 3 pmol/L (18-149 pg/mL) by previously resting, AMG 330-redirected T cells. Complete lysis was achieved after 40 hours of incubation. In the presence of AML cells, AMG 330 specifically induced expression of CD69 and CD25 as well as release of IFN-gamma, TNF, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, and IL-6. Ex vivo, AMG 330 mediated autologous depletion of CD33-positive cells from cynomolgous monkey bone marrow aspirates. Soluble CD33 at concentrations found in bone marrow of patients with AML did not significantly affect activities of AMG 330. Neoexpression of CD33 on newly activated T cells was negligible as it was limited to 6% of T cells in only three out of ten human donors tested. Daily intravenous administration with as low as 0.002 mg/kg AMG 330 significantly prolonged survival of immunodeficient mice adoptively transferred with human MOLM-13 AML cells and human T cells.

In patients ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, azacitidine is the only treatment shown to prolong survival. However, with the availability of a growing compendium of cancer biomarkers and related drugs, analysis of relevant genetic alterations for individual MDS patients might become part of routine evaluation. Therefore and in order to cover the entire bone marrow microenvironment involved in the pathogenesis of MDS, SNP array analysis and targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) for the mostly therapy relevant 46 onco- and tumor-suppressor genes were performed on bone marrow biopsies from 29 MDS patients. In addition to the detection of mutations known to be associated with MDS in NRAS, KRAS, MPL, NPM1, IDH1, PTPN11, APC and MET, single nucleotide variants so far unrelated to MDS in STK11 (n=1), KDR (n=3), ATM (n=1) and JAK3 (n=2) were identified. Moreover, a recurrent microdeletion was detected in Xq26.3 (n=2), causing loss of PHF6 expression, a potential tumor suppressor gene, and the miR-424, which is involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia. Finally, combined genetic aberrations affecting the VEGF/VEGFR pathway were found in the majority of cases demonstrating the diversity of mutations affecting different nodes of a particular signaling network as an intrinsic feature in MDS patients. We conclude that combined SNP array analyses and tNGS can identify established and novel therapy relevant genomic aberrations in MDS patients and track them in a clinical setting for individual therapy selection.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

They represent daily clinical practice situations more realistically than do written tests or computer-based tests. However, there are repeated concerns in the literature regarding objectivity, fairness, and extraneous factors from interpersonal interactions, item bias, reliability, and validity. In this study, the reliability of oral examination on the radiation oncology certifying examination, which was administered in May of 2010, was analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred fifty-two candidates rotated though 8 examination stations. Stations consisted of a hotel room equipped with a computer and software that exhibited images appropriate to the content areas. Each candidate had a 25-30 minute face-to-face encounter with an oral examiner who was a content expert in one of the following areas: gastrointestinal, gynecology, genitourinary, lymphoma/leukemia/transplant/myeloma, head/neck/skin, breast, central nervous system/pediatrics, or lung/sarcoma. This type of design is typically referred to as a repeated measures design or a subject by treatment design, although the oral examination was a routine event without any experimental manipulation. RESULTS: The reliability coefficient was obtained by applying Feldt and Charter's simple computational alternative to analysis of variance formulas that yielded KR-20, or Cronbach's coefficient alpha of 0.81. CONCLUSIONS: An experimental design to develop a blueprint in order to improve the consistency of evaluation is suggested.","['Copyright (c) 2013 American Society for Radiation Oncology.

This retrospective study assessed the outcomes of older patients with AML treated with intensive chemotherapy with or without allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). METHODS: We identified all adult patients>/=60 years with newly diagnosed AML treated with induction chemotherapy at our institutions between February 1999 and July 2011. Institutional databases and medical records were used to collect information on baseline characteristics, chemotherapy protocols, response to therapy, relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-five patients>/=60 years were diagnosed with AML, including 172 patients (49.9%) who received intensive induction chemotherapy. The median age of intensively treated patients was 66 years (range 60-83 years). Responses to one to two cycles of induction chemotherapy were complete remission (CR) in 70.3% of patients, refractory disease in 15.1% and induction death in 14.5%. At a median follow-up of 22 months for survivors, intensive induction chemotherapy resulted in 3-year RFS of 20.2%, and 3-year OS of 24.0%. Seventeen patients (14.0% of patients in CR1) proceeded to allogeneic HSCT in first remission. These patients experienced 3-year RFS of 63.5% and 3-year OS of 77.5%. CONCLUSION: Intensive induction chemotherapy for newly diagnosed AML in older patients is feasible and effective in a proportion of patients, and those selected for allogeneic transplantation in CR1 may experience particularly favorable survival outcomes.",['(c) 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.'],"['Jackson, Kathryn', 'Kennedy, Glen', 'Mollee, Peter', 'Marlton, Paula', 'Morris, Kirk']","['Jackson K', 'Kennedy G', 'Mollee P', 'Marlton P', 'Morris K']","[""Department of Haematology, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140327,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'older']",2014/03/29 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/03/29 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ajco.12188 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2014 Sep;10(3):246-54. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12188.

Electron-based radiation therapy (RT) is often used in the treatment of LC; however, modern studies of RT are lacking. We reviewed our experience to analyze treatment response, disease control, and toxicity associated with RT in order to develop treatment recommendations for patients with LC. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifteen patients who underwent treatment for LC at our institution from November 1994 to August 2009 were identified and their medical records were reviewed and analyzed. RESULTS: LC presented after a median of 2 (range 0-24) months from acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis. Median survival from time of LC presentation was 23 months (range 0.5-137 months). Thirteen courses of radiation were administered to 12 patients: 9 total skin electron beam (TSEB) therapy and 4 focal treatments. Of patients receiving TSEB, 89% had diffuse LC involvement and 67% were in marrow remission. By contrast, only 25% of patients receiving focal therapy had diffuse LC involvement and only 25% were in marrow remission. Median TSEB dose was 1600 (range 600-2400) cGy. Fifty percent of patients had a complete response to RT but 1-year local control was only 33%. All patients who developed a skin relapse either had active marrow disease at the time of RT or marrow recurrence shortly thereafter. Median survival since RT was 5 (range 0.5-136) months. RT was well tolerated without significant acute effects; however, 1 patient receiving chemotherapy developed radiation recall 1 month after RT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LC have aggressive disease with few long-term survivors. Definitive treatment with TSEB should be utilized only in cases of marrow remission with focal electron therapy reserved for palliation of symptomatic lesions.

Our objective was to assess whether MID during induction, is a risk factor for future impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), diabetes, or metabolic syndrome. Ninety survivors of pediatric ALL, ages 10 yr and older were recruited, 30 with history of MID and 60 controls. Waist/height ratio >0.5 was considered as an increased risk for central adiposity and insulin resistance. Lipid profile and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed. Study patients were older than controls (17.2 vs. 14.9, p < 0.05). The groups had similar sex distribution, body mass index (BMI) z-score, and Tanner staging. A waist/height ratio of >0.5 was seen in 60 and 31.7% of the study and control groups, respectively (p = 0.01). Increased frequency of IGT in the study group compared with the control group was seen (13.3 and 1%, respectively) (p = 0.07). We observed a trend toward higher proportion of patients with multiple features of metabolic syndrome in the study compared with control group (16.7 vs. 5%, p = 0.09). In conclusion, MID during induction may be an early marker for metabolic disturbances later in life. The higher rates of increased waist/height ratio, and subjects with multiple metabolic syndrome features, may predict a metabolic risk in children with history of MID. Rates of IGT were four fold higher in the study group although not statistically significant. MID may be a 'red flag' indicating the need for ongoing metabolic screening and lifestyle modifications to prevent future metabolic disease.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

METHODS: These compounds were isolated from Calophyllum brasiliense and its cytotoxicity was tested using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell death was evaluated by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunocytofluorescence of active caspase-3. Genotoxicity was tested using comet assay. Lastly, a chemoinformatic analysis was performed with Osiris-Molinspiration software. KEY FINDINGS: The mixture of mammea A/BA and A/BB (3 : 1) showed cytotoxic activity against K562 cells (IC50 = 43.5 mum). TUNEL positive cells and active caspase-3 were detected after treatment. Genotoxicity of mammea A/BA and A/BB on K562 was detected since first hour of treatment. Additionally, mammea A/BA and A/BB were found to be in compliance with Lipinski 'rule of 5' suggesting that they possess strong potential of druglikeness.

Still, up to 20% of patients experience treatment failure due to drug resistance. Treatment-related toxicities are often life-threatening and are the primary cause of treatment interruption, while ALL survivors may develop complications due to exposure to chemotherapy and/or irradiation during a vulnerable period of development. Different factors may contribute to variable treatment outcomes including patient genetics that has been shown to play important role. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes candidate gene and genome-wide association studies that identified common polymorphisms underlying variability in treatment responses including a few studies addressing late effects of the treatment. Genetic variants influencing antileukemic drug effects or leukemic cell biology have been identified, including for example variants in folate-dependent enzymes, influx and efflux transporters, metabolizing enzymes, drug receptor or apoptotic proteins. EXPERT OPINION: Many pharmacogenetic studies have been conducted in ALL and a variety of potential markers have been identified. Yet more comprehensive insight into genome variations influencing drug responses is needed. Whole exome/genome sequencing, careful study design, mechanistic explanation of association found and collaborative studies will ultimately lead to personalized treatment and improved therapeutic and health outcomes.",,"['Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Krajinovic, Maja']","['Dulucq S', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Krajinovic M']","['University Health Center Bordeaux, Heamatology Laboratory , Bordeaux , France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20140327,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods/trends', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism']",,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/03/29 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/17425255.2014.893294 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2014 May;10(5):699-719. doi: 10.1517/17425255.2014.893294.

METHODS: Two HRQOL questionnaires (EQ-5D and QLQ-C30) were sent to patients diagnosed with AML between 1999 and 2011 at a single academic hospital and still alive in 2012. HRQOL in AML survivors was compared with general population reference values. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with HRQOL in AML survivors. RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 92 of the 103 patients (89%). AML survivors reported significantly worse functioning, more fatigue, pain, dyspnea, appetite loss, and financial difficulties and lower EQ-VAS scores than the general population (P < 0.05). Impaired HRQOL in AML survivors was mainly found in survivors without a paid job. Other factors associated with a poor HRQOL were allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and the absence of social support. CONCLUSION: This single-center study showed that the HRQOL in AML survivors is worse than the HRQOL in the general population. HRQOL in these patients can be improved by adequately treating and preventing fatigue, pain, dyspnea, and appetite loss.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Ultrasonic standing waves in microfluidic systems have previously been used for the continuous focusing of cells in rapid screening and sorting applications. In aqueous fluids, cells typically exhibit positive acoustic contrast and are thus forced toward the pressure nodes of a standing wave. Conversely, elastomeric particles exhibit negative acoustic contrast and travel toward the pressure antinodes. We have developed a class of elastomeric particles that are synthesized in bulk using a simple nucleation and growth process, providing precise control over their size and functional properties. We demonstrate that the biofunctionalization of these particles can allow the capture and transport of cells to the pressure antinodes solely via acoustic radiation forces, which may enable new acoustics-based cell handling techniques such as the washing, labeling, and sorting of cells with minimal preparatory steps.",,"['Shields, C Wyatt 4th', 'Johnson, Leah M', 'Gao, Lu', 'Lopez, Gabriel P']","['Shields CW 4th', 'Johnson LM', 'Gao L', 'Lopez GP']","['Department of Biomedical Engineering, double daggerNSF Research Triangle Materials Research Science & Engineering Center, and section signDepartment of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Duke University , Durham, North Carolina 27708, United States.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140331,United States,Langmuir,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,9882736,IM,"['Acoustics', 'Elastomers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', '*Microfluidic Analytical Techniques', 'Particle Size', 'Polymers/chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Surface Properties', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2015/04/11 06:00,['2014/03/29 06:00'],"['2014/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/la404677w [doi]'],ppublish,Langmuir. 2014 Apr 15;30(14):3923-7. doi: 10.1021/la404677w.

However, refractory and relapsed AML remains a significant source of childhood cancer mortality, highlighting the need for new therapies. Further therapy intensification with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy in pediatric AML is not feasible given the risks of both short-term and long-term organ dysfunction. Substantial emphasis has been placed upon the development of molecularly targeted therapeutic approaches for adults and children with high-risk subtypes of AML with the goal of improving remission induction and minimizing relapse. Several promising agents are currently in clinical testing or late preclinical development for AML, including monoclonal antibodies against leukemia cell surface proteins, kinase inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, epigenetic agents, and chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cell immunotherapies. Many of these therapies have been specifically tested in children with relapsed/refractory AML in Phase 1 and 2 trials with a smaller number of new agents under Phase 3 evaluation for children with de novo AML. Although successful identification and implementation of new drugs for children with AML remain a formidable challenge, enthusiasm for novel molecular therapeutic approaches is great given the potential for significant clinical benefit for children who do not have other curative options.",,"['Tasian, Sarah K', 'Pollard, Jessica A', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Tasian SK', 'Pollard JA', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, PA , USA."", ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington , Seattle, WA , USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, PA , USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA165277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA128583/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140318,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,PMC3957536,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical trial', 'demethylating agents', 'monoclonal antibodies', 'pediatric', 'precision medicine', 'targeted therapy', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2014/03/29 06:00,2014/03/29 06:01,['2014/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2014.00055 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2014 Mar 18;4:55. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2014.00055. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, by using mouse embryonic stem cells, we provide evidence for the existence of IANs in PSC-neuronal networks based on extracellular multielectrode array and intracellular patch-clamp recordings. IANs remain active after pharmacological inhibition of fast synaptic communication and possess intrinsic mechanisms required for autonomous neuronal activity. PSC-derived IANs are functionally integrated in PSC-neuronal populations, contribute to synchronous network bursting, and exhibit pacemaker properties. The intrinsic activity and pacemaker properties of the neuronal subpopulation identified herein may be particularly relevant for interventions involving transplantation of neural tissues.

As such activities have been reported for other cytokines, we asked whether we could define a class of tissue-protective cytokines. We therefore explored a novel approach based on functional clustering. In this pilot study, we started by analyzing a small number of cytokines (30). We functionally classified the 30 cytokines according to their interactions by using the bioinformatics tool STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes), followed by hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of this functional clustering were different from those obtained by clustering cytokines simply according to their sequence. We previously reported that the protective activity of EPO in a model of cerebral ischemia was paralleled by an upregulation of synaptic plasticity genes, particularly early growth response 2 (EGR2). To assess the predictivity of functional clustering, we tested some of the cytokines clustering close to EPO (interleukin-11, IL-11; kit ligand, KITLG; leukemia inhibitory factor, LIF; thrombopoietin, THPO) in an in vitro model of human neuronal cells for their ability to induce EGR2. Two of these, LIF and IL-11, induced EGR2 expression. Although these data would need to be extended to a larger number of cytokines and the biological validation should be done using more robust in vivo models, rather then just one cell line, this study shows the feasibility of this approach. This type of functional cluster analysis could be extended to other fields of cytokine research and help design biological experiments.",,"['Mengozzi, Manuela', 'Ermilov, Peter', 'Annenkov, Alexander', 'Ghezzi, Pietro', 'Pearl, Frances']","['Mengozzi M', 'Ermilov P', 'Annenkov A', 'Ghezzi P', 'Pearl F']","['Brighton and Sussex Medical School , Falmer , UK.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School , Falmer , UK.', ""Bone and Joint Research Unit, Bart's and The London School of Medicine, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London , London , UK."", 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School , Falmer , UK.', 'Translational Drug Discovery Group, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex , Falmer , UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140317,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,PMC3955874,,['NOTNLM'],"['EGR2', 'bioinformatics', 'cluster analysis', 'cytokines', 'early genes', 'neuroprotection', 'repair', 'tissue-protection']",2014/03/29 06:00,2014/03/29 06:01,['2014/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2014.00115 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2014 Mar 17;5:115. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2014.00115. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alloreactive donor NK cells have been shown to improve the outcome of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation for leukemia. In addition, in vivo transfer of NK cells may soon reveal an important therapeutic tool for leukemia, if tolerance to NK-mediated anti-leukemia effects is overcome. This will require, at a minimum, the ex vivo generation of a clinically safe NK cell product containing adequate numbers of NK cells with robust anti-leukemia potential. Ideally, ex vivo generated NK cells should also have similar anti-leukemia potential in different patients, and be easy to obtain for convenient clinical scale-up. Moreover, optimal clinical protocols for NK therapy in leukemia and other cancers are still lacking. These and other issues are being currently addressed by multiple research groups. This review will first describe current laboratory NK cell expansion and differentiation techniques by separately addressing different NK cell sources.

IM treatment effectively inhibits BCR-ABL kinase activity in CML cells, suggesting that additional kinase-independent mechanisms contribute to the presence of MRD. Bone marrow (BM) microenvironment protecting CML cells from IM treatment was investigated. Culturing CML cell line K562 in human stromal cell line HS-5-derived conditioned medium significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by IM, which was soluble factor-mediated drug resistance (SFM-DR). The BM stroma-derived soluble factors could enhance the resistance of K562 cells to IM by increasing Stat3 phosphorylation on tyrosine 705 and subsequently increasing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in K562 cells. Furthermore, the reversal effect of oroxylin A, a naturally monoflavonoid isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, in K562 cells within the SFM-DR model was detected. After treatment of weakly toxic concentration of oroxylin A, the apoptosis of K562 cells induced by IM was increased dramatically through suppressing Stat3 pathway. In addition, the in vivo study showed that oroxylin A potentiates the inhibitory effects of IM on leukemia development by suppressing Stat3 pathway in the K562 xenograft model. In conclusion, IM-induced resistance in K562 cells within the SFM-DR model correlated with increasing Stat3 signaling and upregulating P-gp expression through Stat3 pathway. Additionally, oroxylin A improved the sensitivity of K562 cells to IM in SFM-DR model and in vivo, and the underlying mechanism attributed to the suppression of Stat3 pathway, which suggested oroxylin A might be a promising agent for treatment designed to eradicate MRD in CML patients.",,"['Li, X', 'Miao, H', 'Zhang, Y', 'Li, W', 'Li, Z', 'Zhou, Y', 'Zhao, L', 'Guo, Q']","['Li X', 'Miao H', 'Zhang Y', 'Li W', 'Li Z', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhao L', 'Guo Q']","[""State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, 24 Tongjiaxiang, Nanjing, 210009, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140327,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flavonoids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Plant Roots/chemistry', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Scutellaria baicalensis/chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2014/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-014-1226-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2015 Jan;89(1):121-36. doi: 10.1007/s00204-014-1226-6.

This approach may gain enhanced applicability if the intensity of the PEF required to electrically disrupt cell membranes can be reduced via exposure to a molecular deliverable. This will be particularly impactful if that reduced PEF minimally influences cells that are not exposed to the deliverable. We hypothesized that the introduction of charged molecules to the cell surfaces would create regions of enhanced transmembrane electric potential in the vicinity of each charged molecule, thereby lowering the PEF intensity required to disrupt the plasma membranes. This study will therefore examine if exposure to cationic peptides can enhance a PEF's ability to disrupt plasma membranes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We exposed leukemia cells to 40 mus PEFs in media containing varying concentrations of a cationic peptide, polyarginine. We observed the internalization of a membrane integrity indicator, propidium iodide (PI), in real time. Based on an individual cell's PI fluorescence versus time signature, we were able to determine the relative degree of membrane disruption. When using 1-2 kV/cm, exposure to >50 mug/ml of polyarginine resulted in immediate and high levels of PI uptake, indicating severe membrane disruption, whereas in the absence of peptide, cells predominantly exhibited signatures indicative of no membrane disruption. Additionally, PI entered cells through the anode-facing membrane when exposed to cationic peptide, which was theoretically expected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Exposure to cationic peptides reduced the PEF intensity required to induce rapid and irreversible membrane disruption. Critically, peptide exposure reduced the PEF intensities required to elicit irreversible membrane disruption at normally sub-electroporation intensities. We believe that these cationic peptides, when coupled with current advancements in cell targeting techniques will be useful tools in applications where targeted destruction of unwanted cell populations is desired.",,"['Kennedy, Stephen M', 'Aiken, Erik J', 'Beres, Kaytlyn A', 'Hahn, Adam R', 'Kamin, Samantha J', 'Hagness, Susan C', 'Booske, John H', 'Murphy, William L']","['Kennedy SM', 'Aiken EJ', 'Beres KA', 'Hahn AR', 'Kamin SJ', 'Hagness SC', 'Booske JH', 'Murphy WL']","['School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America; Department of Orthopedics and Rehabilitation, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America.']",['eng'],['F31 EB007903/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140326,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cations', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', '*Electricity', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Propidium/metabolism', 'Static Electricity']",PMC3966810,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2014/03/28 06:00'],"['2013/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092528 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-41178 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 26;9(3):e92528. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092528. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Peptides)', '25212-18-4 (polyarginine)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the CrossMab could induce remarkably high levels of complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative activity.

This can potentially generate correlated copy-number alterations across hundreds of linked genes, as exemplified by the 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with recurrent amplification of megabase regions of chromosome 21 (iAMP21). We used genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of iAMP21 ALL. Here we show that individuals born with the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15 and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have approximately 2,700-fold increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL compared to the general population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by a chromothripsis event involving both sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome, a novel mechanism for cancer predisposition. In sporadic iAMP21, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles are typically the initiating event, often followed by chromothripsis. In both sporadic and rob(15;21)c-associated iAMP21, the final stages frequently involve duplications of the entire abnormal chromosome.

It has been long known that an enzyme with l-asparaginase activity is responsible for cell killing, although astonishingly, its identity remains unclear. Bacterial asparaginases with similar cell killing properties have since become a mainstay therapy of certain cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. By hydrolyzing asparagine to aspartate and ammonia, these drugs deplete the asparagine present in the blood, killing cancer cells that rely on extracellular asparagine uptake for survival. However, bacterial asparaginases can elicit an adverse immune response. We propose that replacement of bacterial enzymes with the guinea pig asparaginase responsible for serum activity, by its virtue of being more closely related to human enzymes, will be less immunogenic. To this goal, we investigated whether an uncharacterized protein from guinea pig with putative asparaginase activity, which we call gpASNase3, could be that enzyme. We examined its self-activation process (gpASNase3 requires autocleavage to become active), kinetically characterized it for asparaginase and beta-aspartyl dipeptidase activity, and elucidated its crystal structure in both the uncleaved and cleaved states. This work reveals that gpASNase3 is not the enzyme responsible for the antitumor effects of guinea pig serum. It exhibits a low affinity for asparagine as measured by a high Michaelis constant, KM, in the millimolar range, in contrast to the low KM (micromolar range) required for asparaginase to be effective as an anticancer agent.",,"['Schalk, Amanda M', 'Lavie, Arnon']","['Schalk AM', 'Lavie A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago , 900 S.

We analyzed apigenin's effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cell cycle progression in K562 and K562/IMA3 cells. Furthermore, we described genes and gene networks that are modulated in CML in response to apigenin.

To date, no studies have examined attitudes toward clinical trial participation in this age range to determine if certain individuals are less likely to enroll if offered participation. The current study assessed attitudes toward participation using the Cancer Treatment Subscale of the Attitudes toward Cancer Trials Scales. Methods: Data were collected from a sample of leukemia and lymphoma survivors (n=99) and a healthy college student sample (n=397). Following a principal components analysis, two subscales-Personal Barriers/Safety and Personal Benefits-were retained for analysis. Results: In the cancer survivor group, only 14 (13.3%) reported being offered participation in a cancer clinical trial, and only 8 of those 14 (7.6% of survivors) participated. Responses from leukemia and lymphoma survivors revealed no significant relationships between age, gender, race/ethnicity, clinical trial participation, insurance status, or social class with Personal Benefits or Personal Barriers/Safety. Healthy college females had more negative Personal Barriers/Safety attitudes compared to males after adjusting for race/ethnicity and social class (p=0.01), but no associations were present when examining Personal Benefits as an outcome. Conclusion: This preliminary investigation suggests that drivers of attitudes toward clinical trial participation in AYAs are not well understood and may impact cancer trial participation. Future work should focus on defining attitudes toward cancer clinical trials in the AYA population and developing interventions to increase awareness, knowledge, and positive attitudes toward participating in cancer research.",,"['Grigsby, Timothy J', 'Kent, Erin E', 'Montoya, Michael J', 'Sender, Leonard S', 'Morris, Rebecca A', 'Ziogas, Argyrios', 'Anton-Culver, Hoda']","['Grigsby TJ', 'Kent EE', 'Montoya MJ', 'Sender LS', 'Morris RA', 'Ziogas A', 'Anton-Culver H']","['Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California , Los Angeles, California.', 'Outcomes Research Branch, Applied Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Science, National Cancer Institute , Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Department of Anthropology, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California. ; Department of Chicano/Latino Studies, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California. ; Department of Public Health, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California.', ""Department of Epidemiology, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California. ; Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California. ; Hyundai Cancer Institute , CHOC Children's Hospital, Orange, California."", ""Hyundai Cancer Institute , CHOC Children's Hospital, Orange, California."", 'Department of Epidemiology, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California. ; Genetic Epidemiology Research Institute, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California. ; Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California. ; Genetic Epidemiology Research Institute, University of California , Irvine, Irvine, California.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,,PMC3955964,,['NOTNLM'],"['attitudes', 'beliefs', 'clinical trials', 'recruitment']",2014/03/29 06:00,2014/03/29 06:01,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1089/jayao.2013.0030 [doi]', '10.1089/jayao.2013.0030 [pii]']",ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2014 Mar 1;3(1):20-27. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2013.0030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, concerns of secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have led to restrictions on pediatric dexrazoxane use in Europe. Published data about dexrazoxane-associated secondary AML are limited and conflicting. We sought to estimate the secondary AML risk in children receiving dexrazoxane after anthracycline exposure. PROCEDURE: A retrospective cohort of children with newly identified malignancies (excluding AML) receiving anthracyclines between January 1, 1999 and March 31, 2011 was established using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS). Patients were followed for all subsequent admissions to identify dexrazoxane exposures and secondary AML, defined by AML ICD-9 codes and AML induction chemotherapy. Logistic regression was used to model the association of dexrazoxane and secondary AML risk. A propensity score was used to adjust for measurable confounding. RESULTS: Of 15,532 patients in the cohort exposed to anthracyclines, 1,406 received dexrazoxane. The secondary AML rate was 0.21% (3 of 1,046) in dexrazoxane-exposed and 0.55% (77 of 14,126) in unexposed patients. In a propensity score-adjusted multivariate analysis, dexrazoxane exposure was not associated with an increased risk of secondary AML, OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.11-1.26. CONCLUSIONS: Dexrazoxane was not associated with an increased risk of secondary AML in a large cohort of pediatric cancer patients receiving anthracyclines in US hospitals. While these data support dexrazoxane's safety in the general pediatric oncology population, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and to quantify dexrazoxane's long-term cardioprotective effects.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Seif, Alix E', 'Walker, Dana M', 'Li, Yimei', 'Huang, Yuan-Shung V', 'Kavcic, Marko', 'Torp, Kari', 'Bagatell, Rochelle', 'Fisher, Brian T', 'Aplenc, Richard']","['Seif AE', 'Walker DM', 'Li Y', 'Huang YS', 'Kavcic M', 'Torp K', 'Bagatell R', 'Fisher BT', 'Aplenc R']","[""Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Department of Pediatrics, The Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA133881/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA165277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R01 CA3881-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140326,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cardiotonic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Databases, Factual', 'Dexrazoxane/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC4177031,['NIHMS581111'],['NOTNLM'],"['cardiotoxicity after cancer therapy', 'dexrazoxane', 'epidemiology', 'secondary malignancy']",2014/03/29 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25043 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Apr;62(4):704-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25043.

The overall cure rate of BL/L in children is 70-90%, but patients diagnosed with advanced-stage disease have a less favorable prognosis. It is possible that secondary chromosomal abnormalities contribute to this unfavorable prognosis via chemotherapy resistance, but the results of genetic studies have been inconsistent. This study aimed to identify and characterize secondary chromosomal abnormalities associated with the t(8;14) and its variants in children with French-American-British-L3 leukemia or Burkitt lymphoma with bone marrow involvement at the time of diagnosis. PROCEDURE: Chromosome analysis was based on G-banding. Fluorescence in situ hybridization technique was applied using IGH/MYC/CEP8 dual-fusion and MYC break-apart probes. Multicolor chromosome banding was performed according to standard protocol. RESULTS: We describe a group of BL/L with extreme adverse clinical outcome, in which secondary chromosomal abnormalities, particularly those involving the long arms of chromosomes 1 and 13, were found in 71% of cases. The IGH/MYC fusion showed molecular heterogeneity in 14% of cases and two cases exhibited three IGH/MYC fusion signals. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary chromosomal abnormalities were found in a high proportion of patients. We observed an extent of IGH/MYC heterogeneity not previously reported in Burkitt lymphoma, including the novel finding of three fusion signals in two cases.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['De Souza, Mariana T', 'Hassan, Rocio', 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Marques-Salles, Terezinha J', 'Boulhosa, Alice M', 'Abdelhay, Eliana', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Silva, Maria Luiza Macedo']","['De Souza MT', 'Hassan R', 'Liehr T', 'Marques-Salles TJ', 'Boulhosa AM', 'Abdelhay E', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Silva ML']","['Post Graduation Program in Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; National Institute of Science and Technology for Cancer Control, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140326,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Brazil', '*Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Human/*genetics', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia', 'IGH/MYC gene fusion', 'pediatric', 'secondary chromosomal abnormalities', 't(8 ;14)(q24 ;q32)']",2014/03/29 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25030 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Aug;61(8):1422-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25030.

These mutations confer a neomorphic activity of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) production, and 2-HG has previously been implicated as an oncometabolite. Inhibitors of mutant IDH1 can potentially be used to treat these diseases. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of action of a newly discovered inhibitor, ML309, using biochemical, cellular, and biophysical approaches. Substrate binding and product inhibition studies helped to further elucidate the IDH1 R132H catalytic cycle. This rapidly equilibrating inhibitor is active in both biochemical and cellular assays. The (+) isomer is active (IC50 = 68 nm), whereas the (-) isomer is over 400-fold less active (IC50 = 29 mum) for IDH1 R132H inhibition. IDH1 R132C was similarly inhibited by (+)-ML309. WT IDH1 was largely unaffected by (+)-ML309 (IC50 >36 mum). Kinetic analyses combined with microscale thermophoresis and surface plasmon resonance indicate that this reversible inhibitor binds to IDH1 R132H competitively with respect to alpha-ketoglutarate and uncompetitively with respect to NADPH. A reaction scheme for IDH1 R132H inhibition by ML309 is proposed in which ML309 binds to IDH1 R132H after formation of the IDH1 R132H NADPH complex. ML309 was also able to inhibit 2-HG production in a glioblastoma cell line (IC50 = 250 nm) and had minimal cytotoxicity. In the presence of racemic ML309, 2-HG levels drop rapidly. This drop was sustained until 48 h, at which point the compound was washed out and 2-HG levels recovered.","['(c) 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Davis, Mindy I', 'Gross, Stefan', 'Shen, Min', 'Straley, Kimberly S', 'Pragani, Rajan', 'Lea, Wendy A', 'Popovici-Muller, Janeta', 'DeLaBarre, Byron', 'Artin, Erin', 'Thorne, Natasha', 'Auld, Douglas S', 'Li, Zhuyin', 'Dang, Lenny', 'Boxer, Matthew B', 'Simeonov, Anton']","['Davis MI', 'Gross S', 'Shen M', 'Straley KS', 'Pragani R', 'Lea WA', 'Popovici-Muller J', 'DeLaBarre B', 'Artin E', 'Thorne N', 'Auld DS', 'Li Z', 'Dang L', 'Boxer MB', 'Simeonov A']","['From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892, the Center for Proteomic Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892.', 'Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, and.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892.', 'From the NIH Chemical Genomics Center, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20892, asimeono@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],['U54 MH084681/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140325,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetamides/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Biophysical Phenomena', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Small Molecule Libraries/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",PMC4022846,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Dehydrogenase', 'Drug Discovery', 'Enzyme', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Glioblastoma', 'IDH1', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Small Molecules']",2014/03/29 06:00,2014/12/18 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38718-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.511030 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 May 16;289(20):13717-25. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.511030.

In a hematopoietic system, overexpression of iASPP results in blockage of apoptosis, which may play a role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers. To address this, we first analyzed the expression of iASPP in patients with acute leukemia (AL) and found it was highly expressed in patients with AL. We further established a transgenic mouse model in which human iASPP was specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. Overexpression of iASPP led to an increase in the proportion of long-term HSCs, short-term HSCs, multipotent progenitors, and common myeloid progenitor. HSCs from iASPP transgenic mice had an advantage in long-term reconstitution potential. In addition, the hematopoietic cells from iASPP transgenic mice exhibited a significantly lower level of p53 dependent apoptosis. After irradiation damage, hematopoietic cells of iASPP transgenic mice had a higher level of gamma-H2AX expression, which lasted for a longer time. These results provide the first evidence that the iASPP can increase HSC populations and reconstitution capacity. Interestingly, in response to cell damage stimuli, hematopoietic cells can be protected against apoptosis by iASPP; meanwhile these apoptosis-resistant cells would have more mutation accumulation, which might be the potential risk for malignant transformation.-Jia, Y., Peng, L., Rao, Q., Xing, H., Huai, L., Yu, P., Chen, Y., Wang, C., Wang, M., Mi, Y., Wang, J.

We sequenced complementary DNA from bone marrow of 47 refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) patients, 29 AML cases with low marrow blast cell count, and 325 other AML patients and determined the presence of SF-hotspot mutations in SF3B1, U2AF35, and SRSF2. SF mutations were found in 10 RAEB, 12 AML cases with low marrow blast cell count, and 25 other AML cases. Our study provides evidence that SF-mutant RAEB and SF-mutant AML are clinically, cytologically, and molecularly highly similar. An integrated analysis of genomewide messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling and DNA-methylation profiling data revealed 2 unique patient clusters highly enriched for SF-mutant RAEB/AML. The combined genomewide mRNA expression profiling/DNA-methylation profiling signatures revealed 1 SF-mutant patient cluster with an erythroid signature. The other SF-mutant patient cluster was enriched for NRAS/KRAS mutations and showed an inferior survival. We conclude that SF-mutant RAEB/AML constitutes a related disorder overriding the artificial separation between AML and MDS, and that SF-mutant RAEB/AML is composed of 2 molecularly and clinically distinct subgroups.

Although previous studies have shown increased signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in AML leukemic blasts, the role of Janus kinase (JAK) signaling in primary AML compared with normal stem cells has not been directly evaluated. We show here that JAK/STAT signaling is increased in LSCs, particularly from high-risk AML. JAK2 inhibition using small molecule inhibitors or interference RNA reduced growth of AML LSCs while sparing normal stem cells both in vitro and in vivo. Increased JAK/STAT activity was associated with increased expression and altered signaling through growth factor receptors in AML LSCs, including receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT and FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3). Inhibition of c-KIT and FLT3 expression significantly inhibited JAK/STAT signaling in AML LSCs, and JAK inhibitors effectively inhibited FLT3-mutated AML LSCs. Our results indicate that JAK/STAT signaling represents an important signaling mechanism supporting AML LSC growth and survival.

Due to off-target activity, AID is implicated in lymphoma development by introducing genome-wide DNA damage and initiating chromosomal translocations such as c-myc/IgH. Several alternative splice transcripts of AID have been reported in activated B cells as well as malignant B cells such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). As most commercially available antibodies fail to recognize alternative splice variants, their abundance in vivo, and hence their biological significance, has not been determined. In this study, we assessed the protein levels of AID splice isoforms by introducing an AID splice reporter construct into cell lines and primary CLL cells from patients as well as from WT and TCL1(tg) C57BL/6 mice (where TCL1 is T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1). The splice construct is 5'-fused to a GFP-tag, which is preserved in all splice isoforms and allows detection of translated protein. Summarizing, we show a thorough quantification of alternatively spliced AID transcripts and demonstrate that the corresponding protein abundances, especially those of splice variants AID-ivs3 and AID-DeltaE4, are not stoichiometrically equivalent. Our data suggest that enhanced proteasomal degradation of low-abundance proteins might be causative for this discrepancy.","['(c) 2013 The Authors.

Extending the use of CAR therapies to cancers other than B-cell malignancies will require selective tumor targeting with minimal or acceptable ""on-target, off-tumor"" effects. The identification of new CAR target antigens is thus one of the next big challenges to address. Recognizing the paucity of currently available tumor-specific targets, we have developed broadly applicable approaches to enhance the tumor selectivity and safety of engineered T cells.

As previously reported, activation of the complement cascade (ComC) and cleavage of C5 by C5 convertase are enabling events in the release of C5a that plays a crucial role in the egress of HSPCs from bone marrow (BM) into peripheral blood (PB) and explains why C5-deficient mice are poor mobilizers. Here we provide evidence that during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor- and AMD3100-induced mobilization, not only the ComC but also two other evolutionarily ancient proteolytic enzyme cascades, the coagulation cascade (CoaC) and the fibrynolytic cascade (FibC), become activated. Activation of all three cascades was measured by generation of C5a, decrease in prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time as well as an increase in the concentrations of plasmin/antiplasmin and thrombin/antithrombin. More importantly, the CoaC and FibC, by generating thrombin and plasmin, respectively, provide C5 convertase activity, explaining why mobilization of HSPCs in C3-deficient mice, which do not generate ComC-generated C5a convertase, is not impaired. Our observations shed more light on how the CoaC and FibC modulate stem cell mobilization and may lead to the development of more efficient mobilization strategies in poor mobilizers. Furthermore, as it is known that all these cascades are activated in all the situations in which HSPCs are mobilized from BM into PB (for example, infections, tissue/organ damage or strenuous exercise) and show a circadian rhythm of activation, they must be involved in both stress-induced and circadian changes in HSPC trafficking in PB.",,"['Borkowska, S', 'Suszynska, M', 'Mierzejewska, K', 'Ismail, A', 'Budkowska, M', 'Salata, D', 'Dolegowska, B', 'Kucia, M', 'Ratajczak, J', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Borkowska S', 'Suszynska M', 'Mierzejewska K', 'Ismail A', 'Budkowska M', 'Salata D', 'Dolegowska B', 'Kucia M', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']","['1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', '1] Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA [2] Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112788/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '2R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL112788/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140326,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzylamines', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Complement C3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Complement C5a/*metabolism', 'Cyclams', 'Female', 'Fibrinolysis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/pharmacology', 'Hirudins/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tranexamic Acid/pharmacology']",PMC4177021,['NIHMS575623'],,,2014/03/29 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014115 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Nov;28(11):2148-54. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.115.

To investigate whether this leads to functional differences in DNA repair abilities measurable in patients, we adapted two plasmid-based host-cell reactivation assays for use in primary lymphocytes. Prior to applying these assays to patients who underwent aHCT, we wanted first to verify whether sample preparation affected repair measurements, as patient samples were simply depleted of erythrocytes (with hetastarch) prior to freezing, which is not the classical way to prepare lymphocytes prior to DNA repair experiments (with a density gradient). We show here that lymphocytes from healthy donors freshly prepared with hetastarch show systematically a higher level of double-strand break repair as compared to when prepared with a density gradient, but that most of this difference disappears after samples were frozen. Several observations points to granulocytes as the source for this effect of sample preparation on repair: 1) removal of granulocytes makes the effect disappear, 2) DSB repair measurements for the same individual correlate to the percentage of granulocytes in the sample and 3) nucleofection in presence of granulocytes increases the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neighboring lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner (R2 of 0.95). These results indicate that co-purified granulocytes, possibly through the release of ROS at time of transfection, can lead to an enhanced repair in lymphocytes that obfuscates any evaluation of inter individual differences in repair as measured by host-cell reactivation. As a result, hetastarch-prepared samples are likely unsuitable for the assessment of DSB repair in primary cells with that type of assay. Granulocyte contamination that exists after a density gradient preparation, although much more limited, could have similar effects, but might be circumvented by freezing cells prior to analysis.",,"['Lacoste, Sandrine', 'Bhatia, Ravi', 'Bhatia, Smita', ""O'Connor, Timothy R""]","['Lacoste S', 'Bhatia R', 'Bhatia S', ""O'Connor TR""]","['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Population Sciences, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI 5P30CA033572-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P50CA107399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140325,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Artifacts', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Superhelical/genetics', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lewis X Antigen/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Transfection']",PMC3965556,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2014/11/13 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0093185 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-51547 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 25;9(3):e93185. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0093185. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (DNA, Superhelical)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Emerging data suggest that baseline quality of life (QOL) and physical function may predict outcomes in oncology, although data in AML are limited. We investigated the association between baseline QOL and physical function with short-term treatment outcomes in adults and elderly AML patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of adults (age 18+) AML patients undergoing IC. Before starting IC, patients completed the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30-item questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue subscale (FACT-Fatigue) in addition to physical function tests (grip strength, timed chair stands, 2-min walk test). Outcomes included 60-day mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and achievement of complete remission (CR). Logistic regression was carried out to evaluate each outcome. RESULTS: Of the 239 patients (median age 57.5 years), 56.7% were male and median Charlson comorbidity score was 0. Sixty-day mortality, ICU admission and CR occurred in 9 (3.7%), 15 (6.3%) and 167 (69.9%) patients, respectively. Using univariate regression, neither QOL nor physical function at presentation was predictive of 60-day mortality (all P > 0.05), whereas ICU admission (P < 0.001) and remission status at 30 days (P = 0.007) were. Fatigue (P = 0.004) and role functioning (P = 0.003) were predictors of ICU admission; QOL and physical function were not. A higher Charlson score predicted ICU admission (P = 0.01) and remission status (P = 0.002). The cytogenetic risk group was associated with achievement of CR (P = 0.02); QOL and physical function were not (all P > 0.05). Findings were similar when patients age 60+ were examined. Relationships between fatigue and role functioning with ICU admission deserve further exploration. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline QOL and physical function tests in this prospective study were not associated with short-term mortality, ICU admission or achievement of CR after the first cycle of chemotherapy.",,"['Timilshina, N', 'Breunis, H', 'Brandwein, J M', 'Minden, M D', 'Gupta, V', ""O'Neill, S"", 'Tomlinson, G A', 'Buckstein, R', 'Li, M', 'Alibhai, S M H']","['Timilshina N', 'Breunis H', 'Brandwein JM', 'Minden MD', 'Gupta V', ""O'Neill S"", 'Tomlinson GA', 'Buckstein R', 'Li M', 'Alibhai SMH']","['Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto.', 'Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation; Department of Public Health Sciences.', 'Hematology/Oncology, Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Center.', 'Department of Psychiatry.', 'Department of Medicine, University Health Network, Toronto; Institute of Health Policy, Management, and Evaluation; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

Additionally, recent reports regarding cardiovascular toxicities of second and third generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors prove that there is still a place for novel therapeutic combinations in CML. We have previously shown that statins are able to modulate activity of chemotherapeutics or antibodies used in oncology. Therefore, we decided to verify that statins are able to potentiate antileukemic activity of imatinib, still a frontline treatment of CML. Lovastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug, synergistically potentiates antileukemic activity of imatinib in cell lines and in primary CD34+ CML cells from patients in different phases of the disease, including patients resistant to imatinib with no detectable mutations. This effect is related to increased intracellular concentration of imatinib in CD34+ CML cells and cell lines measured using uptake of (14)C-labeled imatinib. Lovastatin does not influence influx but significantly inhibits efflux of imatinib mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters: ABCB1 and ABCG2. The addition of cholesterol completely reverses these effects. Statins do not affect expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 genes. The effects are drug-class specific, as observed with other statins. Our results suggest that statins may offer a valuable addition to imatinib in a select group of CML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

However, 40 approximately 50% of the AML patients showed no chromosomal abnormalities, i.e., with normal cytogenetics aka the CN-AML patients. Testing of molecular aberrations such as FLT3 or NPM1 can help to define clinical outcomes in the CN-AML patients but with various successes. Goal of this study was to test the possibility of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene overexpression as an additional molecular biomarker. A total of 103 CN-AML patients, among which 28% had overexpressed WT1, were studied over a period of 38 months. Patient's response to induction chemotherapy as measured by the complete remission (CR) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were measured. Our data suggested that WT1 overexpression correlated negatively with the CR rate, DFS and OS. Consistent with previous reports, CN-AML patients can be divided into three different risk subgroups based on the status of known molecular abnormalities, i.e., the favorable (NPM1(mt)/no FLT3(ITD)), the unfavorable (FLT3(ITD)) and the intermediate risk subgroups. The WT1 overexpression significantly reduced the CR, DFS and OS in both the favorable and unfavorable groups. As the results, patients with normal WT1 gene expression in the favorable risk group showed the best clinical outcomes and all survived with complete remission and disease-free survival over the 37 month study period; in contrast, patients with WT1 overexpression in the unfavorable risk group displayed the worst clinical outcomes. WT1 overexpression by itself is an independent and negative indicator for predicting CR rate, DFS and OS of the CN-AML patients; moreover, it increases the statistical power of predicting the same clinical outcomes when it is combined with the NPM1(mt) or the FLT3(ITD) genotypes that are the good or poor prognostic markers of CN-AML.",,"['Lyu, Xiaodong', 'Xin, Yaping', 'Mi, Ruihua', 'Ding, Jing', 'Wang, Xianwei', 'Hu, Jieying', 'Fan, Ruihua', 'Wei, Xudong', 'Song, Yongping', 'Zhao, Richard Y']","['Lyu X', 'Xin Y', 'Mi R', 'Ding J', 'Wang X', 'Hu J', 'Fan R', 'Wei X', 'Song Y', 'Zhao RY']","['Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China; Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Henan Institute of Hematology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140325,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC3965428,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2015/01/23 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092470 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-51899 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 25;9(3):e92470. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092470. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since its identification, it has attracted only a limited interest, mainly in the sPLA2 biology field, as it is viewed uniquely as a regulator of sPLA2 activities. Recent discoveries outline novel important functions of this gene in cancer biology. Indeed, PLA2R1 gain or loss of function experiments in vitro and in vivo shows that this receptor promotes several tumor suppressive responses including senescence, apoptosis and inhibition of transformation. Supporting a tumor suppressive role of PLA2R1, its expression decreases in numerous cancers, and known oncogenes such as HIF2alpha and c-MYC repress its expression. PLA2R1 promoter methylation, a classical way to repress tumor suppressive gene expression in cancer cells, is observed in leukemia, in kidney and in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, PLA2R1 activates the kinase JAK2 and orients its activity towards a tumor suppressive one. PLA2R1 also promotes accumulation of reactive oxygen species which induce cell death and senescence. This review compiles recent data demonstrating an unexpected tumor suppressive role of PLA2R1 and outlines the future work needed to improve our knowledge of the functions of this gene in cancer.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS: A total of 160 de novo AML cases, both cytogenetically normal and abnormal, were analyzed for the presence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, and the results assessed in conjunction with epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Nucleophosmin protein-1 mutations were found in 7.5%, while FLT3-ITD was present in 12% of these cases. Both of these were lower than expected. The median age at diagnosis of AML was 41 years, and for the FLT3-ITD only cases, median age was 33 years; these ages were younger than expected. CONCLUSION: The lower reported frequencies and younger median age at diagnosis of AML and these specific mutations may be contributed to by a number of factors including effects of race on age of presentation, inclusion of patients diagnosed with de novo AML only, and a generally younger median age of the South African population.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Marshall, R C', 'Tlagadi, A', 'Bronze, M', 'Kana, V', 'Naidoo, S', 'Wiggill, T M', 'Carmona, S C']","['Marshall RC', 'Tlagadi A', 'Bronze M', 'Kana V', 'Naidoo S', 'Wiggill TM', 'Carmona SC']","['National Health Laboratory Services, Johannesburg, South Africa; Department of Molecular Medicine and Haematology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.']",['eng'],"['U2R TW007370/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'U2R TW007373/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'TW007370/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', '5 U2R TW007373/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140325,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation Rate', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'South Africa', 'Survival Analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC4210363,['NIHMS570698'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3-ITD', 'NPM1', 'South Africa', 'frequency']",2014/03/29 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2013/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12204 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2014 Dec;36(6):656-64. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12204.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of CML patients with Ph chromosome positive confirmed by cytogenetic and FISH but classical e13a3(b2a2), e14a2(b3a2)and e1a2 fusion transcripts negative identified by conventional real-time quantification RT-PCR (RQ-PCR). Further RQ-PCR was done with the forward primer and reverse primer designed to detect rare atypical BCR-ABL fusion genes including e14a3 and e19a2 transcripts. Direct sequencing analysis was performed on the PCR products and mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain were detected. The clinical data of patients were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Six CML patients were found to carry t(9;22) abnormality and BCR-ABL rearrangement confirmed by FISH but classical BCR-ABL fusion genes negative detected by RQ-PCR. Further RQ-PCR and sequencing analysis confirmed the fusion of BCR exon 14 and ABL exon 3 in five CML patients (case 1-5) and the fusion of BCR exon 19 and ABL exon 2 in one CML patient (case 6). E255K and I293T IM-resistant mutations were detected in case 1 and 2, respectively. Among five cases with e14a3 transcripts, four were CML-CP, one CML-AP. Four patients were male and one was female. The median age was 48 years. The patient (case 6) with e19a2 transcripts was 40-year-old female with a diagnosis of CML-CP and PLT count was more than 1 000x10(9)/L. Imatinib (IM) therapy was administer in case 1, 2, 3, 4 and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was undergone in case 5 after hydroxyurea (Hu) or interferon failure. Case 1 who had E255K IM resistant mutation, responded poorly to IM but obtained a complete cytogenetic remission (CCyR) after a substitution of dasatinib for IM. Case 2 and 3 achieved CCyR 6 months later after IM treatment and had been maintained well with IM despite I293T mutation in case 2. Case 4 attained CCyR 3 months later after IM treatment but relapsed and died soon. Case 5 was still in CCyR after HSCT. Case 6 with e19a2 transcripts got complete hematologic response after Hu treatment and CCyR was achieved soon after IM therapy. CONCLUSION: Incidence of CML with atypical transcripts is extremely low. They could benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors or HSCT. Rare and atypical BCR- ABL fusion gene subtypes could be missed by conventional RQ-PCR.",,"['Gui, Xiaomin', 'Pan, Jinlan', 'Qiu, Huiying', 'Cen, Jiannong', 'Xue, Yongquan', 'Chen, Suning', 'Shen, Hongjie', 'Yao, Li', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Wu, Yafang', 'Chen, Yan']","['Gui X', 'Pan J', 'Qiu H', 'Cen J', 'Xue Y', 'Chen S', 'Shen H', 'Yao L', 'Zhang J', 'Wu Y', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou 215006, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2014/03/29 06:00,2015/02/20 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.03.007 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2014 Mar;35(3):210-4. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2014.03.007.,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated how deficiencies in P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) affect the pharmacokinetics of atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole and its active metabolite (dehydroaripiprazole) using normal Friend leukemia virus strain B (FVB) mice, BCRP knockout (Bcrp[-/-]) mice, and P-gp and BCRP triple knockout (Mdr1a/1b[-/-]Bcrp[-/-]) mice. 2. While plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole after oral administration were slightly higher in both Bcrp(-/-) and Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice than in normal FVB mice, the difference was not marked. The increase in absolute bioavailability (F) compared with normal mice (approximately 1.3-fold increase) was comparable between Bcrp(-/-) and Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice. This finding suggests that BCRP may be involved in the intestinal absorption of aripiprazole in mice, albeit with minimal contribution to absorption at best. 3. In contrast, the brain-to-plasma concentration ratio (Kp,brain) for aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole after oral administration was significantly higher in Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice than in normal mice, whereas Bcrp(-/-) mice exhibited Kp,brain values similar to those in normal mice. In addition, the Kp,brain values in Mdr1a/1b(-/-)/Bcrp(-/-) mice were not drastically different from those previously reported in Mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice, suggesting that brain penetration of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole can be affected by P-gp, but with little synergistic effect of BCRP.",,"['Nagasaka, Yasuhisa', 'Sano, Tomokazu', 'Oda, Kazuo', 'Kawamura, Akio', 'Usui, Takashi']","['Nagasaka Y', 'Sano T', 'Oda K', 'Kawamura A', 'Usui T']","['Analysis and Pharmacokinetics Research Labs, Astellas Pharma Inc. , Ibaraki , Japan .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140326,England,Xenobiotica,Xenobiotica; the fate of foreign compounds in biological systems,1306665,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/deficiency/*genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/deficiency/*genetics', 'Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antipsychotic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Aripiprazole', 'Biotransformation/genetics', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Quinolones/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aripiprazole', 'P-glycoprotein', 'brain penetration', 'breast cancer resistance protein', 'dehydroaripiprazole', 'knockout mouse', 'mdr1a/1b', 'pharmacokinetics']",2014/03/29 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2014/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/00498254.2014.901585 [doi]'],ppublish,Xenobiotica. 2014 Oct;44(10):926-32. doi: 10.3109/00498254.2014.901585.

A small cell component was present in 6/9 cases. Only four patients achieved a complete remission with first-line therapy and 3/4 relapsed. Four patients are alive with a median follow-up of 31 months, two of them after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and five patients died, two of them of disease. In conclusion, ALCL with leukaemic presentation is very unusual and should be considered as high-risk lymphoma requiring new therapeutic strategies.

These families may suffer from short- and long-term emotional problems. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of supportive psychotherapy on the anxiety of mothers whose children suffer from leukemia. MATERIALS & METHODS: The current research were performed on mothers who had a child with leukemia hospitalized in Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran. They were randomly selected. The research method was a quasi-experimental study with pretest/posttest design. The pretest Kettles' anxiety questionnaire was given to all the mothers and after seven sessions of supportive psychotherapy, the posttest was performed and the grades were compared. RESULTS: Ten mothers finished all seven therapeutic sessions. There was a statistically significant difference between the pretest and posttest mean scores, confirming the mothers' reduced anxiety level. CONCLUSION: Finding effective and newer approaches to improve the well-being of parents with a sick child is an important challenge of today's medical researches.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched our institution's electronic archive of pathology reports from 2001 to 2012. We considered lymphoid neoplasms involving the kidney, bladder, testes and prostate. Patient age at diagnosis, sex, clinical history, and outcome were recorded using the relevant electronic medical records. RESULTS: We identified 25 patients with lymphoid neoplasms of the urogenital tract. 11 cases out of 40 were primary genitourinary lymphomas. Mean age at diagnosis was 61.7 years (range 13-87 years). Among bladder lymphomas cases, a male predominance was noted. As regards the types of lymphoid neoplasms, the following subtypes were observed: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (32%), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (24%), small lymphocytic lymphoma (20%), Malt lymphoma (8%), Burkitt lymphoma (4%), follicular lymphoma (4%); diffuse large B-cell ALK+ (4%) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (4%). RESULTS: Genitourinary tract lymphomas most commonly occurred in the kidney.

Herein we disclose the use of this approach for the discovery of dual FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)-Aurora A inhibitors against cancer. An Aurora hit compound was selected as a starting point, from which 288 virtual molecules were screened. Subsequently, some of these were synthesized and evaluated for their capacity to inhibit FLT3 and Aurora kinase A. To further enhance FLT3 inhibition, structure-activity relationship studies of the lead compound were conducted through a simplification strategy and bioisosteric replacement, followed by the use of computer-guided drug design to prioritize molecules bearing a variety of different terminal groups in terms of favorable binding energy. Selected compounds were then synthesized, and their bioactivity was evaluated. Of these, one novel inhibitor was found to exhibit excellent inhibition of FLT3 and Aurora kinase A and exert a dramatic antiproliferative effect on MOLM-13 and MV4-11 cells, with an IC50 value of 7 nM. Accordingly, it is considered a highly promising candidate for further development.","['(c) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, bortezomib treatment for myeloma is often associated with tumor-lysis syndrome. METHODS: We developed an index called the rapid anemia progression index, which represents the duration and progression of anemia, to evaluate risk factors for tumor-lysis syndrome. We retrospectively reviewed 35 relapsed or refractory myeloma patients treated with bortezomib-containing treatment in our institution. We analyzed various parameters, including albumin, lactase dehydrogenase, beta2-microglobulin and creatinine, similar to the rapid anemia progression index, and evaluated the risk factors for tumor-lysis syndrome associated with bortezomib by the Cairo-Bishop definition. RESULTS: Clinical tumor-lysis syndrome occurred in six patients (17.1%). Tumor-lysis syndrome occurred during the first course of bortezomib-containing treatment among all the patients. The result of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the rapid anemia progression index was 0.759 (P = 0.049). The rapid anemia progression index was more accurate than the index of lactate dehydrogenase, beta2-microglobulin, albumin and creatinine according to the receiver operating characteristic curve. For a cut-off point of -1.12 for the rapid anemia progression index, the sensitivity and specificity were 66.7 and 82.8%, respectively.

Prognosis is related not only to intrinsic characteristics such as cytogenetics and molecular markers, but also the patient's ability to tolerate therapy, and treatment response. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT) has been traditionally indicated for poor-risk disease in first complete remission (CR1) or for treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. 'Poor-risk' disease is now better defined due to genetic subtyping, particularly in chromosomally normal AML. In addition, the presence of comorbid conditions should be included in the decision-making process. Improvements in supportive care and the use of modern conditioning regimens have been associated with improved outcomes, mostly due to a reduction in treatment-related mortality. Therefore, a significant proportion of patients with AML-CR1 can potentially benefit from allo-HCT.

We sequenced all of the genes located in a 32Mb region of 9p by targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) in 96 patients with different cancer types, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, bone malignant fibrous histiocytoma/undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and lung carcinoma. Copy number alterations (CNA), and mutations were studied from the NGS data. We detected a deletion at the CDKN2A locus as being the most frequent genetic alteration in all cancer types. In addition to this locus, NGS also identified other small regions of copy number loss and gain. However, different cancer types did not reveal any statistically significant differences with regard to CNA frequency or type. Of the 191 genes within the target region, two novel recurrent mutations were found in the MELK and PDCD1LG2 genes. The most commonly mutated gene in sarcomas was TLN1 (8%) and PAX5 in ALL (9%). Mutations in PAX5, and RUSC2, were seen exclusively in ALL patients and those in KIAA1432, CA9, TLN1, and MELK only in sarcomas (MFH, FS, EFT). Thus using targeted NGS of the 9p region, in addition to commonly deleted CDKN2A locus, we were able to identify a number of small deletions and gains, as well as novel recurrent mutations in different cancer types.

METHODS: The analysis included patients diagnosed with rectal cancer from 1992 to 2010 and who were registered in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Standardized incidence ratios assessed the location of second primary cancers by the receipt and sequence of radiation therapy. A Cox proportional hazards model examined the predictors for patients who developed second primary cancers. RESULTS: The hazard ratio for developing any type of second primary was 12 % higher in patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy, Hazard Ratio and 95 % confidence interval, HR 95 % CI 1.12 (1.0, 1.2), and 33 % lower for patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy, HR 95 % CI 0.75 (0.7, 0.8), relative to patients who did not receive radiation therapy. The location of the second cancer varied by both the receipt and sequence of radiation therapy. Secondary rectal cancers were reduced 170 % after postoperative radiation and 103 % after preoperative radiation, compared to the non-receipt of radiation therapy. The impact of radiation therapy on secondary colon cancers was not as marked.

In the present study, we found that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling possesses the potential to promote macrophage apoptosis in response to mycobacterial infection. In agreement with other findings, an activation Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was observed in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells upon Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection at a multiple-of-infection of 10, which was accompanied with up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 production. However, the BCG-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 secretion could be significantly reduced when the cells were exposed to a canonical Wnt signaling ligand, Wnt3a. Importantly, the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was able to further promote apoptosis in BCG-infected RAW264.7 cells in part by a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway. Immunoblotting analysis further demonstrated that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling-induced cell apoptosis partly through a caspase-dependent apoptosis mechanism by down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, as well as enhancement of caspase-3 activity in BCG-infected RAW264.7 cells.

Entinostat is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that has been combined with AZA with significant clinical activity in a previous phase I dose finding study. DESIGN: Open label phase II randomized trial comparing AZA 50 mg/m(2)/d given for 10 days +/- entinostat 4 mg/m(2)/d day 3 and day 10. All subtypes of myelodysplasia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes were eligible for the study. The primary objective was the rate of hematologic normalization (HN; complete remission + partial remission + trilineage hematological improvement). RESULTS: One hundred forty-nine patients were analyzed, including 97 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 52 patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In the AZA group, 32% (95% CI, 22% to 44%) experienced HN and 27% (95% CI, 17% to 39%) in the AZA + entinostat group. Both arms exceeded the HN rate of historical control (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9221 trial), but only the AZA group fulfilled the primary objective of the study. Rates of overall hematologic response were 46% and 44%, respectively. Median overall survivals were 18 months for the AZA group and 13 months for the AZA + entinostat group. The combination arm led to less demethylation compared with the monotherapy arm, suggesting pharmacodynamic antagonism. CONCLUSION: Addition of entinostat to AZA did not increase clinical response as defined by the protocol and was associated with pharmacodynamic antagonism. However, the prolonged administration of AZA by itself seems to increase HN rate compared with standard dosing and warrants additional investigation.",,"['Prebet, Thomas', 'Sun, Zhuoxin', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Ketterling, Rhett', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Greenberg, Peter L', 'Herman, James', 'Juckett, Mark', 'Smith, Mitchell R', 'Malick, Lisa', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Czader, Magdalena', 'Litzow, Mark', 'Gabrilove, Janice', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Prebet T', 'Sun Z', 'Figueroa ME', 'Ketterling R', 'Melnick A', 'Greenberg PL', 'Herman J', 'Juckett M', 'Smith MR', 'Malick L', 'Paietta E', 'Czader M', 'Litzow M', 'Gabrilove J', 'Erba HP', 'Gore SD', 'Tallman MS']","['Thomas Prebet, James Herman, Lisa Malick, and Steven D.

Ablation of the c-Kit gene results in hyposensitivity to thermal pain, whereas activation of c-Kit produces hypersensitivity to noxious heat, without altering sensitivity to innocuous mechanical stimuli. In this study, we investigated the role of c-Kit signaling in human pain perception. We hypothesized that subjects treated with Imatinib or Nilotinib, potent inhibitors of tyrosine kinases including c-Kit but also Abl1, PDFGFRalpha, and PDFGFRbeta, that are used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), would experience changes in thermal pain sensitivity. We examined 31 asymptomatic CML patients (14 male and 17 female) receiving Imatinib/Nilotinib treatment and compared them to 39 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (12 male and 27 female). We used cutaneous heat and cold stimulation to test normal and noxious thermal sensitivity, and a grating orientation task to assess tactile acuity. Thermal pain thresholds were significantly increased in the Imatinib/Nilotinib-treated group, whereas innocuous thermal and tactile thresholds were unchanged compared to those in the control group. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the biological effects of c-Kit inhibition are comparable in mice and humans in that c-Kit activity is required to regulate thermal pain sensitivity but does not affect innocuous thermal and mechanical sensation. The effect on experimental heat pain observed in our study is comparable to those of several common analgesics; thus modulation of the c-Kit pathway can be used to specifically modulate noxious heat and cold sensitivity in humans.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Clin A patients (n=61) received two courses of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone)-21 with alemtuzumab (AL, 30 mg) followed by two courses of high-dose chemotherapy. On the basis of donor availability, patients in response received allogeneic (allo) or autologous (auto) stem cell transplantation (SCT). Clin B patients (n=25) received six courses of CHOP-21 and AL (10 mg). Clin A responding patients were 38 of 61 (62%) and received alloSCT (n=23) or autoSCT (n=14); one complete remission (CR) patient was not transplanted. At a median follow-up of 40 months, the 4-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 49, 44 and 65%, respectively. In Clin B study, the response rate was 72%. At a median follow-up of 48 months, the 4-year OS, PFS and DFS rates were 31, 26 and 44%, respectively.

The study was designed to be consistent with the general immunogenicity requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia 6.0 Monograph 01/2008:1321-Feline Leukaemia Vaccine (Inactivated) with the exception that commercial-strength vaccines were assessed. Fifty seronegative cats (8-9 weeks old) were vaccinated subcutaneously on two occasions, three weeks apart, with either placebo (treatment group T01), Versifel FeLV Vaccine (treatment group T02), or Purevax FeLV Vaccine (treatment group T03) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cats were challenged three weeks after the second vaccination with a virulent FeLV isolate (61E strain). Persistent FeLV antigenemia was determined from 3 to 15 weeks postchallenge. Bone marrow samples were tested for the presence of FeLV proviral DNA to determine FeLV latent infection. At week 15 after challenge with the virulent FeLV 61E strain, the Versifel FeLV Vaccine conferred 89.5% protection against FeLV persistent antigenemia and 94.7% protection against FeLV proviral DNA integration in bone marrow cells. In comparison, the Purevax FeLV Vaccine conferred 20% protection against FeLV persistent antigenemia and 35% protection against FeLV proviral DNA integration in bone marrow cells following challenge. The data from this study show that the Versifel FeLV Vaccine was efficacious in preventing both FeLV persistent p27 antigenemia and FeLV proviral DNA integration in bone marrow cells of cats challenged with this particular challenge model under laboratory conditions and provided better protection than Purevax FeLV in this experimental challenge model with highly virulent FeLV.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

All patients received a uniform strategy of pre-transplant therapy, myeloablative conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis.

P2X family receptors (P2XRs) are ATP-gated plasma membrane ion channels with diverse biological functions. Macrophages are important components in the microenvironment of hematopoiesis participating in both physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of P2XRs in macrophages in leukemia has not been established. Here we investigated expression pattern and functions of P2XRs in macrophages from bone marrow (BM) and spleen of Notch1-induced T-ALL mice. Real-time PCR showed that P2XRs except P2X5R were expressed in BM and spleen macrophages. Furthermore, with the development of leukemia, the expression of P2X7R increased in both BM and spleen macrophages whereas expression of P2X1R increased in spleen macrophages. Live cell imaging recoding the Ca(2+) response demonstrated that P2X7R expressed in macrophages was functional. TUNEL and electron microscopy analysis found that apoptotic macrophages were frequently observed in BM and spleen at late stage of leukemia, which was partly contributed by the activation of overexpressed P2X7R. Our results suggested that the intercellular communication mediated by nucleotides might orchestrate in the pathological process of leukemia and could be a potential target for the treatment of leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our laboratory has demonstrated that ATO-induced cytotoxicity in human leukemia (HL-60) cells is mediated by oxidative stress. Pro-oxidants have been known to play a role in free radical-mediated oxidative stress. Vitamin D3, (Vit D3) an active metabolite of vitamin D has been reported to inhibit the growth of number neoplasms such as prostate, breast, colorectal, leukemia, and skin cancers. The goal of the present research was to use (HL-60) cells as an in vitro test model to evaluate whether low doses of Vit D3 potentiate the toxicity of ATO and whether this toxic action is mediated via apoptotic mechanisms. METHOD: HL-60 cells were treated either with a pharmacologic dose of ATO alone and with several low doses of Vit D3. Cell survival was determined by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was measured both by flow cytometry assessment, and DNA laddering assay. RESULTS: MTT assay indicated that Vit D3 co-treatment potentiates ATO toxicity in HL-60 cells in a dose dependent manner. A statistically significant and dose-dependent increase (p <0.05) was recorded in annexin V positive cells (apoptotic cells) with increasing doses of Vit D3 in ATO-treated cells. This finding was confirmed by the result of DNA laddering assay showing clear evidence of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation in vitamin and ATO co-treated cells. CONCLUSION: The present study indicates that Vit D3 potentiates the antitumor effects of ATO. This potentiation is mediated at least in part, through induction of phosphatidylserine externalization and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation. These findings highlight the potential impact of Vit D3 in promoting the pharmacological effect of ATO, suggesting a possible future role of Vit D3/ATO combination therapy in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).",,"['Rogers, Christian S', 'Yedjou, Clement G', 'Sutton, Dwayne J', 'Tchounwou, Paul B']","['Rogers CS', 'Yedjou CG', 'Sutton DJ', 'Tchounwou PB']","['Environmental Toxicology Research Laboratory, NIH-Center for Environmental Health College of Science, Engineering and Technology, Jackson State University, 1400 Lynch Street, Box 18540, Jackson, MS, 39217, USA. paul.b.tchjounwou@jsums.edu.']",['eng'],['G12 MD007581/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20140325,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,PMC3973008,,,,2014/03/26 06:00,2014/03/26 06:01,['2014/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/26 06:01 [medline]']","['2162-3619-3-9 [pii]', '10.1186/2162-3619-3-9 [doi]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2014 Mar 25;3(1):9. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-3-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The excised TMJ tissue underwent formalin fixation and decalcification, and routine hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were generated. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical stains showed a population of monotonous cells in the marrow space expressing CD33, CD43, and myeloperoxidase, confirming the diagnosis of myeloid neoplasm. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry confirmed AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.

We report a case of bilateral endogenous Fusarium solani endophthalmitis in a liver-transplanted patient. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old Danish Caucasian woman who had undergone two liver transplantations, developed endogenous endophthalmitis of her left eye 10 days after the second liver transplantation. Despite continuous therapy, enucleation of her left eye was eventually necessary; at this point funduscopic examination of her right eye disclosed a white inflammatory plaque at the macula consistent with a fungal infection. Microbiological analysis of vitreous fluid from her enucleated left eye revealed Fusarium solani, and light microscopy of her enucleated eye was consistent with Fusarium panophthalmitis with massive ingrowth of the fungi in all areas containing basement membrane collagen. Voriconazole was injected intravitreally in her right eye, and intravenous voriconazole was initiated. No subsequent growth in the inflammatory plaque was observed. She died 6 weeks after the endogenous endophthalmitis was diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of endogenous Fusarium solani endophthalmitis in a liver-transplanted patient.

Autopsy revealed severe demyelinating vacuolar myelopathy in the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, associated with macrophage infiltration, marked axonal loss and some swollen axons. Pathological changes of posterior and lateral columns were observed from the medulla oblongata to lumbar cord. Proximal anterior and posterior roots were preserved. Cerebral white matter was relatively well preserved. There were no vascular lesions or meningeal dissemination of leukemia. Longitudinal extension of cord lesions was extensive, unlike typical cases of subacute combined degeneration (SACD), but distribution of lesions and histological findings were similar to that of SACD. DS patients show heightened sensitivity to MTX because of their genetic background. Risk factors for toxic myelopathy of DS are discussed, including delayed clearance of MTX despite normal renal function, alterations in MTX polyglutamation and enhanced folic acid depletion due to gene dosage effects of chromosome 21. Alteration of folate metabolism and/or vitamin B12 levels through intravenous or intrathecal administration of MTX might exist, although vitamin B12 and other essential nutrients were managed using intravenous hyperalimentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an autopsy case that shows myelopathy mimicking SACD in a DS patient accompanied by B lymphoblastic leukemia.

Consequently, the search for EGFR family inhibitors, a well established target of pharmacological and therapeutic value has been ongoing. Therefore, over the years several small molecules, which compete for ATP in the kinase domain have been synthesised and some of them have proved to be effective in attenuating EGFR mediated proliferation. Thus, there exists in literature a vast amount of experimental data on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive database EGFRIndb that contains details of the small molecular inhibitors of EGFR family. DESCRIPTION: EGFRIndb is a literature curated database of small synthetic molecular inhibitors of EGFR. It consists of 4581 compounds showing in vitro inhibitory activities (IC50, IC80, GI50, GI90, EC50, Ki, Kd and percentage inhibition) either against EGFR or its different isoforms i.e. Erbb2 (v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 2) and Erbb4 (v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 4) or various mutants. For each compound, database provides information on structure, experimentally determined inhibitory activity of compound against kinase as well as various cell lines, properties (physical, elemental and topological) and drug likeness. Additionally, it provides information on irreversible as well as dual inhibitors that have gained importance in recent years due to the emergence of clinical resistance to known drugs. As compound activity against similar kinases is a measure of its selectivity and specificity, the database also provides this information.

Recent clinical trials have shown the tremendous potential of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of autologous T cells engineered to express a CD19-specific CAR targeting B-cell malignancies. Building on this approach, ACT therapies employing allogeneic CAR-expressing cytotoxic cells are now being explored. AREAS COVERED: The basic principles of CAR-ACT are introduced. The potential benefits as well as problems of using allogeneic CAR-modified cells against tumor antigens are discussed. Various approaches to allogeneic CAR therapy are presented, including donor leukocyte infusion, CAR-redirected gammadelta T cells and natural killer cells, strategies to avoid graft-versus-host disease, modulation of lymphocyte migration, and exploitation of graft-versus-host reactivity. EXPERT OPINION: CAR-modified allogeneic cells have the potential to act as universal effector cells, which can be administered to any patient regardless of MHC type.

In addition, expression of P-gp and breakpoint cluster region-abelson 1 (BCR-ABL1), ABCB1 and solute carrier family 22 member 1 (SLC22A1) mRNA were evaluated. The P-gp activity in the wild-type group was found to be higher than that in the mutated group (59.1 vs. 38.3%; P=0.001). Furthermore, the patients who did not achieve major molecular response (MMR) showed a higher rate of efflux mediated by P-gp when compared with individuals who achieved MMR (64.7 vs. 45.7%; P=0.001). All patients without MMR demonstrated effluxes of >60%. In addition, patients without MMR exhibited lower plasma concentrations of IM compared with those with MMR (0.51 vs. 1.42 mug/ml; P=0.001). Higher levels of SLC22A1 mRNA were observed in patients who achieved MMR and complete molecular response (P<0.05). In conclusion, the ABCB1 1236CT/3435CT/2677GT and 1236TT/3435TT/2677TT haplotypes are associated with reduced P-gp activity and MMR in chronic-phase CML patients treated with a standard dose of IM.",,"['Vivona, Douglas', 'Lima, Luciene Terezina', 'Rodrigues, Alice Cristina', 'Bueno, Carolina Tosin', 'Alcantara, Greyce Kelly Steinhorst', 'Barros, Luiza Saldanha Ribeiro', 'DE Moraes Hungria, Vania Tiestsche', 'Chiattone, Carlos Sergio', 'DE Lourdes Lopes Ferrari Chauffaille, Maria', 'Guerra-Shinohara, Elvira Maria']","['Vivona D', 'Lima LT', 'Rodrigues AC', 'Bueno CT', 'Alcantara GK', 'Barros LS', 'DE Moraes Hungria VT', 'Chiattone CS', 'DE Lourdes Lopes Ferrari Chauffaille M', 'Guerra-Shinohara EM']","['Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Biomedical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical, Toxicological and Bromatological Analyses, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto 14040-903, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical, Toxicological and Bromatological Analyses, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto 14040-903, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology and Hemotherapy, Santa Casa Medical School, Sao Paulo 01223-001, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology and Hemotherapy, Santa Casa Medical School, Sao Paulo 01223-001, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Oncology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 04023-900, Brazil.', 'Department of Clinical and Toxicological Analyses, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 05508-900, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140207,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,PMC3961201,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABCB1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib mesylate']",2014/03/25 06:00,2014/03/25 06:01,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2013/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2014.1857 [doi]', 'ol-07-04-1313 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2014 Apr;7(4):1313-1319. doi: 10.3892/ol.2014.1857.

In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), PIM1 was shown to regulate the surface expression of the CXCR4 receptor. Here, we show that PIM (proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus) kinases 1-3 are overexpressed and that the CXCR4 receptor is hyperphosphorylated on Ser339 in CLL compared with normal lymphocytes. Furthermore, CXCR4 phosphorylation correlates with PIM1 protein expression and PIM1 transcript levels in CLL. PIM kinase inhibition with three different PIM kinase inhibitors induced apoptosis in CLL cells independent of the presence of protective stromal cells. In addition, PIM inhibition caused dephosphorylation of the CXCR4 receptor on Ser339, resulting in enhanced ligand-dependent CXCR4 internalization and reduced re-externalization after withdrawal of CXCL12. Furthermore, PIM inhibition in CLL cells blocked CXCR4 functions, such as migration toward CXCL12- or CXCL12-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. In concordance, pretreatment of CLL cells with PIM kinase inhibitors strongly reduced homing of CLL cells toward the bone marrow and the spleen of Rag2(-/-)gammac(-/-) mice in vivo. Interestingly, the knockdown of PIM kinases in CLL cells demonstrated diverging functions, with PIM1 regulating CXCR4 surface expression and PIM2 and PIM3 as important for the survival of CLL cells. Our results show that PIM kinase inhibitors are an effective therapeutic option for CLL, not only by impairing PIM2/3-mediated CLL cell survival, but also by blocking the PIM1/CXCR4-mediated interaction of CLL cells with their protective microenvironment.",,"['Decker, Sarah', 'Finter, Johannes', 'Forde, Aaron James', 'Kissel, Sandra', 'Schwaller, Juerg', 'Mack, Thomas Sebastian', 'Kuhn, Anabel', 'Gray, Nathanael', 'Follo, Marie', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Burger, Meike', 'Zirlik, Katja', 'Pfeifer, Dietmar', 'Miduturu, Chandrasekhar V', 'Eibel, Hermann', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Dierks, Christine']","['Decker S', 'Finter J', 'Forde AJ', 'Kissel S', 'Schwaller J', 'Mack TS', 'Kuhn A', 'Gray N', 'Follo M', 'Jumaa H', 'Burger M', 'Zirlik K', 'Pfeifer D', 'Miduturu CV', 'Eibel H', 'Veelken H', 'Dierks C']","[""Authors' Affiliations: Department of Hematology/Oncology; Centre of Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Centre Freiburg; Faculty of Biology; BIOSS Centre for Biological Signaling Studies, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany; Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland; Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School; Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts; and Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, the Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140321,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nuclear Proteins/deficiency/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2015/01/03 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['1535-7163.MCT-13-0575-T [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0575-T [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2014 May;13(5):1231-45. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0575-T.

Here, we identify CSN4 (subunit 4 of the COP9 signalosome) as a novel binding partner of tescalcin. The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a multiprotein complex that is essential for development in all eukaryotes. This interaction is selective, Ca(2+)-dependent and involves the PCI domain of CSN4 subunit. We then investigated tescalcin and CSN activity in human erythroleukemia HEL and promyelocytic leukemia K562 cells and find that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation, resulting in the upregulation of tescalcin, coincides with reduced deneddylation of cullin-1 (Cul1) and stabilization of p27(Kip1) - molecular events that are associated with CSN activity. The knockdown of tescalcin led to an increase in Cul1 deneddylation, expression of F-box protein Skp2 and the transcription factor c-Jun, whereas the levels of cell cycle regulators p27(Kip1) and p53 decreased. These effects are consistent with the hypothesis that tescalcin might play a role as a negative regulator of CSN activity towards Cul1 in the process of induced cell differentiation.",['(c) 2014.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cells employ other strategies to inactivate their wild type p53 (WTp53), like the overexpression of the p53 negative regulators Mdm2 and Mdm4. As such, AMLs are excellent candidates for therapeutics involving the reactivation of their WTp53 to restrict and destroy cancer cells, and the Mdm2 antagonist nutlin-3 is one such promising agent. Using AML cell lines with WTp53, we identified stable and high levels of p53 in the OCI/AML-2 cell lines. We demonstrate that this nutlin-3 sensitive cell line overexpressed Mdm4 to sequester, stabilise and inhibit p53 in the cytoplasm. We also show that elevated Mdm4 competed with Mdm2-p53 interaction and therefore extended p53 half-life while preventing p53 transcriptional activity. Our results provide biochemical evidence on the dynamics of the p53-Mdm2-Mdm4 interactions in affecting p53 levels and activity, and unlike previously reported findings derived from genetically manipulated systems, AML cells with naturally high levels of Mdm4 remain sensitive to nutlin treatment. KEY POINTS: Endogenously high levels of Mdm4 inhibit and sequester p53 in AML. High levels of Mdm4 do not block function of Mdm2 inhibitors in AML.",,"['Tan, Ban Xiong', 'Khoo, Kian Hoe', 'Lim, Tit Meng', 'Lane, David Philip']","['Tan BX', 'Khoo KH', 'Lim TM', 'Lane DP']","['p53 Laboratory, A-STAR, Singapore.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",PMC4011595,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2015/02/24 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['1559 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.1559 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2014 Feb 28;5(4):933-43. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.1559.,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring the caspase-3 activity. RESULTS: Capsaicin inhibited the proliferation of CCRFCEM cells in a dose-dependent manner. Increased mRNA expressions of caspase gene family members, activated caspase-3 and decreased mRNA and protein expression of BCL-2 gene indicated apoptotic response to capsaicin. Moreover capsaicin treatment suppressed significantly the expression of the key cell signaling pathways of KRAS, AKT, GAB2, PTPN11, BRAF, INPP5D, MAPK7.

Over the last 50 years there have been tremendous scientific advances in understanding the pathogenesis and the mechanisms that control cellular proliferation in ALL. These discoveries led to the development of efficient therapeutic regimens that greatly improved survival of children with ALL. Recently, several genes have been demonstrated to play a key role in tumor suppression and that their deregulation leads to malignant transformation and can affect overall survival. This review summarizes the role of Ikaros (IKZF1) in tumor suppression and regulation of gene expression in leukemia. Deletions and/or mutations of Ikaros have been detected in a large percentage of pediatric and adult ALL and reduced Ikaros function has been associated with poor outcome in ALL. Ikaros function in chromatin remodeling and epigenetic regulation of gene transcription emphasizes the important role of this protein in controlling cellular proliferation.

Its mechanism of action, however, is still poorly understood, in part because of its dual asparaginase and glutaminase activities. Here, we show that L-ASP's glutaminase activity is not always required for the enzyme's anticancer effect. We first used molecular dynamics simulations of the clinically standard Escherichia coli L-ASP to predict what mutated forms could be engineered to retain activity against asparagine but not glutamine. Dynamic mapping of enzyme substrate contacts identified Q59 as a promising mutagenesis target for that purpose. Saturation mutagenesis followed by enzymatic screening identified Q59L as a variant that retains asparaginase activity but shows undetectable glutaminase activity. Unlike wild-type L-ASP, Q59L is inactive against cancer cells that express measurable asparagine synthetase (ASNS). Q59L is potently active, however, against ASNS-negative cells. Those observations indicate that the glutaminase activity of L-ASP is necessary for anticancer activity against ASNS-positive cell types but not ASNS-negative cell types. Because the clinical toxicity of L-ASP is thought to stem from its glutaminase activity, these findings suggest the hypothesis that glutaminase-negative variants of L-ASP would provide larger therapeutic indices than wild-type L-ASP for ASNS-negative cancers.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chan, Wai Kin', 'Lorenzi, Philip L', 'Anishkin, Andriy', 'Purwaha, Preeti', 'Rogers, David M', 'Sukharev, Sergei', 'Rempe, Susan B', 'Weinstein, John N']","['Chan WK', 'Lorenzi PL', 'Anishkin A', 'Purwaha P', 'Rogers DM', 'Sukharev S', 'Rempe SB', 'Weinstein JN']","['Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Center for Computational Proteomics, Huck Institute of Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA;', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;', 'Center for Biological and Materials Sciences, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM; and.', 'Department of Biology, University of Maryland, College Park, MD.', 'Center for Biological and Materials Sciences, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM; and.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA143883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA143883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA083639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140321,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Glutaminase/*chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC4047499,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40142-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-10-535112 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jun 5;123(23):3596-606. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-10-535112.

In particular, tissue-resident CLL cells show prominent activation of both B-cell receptor (BCR) and NF-kappaB pathways. We evaluated the in vivo effects of ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor on tumor cell activation and proliferation in the blood, lymph node, and bone marrow of patients with CLL. Applying validated pathway-specific gene signatures, we detected a rapid and sustained downregulation of BCR and NF-kappaB signaling in CLL cells from both the peripheral blood and tissue compartments during ibrutinib treatment. Ibrutinib reduced phosphorylation of PLCgamma2 and ERK and decreased nuclear protein expression of NF-kappaB p50. Ibrutinib significantly decreased tumor proliferation and expression of surface activation markers CD69 and CD86, independent of prognostic factors such as IGHV mutational status, chromosome 17p deletion, or prior treatment history. Interestingly, stronger inhibition of BCR signaling in lymph node resident CLL cells after one dose of ibrutinib was associated with a higher rate of nodal response at the end of cycle 2. Together, these data validate on-target effects of BTK inhibition in the tissue compartments and demonstrate that ibrutinib effectively inhibits pathways that promote tumor cell activation and proliferation in vivo.

METHODS: Trypan blue exclusion and AnnexinV/PI assays were used to evaluate HL60 cell death under AraC treatment in the presence or absence of 3MA and CQ. Western blotting and immunofluorescence experiments were performed to show the involvement of apoptosis and autophagy protein expressions. Phenotypic characterization of HL60-treated cells was performed by using immunophenotyping. Clonogenic assays were applied to analyse clonal function of HL60-treated cells. RESULTS: We observed that although autophagy inhibition by 3MA, but not CQ, increased the death of HL60 AraC cells after 24 h of treatment, no significant differences between AraC and AraC + 3MA-treated groups were observed by using clonogenic assay. In addition, increased number of immature (CD34(+)/CD38(-)Lin(-/low)) HL60 cells was found in AraC and AraC-3MA groups when compared with control untreated cells. CONCLUSIONS: Although AraC anti-leukaemia effects could be potentiated by 3MA autophagy inhibition after 24 h of exposure, leukaemia cell resistance, the main causes of treatment failure, is also promoted by autophagy initial stage impairment by 3MA, denoting the complex role of autophagy in leukaemia cells' response to chemotherapy.",,"['Palmeira dos Santos, Caroline', 'Pereira, Gustavo J S', 'Barbosa, Christiano M V', 'Jurkiewicz, Aron', 'Smaili, Soraya S', 'Bincoletto, Claudia']","['Palmeira dos Santos C', 'Pereira GJ', 'Barbosa CM', 'Jurkiewicz A', 'Smaili SS', 'Bincoletto C']",,['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antimalarials/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chloroquine/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2014/06/27 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-014-1640-4 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2014 Jun;140(6):909-20. doi: 10.1007/s00432-014-1640-4.,,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5142-23-4 (3-methyladenine)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a case of IgD PCL with a very unusual CD138-/CD19+/CD4+ phenotype Methods: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from a 37 year old patient afflicted by an aggressive plasma cell dyscrasia were examined and analyzed by conventional morphology, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results: Analysis of peripheral blood fulfilled criteria for PCL (more than 20% and more than 2x10e9 cells/L). However, flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry phenotyping revealed that the cells were CD138-/CD38+/CD19+/CD4+/CD56-/CD117- Conclusion: PCL is diagnosed on peripheral blood smear. Immunophenotyping is a tool that can be helpful in diagnosing difficult cases but its atypical findings should not prevent the appropriate PCL diagnosis in clinically and morphologically unquestionable cases.

We analyzed data from the German CML-Study IV, a randomized five-arm treatment optimization study in newly diagnosed BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. Patients randomized to imatinib 400 mg/day (IM400) or imatinib 800 mg/day (IM800) and stratified according to age (>/=65 years vs. <65 years) were compared regarding dose, response, adverse events, rates of progression, and survival. The full 800 mg dose was given after a 6-week run-in period with imatinib 400 mg/day. The dose could then be reduced according to tolerability. A total of 828 patients were randomized to IM400 or IM800. Seven hundred eighty-four patients were evaluable (IM400, 382; IM800, 402). One hundred ten patients (29 %) on IM400 and 83 (21 %) on IM800 were >/=65 years. The median dose per day was lower for patients >/=65 years on IM800, with the highest median dose in the first year (466 mg/day for patients >/=65 years vs. 630 mg/day for patients <65 years). Older patients on IM800 achieved major molecular remission and deep molecular remission as fast as younger patients, in contrast to standard dose imatinib with which older patients achieved remissions much later than younger patients. Grades 3 and 4 adverse events were similar in both age groups. Five-year relative survival for older patients was comparable to that of younger patients. We suggest that the optimal dose for older patients is higher than 400 mg/day.

There were no differences in event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival(PFS), or overall survival (OS) between arms. The estimated rates of PFS on treatment and OS at 42 months were significantly higher in patients with MMR at 6, 12, and 18 months compared with those without MMR.Adverse events were more frequent with high-dose imatinib. Patients with B1 treatment interruption (vs [1) and those able to maintain imatinib C600 mg/day (vs\600 mg/day) in the first year of treatment had faster and higher response rates, but no improvement in EFS or PFS.

We analyzed 103 newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients: 46 adults and 57 children. Pediatric blasts showed a significantly higher expression of Nec-2 (P=0.03), ULBP-1 (P=0.01) and ULBP-3 (P=0.04) compared to adult cells. The differential expression of these ligands between adults and children was confined to B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia with no known molecular alterations. Within molecularly defined subgroups of patients, a high surface expression of NKG2D and DNAM1 ligands was found on BCR-ABL(+) blasts, regardless of patient age. Accordingly, BCR-ABL(+) blasts proved to be significantly more susceptible to natural killer-dependent lysis than B-lineage blasts without molecular aberrations (P=0.03). Cytotoxic tests performed in the presence of neutralizing antibodies indicated a pathway of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell recognition in the setting of the Nec-2/DNAM-1 interaction. These data provide a biological explanation of the different roles played by alloreactive natural killer cells in pediatric versus adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and suggest that new natural killer-based strategies targeting specific subgroups of patients, particularly those BCR-ABL(+), are worth pursuing further.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Torelli, Giovanni F', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Raponi, Sara', 'Pagliara, Daria', 'De Propris, Maria S', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Barberi, Walter', 'Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Santoni, Angela', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Foa, Robin']","['Torelli GF', 'Peragine N', 'Raponi S', 'Pagliara D', 'De Propris MS', 'Vitale A', 'Bertaina A', 'Barberi W', 'Moretta L', 'Basso G', 'Santoni A', 'Guarini A', 'Locatelli F', 'Foa R']","['Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome torelli@bce.uniroma1.it.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Giannina Gaslini Institute, Genova-Quarto.', 'Women and Child Health Department, University of Padova.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140321,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult']",PMC4077088,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2013.101931 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2013.101931 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Jul;99(7):1248-54. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2013.101931.

Given the key role of lipids in cardiovascular diseases, we studied the plasma lipid profile and global cardiovascular risk prior to and during nilotinib therapy in a series of 27 patients in the setting of a prospective single center study. Data from a minimum 1-year follow up showed that nilotinib significantly increased total, low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol within three months. Consequently, the proportion of patients with non-optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased from 48.1% to 88.9% by 12 months, leading to cholesterol-lowering drug intervention in 22.2% of patients. The proportion of patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased from 40.7% to 7.4% by 12 months. In contrast, a significant decrease in triglycerides was observed. Global cardiovascular risk worsened in 11.1% of patients due to diabetes or occlusive arterial events. Whether hypercholesterolemia was the main driver of occlusive arterial events was uncertain: a longer follow up is necessary to ask whether nilotinib-induced hypercholesterolemia increases long-term risk of atherosclerotic diseases. Nevertheless, given key atherogenic properties of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we conclude that when prescribing nilotinib, commitment to detect lipid disorders at baseline and during follow up is mandatory given their frequency, requirement for changes in lifestyle or drug intervention, and potential for long-term cardiovascular complications.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Rea, Delphine', 'Mirault, Tristan', 'Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Gautier, Jean-Francois', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Messas, Emmanuel']","['Rea D', 'Mirault T', 'Cluzeau T', 'Gautier JF', 'Guilhot F', 'Dombret H', 'Messas E']","[""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris delphine.rea@sls.aphp.fr."", 'Service de Medecine Vasculaire and INSERM UMR970, PARCC, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris.', ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris."", ""Service de Diabetologie et d'Endocrinologie, Hopital Lariboisiere, AP-HP, Paris."", ""INSERM Centre d'Investigation Clinique 1402, CHU de Poitiers, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris."", 'Service de Medecine Vasculaire and INSERM UMR970, PARCC, Hopital Europeen Georges Pompidou, AP-HP, Paris.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140321,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Hypercholesterolemia/blood/*chemically induced/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Lipids/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC4077081,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.104075 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.104075 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2014 Jul;99(7):1197-203. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.104075.

Data from four randomized trials (involving 1821 patients) and three registration studies of stage-A disease (involving 1299 patients) were analyzed. Overall survival at 10 years was better for women than men in all trials (27% versus 15%; P=0.0001) and in the registration series (55% versus 43%; P<0.0001). More women than men in the trials were Binet stage A-progressive (26% versus 15%), but gender was an independent predictor of survival in multivariate analysis of clinical variables (P<0.0001). Women responded better to treatment (overall response 83%) than men (71%; P<0.0001), within each stage and age group, although fewer women than men received the full treatment dose (79% versus 85%; P=0.01). Women were more likely than men to experience toxicity (85% versus 78%, P=0.01), particularly gastro-intestinal toxicity (57% versus 42%, P<0.0001). Laboratory markers in the LRF CLL4 trial showed a significantly lower incidence in women than men of unmutated IGHV genes, raised beta-2 microglobulin, CD38 and Zap-70 positivity and TP53 deletions/mutations and/or 11q deletions. We also highlight the higher male:female ratios in randomized trials versus studies of early chronic lymphocytic leukemia and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia in women runs a more benign clinical course than in men. Gender was also an independent predictor of response, suggesting that pharmacokinetic differences between the sexes and a possible effect of estrogens may contribute to the better outcome.

We generated the iPSCs from bovine TSCs via the electroporation of OCT4. The established iPSCs were supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor and bone morphogenetic protein 4 to maintain and stabilize the expression of stemness genes and their pluripotency. Apoptosis signaling was assessed after exposure to mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the active metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Here, we report that iPSCs were more resistant to MEHP-induced apoptosis than were original TSCs. MEHP also repressed the expression of AR and inactivated WNT signaling, and then led to the commitment of cells to apoptosis via the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1. The loss of the frizzed receptor 7 and the gain of p21CIP were responsible for the stimulatory effect of MEHP on AR-mediated apoptosis.

Continued exposure of benzene may eventually lead to damage to the bone marrow, accompanied by pancytopenia, aplastic anemia or leukemia. This paper explores the variations of endogenous metabolites to provide possible clues for the molecular mechanism of benzene-induced hematotoxicity. Liquid chromatography coupled with time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to investigate the variation of endogenous metabolites in bone marrow cells and plasma of male C3H/He mice. The mice were injected subcutaneously with benzene (0, 300, 600 mg/day) once daily for seven days. The body weights, relative organ weights, blood parameters and bone marrow smears were also analyzed. The results indicated that benzene caused disturbances in the metabolism of oxidation of fatty acids and essential amino acids (lysine, phenylalanine and tyrosine) in bone marrow cells. Moreover, fatty acid oxidation was also disturbed in plasma and thus might be a common disturbed metabolic pathway induced by benzene in multiple organs.

Ad.IL3 was further engineered to harbor gene encoding manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) or mannose-binding plant lectin Pinellia pedatisecta agglutinin (PPA), forming Ad.IL3-MnSOD and Ad.IL3-PPA. As compared with Ad.IL3 or Ad.sp-E1A control, Ad.IL3-MnSOD and Ad.IL3-PPA significantly suppressed in vitro proliferation of HL60 and KG-1 cells. Elevated apoptosis was detected in HL60 and KG-1 cells treated with either Ad.IL3-MnSOD or Ad.IL3-PPA. The caspase-9-caspase-7 pathway was determined to be activated by Ad.IL3-MnSOD as well as by Ad.IL3-PPA in HL60 cells. In an HL60/Luc xenograft nonobese diabetic/severe-combined immunodeficiency mice model, Ad.IL3-MnSOD and Ad.IL3-PPA suppressed cancer cell growth as compared with Ad.IL3. A significant difference of cancer cell burden was detected between Ad.IL3 and Ad.IL3-PPA groups at day 9 after treatment. Furthermore, Ad.IL3-MnSOD significantly prolonged mouse survival as compared with Ad.sp-E1A. These findings demonstrated that Ad.IL3-gene could serve as a novel agent for AML therapy.

We hypothesized that the plasma concentration of proHNPs might serve as a specific marker of myelopoietic activity, heralding the onset of normal myelopoiesis before reappearance of neutrophils, in the setting of bone marrow regeneration. To investigate this, plasma levels of proHNPs were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in blood samples collected from patients undergoing allogeneic (n=11) or autologous (n=16) stem cell transplantations (SCTs) and patients receiving chemotherapy for acute leukemia (n=14). To compare proHNPs with previously suggested myeloid markers, myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were also assayed. In all but one patient, chemotherapy led to the complete disappearance of ProHNPs from plasma. It reappeared in plasma on average 6.3 days before reappearance of neutrophils in the allogeneic setting, whereas this was reduced to an average of 2.8 days in the autologous SCT patients who received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

The aim of this work was to investigate how CMKLR1 was internalized and whether its internalization affected cell signaling in vitro. METHODS: Rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, HEK 293 cells, and HeLa cells were used. CMKLR1 internalization was visualized by confocal microscopy imaging or using a FACScan flow cytometer. Six potential phosphorylation sites (Ser337, Ser343, Thr352, Ser344, Ser347, and Ser350) in CMKLR1 were substituted with alanine using site-directed mutagenesis. Heterologous expression of wild type and mutant CMKLR1 allowed for functional characterization of endocytosis, Ca(2+) flux and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. RESULTS: Chemerin and the chemerin-derived nonapeptide (C9) induced dose-dependent loss of cell surface CMKLR1-GFP fusion protein and increased its intracellular accumulation in HEK 293 cells and RBL-2H3 cells stably expressing CMKLR1. Up to 90% of CMKLR1 was internalized after treatment with C9 (1 mumol/L). By using different agents, it was demonstrated that clathrin-independent mechanism was involved in CMKLR1 internalization. Mutations in Ser343 for G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation and in Ser347 for PKC phosphorylation abrogated CMKLR1 internalization. Loss of CMKLR1 internalization partially enhanced the receptor signaling, as shown by increased Ca(2+) flux and a shorter latency to peak level of ERK phosphorylation.

This causes constitutive activation of the kinase resulting in aberrant, proliferative signaling. The function of centrosome proteins in these fusions is not well understood. Among others, kinase centrosome localization and constitutive kinase dimerization are possible consequences of centrosome protein-kinase fusions. To test the relative contributions of localization and dimerization on kinase signaling, we targeted inducibly dimerizable FGFR1 to the centrosome and other subcellular locations and generated a mutant of the FOP-FGFR1 MPN fusion defective in centrosome localization. Expression in mammalian cells followed by western blot analysis revealed a significant decrease in kinase signaling upon loss of FOP-FGFR1 centrosome localization. Kinase dimerization alone resulted in phosphorylation of the FGFR1 signaling target PLCgamma, however levels comparable to FOP-FGFR1 required subcellular targeting in addition to kinase dimerization. Expression of MPN fusion proteins also resulted in centrosome disruption in epithelial cells and transformed patient cells. Primary human MPN cells showed masses of modified tubulin that colocalized with centrin, Smoothened (Smo), IFT88, and Arl13b. This is distinct from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, which are not associated with centrosome-kinase fusions and had normal centrosomes. Our results suggest that effective proliferative MPN signaling requires both subcellular localization and dimerization of MPN kinases, both of which may be provided by centrosome protein fusion partners. Furthermore, centrosome disruption may contribute to the MPN transformation phenotype.",,"['Lee, Joanna Y', 'Hong, Wan-Jen', 'Majeti, Ravindra', 'Stearns, Tim']","['Lee JY', 'Hong WJ', 'Majeti R', 'Stearns T']","['Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America; Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America; Department of Genetics, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM052022/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM52022/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140321,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Order', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Transport', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",PMC3962438,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2014/11/19 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092641 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-52087 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 21;9(3):e92641. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092641. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (CHTOP protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 1)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been postulated that the HSP70 protein can be used as a prognostic indicator of overall patient survival in many types of cancer including leukemia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the concentrations of antiHSP70 antibody and its antigen in the peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as to assess the usefulness of this measurement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 80 patients with AML of intermediate and high cytogenetic risk, scheduled for allogenic stem cell transplantation after initial intensive chemotherapy. Plasma concentrations of antiHSP70 antibodies and HSP70 antigen were measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. The antigen was additionally measured by Western blot analysis. The control group consisted of healthy subjects. RESULTS: Patients with AML had significantly higher antiHSP70 antibody concentrations compared with the control group. The concentration of HSP70 antigen as well as antiHSP70 antibody showed no associations with the type of response after induction chemotherapy. However, patients with higher antigen levels and lower antiHSP70 antibody levels had significantly shorter overall survival.

Myeloid progenitors express the fusion oncogene BCR-ABL, which has uncontrollable activity in malignant cells and prevents the cell apoptosis caused by some antineoplastic agents, such as paclitaxel. Targeting these abnormalities by blocking the tyrosine kinase enzymes of BCR-ABL is a promising approach for chronic myelogenous leukemia therapy. MAIN METHODS: Conventional Liu's staining is an auxiliary technique used in microscopy to enhance the contrast in microscopic images, aiding the observation of cell morphology. The MTT assay, flow cytometry of the sub-G1 analysis and the TUNEL assay were applied to estimate the apoptosis levels. RT-PCR and western blot methods were used to evaluate the key molecules conferring anti-cell-death properties. KEY FINDINGS: The effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1024 were evaluated with regard to the regulation of BCR-ABL expression, inhibition of cell proliferation, and enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in BCR-ABL-expressing K562 cell lines. AG1024 downregulated the expression of BCR-ABL and anti-apoptosis factors, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which were present in K562 cells. Moreover, the combination of AG1024 with paclitaxel inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis within 24h. SIGNIFICANCE: In summary, the present study shows that the combination of AG1024 with paclitaxel inhibited model cancer cell proliferation, suggesting a new use of paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for cancer control.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

One of the most notable examples of a therapeutic enzyme is L-asparaginase, which has been established as an antileukemic protein drug for more than four decades. Up until now, only bacterial enzymes have been used in therapy despite a plethora of undesired side effects mainly attributed to the bacterial origins of these enzymes. Therefore, the replacement of the currently approved bacterial drugs by human homologs aiming at the elimination of adverse effects is of great importance. Recently, we structurally and biochemically characterized the enzyme human L-asparaginase 3 (hASNase3), which possesses L-asparaginase activity and belongs to the N-terminal nucleophile superfamily of enzymes. Inspired by the necessity for the development of a protein drug of human origin, in the present study, we focused on the characterization of another human L-asparaginase, termed hASNase1. This bacterial-type cytoplasmic L-asparaginase resides in the N-terminal subdomain of an overall 573-residue protein previously reported to function as a lysophospholipase. Our kinetic, mutagenesis, structural modeling, and fluorescence labeling data highlight allosteric features of hASNase1 that are similar to those of its Escherichia coli homolog, EcASNase1. Differential scanning fluorometry and urea denaturation experiments demonstrate the impact of particular mutations on the structural and functional integrity of the L-asparaginase domain and provide a direct comparison of sites critical for the conformational stability of the human and E. coli enzymes.",,"['Karamitros, Christos S', 'Konrad, Manfred']","['Karamitros CS', 'Konrad M']","['From the Enzyme Biochemistry Group, Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen D-37077, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140322,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Allosteric Regulation/physiology', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Asparagine/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology/genetics', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysophospholipase/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Models, Molecular', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Structural Homology, Protein']",PMC4036312,,['NOTNLM'],"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Allostery', 'Conformational Stability', 'Differential Scanning Fluorometry', 'Enzyme Mutation', 'Enzyme Purification', 'Fluorescence', 'Human Lysophospholipase', 'Leukemia', 'l-Asparaginases']",2014/03/25 06:00,2014/06/28 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/28 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)38784-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.545038 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 May 9;289(19):12962-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.545038.

Rearrangements of the genes encoding two nucleoporins, NUP98 and NUP214, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia. NUP98 rearrangements result in fusion of an N-terminal portion of NUP98 to one of numerous proteins. These rearrangements often follow treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and tend to occur in younger patients. They have been shown to induce leukemia in mice and to enhance proliferation and disrupt differentiation in primary human hematopoietic precursors. NUP214 has only a few fusion partners. DEK-NUP214 is the most common NUP214 fusion in AML; it tends to occur in younger patients and is usually associated with FLT3 internal tandem duplications. The leukemogenic activity of NUP214 fusions is less well characterized.

In this study, compounds A and B, two iminosugar analogs synthesized previously, showed an inhibition of the growth of K562 cells. They allowed cell cycle arrested at the G0/G1 phase, promoted apoptotic activities and also lowered the mitochondrial membrane potential. Further exploration of the apoptosis mechanism revealed that compound B significantly suppressed the expression of Hsp70, which is a major anti-apoptotic molecular chaperone. Significant decrease was also found in the expression of Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase with anti-apoptosis activities also known as protein kinase B (PKB). At mitochondria level in comparison with compound A, compound B brought a better promotion in the expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bad in Bcl-2 family. As a result of the promotion, the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL was down-regulated. Cytochrome c was released, activating the intrinsic signaling pathways of caspase and resulting in the occurrence of cascade reaction. In addition, compound B stimulated autophagy effectively by up-regulating Beclin 1, thus causing the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II through Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In summary, these results indicated that compounds A and B induced cell death through multiple pathways.

In this paper, a new kind of lipid coated upconverting nanoparticles consisiting of upconerting nanocrystal core and targeted lipid polymer shell was first reported for NIR triggered photodynamic therapy and cell imaging simultaneously. The lipid coated upconverting nanoparticles offers advantages to overcome the problem mentioned above. The UCN core works as a transducer to convert deeply penetrating near-infrared light to visible lights for activating photosensitizer and cell fluorescence imaging simultaneously. The amphiphilic lipid polymer RGD peptide conjugated poly (maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) grafted dioleoyl l-alpha-phosphatidylethanolamine (RGD-PMAO-DOPE) acts as a shield. It can protect the system from catching by RES and target the whole system to the lesions. The experiment results show that the lipid coated upconverting nanoparticle is individual nanosphere with an average size of 20 nm. The drug loading can reach 9%. After NIR exposed, the MC540 was activated to produce singlet oxygen (ROS) successfully by the upconverting fluorescence emitted from UCN. Importantly, compared with nanoparticle without RGD decoration, the lipid coated upconverting nanoparticle can co-deliver the MC540 and UCNs into the same cell with higher efficiency. Besides, the MC540 loaded UCN/RGD-PMAO-DOPE nanoparticles showed significant inhibitory effect on tumor cells after NIR shining.

The cosmetics industry has developed efficient products that can be used on healthy hair or act on concomitant diseases of the hair and scalp. Dyes embellish the hair by bleaching or coloring it briefly, for temporary periods of longer duration, or permanently, depending on the composition of a dye (oxidative or nonoxidative) and its degree of penetration of the hair shaft.

Our goal was to identify the risk factors for underdosing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated for AML treated with PSZ, during a 2-year period. Assays<500ng/mL were considered as under dosed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine assays (43 patients) were performed during induction (n=22) or consolidation (n=37) chemotherapy. PSZ treatment was initiated within a median of 3 days before neutropenia with a first assay performed at 8 days (3-28). The median PSZ blood plasma concentration was 375ng/mL (<200-1900). Forty-one (69%) treatment were maintained until the end of neutropenia. One patient presented with candidemia, 9 with possible invasive aspergillosis, without any significant association with underdosing. The univariate analysis showed that co-administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (P=0.01) and cause of hospitalization (induction chemotherapy vs consolidation, P=0.008) were associated with underdosing, contrary to feeding difficulties (P=0.07) and digestive disorders (P=0.5). The multivariate analysis confirmed the impact of PPI use (P=0.01) and the cause of hospitalization (P=0.003). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the major impact of PPI administration on PSZ blood plasma levels and stresses the risk of non-effective prophylaxis during induction treatment of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In the present work hypomethylation of the DDX43 gene was detected in 15% (32/214) of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP). The level of DDX43 expression was correlated with DDX43 hypomethylation (R=0.277, P=0.014). Moreover, bisulfite sequencing confirmed the significant correlation between the methylation density and the level of DDX43 hypomethylation. Additionally, restoration of DDX43 expression in the K562 cell line by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment confirmed a direct contribution of methylation in regulating the DDX43 gene. DDX43 hypomethylation was observed more frequently in favorable group (21.4%) and intermediate group (15.8%) than in poor group (0%) (P=0.009). AML patients with DDX43 hypomethylation had a better overall survival (median not obtained) than those with DDX43 methylation (median 8 months, 95% confidence interval 5.6-10.4 months) (P=0.014).

DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 70 eyes of 67 patients. INTERVENTION: Ophthalmic artery chemotherapy infusion under fluoroscopic guidance was performed using melphalan (3, 5, or 7.5 mg) in every case, with additional topotecan (1 mg) and/or carboplatin (30 or 50 mg) as necessary. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Tumor control and treatment complications. RESULTS: The mean patient age at IAC was 30 months. The treatment was primary in 36 eyes and secondary in 34 eyes. Those primary therapy eyes were classified according to the International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) as group A (n = 0), B (n = 1), C (n = 4), D (n = 17), or E (n = 14). The secondary therapy eyes had failed previous intravenous chemotherapy (n = 34) in every case. Each eye received a mean of 3 IAC sessions per eye (median, 3; range, 1-7 sessions). After IAC with a mean follow-up of 19 months, globe salvage was achieved in 72% of primary-treated cases and in 62% of secondary-treated cases. Specifically, primary therapy achieved globe salvage for group B (100%), group C (100%), group D (94%), and group E (36%). Of all 70 eyes, complete regression was achieved for solid tumor in 48 of 51 eyes (94%), subretinal seeds in 40 of 42 eyes (95%), and vitreous seeds in 34 of 39 eyes (87%). After each catheterization (n = 198), the main complications included transient eyelid edema (5%), blepharoptosis (5%), and forehead hyperemia (2%). More lasting complications included vitreous hemorrhage (2%), branch retinal artery obstruction (1%), ophthalmic artery spasm with reperfusion (2%), ophthalmic artery obstruction (2%), partial choroidal ischemia (2%), and optic neuropathy (<1%). Over the past 3 years, the combined incidence of ophthalmic, retinal, and choroidal vascular ischemia was reduced to 1%. There was no patient with stroke, seizure, neurologic impairment, limb ischemia, secondary leukemia, metastasis, or death. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year experience with IAC indicates that this technique is remarkably effective for the management of retinoblastoma as both a primary and a secondary treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The algorithm also provides for the incidence process to be marked with the values of subject level covariates, facilitating calculation of the distribution of these variables in prevalent cases. METHODS: Disease incidence is modelled as a marked stochastic process and simulations are made from this process. For each simulated incident case, the probability of remaining in the prevalent sub-population is calculated from bootstrapped survival curves. This algorithm is used to determine the distribution of prevalence estimates and of the ancillary data associated with the marks of the incidence process. This is then used to determine prevalence estimates and estimates of the precision of these estimates, together with estimates of the distribution of ancillary variables in the prevalent sub-population. This technique is illustrated by determining the prevalence of acute myeloid leukaemia from data held in the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN). In addition, the precision of these estimates is determined and the age distribution of prevalent cases diagnosed within twenty years of the prevalence index date is calculated. CONCLUSION: Determining prevalence estimates by using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques provides a means of calculation more flexible that traditional techniques. In addition to automatically providing precision estimates for the prevalence estimates, the distribution of any measured subject level variables can be calculated for the prevalent sub-population. Temporal changes in incidence and in survival offer no difficulties for the method.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The Task Force systematically analyzed more than 270 studies, with an emphasis on those published in the interval since the original 2007 Position Statements. Important developments over this period included prospective cohort studies demonstrating that DXA measures of areal bone mineral density (aBMD) predicted incident fractures and the development of robust reference data and strategies to adjust for bone size in children with growth impairment. In this report, we summarize the current literature on the relationship between DXA-based aBMD and both fracture (vertebral and non-vertebral) outcomes and non-fracture risk factors (e.g., disease characteristics, ambulatory status, and glucocorticoid exposure) in children with chronic illnesses. Most publications described the aBMD profile of children with underlying diseases, as well as the cross-sectional or longitudinal relationship between aBMD and clinically relevant non-fracture outcomes. Studies that addressed the relationship between aBMD and prevalent or incident fractures in children with chronic illnesses are now emerging. In view of these updated data, this report provides guidelines for the use of DXA-based aBMD in this setting. The initial recommendation that DXA is part of a comprehensive skeletal healthy assessment in patients with increased risk of fracture is unchanged. Although the prior guidelines recommended DXA assessment in children with chronic diseases at the time of clinical presentation with ongoing monitoring, this revised Position Statement focuses on the performance of DXA when the patient may benefit from interventions to decrease their elevated risk of a clinically significant fracture and when the DXA results will influence that management.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The International Society for Clinical Densitometry.

OBJECTIVE: Based on findings among patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), this study explored symptoms, neuroendocrine markers, and autonomic cardiovascular responses associated with CFS in childhood cancer survivors. METHODS: Long-term survivors of childhood lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia reporting CF were compared with survivors without CF. Data included patient-reported outcomes, clinical examination, head-up tilt test, and neuroendocrine markers in the blood and the urine. RESULTS: Of 102 included survivors, 15 were excluded from comparative analyses because of significant co-morbidity or pregnancy. Of the remaining 87 participants (median age 33.0 years, follow-up time 25.2 years), 35 had CF and 52 did not have CF. Compared with non-CF controls, CF cases reported a significantly (P < 0.01) higher frequency of symptoms typical of the CFS (muscle or joint pain or both and feeling confused/disoriented) and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction (palpitations, feeling intermittently heat and cold, and watery diarrhea). CF cases and controls did not differ regarding autonomic cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress, but the CF group had lower levels of plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (P = 0.002) and higher levels of urine norepinephrine (P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors with CF reported a high symptom-burden compared with controls. There were few differences between both the groups regarding biomarkers, but slight alterations of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous activity were detected. CF in cancer survivors has features in common with the CFS, but further efforts are required to clarify the pathophysiology.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine.

We evaluated prognostic and predictive significance of smudge cell percentage on a blood smear in CLL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We calculated smudge cell percentages (ratio of smudged to intact cells plus smudged lymphocytes) on archived blood smears of 222 untreated CLL patients registered at Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi over the past 12 years. RESULTS: The male:female ratio was 3:1, and median age 60 (range, 28-90) years. Median absolute lymphocyte count was 42 x 10(9)/L. The median smudge cell percentage was 29.6% (range, 4%-79%). We found no correlation of proportion of smudge cells with age, sex, lymphocyte count, organomegaly, or response to therapy, although there was a significant correlation with the Rai stage at diagnosis. Median smudge cell percentage in stage 0 and I was 33% (range, 12%-79%), in stage II 31% (range, 12%-61%), and stage III and IV 21% (range, 4%-51%) (P < .001). Patients with </= 30% smudge cells had a shorter median progression-free period (PFP) of 30 months compared with patients who had more than 30% smudge cells (PFP, 45 months; P = .01). The 5-year survival rate was 51% for patients with 30% or fewer smudge cells, and it was 81% for patients with more than 30% smudge cells (P < .001) at a median follow-up of 3.5 years.

The pathophysiology involves cytogenetic changes with or without gene mutations and widespread gene hypermethylation at advanced stages. Clinical manifestations result from cytopenias (anaemia, infection, and bleeding). Diagnosis is based on examination of blood and bone marrow showing blood cytopenias and hypercellular marrow with dysplasia, with or without excess of blasts. Prognosis depends largely on the marrow blast percentage, number and extent of cytopenias, and cytogenetic abnormalities.

In the multivariable random-effects model, variables significantly associated with TLPs were age <1year (odds ratio (OR) 3.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06-5.81) or age 10years (OR 2.00, CI 1.66-2.40); body mass index percentile 95 (OR 1.44, CI 1.19-1.75); platelet count <100x10(3)/muL (OR 1.49, CI 1.08-20.7); fewer days since previous LP (OR 5.13, CI 2.34-11.25 for 16days versus 0-3days); and a preceding TLP (OR 1.43, CI 1.19-1.73). In the fixed-effects model, image-guidance reduced the odds of TLP (OR 0.55, CI 0.32-0.95). The 5-year EFS (+/-SE) for children with TLP+ (77+/-8%) was significantly lower than for children with CNS1 status (93+/-2%; p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of TLP remains high. Consistent with previous studies, a TLP+ at diagnosis was associated with a poorer EFS. These risk factors can allow identifying interventions to reduce TLPs and directing interventions to those at highest risk.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Targeting regulators of apoptosis is thus considered a promising approach to sensitizing melanomas to treatment. The development of small-molecule inhibitors that mimic natural antagonists of either antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2 family or the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), known as BH3- or SMAC-mimetics, respectively, are helping us to understand the mechanisms behind apoptotic resistance. Studies using BH3-mimetics indicate that the antiapoptotic BCL-2 protein MCL-1 and its antagonist NOXA are particularly important regulators of BCL-2 family signaling, while SMAC-mimetic studies show that both XIAP and the cIAPs must be targeted to effectively induce apoptosis of cancer cells. Although most solid tumors, including melanoma, are insensitive to these mimetic drugs as single agents, combinations with other therapeutics have yielded promising results, and tests combining them with BRAF-inhibitors, which have already revolutionized melanoma treatment, are a clear priority.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Although dogs are the main reservoir for this disease, a role played by dogs in this outbreak has been ruled out and investigators are now considering other hosts (eg. cats, rabbits, hares) as possible alternative reservoirs.This study was designed to examine the Leishmania infantum status of stray cats in Madrid to assess its possible implications in the human leishmaniosis outbreak. METHODS: 346 captured stray cats were tested for antibodies against L. infantum by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) and nested-PCR methods were used to detect Leishmania DNA in blood samples of cats testing seropositive for L. infantum and/or retroviruses infection. Cats were also tested for Toxoplasma gondii using the direct agglutination test (DAT) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies (PetChek* FIV/FeLV). The presence of intestinal parasites was determined using a routine coprological method. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of L. infantum infection (cut off >/= 1/100) was 3.2% (11/346). However, it was not possible to amplify Leishmania DNA in any of the blood samples. Seropositivity was not associated with sex, age, capture site, clinical status, retrovirus infection or T. gondii seropositivity. Of the 11 cats seropositive for L. infantum, 3 also tested positive for FIV, none for FeLV and 6 for T. gondii. It should be mentioned that the prevalence of FeLV p27 antigen was 4% and of FIV antibody was 9.2%. Although the seroprevalence of T. gondii was quite high at 53.5%, no T. gondii oocysts were found in any of the faeces samples analysed (n = 287). In contrast, intestinal parasites were detected in 76 (26.5%) samples, Toxocara cati being the most prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a stable L. infantum infection situation among the stray cats of the Madrid area; the disease is uncommon and no clinical cases have been reported to date. The detection of other zoonotic parasites such as T. gondii and T. cati in stray cats indicates a need to adopt strict control measures in this population.",,"['Miro, Guadalupe', 'Ruperez, Cristina', 'Checa, Rocio', 'Galvez, Rosa', 'Hernandez, Leticia', 'Garcia, Manuel', 'Canorea, Isabel', 'Marino, Valentina', 'Montoya, Ana']","['Miro G', 'Ruperez C', 'Checa R', 'Galvez R', 'Hernandez L', 'Garcia M', 'Canorea I', 'Marino V', 'Montoya A']","['Departamento de Sanidad Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid. gmiro@ucm.es.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140324,England,Parasit Vectors,Parasites & vectors,101462774,IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/epidemiology/*parasitology', 'Cats', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leishmania infantum', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Spain']",PMC3994395,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['1756-3305-7-112 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-3305-7-112 [doi]']",epublish,Parasit Vectors. 2014 Mar 24;7:112. doi: 10.1186/1756-3305-7-112.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highest prevalence in AML is noted with (8; 21) translocation; which represents 12 to 15% of all AML cases. Interestingly, all the breakpoints mapped to date in t(8;21) are clustered in intron 5 of the RUNX1 gene and intron 1 of the ETO gene. No homologous sequences have been found at the recombination regions; but DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) have been mapped to the areas of the genes involved in t(8;21). Presence of DHS sites is commonly associated with regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers and silencers, among others. RESULTS: In this study we used a combination of comparative genomics, cloning and transfection assays to evaluate potential regulatory elements located in intron 5 of the RUNX1 gene. Our genomic analysis identified nine conserved non-coding sequences that are evolutionarily conserved among rat, mouse and human. We cloned two of these regions in pGL-3 Promoter plasmid in order to analyze their transcriptional regulatory activity. Our results demonstrate that the identified regions can indeed regulate transcription of a reporter gene in a distance and position independent manner; moreover, their transcriptional effect is cell type specific. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified nine conserved non coding sequence that are harbored in intron 5 of the RUNX1 gene. We have also demonstrated that two of these regions can regulate transcriptional activity in vitro. Taken together our results suggest that intron 5 of the RUNX1 gene contains multiple potential cis-regulatory elements.",,"['Rebolledo-Jaramillo, Boris', 'Alarcon, Ricardo A', 'Fernandez, Valentina I', 'Gutierrez, Soraya E']","['Rebolledo-Jaramillo B', 'Alarcon RA', 'Fernandez VI', 'Gutierrez SE']","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile. sgutierr@udec.cl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140324,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/chemistry/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC3984029,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2014/12/18 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2013/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2164-15-225 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-15-225 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2014 Mar 24;15:225. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-15-225.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: An observational study. SETTING: S. Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy. POPULATION: A cohort of 135 female survivors. METHODS: A clinical, hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluation. Thirty-three patients (24%) had non-malignant haematologic diseases (thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia), 68 (50%) had leukaemia, 23 (17%) had lymphomas, and 11 (8%) had solid tumours. In total, 106 patients had received SCT, preceded by a conditioning regimen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and Inhibin-B, and uterine volume. RESULTS: The median concentrations of AMH and Inhibin-B in the entire cohort were 0.12 ng/ml (interquartile range, IQR, 0.1-0.5 ng/ml) and 3.5 pg/ml (IQR 0.1-13.2 pg/ml), respectively. In a stepwise ordered logistic regression analysis, conventional chemotherapy for the treatment of malignancies, as opposed to total body irradiation (TBI), was the only oncologically significant predictor of increased AMH levels (OR 4.8, 95% CI 1.9-12, P < 0.001). Conditioning treatment before or after menarche did not influence AMH concentrations (P = 0.24). The best predictor of reduced uterine volume was TBI during the preparation for the allograft (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-8.4, P = 0.006). Increasing age at treatment (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77-0.95, P = 0.04), chemotherapy, as opposed to other treatments (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.03-0.28, P < 0.001), and solid tumours as opposed to either leukaemia/lymphomas or non-malignant diseases (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.07-0.56, P = 0.002) were associated with larger uterine volumes.

As biomarkers might elucidate the pathogen, we analysed the performance of an Aspergillus PCR assay in blood for diagnosis of IA in immunocompromised paediatric patients with suspected infections. Ninety-five haemato-oncological paediatric patients were included over a period of 3 years, the underlying diseases consisting of acute leukaemia, solid tumours, non-malignant immunocompromising disorders and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. We retrospectively analysed 253 consecutive episodes of suspected infections. Thirty-eight patients had possible IA, none of the patients fulfilled EORTC/MSG criteria of probable/proven IA. PCR positivity was observed in 97/967 analyses. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the PCR per episode were 34%, 78%, 31% and 81% using possible IA as endpoint. Taken together, an undirected blood screening by Aspergillus-specific PCR is of little diagnostic value in a heterogenous paediatric patient cohort.

Immunophenotyping is an important tool in the classification of TCL in people, and can be equally useful in dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that loss of expression of the CD45 antigen is a specific diagnostic feature of TZL. ANIMALS: Twenty dogs with concurrent histology and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry were studied in depth. An additional 494 dogs diagnosed by immunophenotyping were used to characterize the population of dogs with this disease. METHODS: Lymph node biopsies from 35 dogs with TCL were classified by 2 pathologists using WHO criteria. Twenty lymph nodes were from dogs with CD45- TCL and 15 were from CD45+ TCL. The pathologists were blinded to the flow cytometry findings. Outcome information was sought for the 20 dogs with CD45- lymphoma, and population characteristics of the additional 494 dogs were described. RESULTS: All 20 CD45- cases were classified as TZL. The 15 CD45+ cases were classified as aggressive TCL and are described in an accompanying paper. TZL cases had a median survival of 637 days. Examination of 494 additional dogs diagnosed with TZL by immunophenotyping demonstrated that 40% of cases are in Golden Retrievers, are diagnosed at a median age of 10 years, and the majority have lymphadenopathy and lymphocytosis.

A subset of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can, upon binding another molecule, fold to a well-defined three-dimensional structure. In the structurally heterogeneous, unbound ensemble of these IDPs, conformations are likely to exist that, in part, resemble the final bound form. It has been suggested that these conformations, displaying 'residual structure', could be important for the mechanism of such coupled folding and binding reactions. PUMA, of the BCL-2 family, is an IDP in isolation but will form a single, contiguous alpha-helix upon binding the folded protein MCL-1. Using the helix-breaking residue proline, we systematically target each potential turn of helix of unbound PUMA and assess the binding to MCL-1 using time-resolved stopped-flow techniques. All proline-containing mutants bound, and although binding was weaker than the wild-type protein, association rate constants were largely unaffected. We conclude that population of particular residual structure, containing a specific helical turn, is neither required for the binding nor for fast association of PUMA and MCL-1.",,"['Rogers, Joseph M', 'Wong, Chi T', 'Clarke, Jane']","['Rogers JM', 'Wong CT', 'Clarke J']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge , Lensfield Road, Cambridge, CB2 1EW, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['095195/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT095195MA/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140331,United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,IM,"['Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*chemistry', 'Binding Sites', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Folding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*chemistry']",PMC4017604,,,,2014/03/25 06:00,2015/04/22 06:00,['2014/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja4125065 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2014 Apr 9;136(14):5197-200. doi: 10.1021/ja4125065.

Cancer incident new cases and cancer deaths were estimated. METHODS: There were 219 cancer registries submitted cancer incidence and death data in 2010. All data were checked and evaluated on basis of the criteria of data quality from NCCR. Total 145 registries' data were qualified and accepted for cancer statistics in 2010. Pooled data were stratified by urban/rural, area, sex, age group and cancer site. Cancer incident cases and deaths were estimated using age-specific rates and national population. The top ten common cancers in different groups, proportion and cumulative rate were also calculated. Chinese census in 2000 and Segi's population were used for age-standardized incidence/mortality rates. RESULTS: All 145 cancer registries (63 in urban and 82 in rural) covered a total of 158,403,248 population (92,433,739 in urban and 65,969,509 in rural areas). The estimates of new cancer incident cases and cancer deaths were 3,093,039 and 1,956,622 in 2010, respectively. The morphology verified cases (MV%) accounted for 67.11% and 2.99% of incident cases were identified through death certifications only (DCO%) with mortality to incidence ratio (M/I) of 0.61. The crude incidence rate was 235.23/100,000 (268.65/100,000 in males, 200.21/100,000 in females), age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC, 2000) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 184.58/100,000 and 181.49/100,000 with the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) of 21.11%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC were 256.41/100,000 and 187.53/100,000 in urban areas whereas in rural areas, they were 213.71/100,000 and 181.10/100,000, respectively. The crude cancer mortality in China was 148.81/100,000 (186.37/100,000 in males and 109.42/100,000 in females), age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC, 2000) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 113.92/100,000 and 112.86/100,000, and the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) was 12.78%. The cancer mortality and ASMRC were 156.14/100,000 and 109.21/100,000 in urban areas, whereas in rural areas, they were 141.35/100,000 and 119.00/100,000 respectively. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreas cancer, encephaloma, lymphoma, female breast cancer and cervical cancer, were the most common cancers, accounting for 75% of all cancer cases in urban and rural areas. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephaloma, leukemia and lymphoma accounted for 80% of all cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The coverage of cancer registration population had a rapid increase and could reflect cancer burden in each area and population. As the basis of cancer control program, cancer registry plays an irreplaceable role in cancer epidemic surveillance, evaluation of cancer control programs and making anti-cancer strategy.

Increase in size of gingiva is known as gingival hyperplasia or gingival enlargement. Gingival swelling is almost universally the result of Fluid accumulation within the tissues. Enlargement and even aesthetically disfiguring over growth of the gingival tissue, is also a common finding of leukemia, scurvy and subjects undergoing the hormonal changes of puberty, pregnancy, menopause and drugs. MATERIALS & METHODS: A sample size of 1500 was taken. All children who were between the chronological age of 5-12 years from selected schools were included in the study.Three age groups were selected for the study, Group I: 5-7yrs, Group II: 7-9 yrs, Group III 9-12yrs. Each group comprised of 500 students. The examination of gingival enlargement was made according to Gingival Enlargement Index. The oral hygiene status of the child was examined using Oral Hygiene Index-Simplified. RESULTS: The prevalence of Gingival Enlargement increased with the increase of age. Though the Prevalence of GE in female children (15.1%) was more than male children (13.4%), it was not statistically significant. Female children (1.6%) had a higher prevalence of epilepsy than male children (0.29%) in this present study. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of gingival enlargement was predominantly inflammatory, showing that the oral hygiene status of the oral Children in Karnataka was far from satisfactory.

TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 were mutated in 11.5%, 10.0%, and 18.4% of patients, respectively. NOTCH1(mut) and SF3B1(mut) virtually showed mutual exclusivity (0.6% concurrence), but TP53(mut) was frequently found in NOTCH1(mut) (16.1%) and in SF3B1(mut) (14.0%) patients. There were few significant associations with clinical and laboratory characteristics, but genetic markers had a strong influence on response and survival. In multivariable analyses, an independent prognostic impact was found for FCR, thymidine kinase (TK) >/=10 U/L, unmutated IGHV, 11q deletion, 17p deletion, TP53(mut), and SF3B1(mut) on progression-free survival; and for FCR, age >/=65 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >/=1, beta2-microglobulin >/=3.5 mg/L, TK >/=10 U/L, unmutated IGHV, 17p deletion, and TP53(mut) on overall survival. Notably, predictive marker analysis identified an interaction of NOTCH1 mutational status and treatment in that rituximab failed to improve response and survival in patients with NOTCH1(mut). In conclusion, TP53 and SF3B1 mutations appear among the strongest prognostic markers in CLL patients receiving current-standard first-line therapy. NOTCH1(mut) was identified as a predictive marker for decreased benefit from the addition of rituximab to FC.

Although hematopoietic cell transplantation can be curative, additional therapies are needed for a disease that disproportionally afflicts the elderly. We tested the ability of a CD16xCD33 BiKE to induce natural killer (NK) cell function in 67 MDS patients. Compared with age-matched normal controls, CD7(+) lymphocytes, NK cells, and CD16 expression were markedly decreased in MDS patients. Despite this, reverse antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays showed potent degranulation and cytokine production when resting MDS-NK cells were triggered with an agonistic CD16 monoclonal antibody. Blood and marrow MDS-NK cells treated with bispecific killer cell engager (BiKE) significantly enhanced degranulation and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma production against HL-60 and endogenous CD33(+) MDS targets. MDS patients had a significantly increased proportion of immunosuppressive CD33(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that negatively correlated with MDS lymphocyte populations and CD16 loss on NK cells.

However, the cytological analysis is not always obvious and requires trained and competent cytologist. In this context, the alarms and/or parameters generated by hematology analyzer could be particularly informative to alert the operators. METHODS: Blood samples from patients with Sezary syndrome (n = 9) were studied with Sysmex XN-1000 analyzer, and compared to patients with benign or tumoral skin lesions (n = 47) and patients with chronic lymphoproliferative B-cell diseases (n = 51) used as control. RESULTS: In present series, the value of structural lymphoid parameters (LyX and LyZ) and the alarm Blast/Abn Lympho were statistically higher in Sezary cases than in control cases. In addition, the value of LyX was associated to the count of circulating Sezary cells and value of LyZ to the presence of large Sezary cells, both parameters described as prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: The combination of alarm Blast/Abn Lympho and structural parameters (Ly-X/Ly-Z/Ly-Y) may allow to define rule of blood slide review to screen circulating Sezary cells, and give promising results in B-cell diseases.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Brisou, Gabriel', 'Manzoni, Delphine', 'Dalle, Stephane', 'Felman, Pascale', 'Morel, Dominique', 'Boubaya, Marouane', 'Magaud, Jean Pierre', 'Baseggio, Lucile']","['Brisou G', 'Manzoni D', 'Dalle S', 'Felman P', 'Morel D', 'Boubaya M', 'Magaud JP', 'Baseggio L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Cellulaire, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre-Benite, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140320,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,IM,"['Autoanalysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sezary Syndrome/*blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",PMC6806721,,['NOTNLM'],"['diagnosis', 'morphology', 'prognosis', 'sezary']",2014/03/22 06:00,2015/07/17 06:00,['2014/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcla.21744 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2015 Mar;29(2):153-61. doi: 10.1002/jcla.21744.

However, if Ph-ALL patients showed IM resistance due to ABL kinase mutation, second-generation TKI, dasatinib or nilotinib, was recommended. We treated 4 pediatric Ph-ALL patients with both IM and bone marrow transplantation (BMT); however, 3 relapsed. We retrospectively examined the existence of ABL kinase mutation using PCR and direct sequencing methods, but there was no such mutation in all 4 diagnostic samples. Interestingly, two relapsed samples from patients who were not treated with IM before relapse did not show ABL kinase mutation and IM was still effective even after relapse. On the other hand, one patient who showed resistance to 3 TKI acquired dual ABL kinase mutations, F359C at the IM-resistant phase and F317I at the dasatinib-resistant phase, simultaneously. In summary, Ph-ALL patients relapsed with or without ABL kinase mutation. Furthermore, ABL kinase mutation was only found after IM treatment, so an IM-resistant clone might have been selected during the IM treatment and intensive chemotherapy.

Leukemic B cells of HCL exhibit a characteristic morphology and immunophenotype and coexpress multiple clonally related immunoglobulin isotypes. Precise diagnosis and detailed workup is essential, because the clinical profile of HCL can closely mimic that of other chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders that are treated differently. Variants of HCL, such as HCLv and VH4-34 molecular variant, vary in the immunophenotype and specific VH gene usage, and have been more resistant to available treatments. On the contrary, classic HCL is a highly curable disease. Most patients show an excellent long-term response to treatment with single-agent cladribine or pentostatin, with or without the addition of an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody such as rituximab. However, approximately 30-40 % of patients with HCL relapse after therapy; this can be treated with the same purine analogue that was used for the initial treatment. Advanced molecular techniques have identified distinct molecular aberrations in the Raf/MEK-ERK pathway and BRAF (V600E) mutations that drive the proliferation and survival of HCL B cells. Currently, research in the field of HCL is focused on identifying novel therapeutic targets and potential agents that are safe and can universally cure the disease. Ongoing and planned clinical trials are assessing various treatment strategies, such as the combination of purine analogues and various anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, recombinant immunotoxins targeting CD22 (e.g., moxetumomab pasudotox), BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib, and B-cell receptor signaling inhibitors, such as ibrutinib, which is a Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This article provides an update of our current understanding of the pathophysiology of HCL and the treatment options available for patients with classic HCL.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze different genetic abnormalities in acute B lymphoblastic leukemia in children, its relationship with the immunophenotype and the proliferative rate compared with normal B cell precursors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed immunophenotype, DNA content and proliferative rate in 44 samples by flow cytometry, and translocations t(9;22), t(12;21), t(4;11), and t(1;19) by RT-PCR. Using a hierarchical cluster analysis, we identified some immunophenotypic patterns associated to genetic abnormalities when compared with normal B cell precursors. RESULTS: DNA quantification showed that 21% of the cases had high hyperdiploidy and 47.7% has low hyperdiploidy. The presence of hyperdiploidy was associated with increased tumor proliferation and aberrant immunophenotypes, including abnormal expression of CD10, TdT, CD38, and CD45 and an increased size of the lymphoblasts. The presence of t(9;22) and t(12;21) discriminates normal cells from tumor cells with aberrant immunophenotype in the expression of CD19, CD22, CD13, CD33, CD38, CD34, and CD45. CONCLUSIONS: The aberrant immunophenotype profile detected in neoplastic cells along with abnormalities in the proliferative rate were significantly associated with DNA hyperdiploidy and clearly distinguished lymphoblasts with t(9;22) and t(12;21) from normal B cell precursors.

Combination therapies involving 6-MP and methotrexate have shown remarkable results in the cure of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in the last 30 years. 6-MP undergoes very extensive intestinal and hepatic metabolism following oral dosing due to the activity of xanthine oxidase leading to very low and highly variable bioavailability and methotrexate has been demonstrated as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Despite the success recorded in the use of 6-MP in ALL, there is still lack of effect and life threatening toxicity in some patients due to variability in the pharmacokinetics of 6-MP. Also, dose adjustment during treatment is still based on toxicity. The aim of the current work was to develop a mechanistic model that can be used to simulate trial outcomes and help to improve dose individualisation and dosage regimen optimisation. A physiological based pharmacokinetic model was proposed for 6-MP, this model has compartments for stomach, gut lumen, enterocyte, gut tissue, spleen, liver vascular, liver tissue, kidney vascular, kidney tissue, skin, bone marrow, thymus, muscle, rest of body and red blood cells. The model was based on the assumption of the same elimination pathways in adults and children. Parameters of the model include physiological parameters and drug-specific parameter which were obtained from the literature or estimated using plasma and red blood cell concentration data. Age-dependent changes in parameters were implemented for scaling and variability was also introduced on the parameters for prediction. Inhibition of 6-MP first-pass effect by methotrexate was implemented to predict observed clinical interaction between the two drugs. The model was developed successfully and plasma and red blood cell concentrations were adequately predicted both in terms of mean prediction and variability. The predicted interaction between 6-MP and methotrexate was slightly lower than the reported clinical interaction between the two drugs. The model can be used to predict plasma and tissue concentration in adults and children following oral and intravenous dosing and may ultimately help to improve treatment outcome in childhood ALL patients.",,"['Ogungbenro, Kayode', 'Aarons, Leon']","['Ogungbenro K', 'Aarons L']","['Centre for Applied Pharmacokinetic Research, Manchester Pharmacy School, The University of Manchester, Oxford Road, Manchester, M13 9PT, UK, kayode.ogungbenro@manchester.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['MC_G1100157/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],['Journal Article'],20140321,United States,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn,Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,101096520,IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Computer Simulation', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Models, Biological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2014/10/14 06:00,['2014/03/22 06:00'],"['2013/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10928-014-9355-3 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn. 2014 Apr;41(2):173-85. doi: 10.1007/s10928-014-9355-3.

Part 1: methotrexate.,159-71,10.1007/s10928-014-9354-4 [doi],"Methotrexate is an antimetabolite and antifolate drug that is widely used in the treatment of malignancies and auto-immune disorders. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, methotrexate is often combined with 6-mercaptopurine and both of them have been shown to be very effective for maintenance of remission. Large variability in the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate has led to increasing use of therapeutic drug monitoring in its clinical use to identify patients with high risk of toxicity and optimise clinical outcome. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed for methotrexate for oral and intravenous dosing and adults and paediatric use. The model has compartments for stomach, gut lumen, enterocyte, gut tissue, spleen, liver vascular, liver tissue, gall bladder, systemic plasma, red blood cells, kidney vascular, kidney tissue, skin, bone marrow, thymus, muscle and rest of body. A mechanistic model was also developed for the kidney to account for renal clearance of methotrexate via filtration and secretion. Variability on system and drug specific parameters was incorporated in the model to reflect observed clinical data and assuming the same pathways in adults and children, age-dependent changes in body size, organ volumes and plasma flows, the model was scaled to children. The model was developed successfully for adults and parameters such as net secretion clearance, biliary transit time and red blood cell distribution and binding parameters were estimated from published adult profiles. A relationship between fraction absorbed and dose using reported mean bioavailability data in the literature was also established. The model also incorporates non-linear binding in some tissues that has been described in the literature. Predictions using this model provide adequate description of observed plasma concentration data in adults and children.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of nilotinib on eradicating leukemia stem cells and enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents. Our results showed that ABCB1 and ABCG2 were preferentially expressed in leukemic CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. Nilotinib significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and mitoxantrone in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and led to increased apoptosis. Moreover, nilotinib strongly reversed multidrug resistance and increased the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 in primary leukemic blasts overexpressing ABCB1 and/or ABCG2. Studies with ABC transporter-overexpressing carcinoma cell models confirmed that nilotinib effectively reversed ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated drug resistance, while showed no significant reversal effect on ABCC1- and ABCC4-mediated drug resistance. Results from cytotoxicity assays showed that CD34(+)CD38(-) cells exhibited moderate resistance (2.41-fold) to nilotinib, compared with parental K562 cells. Furthermore, nilotinib was less effective in blocking the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl and CrkL (a substrate of Bcr-Abl kinase) in CD34(+)CD38(-) cells. Taken together, these data suggest that nilotinib particularly targets CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cells and MDR leukemia cells, and effectively enhances the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking the efflux function of ABC transporters.",,"['Wang, Fang', 'Wang, Xiao-Kun', 'Shi, Cheng-Jun', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Hu, Ya-Peng', 'Chen, Yi-Fan', 'Fu, Li-Wu']","['Wang F', 'Wang XK', 'Shi CJ', 'Zhang H', 'Hu YP', 'Chen YF', 'Fu LW']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510060, China.

ATBF1 is normally localized in the nucleus, but is often mislocalized in the cytoplasm in cancer cells. The mechanism underlying the mislocalization of ATBF1 is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the nuclear localization of ATBF1, and found that ectopically expressed ATBF1 formed nuclear body (NB)-like dots in the nucleus, some of which indeed physically associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) NBs. We also defined a 3-amino acid motif, KRK2615-2617, as the nuclear localization signal (NLS) for ATBF1. Interestingly, diffusely distributed nuclear SUMO1 proteins were sequestered into ATBF1 dots, which could be related to ATBF1's physical association with PML NBs, known SUMOylation hotspots. Furthermore, ATBF1 itself was SUMOylated. ATBF1 SUMOylation occurred at more than 3 lysine residues including K2349, K2806 and K3258 and was nuclear specific. Finally, the PIAS3 SUMO1 E3 ligase, which interacts with ATBF1 directly, diminished rather than enhanced ATBF1 SUMOylation, preventing the co-localization of ATBF1 with SUMO1 in the nucleus. These findings suggest that nuclear localization and SUMOylation are important for the transcription factor function of ATBF1, and that ATBF1 could cooperate with PML NBs to regulate protein SUMOylation in different biological processes.",,"['Sun, Xiaodong', 'Li, Jie', 'Dong, Frederick N', 'Dong, Jin-Tang']","['Sun X', 'Li J', 'Dong FN', 'Dong JT']","['Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA121459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA121459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140320,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",PMC3961433,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2014/11/08 06:00,['2014/03/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092746 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-02188 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 20;9(3):e92746. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092746. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PIAS3 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Inhibitors of Activated STAT)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (SUMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '143258-00-8 (ZFHX3 protein, human)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction indicated high expression of this sequence in Hodgkin's lymphoma derived cell lines but not in normal blood cells. Further characterization of this sequence and the surrounding genomic DNA revealed that this sequence is part of a human endogenous retrovirus locus. The sequence of this endogenous retrovirus is interrupted by a pseudogene of the dual specificity phosphatase 5 (DUSP5). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed high expression of this pseudogene (DUSP5P1) in HL cell lines but not in normal blood cells or Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B cells. Cells from other tumor types (Burkitt's lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma) also showed a higher DUSP5P1/DUSP5 ratio than normal cells. Furthermore, we observed that higher expression of DUSP5 in relation to DUSP5P1 correlated with the expression of the pro-apoptotic factor B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2-like 11 (BCL2L11) in peripheral blood cells and HL cells. Knock-down of DUSP5 in HL cells resulted in down-regulation of BCL2L11.

It has become clear, however, that virus-specific naive CD8+ T cells newly generated from the thymus can be primed with persisting antigens. In the setting of low antigen density and resolved inflammation, newly primed CD8+ T cells are preferentially recruited into the functional memory pool. Thus, continual recruitment of naive CD8+ T cells from the thymus is important for preserving the population of functional memory CD8+ T cells in chronically infected animals. Friend virus (FV) is the pathogenic murine retrovirus that establishes chronic infection in adult mice, which is bolstered by the profound exhaustion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells induced during the early phase of infection. Here we show an additional evasion strategy in which FV disseminates efficiently into the thymus, ultimately leading to clonal deletion of thymocytes that are reactive to FV antigens. Owing to the resultant lack of virus-specific recent thymic emigrants, along with the above exhaustion of antigen-experienced peripheral CD8+ T cells, mice chronically infected with FV fail to establish a functional virus-specific CD8+ T cell pool, and are highly susceptible to challenge with tumor cells expressing FV-encoded antigen. However, FV-specific naive CD8+ T cells generated in uninfected mice can be primed and differentiate into functional memory CD8+ T cells upon their transfer into chronically infected animals.

Based on 997 cancer cases, adjusted hazard ratios in the time-to-event analysis for the highest exposure category (>0.2 V/m) as compared with the reference category (<0.05 V/m) were 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.74, 1.43) for all cancers, 0.55 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.19) for childhood leukemia, and 1.68 (95% CI: 0.98, 2.91) for childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Results of the incidence density analysis, based on 4,246 cancer cases, were similar for all types of cancer and leukemia but did not indicate a CNS tumor risk (incidence rate ratio = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.73, 1.46). This large census-based cohort study did not suggest an association between predicted RF-EMF exposure from broadcasting and childhood leukemia. Results for CNS tumors were less consistent, but the most comprehensive analysis did not suggest an association.",,"['Hauri, Dimitri D', 'Spycher, Ben', 'Huss, Anke', 'Zimmermann, Frank', 'Grotzer, Michael', 'von der Weid, Nicolas', 'Spoerri, Adrian', 'Kuehni, Claudia E', 'Roosli, Martin']","['Hauri DD', 'Spycher B', 'Huss A', 'Zimmermann F', 'Grotzer M', 'von der Weid N', 'Spoerri A', 'Kuehni CE', 'Roosli M']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140219,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Spatial Analysis', 'Switzerland/epidemiology', 'Time Factors']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['broadcast transmitters', 'central nervous system tumors', 'childhood leukemia', 'childhood neoplasms', 'electromagnetic fields', 'radio waves']",2014/03/22 06:00,2014/05/13 06:00,['2014/03/22 06:00'],"['2014/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['kwt442 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwt442 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2014 Apr 1;179(7):843-51. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwt442.

The microbiology study of the BAL with Giemsa and immunofluorescence staining, seven days after admission showed the existence of P. jiroveci in the lungs. Further, one day and five days after admission, (1-->3) beta-D-glucan (BDG) levels were very high.

Results of individual epidemiologic studies have been inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between residential traffic exposure and childhood cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Studies published between January 1980 and July 2011 were retrieved from a systematic search of 18 bibliographic databases. Nine studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. Weighted summary ORs were calculated using a random effects model for outcomes with four or more studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Childhood leukemia was positively associated (summary OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.12, 2.10) with residential traffic exposure among seven studies using a postnatal exposure window (e.g., childhood period or diagnosis address) and there was no association (summary OR=0.92, 95% CI=0.78, 1.09) among four studies using a prenatal exposure window (e.g., pregnancy period or birth address). There were too few studies to analyze other childhood cancer outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that childhood leukemia is associated with residential traffic exposure during the postnatal period, but not during the prenatal period. Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies that use complete residential history to estimate traffic exposure, examine leukemia subtypes, and control for potential confounding factors are needed to confirm these findings. As many people reside near busy roads, especially in urban areas, precautionary public health messages and interventions designed to reduce population exposure to traffic might be warranted.","['Published by American Journal of Preventive Medicine on behalf of American', 'Journal of Preventive Medicine.']","['Boothe, Vickie L', 'Boehmer, Tegan K', 'Wendel, Arthur M', 'Yip, Fuyuen Y']","['Boothe VL', 'Boehmer TK', 'Wendel AM', 'Yip FY']","['Office of Public Health Scientific Services, Division of Epidemiology, Analysis, and Library Services, Analytic Tools and Methods Branch, CDC, Atlanta, Georgia.

NVP-BEZ235 inhibited cell proliferation without inducing apoptosis. It strongly repressed Mcl-1 expression and induced Puma expression in both cell lines tested while differentially modulating Bim between the two. Interestingly, NVP-BEZ235 efficiently sensitized ovarian carcinoma cells to ABT-737, provided that Bim expression was induced.

We conducted a multicenter Phase II Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nilotinib among Japanese patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML-chronic phase (CP) or accelerated phase (AP). RESULTS: We analyzed 49 patients (33 imatinib-resistant and 16 imatinib-intolerant) treated with nilotinib 400 mg twice daily. The major molecular response (MMR) rate was 47.8% at 12 months among 35 patients who did not demonstrate an MMR at study entry. Somatic BCR-ABL1 mutations (Y253H, I418V, and exon 8/9 35-bp insertion [35INS]) were detected in 3 patients at 12 months or upon discontinuation of nilotinib. Although 75.5% of patients were still being treated at 12 months, nilotinib treatment was discontinued because of progressing disease in 1 patient, insufficient effect in 2, and adverse events in 9. There was no statistically significant correlation between MMR and trough concentrations of nilotinib. Similarly, no correlation was observed between trough concentrations and adverse events, except for pruritus and hypokalemia. Hyperbilirubinemia was frequently observed (all grades, 51.0%; grades 2-4, 29%; grades 3-4, 4.1%). Hyperbilirubinemia higher than grade 2 was significantly associated with the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A9 I399C/C genotype (P = 0.0086; Odds Ratio, 21.2; 95% Confidence Interval 2.2-208.0). CONCLUSIONS: Nilotinib was efficacious and well tolerated by patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant CML-CP/AP. Hyperbilirubinemia may be predicted before nilotinib treatment, and may be controlled by reducing the daily dose of nilotinib in patients with UGT1A9 polymorphisms.

She subsequently showed a late virological relapse at week 24, and was successfully retreated with telaprevir-based triple therapy. Despite an increase in leucocyte and lymphocyte count compared to baseline following triple therapy, to date there is no evidence of progression of CLL and the patient remains asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Patients with CLL may experience haematological response following successful anti-HCV therapy using IFN-based regimens. Re-treatment with triple therapy including telaprevir following late virological relapse was successful, was not associated with any unexpected safety issues, and did not adversely affect CLL status.",,"['Christensen, Stefan', 'Gillessen, Anton']","['Christensen S', 'Gillessen A']","['Infektiologische Praxisgemeinschaft, Salzstrasse 58, D-48143 Munster, Germany. christensen@cim-ms.de.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140320,England,Infect Agent Cancer,Infectious agents and cancer,101276559,,,PMC3994472,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2014/03/22 06:01,['2014/03/22 06:00'],"['2014/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:01 [medline]']","['1750-9378-9-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1750-9378-9-10 [doi]']",epublish,Infect Agent Cancer. 2014 Mar 20;9(1):10. doi: 10.1186/1750-9378-9-10.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) analysis of the MOTN-1 cell line was performed as well as paired-end next-generation sequencing (NGS; Illumina HiSeq2000) of this cell line and one T-LGL patient. In addition, chosen 6q region was characterized in three T-LGL patients using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (FT-CGH) and LM-PCR. Gene expression was studied by RNA sequencing (RNAseq; SOLID5500). RESULTS: Rearrangements were detected within 1p and 2q in MOTN-1 affecting expression of FGR, ZEB2, and CASP8, and within 6q in MOTN-1 and one T-LGL patient affecting MAP3K5 and IFNGR1. Nineteen genes, among them FOXN3, RIN3, AKT1, PPP2R5C, were overexpressed as a result of an amplification in 14q in one T-LGL patient. Two novel fusion transcripts were identified: CASP8-ERBB4 in MOTN-1 and SBF1-PKHD1L1 in T-LGL patient. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that submicroscopic genomic rearrangements change gene expression in T-LGL.

METHODS: Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for 41 patients with chloromas treated with RT at our institution. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were treated with palliative intent, whereas sixteen received RT as a component of curative intent therapy in addition to systemic chemotherapy with or without haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). All patients received RT for chloroma (median dose 24 Gy). Median survival was 5.4 months after RT (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.5-12.6 months), and no significant difference in overall survival was identified based on prior treatment with systemic chemotherapy alone or HSCT. Patients treated with curative intent had a median survival of 26.2 months (95% CI 6.1-48.9 months) and a Kaplan-Meier estimate of 15% overall survival at 5 years. At the end of the study follow-up period, 38 patients were dead and three patients treated with curative intent remained alive. After palliative RT, 44% of patients experienced partial relief and 48% experienced complete symptomatic improvement without significant acute toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: RT provides timely symptom palliation for patients with chloromas with minimal morbidity, but the prognosis remains poor.

Thus, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from CM have potential as an appropriate cell source to test human regenerative medicine using human ESCs. CM ESCs have been established by us and other groups, and can be cultured in vitro. However, the growth factors and downstream pathways for self-renewal of CM ESCs are largely unknown. In this study, we found that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) rather than leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promoted CM ESC self-renewal via the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) pathway on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders.

Furthermore, a coculture system was established to investigate the interaction of leukemic cells with liver cells. CD44-positive Kasumi-1, but not CD44-negative HL-60 cells, were observed to adhere to the liver cell line L02. This cell-cell adhesion was significantly blocked by HA, indicating that Kasumi-L02 cell adhesion was mediated by the CD44-HA interaction.

In this study, we sequenced the mutation in exon 7 of the WT1 gene in 60 children with newly diagnosed AML and the spatial configuration of WT1 with frameshift mutations in exon 7 was evaluated using the software for homology modeling and optimization of molecular dynamics. Three cases with frameshift mutations in exon 7 were identified (3/60; mutation rate, 5%).

Of the three cases, one case presented with antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and the remaining two cases exhibited primary resistance to induction chemotherapy. The spatial configuration analysis demonstrated that the three mutations affected the spatial structure of exon 7 and even affected exon 8 compared to its wild-type.

BCL11A siRNA was transfected into SUDHL6, EB1 cells with HiPerfect transfection reagents. After transient transfection with BCL11A siRNA, the expression levels of BCL11A mRNA and protein were assayed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot analysis.

Human heparanase (HPSE) gene promoter is also considered a tumor-specific promoter. However, whether or not the SV40 enhancer affects the tumor specificity of HPSE remains to be determined. The SV40 enhancer sequence, 237 bp in length, was amplified and correctly inserted into the assigned multiple clone sites (MCS) of the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-Hp, which was constructed in advance.

Endometriosis induces inflammation and is vulnerable to oxidative stress damage. To update and summarize the literature concerning the mechanisms that serve to protect genomic DNA from the oxidative damage, the present study reviews the English-language literature for biochemical studies on the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1beta target genes. Findings demonstrated that retrograde flow of the menstrual blood might give rise to endometriosis. Iron may have a significant impact on endometriosis gene expression. HNF-1beta regulates tissue-specific gene expression in endometriosis, as well as the expression of several genes, including CD44v9, which binds several molecules, including hyaluronan, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leukemia-associated Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG), IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), major histocompatibility complex, class II invariant chain (CD74), cystine transporter subunit (xCT), Fas and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The CD44v9 system is involved in cell migration, growth, survival, anti-apoptosis, immune response and anti-oxidative stress through maintaining higher levels of antioxidants. HNF-1beta may serve to alleviate damage and promote survival of cells experiencing stress by upregulating antioxidant protein expression. This review expands current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the oxidative stress protection provided by HNF-1beta and provides evidence that elevated HNF-1beta activity might be associated with the CD44v9-dependent signaling cascades.",,"['Akasaka, Juria', 'Uekuri, Chiaki', 'Shigetomi, Hiroshi', 'Koike, Matsuki', 'Kobayashi, Hiroshi']","['Akasaka J', 'Uekuri C', 'Shigetomi H', 'Koike M', 'Kobayashi H']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nara Medical University, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nara Medical University, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nara Medical University, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nara Medical University, Nara 634-8522, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nara Medical University, Nara 634-8522, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Review'],20121011,England,Biomed Rep,Biomedical reports,101613227,,,PMC3956682,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD44v9', 'detoxification', 'endometriosis', 'oxidative stress']",2013/01/01 00:00,2013/01/01 00:01,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2012/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2012/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2013/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/br.2012.19 [doi]', 'br-01-01-0013 [pii]']",ppublish,Biomed Rep. 2013 Jan;1(1):13-17. doi: 10.3892/br.2012.19.

Here we review most of the described MJ activities in an attempt to get an integrated view and better understanding of its multifaceted modes of action. MJ (1) arrests cell cycle, inhibiting cell growth and proliferation, (2) causes cell death through the intrinsic/extrinsic proapoptotic, p53-independent apoptotic, and nonapoptotic (necrosis) pathways, (3) detaches hexokinase from the voltage-dependent anion channel, dissociating glycolytic and mitochondrial functions, decreasing the mitochondrial membrane potential, favoring cytochrome c release and ATP depletion, activating pro-apoptotic, and inactivating antiapoptotic proteins, (4) induces reactive oxygen species mediated responses, (5) stimulates MAPK-stress signaling and redifferentiation in leukemia cells, (6) inhibits overexpressed proinflammatory enzymes in cancer cells such as aldo-keto reductase 1 and 5-lipoxygenase, and (7) inhibits cell migration and shows antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activities. Finally, MJ may act as a chemosensitizer to some chemotherapics helping to overcome drug resistant.

Infection may not be the cause of fever in such patients after neutrophil-count recovery. Herein, we present two patients who developed fever during the neutropenic phase of induction chemotherapy and were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics until they were no longer febrile and had recovered their neutrophil count. Being off antibiotics, they redeveloped fever within 48-72 hours. These fevers seemed to be secondary to postinfectious inflammatory response and not infection, supported by the fact that adequate antibiotic treatment was given and the collected fluid contained neutrophils but the cultures were negative. We hypothesize an explanation for this phenomenon based on the ""homing of neutrophils"" to bone marrow, which involves chemoattraction of CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)-4 expressed on neutrophils towards the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 (CXCL12) expressed constitutively by bone marrow. Literature has shown that elevation of SDF-1 levels at injured/inflamed sites might create a similar gradient. This gradient results in the migration of neutrophils to the sites of previous injury/inflammation, leading to the formation of sterile abscesses. Based on our cases, we also conclude that antibiotics do not prevent the formation or treat such sterile ""abscesses""; however, the drainage of these ""abscesses"" and treatment with anti-inflammatory agents are useful in such cases.",,"['Pawar, Rahul D', 'Williams, Travis', 'Khera, Rahul', 'Eid, Albert', 'Aljitawi, Omar S', 'Dusing, Reginald W']","['Pawar RD', 'Williams T', 'Khera R', 'Eid A', 'Aljitawi OS', 'Dusing RW']","['Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Hematology/Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Infectious Diseases, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA ; Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Radiology, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20140310,New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,PMC3956695,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR4', 'SDF-1', 'homing of neutrophils', 'postinfectious inflammatory response']",2014/03/22 06:00,2014/03/22 06:01,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S53616 [doi]', 'jbm-5-037 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2014 Mar 10;5:37-41. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S53616. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Electronic searches were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese Biomedical Database, China Journal Full-text Database, and Chinese Scientific Journals Database. The languages were limited to Chinese and English. Randomized controlled trials were selected by 2 investigators. Analyses were performed using RevMan 5.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 3139 patients in 4 studies met the inclusion criteria. In those patients, complete hematologic response and cytogenetic responses showed significant improvements in favor of IFN-alfa + Ara-C, with complete hematologic response relative risk (RR) of 1.15 (95% CI, 1.09-1.21), complete cytogenetic response RR of 1.87 (95% CI, 1.47-2.38), partial cytogenetic response RR of 1.48 (95% CI, 1.25-1.75), and major cytogenetic response RR of 1.61 (95% CI, 1.42-1.83), respectively. The overall 3-year survival rate in the IFN-alfa + Ara-C group was 86% compared with 79% in the IFN-alfa group (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14). In the other 2 studies, 5-year overall survival was 69% compared with 63%, respectively (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15). However, IFN-alfa and Ara-C involved higher risk of hematologic toxicity, gastrointestinal adverse events, and severe mucositis compared with IFN-alfa monotherapy (RR = 2.63 [95% CI, 1.94-3.56); RR = 3.38 [95% CI, 2.28-5.00], and RR = 8.84 [95% CI, 3.82-20.46], respectively). Weight loss and skin rash were also observed more frequently in the combination treatment group (RR = 2.00 [95% CI, 1.47-2.73) and RR = 3.75 [95% CI, 2.13-6.59], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase, the combination of IFN-alfa + Ara-C demonstrated improved complete hematologic response, superior cytogenetic responses, and higher rates of 3- and 5-year survival than IFN-alfa alone. However, combination therapy is more likely to cause serious adverse effects.

There are rare literatures that address the outcome in these patients. Therefore, we collected our database, analyzed the outcome, reliability, and related-management of microsurgical technique in the patients with hematological diseases. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 20 patients with hematological disorders who received free tissue transfers during 20-years period in a single microsurgical center was done. Eleven patients who received head and neck reconstruction were found to have hyperfibrinogenemia. Seven patients with reactive thrombocytosis after trauma, and two patients with leukemia had soft tissue defects in the upper and lower extremities. Twenty-six flaps were used for free tissue transfers. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion. Anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) was given postoperatively. RESULTS: Twenty-three of the 26 free flaps survived without vascular compromise. Intra-operatively all patients received intravenous 5,000 Ud of heparin post immediate reperfusion, and anti-coagulant medication such as Dextran-40 or prostaglandin-E1 was given to the patients postoperatively. The three failed cases were found in patients with hyperfibrinogenemia and needed further reconstruction with another flap. The overall success rate was 88.5% (23/26). CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic disorder is not a predicted factor of free flap failure. The key factors for success flap survival in patients with hematologic disorders include preoperative knowledge of the medical condition and monitoring potential post-operative complications, aggressive hematologist consultations, and meticulous non-traumatic surgical anastomosis.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lin, Pao-Yuan', 'Cabrera, Rodrigo', 'Chew, Khong-Yik', 'Kuo, Yur-Ren']","['Lin PY', 'Cabrera R', 'Chew KY', 'Kuo YR']","['Section of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Surgery, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140320,United States,Microsurgery,Microsurgery,8309230,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', '*Free Tissue Flaps', 'Hematologic Diseases/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microsurgery', 'Middle Aged', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2015/06/10 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/micr.22243 [doi]'],ppublish,Microsurgery. 2014 Oct;34(7):505-10. doi: 10.1002/micr.22243.

This study was undertaken by MECCA as initial efforts in collaborative data collection to provide clinical and demographic information on children with ALL in the Middle East. PROCEDURE: Clinical and laboratory data for patients with ALL between January 2008 and April 2012 were prospectively collected from institutions in 14 Middle East countries and entered into a custom-built-database during induction phase. All laboratory studies including cytogenetics were done at local institutions. RESULTS: The 1,171 voluntarily enrolled patients had a mean age of 6.1 +/- 3.9 years and 59.2% were boys. T-ALL represented 14.8% and 84.2% had B-precursor ALL. At diagnosis, 5.6% had CNS disease. The distribution of common genetic abnormalities reflected a similar percentage of hyperdiploidy (25.6%), but a lower percentage of ETV6-RUNX1 translocation (14.7%) compared to large series reported from Western populations. By clinical criteria, 47.1% were low/standard risk, 16.9% were intermediate risk, and 36% were high risk. Most patients received all their care at the same unit (96.9%). Patients had excellent induction response to chemotherapy with an overall complete remission rate of 96%. Induction toxicities were acceptable. CONCLUSIONS: This first collaborative study has established a process for prospective data collection and future multinational collaborative research in the Middle East. Despite the limitations of an incomplete population-based study, it provides the first comprehensive baseline data on clinical characteristics, laboratory evaluation, induction outcome, and toxicity. Further work is planned to uncover possible biologic differences of ALL in the region and to improve diagnosis and management.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Al-Mulla, Naima A', 'Chandra, Prem', 'Khattab, Mohammed', 'Madanat, Faris', 'Vossough, Parvaneh', 'Torfa, Eyad', 'Al-Lamki, Zakiya', 'Zain, Gamal', 'Muwakkit, Samar', 'Mahmoud, Salah', 'Al-Jassmi, Abdulrahman', 'Tuncer, Murat', 'Al-Mukharraq, Hussein', 'Barsaoui, Sihem', 'Arceci, Robert J', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Kulozik, Andreas E', 'Ravindranath, Yaddanapudi', 'Reaman, Gregory H', 'Farranoush, Mohammad', 'AlNasser, Abdullah A']","['Al-Mulla NA', 'Chandra P', 'Khattab M', 'Madanat F', 'Vossough P', 'Torfa E', 'Al-Lamki Z', 'Zain G', 'Muwakkit S', 'Mahmoud S', 'Al-Jassmi A', 'Tuncer M', 'Al-Mukharraq H', 'Barsaoui S', 'Arceci RJ', 'Howard SC', 'Kulozik AE', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Reaman GH', 'Farranoush M', 'AlNasser AA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140320,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Middle East/epidemiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['MECCA', 'induction', 'leukemia', 'pediatric']",2014/03/22 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25031 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Aug;61(8):1403-10. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25031.

PROCEDURE: Bone turnover was assessed by biomarkers including serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP), osteocalcin (OC), and urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen indexed to creatinine (NTX/Cr). The 215 males ranged in age from 9 to 36 years (median age 17 years). RESULTS: Age and tanner score were inversely associated with all biomarkers (BALP, OC, NTX/Cr) (P < 0.001). Males had higher BALP and OC than females (P < 0.001). Body mass index (BMI) was inversely associated with OC and NTX/Cr (P < 0.001). There was no significant association of biomarkers with lifestyle related factors, ALL treatment-related factors, dietary calcium, vitamin D, or LS-BMD Z-score.

In order to improve it, the newly developed XN-Series automated hematology analyzers (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) have been installed with a new dedicated channel for platelet analysis (PLT-F), which is based on a fluorescence flow cytometry method with uses of a novel fluorescent dye specifically staining platelets. We evaluated the basic performance of this new PLT-F channel. METHODS: Basic performance of the PLT-F channel in within-run reproducibility and assay linearity was studied using standard methods. Correlation was studied between PLT-F and a conventional automated hematology analyzer (XE-2100) and immunoplatelet analysis using anti-CD61 monoclonal antibody (Cell-Dyn Sapphire; Abbott Laboratories). The assay interference by nonplatelet particles such as fragmented red and white blood cells was evaluated by using clinical samples, respectively, from burn injury and acute leukemia. RESULTS: Basic performance of the PLT-F platelet counting was satisfactory in within-run reproducibility, linearity and correlation with the conventional analyzer. The correlation was satisfactory also with the immunoplatelet analysis, even for samples from a patient with burn injury, and those with white blood cell fragments displayed, platelet abnormal flag and low platelet counts (<50 x 10(9)/l). CONCLUSION: The platelet counting performance of the PLT-F channel of the XN Series had improved accuracy and precision in the low range and in abnormal samples, avoiding the interference by nonplatelet particles.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tanaka, Yuzo', 'Tanaka, Yumiko', 'Gondo, Kazumi', 'Maruki, Yoshiko', 'Kondo, Tamiaki', 'Asai, Satomi', 'Matsushita, Hiromichi', 'Miyachi, Hayato']","['Tanaka Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Gondo K', 'Maruki Y', 'Kondo T', 'Asai S', 'Matsushita H', 'Miyachi H']","['Clinical Laboratory, Tokai University Hospital, Isehara, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140319,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,IM,"['Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Burns/pathology', 'Electronic Data Processing/*methods', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hematologic Tests/*methods', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3/metabolism', 'Platelet Count/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Statistics as Topic']",PMC6807536,,['NOTNLM'],"['PLT-F channel', 'automated hematology analyzer', 'nonplatelet particle', 'platelet counting', 'thrombocytopenia']",2014/03/22 06:00,2015/05/12 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/08/21 00:00 [received]', '2013/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcla.21691 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2014 Sep;28(5):341-8. doi: 10.1002/jcla.21691.

The treatment paradigm for MDS has changed in recent years with the introduction of hypomethylating agents (HMAs). The present retrospective multicenter study was designed to assess the effects of pre-transplant HMA on transplant outcome and determine which patients would benefit most from this therapy. A total of 109 patients who received alloSCT at one of five institutions between 2007 and 2010 were enrolled in this study regardless of pre-transplant HMA therapy. 81 of the 109 patients enrolled were treated with HMA prior to alloSCT. 28 patients received alloSCT without HMA bridging. The distributions of WHO classification groups and IPSS scores were similar between the two groups (P = 0.752 and P = 0.265, respectively).

METHODS: The authors reviewed 1435 patients who were diagnosed with DLBCL as part of the International DLBCL rituximab with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) Consortium Program and performed clinical, immunohistochemical, and genetic analyses with a focus on cyclin D1. All patients who were cyclin D1-positive according to immunohistochemistry were also assessed for rearrangements of the cyclin D1 gene (CCND1) using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Gene expression profiling was performed to compare patients who had DLBCL with and without cyclin D1 expression. RESULTS: In total, 30 patients (2.1%) who had DLBCL that expressed cyclin D1 and lacked CCND1 gene rearrangements were identified. Patients with cyclin D1-positive DLBCL had a median age of 57 years (range, 16.0-82.6 years). There were 23 males and 7 females. Twelve patients (40%) had bulky disease. None of them expressed CD5. Two patients expressed cyclin D2. Gene expression profiling indicated that 17 tumors were of the germinal center type, and 13 were of the activated B-cell type. Genetic aberrations of B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2), BCL6, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), mouse double minute 2 oncogene E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (MDM2), MDM4, and tumor protein 53 (TP53) were rare or absent. Gene expression profiling did not reveal any striking differences with respect to cyclin D1 in DLBCL. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with patients who had cyclin D1-negative DLBCL, men were more commonly affected with cyclin D1-positive DLBCL, and they were significantly younger. There were no other significant differences in clinical presentation, pathologic features, overall survival, or progression-free survival between these two subgroups of patients with DLBCL.",['(c) 2014 American Cancer Society.'],"['Ok, Chi Young', 'Xu-Monette, Zijun Y', 'Tzankov, Alexandar', ""O'Malley, Dennis P"", 'Montes-Moreno, Santiago', 'Visco, Carlo', 'Moller, Michael B', 'Dybkaer, Karen', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Zu, Youli', 'Bhagat, Govind', 'Richards, Kristy L', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Han van Krieken, J', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Farnen, John P', 'Piris, Miguel A', 'Winter, Jane N', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Young, Ken H']","['Ok CY', 'Xu-Monette ZY', 'Tzankov A', ""O'Malley DP"", 'Montes-Moreno S', 'Visco C', 'Moller MB', 'Dybkaer K', 'Orazi A', 'Zu Y', 'Bhagat G', 'Richards KL', 'Hsi ED', 'Han van Krieken J', 'Ponzoni M', 'Farnen JP', 'Piris MA', 'Winter JN', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Young KH']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['1RC1CA146299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA136411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA142509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA138688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140319,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage', 'Cyclin D1/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['cyclin D1', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'pleomorphic mantle cell lymphoma']",2014/03/22 06:00,2014/10/01 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.28664 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2014 Jun 15;120(12):1818-29. doi: 10.1002/cncr.28664.

Besides prospective clinical trials usually enrolling young and fit patients, retrospective studies were performed comparing the outcome of patients belonging to different age groups and showing longer survival in patients diagnosed in the most recent periods. In patients younger than 70 years the 10-year relative survival was 43-53% in the 1980s as compared with 59-63% in the 2000s. Likewise, the 10-year relative survival in patients >70 years was 22-42% in the 1980s and 46-55% in the 2000s. Improved outcome derived in part by the introduction of effective regimens in genetically defined ""high-risk"" disease (i.e., 17p-, 11q-, TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1 mutations), especially in the younger and/or fit patients. The unfavorable prognostic significance of 11q- was overcome by chemoimmunotherapy. High-dose steroids with anti-CD52 appeared to improve the response rate in 17p-/TP53 mutated cases and allogeneic transplantation achieved prolonged disease control irrespective of high-risk disease. Further improvement is being generated by the new anti-CD20 obinutuzumab in the elderly and by mechanism-based treatment using kinase-targeting agents or anti-BCL2 molecules yielding high-response rate and impressive progression-free survival in the chemorefractory setting as well as in previously untreated patients.",['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Thus far, the biological basis leading to CML progression remains poorly understood. SH2-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is reported to bind to p210BCRABL1 and to function as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, its substrates have been found to be essential for p210BCR-ABL1 leukemogenesis or CML progression. In the present study, we found that SHP-1 mRNA and protein levels were markedly decreased in patients in the accelerated and blastic phases of CML (AP-CML and BP-CML) compared to those in the chronic phase (CP-CML). In vitro, we demonstrated that overexpression of SHP-1 reduced p210BCR-ABL1 protein expression and activity in the K562 CML cell line and negatively regulated the AKT, MAPK, MYC and JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathways. Moreover, using a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay, abnormal methylation of the SHP-1 gene promoter region was found both in K562 cells and bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) cells from AP-CML and BP-CML patients. In conclusion, our findings suggest that decreased expression levels of SHP-1 caused by aberrant promoter hypermethylation may play a key role in the progression of CML by dysregulating BCR-ABL1, AKT, MAPK, MYC and JAK2/STAT5 signaling.",,"['Li, Yinghua', 'Yang, Lin', 'Pan, Yuxia', 'Yang, Jingci', 'Shang, Yintao', 'Luo, Jianmin']","['Li Y', 'Yang L', 'Pan Y', 'Yang J', 'Shang Y', 'Luo J']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Key Laboratory of Hematology, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, P.R.

METHODS: Between 2008 and 2010, patients with CML were surveyed by telephone. Quality of life was evaluated by the functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT) tool. RESULTS: The mean QOL among CML patients was 92.53 (out of 124 total points) in the trial outcome index, 78.50 (out of 108) in the general total score, and 130.43 (out of 176) in the leukemia total score. Patients who had the prescriptions recently changed anyway had better QOL general score (p = 0.012) and leukemia-specific score (p = 0.043) than those who remained with the same treatment. Imatinib was not associated with this change in QOL (p > 0.797). The more the patient felt able to work, the higher the scores in all three FACIT scales (p < 0.001, Spearman's correlation). The use of imatinib (p = 0.012) was associated with a better ability to work, while chemotherapy (p = 0.017) and the use of hydroxyurea (p = 0.001) were inversely associated with work capability. CONCLUSIONS: A recent change in medication can improve quality of life. The ability to work is an important component of quality of life of patients with CML. Ability to work should be specifically considered in CML treatment.",,"['Hamerschlak, Nelson', 'de Souza, Carmino', 'Cornacchioni, Ana Lucia', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Tabak, Daniel', 'Spector, Nelson', 'Steagall, Merula']","['Hamerschlak N', 'de Souza C', 'Cornacchioni AL', 'Pasquini R', 'Tabak D', 'Spector N', 'Steagall M']","['Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein.

We have observed potential reversal effects of DLJ14 on adriamycin (Adr)-resistant human myelogenous leukemia cells (K562/A02) and Adr-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/A) in vitro or in vivo in previous studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of DLJ14 and Adr combination treatment on Adr-resistant human breast cancer. Inhibition of cancer cell growth was estimated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry and apoptosis determined using Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and Hoechst 33258 nuclear staining. The expression of proteins in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt survival pathway and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway were measured by Western blotting analysis. Results showed that DLJ14 and Adr combination treatment exhibited stronger inhibition of the survival of MCF-7/A cells than Adr treatment alone. This effect might be associated with its role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. DLJ14 combined with Adr induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M-phase by activating p21(wafl /cip1) and p53 in mitochondria and increased cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) disruption and cytochrome c (Cytc) release from mitochondria to cytosol suggested that apoptosis induction might be mediated by the mitochondrial pathway. Moreover, the combination of DLJ14 and Adr could down-regulate the expression of EGFR, p-EGFR, PI3K, and p-Akt in MCF-7/A cells. Overall, DLJ14 and Adr combination treatment may inhibit proliferation of Adr-resistant human breast cancer cells through inhibition of the EGFR/PI3K/Akt survival pathway and induction of apoptosis via the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway.",,"['Chen, Jinhua', 'Wang, Wenfang', 'Wang, Hongyuan', 'Liu, Xinyong', 'Guo, Xiuli']","['Chen J', 'Wang W', 'Wang H', 'Liu X', 'Guo X']","['Department of Pharmacology, Key Laboratory of Chemical Biology (Ministry of Education), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Shandong University.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Drug Discov Ther,Drug discoveries & therapeutics,101493809,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'Female', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['DN/JST.JSTAGE/ddt/8.33 [pii]', '10.5582/ddt.8.33 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Discov Ther. 2014 Feb;8(1):33-41. doi: 10.5582/ddt.8.33.,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DLJ14 compound)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Astrocytes and astrocyte-conditioned media are widely used in models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), however, very little is known about astrocyte culture in 2D. To test the hypothesis that surface coating and soluble factors influence astrocyte morphology in 2D, we quantitatively analyzed the morphology of human fetal derived astrocytes on glass, matrigel, fibronectin, collagen IV, and collagen I, and after the addition soluble factors including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), laminin, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Matrigel surface coatings, as well as addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to the media, were found to have the strongest effects on 2D astrocyte morphology, and may be important in improving existing BBB models. In addition, the novel set of quantitative parameters proposed in this paper provide a test for determining the influence of compounds on astrocyte morphology, both to screen for new endothelial cell-secreted factors that influence astrocytes, and to determine in a high-throughput way which factors are important for translation to more complex, 3D BBB models.",,"['Levy, Amanda F', 'Zayats, Maya', 'Guerrero-Cazares, Hugo', 'Quinones-Hinojosa, Alfredo', 'Searson, Peter C']","['Levy AF', 'Zayats M', 'Guerrero-Cazares H', 'Quinones-Hinojosa A', 'Searson PC']","['Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Institute for Nanobiotechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Institute for Nanobiotechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Neurosurgery and Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Neurosurgery and Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America; Institute for Nanobiotechnology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA170629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS070024/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5R01NS070024/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA170629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20140319,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Basement Membrane/*metabolism', '*Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Fetus/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Solubility']",PMC3960172,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092165 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-50138 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 19;9(3):e92165. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092165. eCollection 2014.,,['0 (Membrane Proteins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is a transcriptional regulator known to influence cellular response to stress signals in the vasculature. We report here that in response to chronic hypobaric hypoxia, MKL1 expression was up-regulated in the lungs in rats. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated depletion of MKL1 significantly ameliorated the elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure in vivo with a marked alleviation of vascular remodeling. MKL1 silencing also restored the expression of NO, a key vasoactive molecule necessary for the maintenance of vascular tone. In addition, hypoxia induced pulmonary inflammation was dampened in the absence of MKL1 as evidenced by normalized levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as reduced infiltration of pro-inflammatory immune cells in the lungs. Of note, MKL1 knockdown attenuated fibrogenesis in the lungs as indicated by picrosirius red staining. Finally, we demonstrate that MKL1 mediated transcriptional activation of type I collagen genes in smooth muscle cells under hypoxic conditions.

Adiponectin is a cytokine produced by adipocytes, but paradoxically decreased in obesity, that has been implicated in MM progression. Herein, we evaluated how prolonged exposure to adiponectin affected the survival of MM cells as well as putative signaling mechanisms. Adiponectin activates protein kinase A (PKA), which leads to decreased AKT activity and increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. AMPK, in turn, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Adiponectin-induced apoptosis may be mediated, at least in part, by the PKA/AMPK-dependent decline in the expression of the enzyme acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC), which is essential to lipogenesis. Supplementation with palmitic acid, the preliminary end product of fatty acid synthesis, rescues MM cells from adiponectin-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furancarboxylic acid (TOFA), an ACC inhibitor, exhibited potent antiproliferative effects on MM cells that could also be inhibited by fatty acid supplementation. Thus, adiponectin's ability to reduce survival of MM cells appears to be mediated through its ability to suppress lipogenesis. Our findings suggest that PKA/AMPK pathway activators, or inhibitors of ACC, may be useful adjuvants to treat MM. Moreover, the antimyeloma effect of adiponectin supports the concept that hypoadiponectinemia, as occurs in obesity, promotes MM tumor progression.",,"['Medina, E A', 'Oberheu, K', 'Polusani, S R', 'Ortega, V', 'Velagaleti, G V N', 'Oyajobi, B O']","['Medina EA', 'Oberheu K', 'Polusani SR', 'Ortega V', 'Velagaleti GV', 'Oyajobi BO']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['KL2TR001118/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140320,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase/metabolism', 'Adipokines/metabolism', 'Adiponectin/deficiency/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Fatty Acids/chemistry', 'Furans/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lipogenesis', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Obesity/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014112 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.112 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Oct;28(10):2080-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.112.

To address this problem, we determined the crystal structure of the ternary complex containing Runx1(1-242) and Ets1(296-441) bound to T-cell receptor alpha (TCRalpha) enhancer DNA. In the crystal, an Ets1-interacting domain of Runx1 is bound to the Ets1 DNA-binding domain and displaced an entire autoinhibitory module of Ets1, revealing a novel mechanism of Ets1 activation. The DNA-binding and transcriptional studies with a variety of structure-guided Runx1 mutants confirmed a critical role of direct Ets1*Runx1 interaction in Ets1 activation.

In this study, we investigated the binding of p53 DNA-binding domain (p53DBD) with the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2, using GST pull-down assay and NMR spectroscopy. The GST pull-down assays and NMR experiments demonstrated the direct binding of the p53DBD with Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2. Further, NMR chemical shift perturbation data showed that Bcl-w and Mcl-1 bind to the positively charged DNA-binding surface of p53DBD. Noticeably, the refined structural models of the complexes between p53DBD and Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 showed that the binding mode of p53DBD is highly conserved among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, the chemical shift perturbations on Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bcl-2 induced by p53DBD binding occurred not only at the p53DBD-binding acidic region but also at the BH3 peptide-binding pocket, which suggests an allosteric conformational change similar to that observed in Bcl-XL.

Translocations of RUNX1 are seen in several types of leukemia with at least 21 identified partner genes. The cryptic t(7;21)(p22;q22) rearrangement involving the USP42 gene appears to be a specific and recurrent cytogenetic abnormality. Eight of the 9 cases identified in the literature with this translocation were associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with the remaining case showing refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 2. Herein, we present a patient with two preceding years of leukopenia and one year of anemia prior to the diagnosis of AML, NOS with monocytic differentiation (myelomonocytic leukemia) whose conventional cytogenetics showed an abnormal clone with 5q deletion. Interphase FISH using LSI RUNX1/RUNXT1 showed three signals for RUNX1. FISH studies on previously G-banded metaphases showed the extra RUNX1 signal on the short arm of chromosome 7. Further characterization using the subtelomeric 7p probe showed a cryptic 7;21 translocation. Our case and eight previously reported leukemic cases with the t(7;21)(p22;q22) appear to share similar features including monocytic differentiation, immunophenotypic aberrancies (often with CD56 and/or CD7), and a generally poor response to standard induction chemotherapy. About 80% of these cases had loss of 5q material as an additional abnormality at initial diagnosis or relapse. These findings suggest that t(7;21) may represent a distinct recurrent cytogenetic abnormality associated with AML. The association between the t(7;21) and 5q aberrancies appears to be non-random, however the pathogenetic connection remains unclear. Additional studies to evaluate for RUNX1 partner genes may be considered for AML patients with RUNX1 rearrangement and 5q abnormalities; however knowledge of the prognostic implications of this rearrangement is still limited.",,"['Ji, Jianling', 'Loo, Eric', 'Pullarkat, Sheeja', 'Yang, Lynn', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Ji J', 'Loo E', 'Pullarkat S', 'Yang L', 'Tirado CA']","['Cytogenetics, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Hematopathology, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Hematopathology, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Cytogenetics, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Cytogenetics, Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20140319,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,PMC4012275,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'RUNX1', 'USP42', 't(7;21)', 't(7;21)(p22;q22)']",2014/03/22 06:00,2014/03/22 06:01,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/2162-3619-3-8 [doi]', '2162-3619-3-8 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2014 Mar 19;3:8. doi: 10.1186/2162-3619-3-8. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, it has been described in bone cancer, SHH-medulloblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia, amongst others, however there are still no formal or automated methods for detecting or annotating it in high throughput sequencing data. As such, findings of chromothripsis are difficult to compare and many cases likely escape detection altogether. RESULTS: We introduce ShatterProof, a software tool for detecting and quantifying chromothriptic events. ShatterProof takes structural variation calls (translocations, copy-number variations, short insertions and loss of heterozygosity) produced by any algorithm and using an operational definition of chromothripsis performs robust statistical tests to accurately predict the presence and location of chromothriptic events. Validation of our tool was conducted using clinical data sets including matched normal, prostate cancer samples in addition to the colorectal cancer and SCLC data sets used in the original description of chromothripsis. CONCLUSIONS: ShatterProof is computationally efficient, having low memory requirements and near linear computation time. This allows it to become a standard component of sequencing analysis pipelines, enabling researchers to routinely and accurately assess samples for chromothripsis.

Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)-activating kinase has been demonstrated to interact with retinoic acid receptor (RAR)alpha in acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells, and inhibition of CDK-activating kinase by ATRA causes hypophosphorylation of PML-RARalpha, leading to myeloid differentiation. In many cases, downregulation of CDK activity by ATRA and vitamin D3 is a result of elevated p21- and p27-bound CDKs. Activation of p21 is regulated at the transcriptional level, whereas elevated p27 results from both (indirectly) transcriptional activation and post-translational modifications. CDK inhibitors (CKIs) of the INK family, such as p15, p16 and p18, are mainly involved in inhibition of cell proliferation, whereas CIP/KIP members, such as p21, regulate both growth arrest and induction of differentiation. ATRA and vitamin D3 can also downregulate expression of G1 CDKs, especially CDK2 and CDK6. Inhibition of cyclin E expression has only been observed in ATRA- but not in vitamin D3-treated leukaemic cells. In vitro, not only dephosphorylation of pRb but also elevation of total pRb is required for ATRA and vitamin D3 to suppress growth and trigger their differentiation.

OBJECTIVES: To report seven patients with B-cell malignancy and folliculotropic MF or pseudo-MF and emphasize on criteria allowing distinction between the two conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively and prospectively included seven patients with B-cell malignancy who presented skin lesions histologically consisting in a folliculotropic T-cell infiltrate and reviewed the literature on the topic. RESULTS: Four men and three women had a chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 6) or a MALT-type lymphoma (n = 1). Five patients had localized papules, and two had patches and plaques. Histological examination showed in all cases a diffuse dermal T-cell infiltrate with folliculotropic involvement and follicular mucinosis associated with clusters of the B-cell lymphoma, without significant expression of follicular helper T-cell markers. T-cell rearrangement studies showed a polyclonal pattern in the patients with papules and a monoclonal pattern in the cases of patches and plaques. Papular lesions had an indolent evolution, whereas patches and plaques persisted or worsened into transformed MF. CONCLUSION: Folliculotropic T-cell infiltrates associated with B-cell malignancies can be either a true folliculotropic MF or a pseudo-MF. The distinction between both conditions cannot rely only on the histopathological aspect, but needs both a clinical pathological correlation and the search for a dominant T-cell clone. Whether the neoplastic T and B cells derive from a common ancestor or the T-cell proliferation is promoted by the underlying B-cell lymphoma remains unsolved, but interaction between B and T cell in the skin does not appear to be dependent on a TFH differentiation of the T-cell infiltrate.",['(c) 2014 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.'],"['Ingen-Housz-Oro, S', 'Franck, N', 'Beneton, N', 'Fauconneau, A', 'Do-Pham, G', 'Carlotti, A', 'Petit, T', 'Liolios, I', 'Bara, C', 'Carpentier, H', 'Storelli, D', 'Prophette, B', 'Garderet, L', 'Haioun, C', 'Petit, E', 'Delfau-Larue, M-H', 'Vergier, B', 'Chosidow, O', 'Beylot-Barry, M', 'Ortonne, N']","['Ingen-Housz-Oro S', 'Franck N', 'Beneton N', 'Fauconneau A', 'Do-Pham G', 'Carlotti A', 'Petit T', 'Liolios I', 'Bara C', 'Carpentier H', 'Storelli D', 'Prophette B', 'Garderet L', 'Haioun C', 'Petit E', 'Delfau-Larue MH', 'Vergier B', 'Chosidow O', 'Beylot-Barry M', 'Ortonne N']","['Department of Dermatology, AP-HP, Henri Mondor Hospital, Creteil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140319,England,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,9216037,IM,"['Aged', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hair Follicle', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/complications/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/complications/*pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pseudolymphoma/complications/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications/*pathology', '*T-Lymphocytes']",,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jdv.12454 [doi]'],ppublish,J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2015 Jan;29(1):77-85. doi: 10.1111/jdv.12454.

BCR autonomous signalling may induce constant receptor editing and mistakes in allelic exclusion. The fact that whole BCR recognizes a self-antigen or foreing antigen may be irrelevant in early B cell development. In early B cells, autonomous signalling induced by recognition of the BCR's own epitopes simulates an antigen-antibody engagement. In the bone marrow this interaction is viewed as recognition of self-molecules and induces receptor editing. In mature B cells autonomous signalling by the BCR may promote 'reversible anergy' and also may correct self-reactivity induced by the somatic hypermutation mechanisms in mutated CLL B cells. However, in unmutated CLL B cells, BCR autonomous signalling in addition to self-antigen recognition augments B cell activation, proliferation and genomic instability. We suggest that CLL originates from a coordinated normal immunologic tolerance mechanism to destroy self-reactive B cells.

This study examined the risk of a new primary cancer following an initial skin cancer and assessed risk factors associated with second primary cancers. METHODS: All invasive cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM, N = 28 069) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC, N = 24 620) diagnosed in Norway during 1955-2008 were included. Rates of new primary cancers in skin cancer survivors were compared to rates of primary malignancies in the general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Discrete-time logistic regression models were applied to individual-level data to estimate cancer risk among those with and without a prior skin cancer, accounting for residential region, education, income, parenthood, marital status and parental cancer status, using a 20% random sample of the entire Norwegian population as reference. Further analyses of the skin cancer cohort were undertaken to determine risk factors related to subsequent cancers. RESULTS: During follow-up, 9608 new primary cancers occurred after an initial skin cancer. SIR analyses showed 50% and 90% increased risks for any cancer after CMM and SCC, respectively (p < 0.01). The logistic regression model suggested even stronger increase after SCC (130%). The highest risk was seen for subsequent skin cancers, but several non-skin cancers were also diagnosed in excess: oral, lung, colon, breast, prostate, thyroid, leukemia, lymphoma and central nervous system. Factors that were associated with increased risk of subsequent cancers include male sex, older age, lower residential latitude, being married and low education and income. Parental cancer did not increase the risk of a subsequent cancer after SCC, but was a significant predictor among younger CMM survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide information on shared environmental and genetic risk factors for first and later cancers and may help to identify individuals at high risk for subsequent cancers, which will be important as skin cancer incidence continues to rise.",,"['Robsahm, Trude E', 'Karagas, Margaret R', 'Rees, Judy R', 'Syse, Astri']","['Robsahm TE', 'Karagas MR', 'Rees JR', 'Syse A']","['Cancer Registry of Norway, PB 5313 Majorstuen, N-0304 Oslo, Norway. trude.eid.robsahm@kreftregisteret.no.']",['eng'],['R01 CA057494/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140319,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Norway/epidemiology', '*Population Surveillance/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3994878,,,,2014/03/22 06:00,2014/10/31 06:00,['2014/03/21 06:00'],"['2013/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/31 06:00 [medline]']","['1471-2407-14-210 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-14-210 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2014 Mar 19;14:210. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-14-210.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In our established UK population-based patient cohort, 323 patients were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or myeloma between May 2005 and April 2008, and died before April 2010. A day-by-day calendar approach was devised to collect pathway data, including SPC referrals, to supplement routinely collected information on clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, response, and date and place of death. RESULTS: 155 (47.9%) of the 323 patients had at least one SPC referral. The likelihood of referral increased with survival (OR 6.58, 95% CIs 3.32 to 13.03 for patients surviving >/=1 year compared to </=1 month from diagnosis), and varied with diagnosis (OR 1.96, CIs 1.15 to 3.35 for myeloma compared to acute myeloid leukaemia). Compared to patients dying in hospital, those who died at home or in a hospice were also more likely to have had an SPC referral (OR 3.07, CIs 1.59 to 5.93 and 4.74, CIs 1.51 to 14.81, respectively). No associations were found for age and sex. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel approach efficiently captured pathway data and SPC referrals, revealing evidence of greater integration between haematology and SPC services than previously reported. The likelihood of referral was much higher among those dying outside hospital, and variations in practice were observed by diagnosis, emphasising the importance of examining diseases individually.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In the immune system, Notch activity is required for the differentiation of T cell progenitors, but it is reduced in more mature thymocytes, in which Notch is oncogenic. Studies based on single-gene models have suggested that the tumor suppressor protein Ikaros plays an important role in repressing the transcription of Notch target genes. We used genome-wide analyses, including chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, to identify genes controlled by Notch and Ikaros in gain- and loss-of-function experiments. We found that Ikaros bound to and directly repressed the expression of most genes that are activated by Notch. Specific deletion of Ikaros in thymocytes led to the persistent expression of Notch target genes that are essential for T cell maturation, as well as the rapid development of T cell leukemias in mice. Expression of Notch target genes that are normally silent in T cells, but are activated by Notch in other cell types, occurred in T cells of mice genetically deficient in Ikaros. We propose that Ikaros shapes the timing and repertoire of the Notch transcriptional response in T cells through widespread targeting of elements adjacent to Notch regulatory sequences.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study group comprised 267 individuals. They were screened for the most common variants of low TPMT activity. TPMT activity was measured in erythrocytes using the HPLC rate-blanked method. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (12.4%) were heterozygous (26 were TPMT*1/*3A, 5 TPMT*1/*2, 2 TPMT *1/*3C) and 1 was a compound heterozygote (*2/*3A). Normal and low normal TPMT activities substantially overlapped in wild-type and heterozygous individuals, whereas high activities were found in 29 wild-type genotyped patients. Extreme and life-threatening toxicity was observed in the compound heterozygote patient.

Autocrine FGF4/Erk signalling has been identified as a major stimulus for fate decisions and lineage commitment in these cells. Recent findings on serum-free culture conditions with specific inhibitors (known as 2i) demonstrate that the inhibition of this pathway reduces transcription factor heterogeneity and is vital to maintain ground state pluripotency of mESCs. We suggest a novel mathematical model to explicitly integrate FGF4/Erk signalling into an interaction network of key pluripotency factors (namely Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Rex1). The envisaged model allows to explore whether and how proposed mechanisms and feedback regulations can account for different expression patterns in mESC cultures. We demonstrate that an FGF4/Erk-mediated negative feedback is sufficient to induce molecular heterogeneity with respect to Nanog and Rex1 expression and thus critically regulates the propensity for differentiation and the loss of pluripotency. Furthermore, we compare simulation results on the transcription factor dynamics in different self-renewing states and during differentiation with experimental data on a Rex1GFPd2 reporter cell line using flow cytometry and qRT-PCR measurements. Concluding from our results we argue that interaction between FGF4/Erk signalling and Nanog expression qualifies as a key mechanism to manipulate mESC pluripotency. In particular, we infer that ground state pluripotency under 2i is achieved by shifting stable expression pattern of Nanog from a bistable into a monostable regulation impeding stochastic state transitions. Furthermore, we derive testable predictions on altering the degree of Nanog heterogeneity and on the frequency of state transitions in LIF/serum conditions to challenge our model assumptions.",,"['Herberg, Maria', 'Kalkan, Tuzer', 'Glauche, Ingmar', 'Smith, Austin', 'Roeder, Ingo']","['Herberg M', 'Kalkan T', 'Glauche I', 'Smith A', 'Roeder I']","['Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.', 'Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Institute for Medical Informatics and Biometry, Medical Faculty Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['G1100526/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140318,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Computer Simulation', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/physiology', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Stability', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC3958526,,,,2014/03/20 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092496 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-44813 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 18;9(3):e92496. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092496. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Nanog protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes it difficult to diagnose infections in patients who are already inflamed, e.g. due to cell and tissue damage. For example, fever in patients with hematological malignancies may depend on infection, lysis of malignant cells, and/or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage. We hypothesized that it would be possible to distinguish patterns of inflammatory mediators characterizing infectious and non-infectious causes of inflammation, respectively. Analysis of a broad range of parameters using a multivariate method of pattern recognition was done for this purpose. METHODS: In this prospective study, febrile (>38 degrees C) neutropenic patients (n = 42) with hematologic malignancies were classified as having or not having a microbiologically defined infection by an infectious disease specialist. In parallel, blood was analyzed for 116 biomarkers, and 23 clinical variables were recorded for each patient. Using O-PLS (orthogonal projection to latent structures), a model was constructed based on these 139 variables that could separate the infected from the non-infected patients. Non-discriminatory variables were discarded until a final model was reached. Finally, the capacity of this model to accurately classify a validation set of febrile neutropenic patients (n = 10) as infected or non-infected was tested. RESULTS: A model that could segregate infected from non-infected patients was achieved based on discrete differences in the levels of 40 variables. These variables included acute phase proteins, cytokines, measures of coagulation, metabolism, organ stress and iron turn-over.

Many cancer cells show chromosome instability (CIN) due to aberrant expression of the genes involved in chromosome segregation. The induction of massive chromosome segregation errors in such cancer cells by small molecule inhibitors is an emerging strategy to kill these cells selectively. Here we screened and characterized small molecule inhibitors which cause mitotic chromosome segregation errors to target cancer cell growth. We screened about 300 chemicals with known targets, and found that Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitors bypassed the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which delays anaphase onset until proper kinetochore-microtubule interactions are established. We investigated how ROCK inhibitors affect chromosome segregation, and found that they induced microtubule-dependent centrosome fragmentation. Knockdown of ROCK1 and ROCK2 revealed their additive roles in centrosome integrity. Pharmacological inhibition of LIMK also induced centrosome fragmentation similar to that by ROCK inhibitors. Inhibition of ROCK or LIMK hyper-stabilized mitotic spindles and impaired Aurora-A activation. These results suggested that ROCK and LIMK are directly or indirectly involved in microtubule dynamics and activation of Aurora-A. Furthermore, inhibition of ROCK or LIMK suppressed T cell leukemia growth in vitro, but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells. They induced centrosome fragmentation and apoptosis in T cell leukemia cells. These results suggested that ROCK and LIMK can be a potential target for anti-cancer drugs.",,"['Oku, Yusuke', 'Tareyanagi, Chiaki', 'Takaya, Shinichi', 'Osaka, Sayaka', 'Ujiie, Haruki', 'Yoshida, Kentaro', 'Nishiya, Naoyuki', 'Uehara, Yoshimasa']","['Oku Y', 'Tareyanagi C', 'Takaya S', 'Osaka S', 'Ujiie H', 'Yoshida K', 'Nishiya N', 'Uehara Y']","['Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Microbial Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Iwate Medical University School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Yahaba-cho, Shiwa-gun, Iwate, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140318,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Centrosome/drug effects', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosome Segregation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lim Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'rho-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC3958508,,,,2014/03/20 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/20 06:00'],"['2013/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0092402 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-37151 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 18;9(3):e92402. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0092402. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (LIMK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Lim Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (rho-Associated Kinases)']",,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(6):e101101'],,,,,,,

Its degraded forms have been identified as potential carcinogens, although the mechanism remains unclear. METHODS: The effects of degraded lambda-carrageenan (lambda-dCGN) on murine RAW264.7 cells and human THP-1-derived macrophage cells were investigated by studying its actions on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression, and activation of nuclear factor-kappab (NF-kappaB) and activation protein-1 (AP-1) pathways. RESULTS: We found that lambda-dCGN was much stronger than native lambda-CGN in the activation of macrophages to secrete TNF-alpha. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with lambda-dCGN resulted in the upregulation of TLR4, CD14 and MD-2 expressions, but it did not increase the binding of lipopolysacchride (LPS) with macrophages. Meanwhile, lambda-dCGN treatment activated NF-kappaB via B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) and nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, alpha (IkappaBalpha) phosphorylation. In addition, lambda-dCGN induced extracellular signal-regulated kinases/1/2/mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2/MAPK) and AP-1 activation. Interestingly, pretreatment of RAW264.7 cells with lambda-dCGN markedly enhanced LPS-stimulated TNF-alpha secretion. This pretreatment resulted in the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and intensified activation of AP-1. CONCLUSIONS: lambda-dCGN induced an inflammatory reaction via both NF-kappaB and AP-1, and enhanced the inflammatory effect of LPS through AP-1 activation. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The study demonstrated the role of lambda-dCGN to induce the inflammatory reaction and to aggravate the effect of LPS on macrophages, suggesting that lambda-dCGN produced during food processing and gastric digestion may be a safety concern.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The treatment of AML has advanced little in the past thirty years, in part because of the biologic heterogeneity of the disease and the difficulty in targeting AML cells while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Advances in preventing and treating AML are likely to occur once the cellular and molecular differences between leukemia and normal hematopoietic cells are better understood. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), while, in contrast, a subset of AMLs are lacking this activity. This difference may be relevant to the development of AML and may also provide a better avenue for treating this disease.

Therefore, we investigated a possible correlation of mRNA expression of HIF-1alpha and GLUT1 with chemoresistance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained from newly diagnosed and relapsed AML (M3 exclusion) cases. RNA interference with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to stably silence GLUT1 or HIF-1alpha gene expression in an AML cell line and HIF-1alpha and GLUT1 mRNA expression was measured by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qPCR). RESULTS: High levels of HIF-1alpha and GLUT1 were associated with poor responsiveness to chemotherapy in AML. Down-regulation of the expression of GLUT1 by RNA interference obviously sensitized drug-resistant HL-60/ADR cells to adriamycin (ADR) in vitro, comparable with RNA interference for the HIF-1alpha gene.

A total of 812 subjects [523 healthy controls, 148 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases and 141 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases] were screened for TYMS 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat and cSHMT C1420T using PCR-AFLP and PCR-with confronting two-pair primers (CTPP) approaches. TYMS 5'-UTR 2R allele frequencies of controls, ALL and AML cases were 35.3%, 28.0% and 30.1% respectively. This polymorphism conferred protection against ALL (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.53-0.96) while showing no statistically significant association with AML (OR: 0.79, 95%CI: 0.58, 1.07). The cSHMT variant allele (T-) frequencies of ALL and AML cases (6.42% and 5.68% respectively) were significantly lower compared to controls (58.3%). This polymorphism conferred protection against ALL (OR: 0.049, 95%CI: 0.029-0.081) and AML (OR: 0.043, 95%CI: 0.025-0.074). The TYMS 5'-UTR 2R2R genotype was associated with a lower total leukocyte count, smaller percentage of blasts, and more adequate platelet count compared to 2R3R and 3R3R genotypes in ALL cases. No such genotype-dependent differences were observed in AML cases. ALL cases carrying the cSHMT C1420T polymorphism showed higher disease free survival compared to those with the wild genotype. To conclude, the TYMS 5'-UTR 28bp tandem repeat reduces risk for ALL while cSHMT C1420T reduces risk for both ALL and AML.

TP53 is associated with old age, chemotherapy resistance, and worse OS. Using genetic sequencing, we set out to look at our own experience with AML, and hypothesized that both TP53 mutations and SNPs at codon 72 would mimic the literature by occurring in a minority of patients, and conferring a worse OS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a pilot study of randomly selected, newly diagnosed AML patients at Mount Sinai Medical Center, diagnosed from 2005-2008 (n=10). TP53 PCR sequencing was performed using DNA from bone marrow smears. Analysis was accomplished using Mutation Surveyor software with confirmation of the variants using the COSMIC and dbSNP databases. RESULTS: Fewer than half of the patients harbored TP53 mutations (40%). There was no significant difference in OS based on gender, AML history, risk-stratified karyotype, or TP53 mutation. There were possible trends toward improved survival among patients less than 60 (11 vs 4 months, p=0.09), Hispanics (8 vs 1 months, p=0.11), and those not harboring SNP P72R (8 vs 2 months, p=0.10). There was a significant improvement in survival among patients with better performance status (28 vs 4 months, p=0.01) and those who did not have a complex karyotype (8 vs 1 months, p=0.03). The most commonly observed TP53 mutation was a missense N310K (40%) and the most commonly observed SNP was P72R (100.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms previous reports that poor PS and the presence of a complex karyotype are associated with a decreased OS. In our cohort, TP53 mutations were relatively common, occurring more frequently in male patients with an adverse karyotype. Although there was no significant difference in survival between TP53 mutated and un-mutated patients, there was a possible trend toward worse OS among patients with SNP P72R.

Bone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside our bones. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is a powerful strategy for the treatment of leukemia, aplastic anemia, congenital immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases. In humans, bone marrow cells (BMCs) have usually been collected by multiple bone marrow aspirations from the iliac crest. We have established a new ""perfusion"" method for collecting BMCs with minimal contamination with the peripheral blood using the long bones of cynomolgus monkeys. This method has proven to be a simple and safe method for harvesting BMCs and reduces the risk of acute graft versus host disease in allogeneic BMT. Intra-bone marrow-BMT (IBM-BMT) provides distinct advantages because it recruits donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. IBM-BMT has been shown to currently be the best strategy for allogeneic BMT. Here we review the perfusion method (for harvesting BMCs) and IBM-BMT (for their transplantation) and show that this combination will become a powerful new clinical strategy for allogeneic BMT.",,"['Korrapati, Narasimhulu', 'Nanganuru, Harikrishna Yadav']","['Korrapati N', 'Nanganuru HY']","['Department of Biotechnology National Institute of Technology Warangal Warangal-506004, India. simha7762006@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140319,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,,,,,,,2014/03/20 06:00,2014/03/20 06:00,['2014/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [medline]']",['CSCRT-EPUB-59694 [pii]'],aheadofprint,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2014 Mar 19. pii: CSCRT-EPUB-59694.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) monitoring may identify early suboptimal responses, and thereby permit detection of non-adherence to therapy, we sought to assess the association between frequency of molecular monitoring and medication adherence. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study design of diagnosed CP-CML obtained from two large US administrative claims databases. Patients were grouped into cohorts based on the number of qPCR tests they had. Adherence was assessed both by medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered (PDC) and was compared between qPCR cohorts. A sensitivity analysis was performed by adjusting for the number of oncology outpatient visits not due to routine molecular monitoring. RESULTS: Over the 12 month study period, 1205 CML patients met the selection criteria; 41.0% had no qPCR tests, 31.9% had 1-2 tests, and 27.1% had 3-4 tests; 88.9% of patients were initiated on imatinib. Patients in the 3-4 qPCR tests cohort had an average MPR that was 10.22 (p < 0.001) and 9.54 (p < 0.001) percentage points higher compared to patients in the 0 tests cohort and the 1-2 tests cohort. When using PDC as a measure of adherence, similar results were obtained. The results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with core analysis findings, excluding number of physician visits as a potential driver of adherence. LIMITATIONS: These findings demonstrate an association, not causation, between molecular monitoring frequency and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent molecular monitoring (3-4 times per year as recommended in current guidelines) is associated with greater TKI treatment adherence for patients diagnosed with CML. Since TKI adherence >80% has been associated with better clinical outcomes, this study underscores the importance of molecular monitoring.",,"['Guerin, Annie', 'Chen, Lei', 'Dea, Katherine', 'Wu, Eric Q', 'Goldberg, Stuart L']","['Guerin A', 'Chen L', 'Dea K', 'Wu EQ', 'Goldberg SL']","['Analysis Group Inc. , Boston, MA , USA.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140321,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction/statistics & numerical data', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Medication adherence', 'Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2014/03/20 06:00,2015/06/09 06:00,['2014/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1185/03007995.2014.904281 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2014 Jul;30(7):1345-52. doi: 10.1185/03007995.2014.904281.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was in vitro propagation of human spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and improvement of presence of human Germ Stem Cells (hGSCs) were assessed by specific markers POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1 (POU5F1), also known as Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) and PLZF (Promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger protein). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human testicular cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion (Collagenase IV and Trypsin). Germ cells were cultured in Stem-Pro 34 media supplemented by growth factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor to support self-renewal divisions. Germline stem cell clusters were passaged and expanded every week. Immunofluorecent study was accomplished by Anti-Oct4 antibody through the culture. The spermatogonial stem cells genes expression, PLZF, was studied in testis tissue and germ stem cells entire the culture. RESULTS: hGSCs clusters from a brain dead patient developed in testicular cell culture and then cultured and propagated up to 6 weeks. During the culture Oct4 were a specific marker for identification of hGSCs in testis tissue. Expression of PLZF was applied on RNA level in germ stem cells. CONCLUSION: hGSCs indicated by SSCs specific marker can be cultured and propagated for long-term in vitro conditions. This article extracted from Ph.D. Thesis.

The discovery, over two decades ago, of major histocompatibility complex-class I-specific inhibitory NK receptors and subsequently of activating receptors, recognizing ligands expressed by tumor or virus-infected cells, paved the way to our understanding of the mechanisms of selective recognition and killing of tumor cells. Although NK cells can efficiently kill tumor cells of different histotypes in vitro, their activity may be limited in vivo by their inefficient trafficking to tumor lesions and by the inhibition of their function induced by tumor cells themselves and by the tumor microenvironment. On the other hand, the important role of NK cells has been clearly demonstrated in the therapy of high risk leukemias in the haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation setting. NK cells derived from donor HSC kill leukemic cells residual after the conditioning regimen, thus preventing leukemia relapses.

The LEA study began in 2004 and is based on a French multicentric prospective cohort. Included are children treated for AL since January 1980 (incident and prevalent cases), surviving at month 24 for myeloblastic AL and lymphoblastic AL grafted in first complete remission or at month 48 for lymphoblastic AL not grafted in first complete remission. Information is collected during specific medical visits and notably includes the following data: socioeconomic data, AL history, physical late effects (such as fertility, cardiac function and metabolic syndrome) and quality of life. Data are collected every 2 years until the patient is 20 years old and has had a 10-year follow-up duration from diagnosis or last relapse. Thereafter, assessments are planned every 4 years. In active centres in 2013, eligible patients number more than 3000. The cohort has already included 2385 survivors, with rate of exhaustiveness of almost 80%.

Data were obtained on all incident lymphoid neoplasms registered in Australia during 1982-2006. Subtypes were grouped using the InterLymph nested hierarchical classification, based on the 2008 WHO Classification. Temporal trends were examined using Joinpoint regression; average annual percentage change in incidence was computed. Multiple Poisson regression was used to compare incidence by sex and age. The incidence of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) increased by 2.5%/year during 1982-1996 and was stable thereafter. During 1997-2006, several mature B- and natural killer (NK)-/T-cell NHL subtypes increased in incidence, including diffuse large B-cell (1.3%/year), follicular (2.5%/year), Burkitt (6.8%/year), marginal zone (13.2%/year), mantle cell (4.2%/year), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (4.7%/year) and plasmacytoma (7.1%/year). While chronic lymphocytic leukemia incidence was stable, small lymphocytic lymphoma incidence declined (8.1%/year). Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) incidence increased during 1997-2006 (2.2%/year), both classical (4.3%/year) and nodular lymphocyte predominant (12.1%/year) HL. Diagnostic artifact, evidenced by a sustained decline in the incidence of NHL not otherwise specified (NOS; 5.8%/year) and lymphoid neoplasms NOS (5.6%/year), limits the interpretation of temporal trends for some subtypes.

Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are the main causes for the relapse and refractory. T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), a specific surface molecule expressed on LSCs in most types of AML, is a candidate for AML LSC-targeted therapies. It is important to know how this molecule functions in the maintenance of LSCs and suppression of anti-tumor immunity. Recent data have shown that Tim-3 which expresses on T cells can suppress immune responses indirectly by inducing expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs at the leukemia site can also differentiate into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs can promote proliferation and survival of LSCs by the diversion of adaptive immunity and the facilitation of extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. Our previous study in AML patient bone marrow samples showed CD68(+) macrophages around AML clone. Based on the known evidence and our experimental findings, we hypothesize that Tim-3, which specifically expresses on LSCs, is beneficial for LSCs survival and AML progression by promoting expansion of MDSCs and differentiating into TAMs at the leukemia site.",,"['Gao, Lei', 'Yu, Shicang', 'Zhang, Xi']","['Gao L', 'Yu S', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, 400037, China, gaolei7765@163.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Galectins/*metabolism', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', '*Signal Transduction']",,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2015/09/04 06:00,['2014/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/04 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12013-014-9900-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 2014 Sep;70(1):273-7. doi: 10.1007/s12013-014-9900-0.,,"['0 (Galectins)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this population, chlorambucil monotherapy is an appropriate therapeutic option; however, response rates with chlorambucil are low, and more effective treatments are needed. This trial was designed to assess how the addition of rituximab to chlorambucil (R-chlorambucil) would affect safety and efficacy in patients with CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with first-line CLL were treated with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) on day 1, cycle one, and 500 mg/m(2) thereafter) plus chlorambucil (10 mg/m(2)/d all cycles; day 1 through 7) for six 28-day cycles. For patients not achieving complete response (CR), six additional cycles of chlorambucil alone could be administered. The primary end point of the study was safety. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were treated with R-chlorambucil, with a median follow-up of 30 months. Median age of patients was 70 years (range, 43 to 86 years), with patients having a median of seven comorbidities. Hematologic toxicities accounted for most grade 3/4 adverse events reported, with neutropenia and lymphopenia both occurring in 41% of patients and leukopenia in 23%. Overall response rates were 84%, with CR achieved in 10% of patients. Median progression-free survival was 23.5 months; median overall survival was not reached. CONCLUSION: These results compare favorably with previously published results for chlorambucil monotherapy, suggesting that the addition of rituximab to chlorambucil may improve efficacy with no unexpected adverse events.

They form a group of neoplasms strongly dependent on their inflammatory microenvironment, which plays an important supportive role in tumor B-cell survival and in the resistance to antitumor immune response. New therapies must consider both tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Stromal cells, derived from bone marrow or lymph nodes, and B cells from follicular lymphoma patients were cocultured or cultured alone with celecoxib treatment, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and/or TRAIL, a promising cytotoxic molecule for cancer therapy. RESULTS: In this study, we show that follicular lymphoma stromal cells produce large amounts of PGE2. This production is abrogated after celecoxib treatment, targeting the COX-2 isoenzyme involved in PGE2 synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that celecoxib increases apoptosis in NHL B-cell lines and in primary follicular lymphoma B cells cocultured with stromal cells, but independently of the PGE2/COX-2 axis. Finally, celecoxib increases the apoptotic activity of TRAIL. We provide evidence that celecoxib affects proliferation and sensitizes NHL B-cell lines to apoptosis through COX-2-independent effects by slowing down the cell cycle and decreasing the expression of survival proteins, such as Mcl-1.

Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) activity may affect the sensitivity of patients to folate-based chemotherapeutic drugs, thus influencing the relapse risk. Two polymorphisms of the gene encoding MTHFR, C677T and A1298C, alter MTHFR enzyme activity and may be associated with ALL relapse. The aim of this meta-analysis was to clarify the correlation between the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and ALL relapse. To this end, data were collected from studies of the association between these two polymorphisms and ALL relapse. Analysis of the data revealed a serious contradiction among the results. A recessive model demonstrated that the ALL relapse risk was significantly increased in carriers of the 677 TT genotype, especially for pediatric ALL, but was unaffected by the A1298C polymorphism. These findings confirm that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism could be considered as a good marker of the pediatric ALL relapse risk.",,"['He, H-R', 'Chen, S-Y', 'You, H-S', 'Hu, S-S', 'Sun, J-Y', 'Dong, Y-L', 'Lu, J']","['He HR', 'Chen SY', 'You HS', 'Hu SS', 'Sun JY', 'Dong YL', 'Lu J']","[""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", ""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140318,United States,Pharmacogenomics J,The pharmacogenomics journal,101083949,IM,"['Genotype', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'Recurrence']",,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2015/10/13 06:00,['2014/03/19 06:00'],"['2013/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/13 06:00 [medline]']","['tpj201410 [pii]', '10.1038/tpj.2014.10 [doi]']",ppublish,Pharmacogenomics J. 2014 Oct;14(5):432-8. doi: 10.1038/tpj.2014.10.

We hypothesized that such failure may be due to anergy, as CLL cells exhibit variable levels of nonresponsiveness to surface IgM stimulation that is reversible in vitro. Moreover, anergy is associated with reduced differentiation capacity in normal B cells. We investigated responses of CLL cells to two potent differentiation-promoting agents, IL-21 and cytosine guanine dinucleotide-enriched oligo-deoxynucleotides. The induction of PR domain-containing protein 1 (PRDM1; also known as Blimp-1), a critical regulator of plasmacytic differentiation, by these agents was closely correlated but varied between individual cases, despite functionally intact IL-21 receptor- and Toll-like receptor 9-mediated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways. PRDM1 induction was inversely correlated with the extent of anergy as measured by the ability to mobilize intracellular Ca(2+) following BCR crosslinking. PRDM1 responsiveness was associated with other markers of differentiation and proliferation but not with differences in apoptosis. The ability to induce PRDM1 did correlate with differential transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of the PRDM1 gene. These studies extend our understanding of CLL pathobiology, demonstrating that reduced differentiation capacity may be a consequence of anergy. Epigenetic drugs may offer possibilities to reactivate PRDM1 expression as part of novel differentiation therapy approaches.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Duckworth, Andrew', 'Glenn, Mark', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Packham, Graham', 'Kalakonda, Nagesh']","['Duckworth A', 'Glenn M', 'Slupsky JR', 'Packham G', 'Kalakonda N']","['Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; and.', 'Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; and.', 'Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; and.', 'Cancer Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Haematology, Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom; and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140317,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Clonal Anergy', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/*immunology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Interleukins/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/immunology']",,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/09/03 06:00,['2014/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40175-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-11-539049 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 May 22;123(21):3277-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-11-539049.

To address this lack of data, we have developed a dynamic in vitro model in which CLL cells experience shear forces equivalent to those in capillary beds and are made to flow through capillary-like hollow fibers lined with endothelial cells. CLL cells treated in this way increased their expression of CD62L and CXCR4 (both P < .0001) and of CD49d and CD5 (both P = .003) directly as a result of the shear force. Furthermore, CLL cells migrated through the endothelium into the ""extravascular"" space (mean migration, 1.37% +/- 2.14%; n = 21). Migrated CLL cells had significantly higher expression of CD49d (P = .02), matrix metallopeptidase-9 (P = .004), CD38 (P = .009), CD80 (P = .04), and CD69 (P = .04) compared with CLL cells that remained in the circulation. The degree of migration observed strongly correlated with CD49d expression (r(2), 0.47; P = .01), and treatment with the CD49d-blocking antibody natalizumab resulted in significantly decreased migration (P = .01). Taken together, our data provide evidence for a novel, dynamic, and tractable in vitro model of lymphocyte migration and confirm that CD49d is a critical regulator of this process in CLL.",['(c) 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Walsby, Elisabeth', 'Buggins, Andrea', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Jones, Ceri', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Pepper, Chris']","['Walsby E', 'Buggins A', 'Devereux S', 'Jones C', 'Pratt G', 'Brennan P', 'Fegan C', 'Pepper C']","['Cardiff Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Group, Institute of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', ""Department of Haematology, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; and."", ""Department of Haematology, King's College London, London, United Kingdom; and."", 'Cardiff Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Group, Institute of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', 'Cancer Research United Kingdom Institute for Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Cardiff Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Group, Institute of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', 'Cardiff Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Group, Institute of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', 'Cardiff Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Group, Institute of Cancer & Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140317,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Culture Techniques/instrumentation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Coculture Techniques/instrumentation/methods', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Microfluidics', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Shear Strength']",,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/08/15 06:00,['2014/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)40143-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2013-12-544569 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2014 Jun 5;123(23):3607-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2013-12-544569.

Recent studies suggest the existence of functional cross-talk between hematologic malignancies and vascular endothelium. Here we show that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) localizes to the vasculature in both patients and in a xenograft model. A significant number of vascular tissue-associated AML cells (V-AML) integrate into vasculature in vivo and can fuse with endothelial cells. V-AML cells acquire several endothelial cell-like characteristics, including the upregulation of CD105, a receptor associated with activated endothelium. Remarkably, endothelial-integrated V-AML shows an almost fourfold reduction in proliferative activity compared with non-vascular-associated AML. Primary AML cells can be induced to downregulate the expression of their hematopoietic markers in vitro and differentiate into phenotypically and functionally defined endothelial-like cells. After transplantation, these leukemia-derived endothelial cells are capable of giving rise to AML. These novel functional interactions between AML cells and normal endothelium along with the reversible endothelial cell potential of AML suggest that vascular endothelium may serve as a previously

Here, we clarify the basis for NB formation and identify stress-induced partner sumoylation as the primary NB function. NB nucleation does not rely primarily on intermolecular interactions between the PML SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) and SUMO, but instead results from oxidation-mediated PML multimerization. Oxidized PML spherical meshes recruit UBC9, which enhances PML sumoylation, allow partner recruitment through SIM interactions, and ultimately enhance partner sumoylation. Intermolecular SUMO-SIM interactions then enforce partner sequestration within the NB inner core. Accordingly, oxidative stress enhances NB formation and global sumoylation in vivo. Some NB-associated sumoylated partners also become polyubiquitinated by RNF4, precipitating their proteasomal degradation. As several partners are protein-modifying enzymes, NBs could act as sensors that facilitate and confer oxidative stress sensitivity not only to sumoylation but also to other post-translational modifications, thereby explaining alterations of stress response upon PML or NB loss.",,"['Sahin, Umut', 'Ferhi, Omar', 'Jeanne, Marion', 'Benhenda, Shirine', 'Berthier, Caroline', 'Jollivet, Florence', 'Niwa-Kawakita, Michiko', 'Faklaris, Orestis', 'Setterblad, Niclas', 'de The, Hugues', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach, Valerie']","['Sahin U', 'Ferhi O', 'Jeanne M', 'Benhenda S', 'Berthier C', 'Jollivet F', 'Niwa-Kawakita M', 'Faklaris O', 'Setterblad N', 'de The H', 'Lallemand-Breitenbach V']","['Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Hopital St. Louis 1, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/metabolism', '*Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",PMC3998805,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/05/28 06:00,['2014/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['jcb.201305148 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.201305148 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2014 Mar 17;204(6):931-45. doi: 10.1083/jcb.201305148.,,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Rnf4 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of PMA-induced cellular differentiation is not fully understood. We found that PMA triggers global enhancement of protein ubiquitination in K562, a myelogenous leukemia cell line and one of the enhanced-ubiquitination targets is SnoN, an inhibitor of the Smad signaling pathway. Our data indicated that PMA stimulated the production of Activin A, a cytokine of the TGF-beta family. Activin A then activated the phosphorylation of both Smad2 and Smad3. In consequence, SnoN is ubiquitinated by the APC(Cdh1) ubiquitin ligase with the help of phosphorylated Smad2. Furthermore, we found that SnoN proteolysis is important for the expression of CD61, a marker of megakaryocyte.

Data were analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS: Twenty out of 41 adolescents had one or more physical late effects. Adolescents showed more serious psychological late effect than parents. Five children and seven parents had above cut-off scores and they were considered the high risk group for posttraumatic symptoms. Parent-reported scores were significantly higher than child-reported scores in terms of social adjustment and emotional functioning of quality of life.

Herein, we validated the biological activity of a Petiveria alliacea fraction using a metastatic breast adenocarcinoma model (4T1). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Petiveria alliacea fraction biological activity was determined estimating cell proliferation, cell colony growth capacity and apoptosis (caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial membrane potential) in 4T1 cells. Petiveria alliacea was used at IC(5)(0) concentration (29 microg/mL) and 2 dilutions below, doxorubicin at 0.27 microg/mL (positive control) and dibenzyl disulfide at 2.93 microg/mL (IC50 fraction marker compound). Proteomic estimations were analyzed by LC-MS-MS. Protein level expression was confirmed by RT-PCR. Glucose and lactate levels were measured by enzymatic assays. LD50 was established in BALB/c mice and antitumoral activity evaluated in mice transplanted with GFP-tagged 4T1 cells. Mice were treated with Petiveria alliacea fraction via I.P (182 mg/kg corresponding to 1/8 of LD(5)(0) and 2 dilutions below). RESULTS: Petiveria alliacea fraction in vitro induces 4T1 cells apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation without mitochondria membrane depolarization, and decreases cell colony growth capacity. Also, changes in glycolytic enzymes expression cause a decrease in glucose uptake and lactate production. Fraction also promotes breast primary tumor regression in BALB/c mice transplanted with GFP-tagged 4T1 cells. CONCLUSION: A fraction of Petiveria alliacea leaves and stems induces in vitro cell death and in vivo tumor regression in a murine breast cancer model. Our results validate in partly, the traditional use of Petiveria alliacea in breast cancer treatment, revealing a new way of envisioning Petiveria alliacea biological activity. The fraction effect on the glycolytic pathway enzymes contributes to explain the antiproliferative and antitumor activities.","['Copyright (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd..

We conducted a phase I study combining oxaliplatin with cytarabine and fludarabine therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2008 and November 2009, 27 patients were registered in the study. Patients had histologically confirmed disease, performance status 0 to 2, and adequate organ function. The treatment regimen consisted of increasing doses of oxaliplatin (25, 30, or 35 mg/m(2)/d) on days 1 to 4 (escalation phase), and fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)) and cytarabine (500 mg/m(2)) on days 2 to 6, every 28 days for </= 6 cycles. The dose-limiting toxicity was defined as any symptomatic grade >/= 3 nonhematologic toxicity lasting >/= 3 days and involving a major organ system. RESULTS: Of 27 patients, 12 were treated in the dose-escalation phase and 15 at the maximum tolerated dose for oxaliplatin (30 mg/m(2); expansion phase). All patients were evaluable for toxicity and response. Only 1 patient received the second cycle; the remaining patients received no further study treatment, owing to slow recovery from toxicities or physician decision. Grade 3-4 drug-related toxicities included diarrhea (grade 4) and elevated levels of bilirubin (grade 3) and aspartate transaminase (grade 3). In all, 3 patients had a complete remission and 2 patients complete response without platelet recovery. CONCLUSION: Oxaliplatin, cytarabine, and fludarabine therapy had antileukemic activity in patients with poor-risk AML, but it was associated with toxicity.

Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) targeting these cells may improve the treatment of AML, but is limited by the low density of target epitopes. Our objective was to study a human polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (hPNKP) inhibitor that interferes with DNA repair as a radiosensitizer for the Auger electron RIT agent, (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3, which recognizes the CD123(+)/CD131(-) phenotype uniquely displayed by LSCs. METHODS: The surviving fraction (SF) of CD123(+)/CD131(-) AML-5 cells exposed to (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3 (33-266 nmols/L; 0.74MBq/mug) or to gamma-radiation (0.25-5Gy) was determined by clonogenic assays. The effect of A12B4C3 (25 mumols/L) combined with (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3 (16-66 nmols/L) or with gamma-radiation (0.25-2Gy) on the SF of AML-5 cells was assessed. The density of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the nucleus was measured using the gamma-H2AX assay. Cellular dosimetry was estimated based on the subcellular distribution of (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3 measured by cell fractionation. RESULTS: Binding of (111)In-NLS-7G3 to AML-5 cells was reduced by 2.2-fold in the presence of an excess (1muM) of unlabeled NLS-7G3, demonstrating specific binding to the CD123(+)/CD131(-) epitope. (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3 reduced the SF of AML-5 cells from 86.1 +/- 11.0% at 33 nmols/L to 10.5 +/- 3.6% at 266 nmols/L. Unlabeled NLS-7G3 had no significant effect on the SF. Treatment of AML-5 cells with gamma-radiation reduced the SF from 98.9 +/- 14.9% at 0.25Gy to 0.03 +/- 0.1% at 5 Gy. A12B4C3 combined with (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3 (16-66 nmols/L) enhanced the cytotoxicity up to 1.7-fold compared to treatment with radioimmunoconjugates alone and was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA DSBs in the nucleus. A12B4C3 enhanced the cytotoxicity of gamma-radiation (0.25-0.5Gy) on AML-5 cells by up to 1.5-fold, and DNA DSBs were increased by 1.7-fold. Exposure to (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3 (66 nmols/L) delivered up to 0.6Gy to AML-5 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that A12B4C3 radiosensitized AML cells to the DNA damaging effects of (1)(1)(1)In-NLS-7G3.

Previous studies indicated that in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) bearing the leukemia promoting PML/RARalpha fusion protein, let-7c expression seems to be controlled by the host gene promoter, in which canonical Retinoic Acid Responsive Elements (RAREs) are bound by PML/RARalpha in an all transretinoic acid (ATRA)-sensitive manner. Here, let-7c transcriptional regulation was further investigated and a novel intronic promoter upstream of the pre-miRNA was identified. This new promoter has transcriptional activity strongly indicating that at least two promoters need to be considered for let-7c transcription: the distal host gene and the proximal intronic promoter. Therefore, epigenetic modifying enzymes and histone acetylation and methylation status were analyzed on both let-7c promoters. It was demonstrated that ATRA treatment leads to let-7c upregulation inducing a more open chromatin conformation of the host gene promoter, with an enrichment of epigenetic marks that correlate with a more active transcriptional state. Conversely, the epigenetic marks on the intronic promoter are not significantly affected by ATRA treatment. Interestingly, in solid tumors such as prostate and lung adenocarcinoma it was found that both host and intronic promoters are functional. These data suggest that while the host gene promoter may control let-7c expression in AML, in a nonleukemic tumor context instead the intronic promoter contributes or preferentially regulates let-7c transcription. IMPLICATIONS: Alternative promoter usage represents a regulatory mechanism of let-7c expression in different tissues. Mol Cancer Res; 12(6); 878-89.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the clinicopathologic characteristics of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. METHODS: We retrospectively identified patients with histiocytoid Sweet syndrome at our institution from January 1992 through December 2010. We evaluated the underlying cutaneous infiltrate using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: We re-evaluated all 22 patients with hematologic malignancy-associated Sweet syndrome. Six patients had a monocytoid infiltrate that was consistent with histiocytoid Sweet syndrome; subsequent evaluation of these patients demonstrated cytogenetic abnormalities on prior bone-marrow biopsy specimens. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was feasible in cutaneous specimens from 5 of the 6 patients and demonstrated the same cytogenetic abnormalities that were identified on prior bone-marrow biopsy specimens in 4 patients. Therefore, these 4 patients may have had a form of leukemia cutis. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective study. CONCLUSION: For patients with histiocytoid Sweet syndrome, an underlying hematologic malignancy, and a monocytoid infiltrate on biopsy specimen, fluorescence in situ hybridization of the cutaneous infiltrate may be beneficial to identify cytogenetic abnormalities that may indicate leukemia cutis.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

Studies regarding the safety and efficacy of thrombomodulin alfa (TM-alpha; recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin) in patients with APL and DIC are limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was performed on a cohort of 172 patients with APL from an open-label, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study of TM-alpha. RESULTS: Of the 172 patients, 31 were relapse/refractory APL patients, and 141 were newly diagnosed APL patients. Within the first 30 days, 24 patients (14.0%) died, and six of those deaths (3.5%) were due to hemorrhage. In total, 12 patients (7.0%) had severe hemorrhagic complications. Both the early death rate due to hemorrhage as well as the severe hemorrhage rate did not exceed those in some recent population-based studies of patients with APL. Forty-nine patients received TM-alpha prior to the initiation of antileukemic treatment, and one patient experienced hemorrhagic early death (ED), suggesting that early TM-alpha treatment appeared to result in a reduction in the hemorrhagic ED rate. Moreover, TM-alpha improved coagulopathy regardless of concomitant all-trans retinoic acid treatment.

Despite this, no long-term predictive models have been developed for AML, mainly because of the complexities associated with this disease. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the current study was to develop a model (based on a UK cohort) to predict cost and life expectancy at a population level. METHODS: The model developed in this study combined a decision tree with several Markov models to reflect the complexity of the prognostic factors and treatments of AML. The model was simulated with a cycle length of 1 month for a time period of 5 years and further simulated until age 100 years or death. Results were compared for two age groups and five different initial treatment intents and responses. Transition probabilities, life expectancies, and costs were derived from a UK population-based specialist registry-the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (www.hmrn.org). RESULTS: Overall, expected 5-year medical costs and life expectancy ranged from pound8,170 to pound81,636 and 3.03 to 34.74 months, respectively. The economic and health outcomes varied with initial treatment intent, age at diagnosis, trial participation, and study time horizon. The model was validated by using face, internal, and external validation methods. The results show that the model captured more than 90% of the empirical costs, and it demonstrated good fit with the empirical overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Costs and life expectancy of AML varied with patient characteristics and initial treatment intent. The robust AML model developed in this study could be used to evaluate new diagnostic tools/treatments, as well as enable policy makers to make informed decisions.","['Copyright (c) 2014 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes', 'Research (ISPOR).

METHODS: The aim of this study was to quantify HC nuclei shapes classified into 11 categories on diagnostic bone marrow smears of 38 consecutive patients with HCL. RESULTS: HC in all 33 patients with evaluable smears at diagnosis exhibited a round/oval nucleus in 60.8-95.8%, an indented nucleus in 3.4-24.5% and a kidney-shaped nucleus in 0.4-7.0%. Other shapes of HC nuclei were found only in a proportion of patients: nuclei with two indentations in 0.4-6.5% HC (28 patients), overlapped nuclei in 0.5-3.5% HC (17) and lobulated nuclei in 0.4-4.5% HC (15). Two per cent or less of HC had the following nuclear shapes: that of an opposite indentation and impression (14 patients), dumb-bell (13), ring (10), horseshoe (5), two nuclei (8 patients).

OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to assess the cost utility and budget impact of using dasatinib or nilotinib, rather than high-dose (800-mg/d) imatinib, in patients with chronic phase (CP) CML who are resistant to standard-dose (400-mg/d) imatinib in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was developed and used to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes of treating patients aged >/=38 years with CP-CML. The efficacy parameters were synthesized from a systematic review. Utilities using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions tool and costs were obtained from the Thai CML population. Costs and outcomes were compared and presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in 2011 Thai baht (THB) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, treatment with dasatinib was found to yield more QALYs (2.13) at a lower cost (THB 1,631,331) per person than high-dose imatinib. Nilotinib treatment was also found to be more cost-effective than high-dose imatinib, producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of THB 83,328 per QALY gained. This treatment option also resulted in the highest number of QALYs gained of all of the treatment options. The costs of providing dasatinib, nilotinib, and high-dose imatinib were estimated at THB 5 billion, THB 6 billion, and THB 7 billion, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with dasatinib or nilotinib is likely to be more cost-effective than treatment with high-dose imatinib in CP-CML patients who do not respond positively to standard-dose imatinib in the Thai context. Dasatinib was found to be more cost-effective than nilotinib.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.

PVB19 infection is most common in the pediatric population, manifesting as erythema infectiosum. In patients with hemoglobinopathy, PVB19 infection is known to cause aplastic anemia. PVB19 infection rarely affects the nervous system - reported manifestations include seizures, encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. Less common presentations include stroke, cerebellar ataxia, optic neuritis, brachial plexitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and carpal tunnel syndrome. METHODS: Review the different central nervous system (CNS) manifestations and treatment strategies in all reported cases of adult CNS PVB19 infection. RESULTS: Cerebellar ataxia is a very rare manifestation of PVB19 CNS infection. Our patient had refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and PVB19 in bone marrow and serum; he presented with 6-week history of progressive pan-cerebellar ataxia. CSF was acellular but PVB19 was present on PCR test. Early treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) led to improvement in the patient's neurological deficits. CONCLUSIONS: PVB19 CNS infection should be in the differential as a cause of cerebellar ataxia in immunocompromised patients. Recognition is critical to early institution of appropriate therapy. Our patient showed considerable improvement in ataxia after IVIG therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The role of MLL gene deregulation in rare cases of isolated lymphoblastic lymphoma in infants is obscure. We report the case of a 10-month-old child who presented with a cutaneous nodule on the left foot. Histological diagnosis was precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma. The young age of the patient motivated us to investigate the presence of an MLL rearrangement. METHODS: Cytogenetic analysis was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and the genomic fusion partner of MLL was identified by long-distance inverse (LDI-)PCR and confirmed by direct PCR. RESULTS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization screening of paraffin-embedded formalin-fixed tissue indeed revealed the presence of an MLL rearrangement. The genomic fusion partner was identified as AF10 by DNA sequencing of the MLL breakpoint region. The MLL-AF10 fusion gene was further detected in cytologically normal pretreated bone marrow. Treatment was started with standard four-drug induction chemotherapy. Because of the unfavorable outcome associated with MLL rearrangements in infant leukemia, we intensified postremission treatment according to the Interfant-06 study protocol. The child is in continuous first remission 36 months after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of submicroscopic bone marrow involvement in MLL-rearranged isolated cutaneous B-cell precursor lymphoma in an infant. To prospectively address the role of MLL rearrangements in extramedullary B-lymphoblastic malignancies in infants, we suggest to assess both tumors and non-infiltrated bone marrow for the presence of this genetic abnormality.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Ubiquitination of IkappaBalpha may partially account for constitutive activation of NF-kappaB. MLN4924 is an investigational agent that inhibits the Nedd8-activating enzyme, thereby neutralizing Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases and preventing degradation of their substrates. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a preclinical assessment of MLN4924 in CLL. Primary CLL cells were cocultured in vitro with CD40L-expressing stroma to mimic the prosurvival conditions present in lymphoid tissue. The effect of MLN4924 on CLL cell apoptosis, NF-kappaB pathway activity, Bcl-2 family members, and cell cycle was assessed by flow cytometry, Western blotting, PCR, and immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: CD40L-expressing stroma protected CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis and induced resistance to multiple drugs, accompanied by NF-kappaB activation and Bim repression. Treatment with MLN4924 induced CLL cell apoptosis and circumvented stroma-mediated resistance. This was accompanied by accumulation of phospho-IkappaBalpha, decreased nuclear translocation of p65 and p52 leading to inhibition of both the canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways, and reduced transcription of their target genes, notably chemokines. MLN4924 promoted induction of Bim and Noxa in the CLL cells leading to rebalancing of Bcl-2 family members toward the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bim or Noxa decreased sensitivity to MLN4924. MLN4924 enhanced the antitumor activity of the inhibitors of B-cell receptor (BCR)-associated kinases. CONCLUSIONS: MLN4924 disrupts NF-kappaB activation and induces Bim expression in CLL cells, thereby preventing stroma-mediated resistance.

Modern treatment protocols utilizing intense induction followed by myeloablative consolidation chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR) have improved survival rates, but the long-term sequelae, including development of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMN), are just now surfacing. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from 87 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who were treated with intensive induction chemotherapy followed by ASCR between January 1991 and July 2011 following one of two institutional protocols: Chicago Pilot 1 (CP1; n = 12) and Chicago Pilot 2 (CP2; n = 75). RESULTS: The 15-year overall survival rate for all 87 patients was 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1-45.0%). The 10- and 15-year cumulative incidence of SMN was 16.5% (95%CI, 7.2-38.0%) and 34.2% (95%CI, 18.6-63.1%), respectively, without evidence of a plateau at 15 years. Six of the 10 patients (n = 2 in CP1 and n = 8 in CP2) who developed SMN had hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Solid tumors included thyroid papillary carcinoma, chondrosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and biliary adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: A significantly higher incidence of SMN, especially hematological malignancies, was observed in this cohort compared to older neuroblastoma studies, potentially due to exposure to epipodophyllotoxins and a high cumulative dose of alkylating agents these patients received. The risk of developing an SMN continued to increase with survival time and did not reach the plateau at 15 years. Although the number of the patients is relatively small, our study emphasizes the need for life-long follow-up of survivors who were treated using modern therapy.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Martin, Alissa', 'Schneiderman, Jennifer', 'Helenowski, Irene B', 'Morgan, Elaine', 'Dilley, Kimberley', 'Danner-Koptik, Karina', 'Hatahet, Mohamad', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki', 'Cohn, Susan L', 'Kletzel, Morris', 'Hijiya, Nobuko']","['Martin A', 'Schneiderman J', 'Helenowski IB', 'Morgan E', 'Dilley K', 'Danner-Koptik K', 'Hatahet M', 'Shimada H', 'Cohn SL', 'Kletzel M', 'Hijiya N']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology/Stem Cell Transplant, Ann and Robert H.

A previous study revealed that LEDGF/p75 dynamically scans the chromatin, and upon interaction with HIV-1 integrase, their complex is locked on chromatin. At present, it is not known whether LEDGF/p75-mediated chromatin locking is typical for interacting proteins. Here, we employed continuous photobleaching and fluorescence correlation and cross-correlation spectroscopy to investigate in vivo chromatin binding of JPO2, a LEDGF/p75- and c-Myc-interacting protein involved in transcriptional regulation. In the absence of LEDGF/p75, JPO2 performs chromatin scanning inherent to transcription factors. However, whereas the dynamics of JPO2 chromatin binding are decelerated upon interaction with LEDGF/p75, very strong locking of their complex onto chromatin is absent. Similar results were obtained with the domesticated transposase PogZ, another cellular interaction partner of LEDGF/p75. We furthermore show that diffusive JPO2 can oligomerize; that JPO2 and LEDGF/p75 interact directly and specifically in vivo through the specific interaction domain of JPO2 and the C-terminal domain of LEDGF/p75, comprising the integrase-binding domain; and that modulation of JPO2 dynamics requires a functional PWWP domain in LEDGF/p75. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the LEDGF/p75-chromatin interaction depend on the specific partner and that strong chromatin locking is not a property of all LEDGF/p75-binding proteins.",,"['Hendrix, Jelle', 'van Heertum, Bart', 'Vanstreels, Els', 'Daelemans, Dirk', 'De Rijck, Jan']","['Hendrix J', 'van Heertum B', 'Vanstreels E', 'Daelemans D', 'De Rijck J']","['From the Laboratory for Photochemistry and Spectroscopy, Department of Chemistry, University of Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140314,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transposases/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4007443,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chromatin', 'Coactivator Transcription', 'Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy', 'Integrase', 'JPO2', 'LEDGF/p75', 'PogZ', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein-Protein Interactions', 'Transcription Factors']",2014/03/19 06:00,2014/08/03 06:00,['2014/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)41438-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M113.525964 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2014 May 2;289(18):12494-506. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M113.525964.

Each of these subunits contain chromatin reader domains that recognize specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histone tails, and this recognition directs the MOZ HAT complex to specific chromatin substrates.

This study investigates SMNs in patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma at our institution. METHODS: Records of 646 patients treated for neuroblastoma at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between 1961 and 2005 were reviewed. Data from patients with SMNs were analyzed and the 20- and 30-year cumulative incidence of SMNs and standardized incidence ratio were calculated. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had a SMN. The 20- and 30-year cumulative incidences of a SMN were 2.6%+/-0.7% and 4.6%+/-1.1%, respectively. The standardized incidence ratio was 8.3 (95% confidence interval, 5.0-13.0). Five patients developed a SMN within 5 years from diagnosis. The median latency for the development of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n=4), sarcomas (n=7), and carcinomas (n=5) were 3.6, 9, and 24.2 years, respectively. Nine patients died from their SMN, including all with acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neuroblastoma have an increased risk of secondary neoplasia. Modification of risk-adapted therapies will likely alter the affected patient population and the incidence of SMNs. Future studies are necessary to link SMNs to treatment exposures and to evaluate the risk of SMNs beyond 30 years from diagnosis.",,"['Federico, Sara M', 'Allewelt, Heather B', 'Spunt, Sheri L', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Jenkins, Jesse', 'Santana, Victor M', 'Furman, Wayne L', 'McGregor, Lisa M']","['Federico SM', 'Allewelt HB', 'Spunt SL', 'Hudson MM', 'Wu J', 'Billups CA', 'Jenkins J', 'Santana VM', 'Furman WL', 'McGregor LM']","[""Departments of *Oncology section signBiostatistics parallelPathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center, Memphis, TN double daggerDepartment of Oncology, Duke University, Durham, NC.""]",['eng'],"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA023944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neuroblastoma/*complications', 'Risk']",PMC4266626,['NIHMS566696'],,,2014/03/19 06:00,2015/02/26 06:00,['2014/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000000148 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2015 Jan;37(1):e6-e12. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000148.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: When comparing high versus low physical activity levels, the RR for non-Hodgkin lymphoma was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00), for Hodgkin lymphoma it was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.58-1.26), for leukemia it was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-1.13), and for multiple myeloma it was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.68-1.09). When focusing on subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the RR for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80-1.14) and for follicular lymphoma it was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.83-1.22). In an exploratory analysis combining all hematologic cancers, high versus low physical activity levels yielded a statistically significant RR of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.88-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity showed statistically nonsignificant associations with risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. These findings may not represent a true lack of associations given the variation in high versus low physical activity definitions, the quality of physical activity assessments, and the variability in hematologic cancer classification schemes in individual studies. IMPACT: Physical activity is unrelated to risks of subtype-specific hematologic cancers.",['(c)2014 AACR.'],"['Jochem, Carmen', 'Leitzmann, Michael F', 'Keimling, Marlen', 'Schmid, Daniela', 'Behrens, Gundula']","['Jochem C', 'Leitzmann MF', 'Keimling M', 'Schmid D', 'Behrens G']","[""Authors' Affiliation: Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20140314,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*etiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Prognosis']",,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/12/23 06:00,['2014/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-13-0699 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0699 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2014 May;23(5):833-46. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0699.

Here we show using metabolomics that CO-sensitive methylation of PFKFB3, an enzyme producing fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), serves as a switch to activate phosphofructokinase-1, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme. In human leukaemia U937 cells, PFKFB3 is asymmetrically di-methylated at R131 and R134 through modification by protein arginine methyltransferase 1. HO-1 induction or CO results in reduced methylation of PFKFB3 in varied cancer cells to suppress F-2,6-BP, shifting glucose utilization from glycolysis toward the pentose phosphate pathway. Loss of PFKFB3 methylation depends on the inhibitory effects of CO on haem-containing cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). CBS modulates remethylation metabolism, and increases NADPH to supply reduced glutathione, protecting cells from oxidative stress and anti-cancer reagents. Once the methylation of PFKFB3 is reduced, the protein undergoes polyubiquitination and is degraded in the proteasome. These results suggest that the CO/CBS-dependent regulation of PFKFB3 methylation determines directional glucose utilization to ensure resistance against oxidative stress for cancer cell survival.",,"['Yamamoto, Takehiro', 'Takano, Naoharu', 'Ishiwata, Kyoko', 'Ohmura, Mitsuyo', 'Nagahata, Yoshiko', 'Matsuura, Tomomi', 'Kamata, Aki', 'Sakamoto, Kyoko', 'Nakanishi, Tsuyoshi', 'Kubo, Akiko', 'Hishiki, Takako', 'Suematsu, Makoto']","['Yamamoto T', 'Takano N', 'Ishiwata K', 'Ohmura M', 'Nagahata Y', 'Matsuura T', 'Kamata A', 'Sakamoto K', 'Nakanishi T', 'Kubo A', 'Hishiki T', 'Suematsu M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] MS Business Unit, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto 604-8511, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan [2] Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO), Suematsu Gas Biology Project, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140317,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Down-Regulation', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', '*Pentose Phosphate Pathway', 'Phosphofructokinase-2/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3959213,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/03/18 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms4480 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms4480 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2014 Mar 17;5:3480. doi: 10.1038/ncomms4480.,,"['EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'EC 2.7.1.105 (PFKFB3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.105 (Phosphofructokinase-2)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we investigated WNT pathway activation in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients. To evaluate the potential role of WNT signaling in T-cell leukomogenesis, we performed expression analysis of key components of WNT pathway. More than 85% of the childhood T-ALL patients showed upregulated beta-catenin expression at the protein level compared with normal human thymocytes. The impact of this upregulation was reflected in high expression of known target genes (AXIN2, c-MYC, TCF1 and LEF). Especially AXIN2, the universal target gene of WNT pathway, was upregulated at both mRNA and protein levels in approximately 40% of the patients. When beta-CATENIN gene was silenced by small interfering RNA, the cancer cells showed higher rates of apoptosis. These results demonstrate that abnormal WNT signaling activation occurs in a significant fraction of human T-ALL cases independent of known T-ALL risk factors.

Since their discovery nearly 20 years ago, Aurora kinases have been studied extensively in cell and cancer biology. Several early studies found that Aurora kinases are amplified and overexpressed at the transcript and protein level in various malignancies, including several types of leukemia. These discoveries and others provided a rationale for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of Aurora kinases as leukemia therapies. The first generation of Aurora kinase inhibitors did not fare well in clinical trials, owing to poor efficacy and high toxicity. However, the creation of second-generation, highly selective Aurora kinase inhibitors has increased the enthusiasm for targeting these proteins in leukemia.

Bifunctional (HN2) and monofunctional (HN1) nitrogen are two such agents, and HN2 was the first drug successfully employed in anti-leukemia chemotherapy. Currently, HN2 is used either alone or combined with other drugs to treat Hodgkin's disease. It is well known that several crosslinking agents require metabolic activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) to exert their lethal effects. The objective of this work was therefore to determine whether the abovementioned mustards would also require metabolic activation to exert lethal action against Escherichia coli. For this purpose, we measured survival following exposure to HN2 in E. coli strains that were deficient in nucleotide excision repair (uvrA NER mutant), base excision repair (xthA nfo nth fpg BER mutant) or superoxide dismutase (sodAB mutant) activity. We also performed the same experiments in cells pretreated with an iron chelator (2,2'-dipyridyl, DIP). The NER and BER mutants were only sensitive to HN2 treatment (survival rates similar to those of the wild-type were achieved with 5-fold lower HN2 doses). However, wild-type and sodAB strains were not sensitive to treatment with HN2. In all tested strains, survival dropped by 2.5-fold following pretreatment with DIP compared to treatment with HN2 alone. Furthermore, DIP treatment increased ROS generation in both wild type and sodAB-deficient strains. Based on these data and on the survival of the SOD-deficient strain, we suggest that the increased production of ROS caused by Fe(2+) chelation may potentiate the lethal effects of HN2 but not HN1. This potentiation may arise as a consequence of enhancement in the number of or modification of the type of lesions formed. No sensitization was observed for the non-crosslinkable HN2 analog, HN1.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

The omic data are large-scale and high-throughput data. Such data challenge traditional statistical methodologies and require multiple tests. Several multiple-testing procedures such as Bonferroni procedure, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure and Westfall-Young procedure have been developed, among which some control family-wise error rate and the others control false discovery rate (FDR). These procedures are valid in some cases and cannot be applied to all types of large-scale data. To address this statistically challenging problem in the analysis of the omic data, we propose a general method for generating a set of multiple-testing procedures. This method is based on the BH theorems. By choosing a C-value, one can realize a specific multiple-testing procedure. For example, by setting C = 1.22, our method produces the BH procedure. With C < 1.22, our method generates procedures of weakly controlling FDR, and with C > 1.22, the procedures strongly control FDR. Those with C = G (number of genes or tests) and C = 0 are, respectively, the Bonferroni procedure and the single-testing procedure. These are the two extreme procedures in this family. To let one choose an appropriate multiple-testing procedure in practice, we develop an algorithm by which FDR can be correctly and reliably estimated. Simulated results show that our method works well for an accurate estimation of FDR in various scenarios, and we illustrate the applications of our method with three real datasets.

Among many sources of multidimensional genomic data, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides the public with comprehensive profiling data on >30 cancer types, making it an ideal test bed for conducting and comparing different analyses. In this article, the analysis goal is to apply several existing methods and associate multidimensional genomic measurements with cancer outcomes in particular prognosis, with special focus on the predictive power of genomic signatures. We exploit clinical data and four types of genomic measurement including mRNA gene expression, DNA methylation, microRNA and copy number alterations for breast invasive carcinoma, glioblastoma multiforme, acute myeloid leukemia and lung squamous cell carcinoma collected by TCGA. To accommodate the high dimensionality, we extract important features using Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), which are representative of dimension reduction and variable selection techniques and have been extensively adopted, and fit Cox survival models with combined important features. We calibrate the predictive power of each type of genomic measurement for the prognosis of four cancer types and find that the results vary across cancers. Our analysis also suggests that for most of the cancers in our study and the adopted methods, there is no substantial improvement in prediction when adding other genomic measurement after gene expression and clinical covariates have been included in the model. This is consistent with the findings that molecular features measured at the transcription level affect clinical outcomes more directly than those measured at the DNA/epigenetic level.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Recently, genistein and quercetin were reported to potentiate ATO-provoked apoptosis in leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Genistein acted via enhanced ROS generation and quercetin via glutathione depletion. Searching for potential strategies for the treatment of malignant gliomas in this study the capacity of these flavonoids to sensitize rat C6 astroglioma cells for the cytotoxic action of ATO was investigated. ATO inhibited cell growth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. This effect was accompanied neither by enhanced radical generation nor lipid peroxidation and was not attributed to apoptosis. ATO treatment concentration-dependently increased glutathione levels. Genistein enhanced radical generation. Combined with ATO it inhibited cell growth additively. Additivity was also obtained after cotreatment with ATO and H2O2. Quercetin acted antagonistically on ATO-induced growth inhibition. Quercetin increased glutathione levels. In contrast, buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO) depleted cellular glutathione and acted synergistically with ATO. In conclusion, in C6 cells neither genistein nor quercetin are suited as sensitizing agent, in contrast to BSO. Depletion of cellular glutathione content rather than an increase of ROS generation plays a central role in the enhancement of ATO-toxicity in C6 cells.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, we examined the anti-tumor activity of the fermented culture broth of Antrodia salmonea (AS) in vitro and in vivo and revealed its underlying molecular mechanism of action. RESULTS: Treatment of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells with AS (50-150 mug/mL) significantly reduced cell viability and caused G1 arrest via the inhibition of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclin D1, CDK4, cyclin E, cyclin A, and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (p-Rb). Furthermore, AS treatment induced apoptosis, which was associated with DNA fragmentation, followed by a sequence of events, including intracellular ROS generation; mitochondrial dysfunction; Fas ligand activation; cytochrome c release; caspase-3, -8, -9, and PARP activation; and Bcl-2/Bax dysregulation. The results of the in vitro study suggested that AS-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells was mediated by both the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. Furthermore, we found that AS treatment was effective in delaying tumor incidence in HL-60 xenografted nude mice and reducing tumor burden.

International guidelines are sometimes conflicting, exclude certain patient groups, or cannot directly be applied to the German health system. This guideline by the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) of the German Society of Haematology and Medical Oncology (DGHO) gives evidence-based recommendations for the use of G-CSF, pegylated G-CSF, and biosimilars to prevent infectious complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, including those with haematological malignancies. METHODS: We systematically searched and evaluated current evidence. An expert panel discussed the results and recommendations. We then compared our recommendations to current international guidelines. RESULTS: We summarised the data from eligible studies in evidence tables, developed recommendations for different entities and risk groups. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive literature search and expert panel consensus confirmed many key recommendations given by international guidelines. Evidence for growth factors during acute myeloid leukaemia induction chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim use in haematological malignancies was rated lower compared with other guidelines.","['(c) The Author 2014.

These patients were followed for a median of 24.5 months (range, 8 to 60 months). A total of 236 BM samples were collected and analyzed. Of these, 230 were monitored concurrently for minimal residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry (FCM) for leukemia-associated aberrant immune phenotypes and by RQ-PCR for the expression of the Wilms tumor (WT1) gene. The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse in patients who experienced MLL-positive patients (MLL > .0000%) (n = 9) after HSCT was 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87% to 100%) compared with 12.5% (95% CI, 5.6% to 19.4%) for MLL-negative patients (n = 31) (P < .001). For these 2 patient groups, the 3-year overall survival (OS) was 12.5% (95% CI, .8% to 24.2%) and 77.8% (95% CI, 68.4% to 87.2%) (P < .001), respectively, and the 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 0% and 72.2% (95% CI, 61.1% to 83.3%), respectively (P < .001). MLL positivity was associated with a higher rate of relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 18.643; 95% CI, 3.449 to 57.025; P = .001), lower LFS (HR, 7.267; 95% CI, 2.038 to 25.916; P = .002), and lower OS (HR, 8.259; 95% CI, 2.109 to 32.336; P = .002), as determined by Cox multivariate analysis. The expression of the MLL gene had a higher specificity and sensitivity than WT1 or MRD monitored by FCM for predicting the relapse of the patients with MLL + AL. Our results suggest that monitoring the expression of the MLL gene may help to identify patients with MLL + AL who are at high risk of relapse after allo-HSCT and may provide a guide for suitable intervention.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The Gruppo Italiano Trapianto Midollo Osseo (GITMO) prospectively registered data on 1858 consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT between 2008 and 2010. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for proven/probable IFD (PP-IFD) during the early (days 0 to 40), late (days 41 to 100), and very late (days 101 to 365) phases after allo-HSCT and to evaluate the impact of PP-IFDs on 1-year overall survival. The cumulative incidence of PP-IFDs was 5.1% at 40 days, 6.7% at 100 days, and 8.8% at 12 months post-transplantation. Multivariate analysis identified the following variables as associated with PP-IFDs: transplant from an unrelated volunteer donor or cord blood, active acute leukemia at the time of transplantation, and an IFD before transplantation in the early phase; transplant from an unrelated volunteer donor or cord blood and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the late phase; and grade II-IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD in the very late phase. The risk for PP-IFD was significantly higher when acute GVHD was followed by chronic GVHD and when acute GVHD occurred in patients undergoing transplantation with grafts from other than matched related donors. The presence of PP-IFD was an independent factor in long-term survival (hazard ratio, 2.90; 95% confidence interval, 2.32 to 3.62; P < .0001). Our findings indicate that tailored prevention strategies may be useful in subpopulations at differing levels of risk for PP-IFDs.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: We recruited 103 children with ALL and their 96 parents, and divided them into five groups according to disease phase: diagnosis, initial remission, active treatment, survival and relapsing. We compared these to 22 healthy controls and their parents. Patients and controls were subjected to clinical assessments, the symptoms checklist of the International Classification of Disease ICD (ICD-10), and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children The parents of patients and controls underwent a general health questionnaire, the ICD-10 symptoms checklist, rating scales for anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) assessment scale, and the physical cognitive affective social economic ego problems (PCASEE) questionnaire for quality of life (QOL) rating. RESULTS: Psychiatric morbidity was evident in nearly 60% of leukemic children and their parents and was significantly increased in comparison to controls. Children mostly suffered from adjustment and oppositional defiant disorders. The most common discriminators between patient groups were conduct and attention problems being lowest in newly diagnosed patients, and social aggression being lowest in patients in remission. The three parameters were highest in relapsed patients whose parents mostly had adjustment and depressive disorders. Risk factors for child psychopathology were older age, female gender, and parental psychopathology. Mothers and parents with lower education and professional level were found to be vulnerable. Performance and total intelligence quotient (IQ) were significantly lower in leukemic children, and these were most pronounced in the survivor group. Risk factors for cognitive dysfunction were younger age, longer chemotherapy duration, and lower parental education level. CONCLUSION: Most patients and their caregivers suffered from significant psychiatric morbidity, highlighting the need for routine screening to improve psychological outcomes in such cases.","['Copyright (c) 2014 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

Unfortunately, many patients show relapse or progression in heterogeneous patterns. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively evaluated patterns of relapse or progression after bortezomib-based salvage therapy in patients with MM and analyzed prognostic significance according to patterns of relapse or progression. One hundred forty-eight patients were treated with bortezomib-based therapy between November 2004 and April 2012. Of these patients, 104 (70.3%) patients relapsed or progressed after bortezomib-based salvage therapy. We divided the patterns of relapse or progression to the 2 groups: (1) the isoform relapse or progression (group A) in 89 (85.6%) patients as disease findings at initiation of bortezomib-based therapy; and (2) transformed relapse or progression (group B) in 15 (14.4%) patients (plasmacytoma, n = 7; light chain escape, n = 6; and plasma cell leukemia, n = 2) different from initial disease findings. RESULTS: Median overall survival in group A and group B were 32.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.3-44.1) and 10.7 months (95% CI, 2.0-19.4) (P < .001), respectively. CONCLUSION: MM patients who relapsed or progressed as the transformed pattern for bortezomib-based salvage therapy have an extremely poor prognosis and might require new innovative approaches.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The failure to achieve molecular negativity shortly after starting TKI has been demonstrated to be predictive of relapse, suggesting that an accurate measurement of low BCR-ABL1 levels may have a role in preventing hematological relapse. Despite the big efforts made by many European laboratories within the European Study Group, at the time of writing a standardized procedure to quantify and express results is still missing for BCR-ABL1-positive ALL. In this study, in order to detect with high sensitivity low levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts, we used a new technology and a new molecular approach based on microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) using Taqman chemistry and we compared obtained results with those generated by the conventional method based on reverse transcriptase PCR reaction (RQ-PCR) for BCR-ABL1 and total ABL1, with TaqMan chemistry and with Applied Biosystems instrument. We demonstrated the dPCR is high-sensitive (able to detect a single copy of BCR-ABL1) and reliable (results are comparable to those obtained by BCR-ABL1 quantification with conventional technology), allowing an accurate monitoring of BCR-ABL1-positive ALL patients in complete remission.",['Copyright (c) 2014.

The BCR-ABL protein has a constitutive tyrosine kinase activity which is responsible for CML pathogenesis by promoting cell apoptosis resistance; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with BCR-ABL expression and apoptosis impairment in CML leukemic cells have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: This study evaluated apoptomiRs and their predicted apoptotic genes in BCR-ABL(+) cells from patients in different phases of CML treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) according to their imatinib (IM) response by qPCR. Phosphotyrosine and c-ABL expressions in HL-60.BCR-ABL cells treated with TKI were done by Western blot. RESULTS: We found that dasatinib (DAS) modulated miR-let-7d, miR-let-7e, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-21, miR-130a and miR-142-3p expressions while IM modulated miR-15a and miR-130a levels. miR-16, miR-130a and miR-145 expressions were modulated by nilotinib (NIL). We observed higher miR-15a, miR-130b and miR-145; and lower miR-16, miR-26a and miR-146a expressions in CML-CP in comparison with controls. CML-AP patients showed low miR-let-7d, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-29c, miR-142-3p, miR-145, and miR-146a levels in comparison with CML-CP. We noted that the miR-26a, miR-29c, miR-130b and miR-146a expressions were downregulated in IM resistant patients in comparison with IM responsive patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the modulation of apoptomiRs by BCR-ABL kinase activity and the deregulation of apoptomiRs and their predicted apoptotic target genes in different CML phases and after treatment with TK inhibitors. ApoptomiRs may be involved in the BCR-ABL(+) cell apoptosis regulation.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Mutations in PTPN11 lead to several distinct human diseases. Germ-line PTPN11 mutations cause about 50% of Noonan Syndrome (NS), which is among the most common autosomal dominant disorders. LEOPARD Syndrome (LS) is an acronym for its major syndromic manifestations: multiple Lentigines, Electrocardiographic abnormalities, Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary stenosis, Abnormalities of genitalia, Retardation of growth, and sensorineural Deafness. Frequently, LS patients have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and they might also have an increased risk of neuroblastoma (NS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with the distinct pathogenesis of NS and LS, different types of PTPN11 mutations cause these disorders. RESULTS: Although multiple studies have reported the biochemical and biological consequences of NS- and LS-associated PTPN11 mutations, their structural consequences have not been analyzed fully. Here we report the crystal structures of WT SHP2 and five NS/LS-associated SHP2 mutants. These findings enable direct structural comparisons of the local conformational changes caused by each mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Our structural analysis agrees with, and provides additional mechanistic insight into, the previously reported catalytic properties of these mutants. The results of our research provide new information regarding the structure-function relationship of this medically important target, and should serve as a solid foundation for structure-based drug discovery programs.",,"['Qiu, Wei', 'Wang, Xiaonan', 'Romanov, Vladimir', 'Hutchinson, Ashley', 'Lin, Andres', 'Ruzanov, Maxim', 'Battaile, Kevin P', 'Pai, Emil F', 'Neel, Benjamin G', 'Chirgadze, Nickolay Y']","['Qiu W', 'Wang X', 'Romanov V', 'Hutchinson A', 'Lin A', 'Ruzanov M', 'Battaile KP', 'Pai EF', 'Neel BG', 'Chirgadze NY']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, M5G 2C4, Canada. bneel@uhnresearch.ca.']",['eng'],['R37 CA49152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140314,England,BMC Struct Biol,BMC structural biology,101088689,IM,"['Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'LEOPARD Syndrome/*genetics/pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Noonan Syndrome/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*chemistry/*genetics']",PMC4007598,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/09/30 06:00,['2014/03/18 06:00'],"['2013/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1472-6807-14-10 [pii]', '10.1186/1472-6807-14-10 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Struct Biol. 2014 Mar 14;14:10. doi: 10.1186/1472-6807-14-10.,,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently developed a nanomicellar formulation of DNR that specifically targets acute myeloid leukemia stem cells. MATERIALS & METHODS: Pharmacokinetics analysis of free DNR, DNR in nanomicellar formulations was performed in Balb/c mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. Histochemical staining, caspase 3/7, troponin and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme were used to assess toxicity. RESULTS: Compared with free DNR, the nanomicellar formulations of DNR had less cardiotoxicity as evidenced by milder histopathological changes, lower caspase 3/7 activity in heart tissue (p = 0.002), lower plasma creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (p = 0.002) and troponin concentrations (p = 0.001) postinjection. The area under curve concentration of DNR in micelles increased by 31.9-fold in mice (p < 0.0001) and 22.0-fold higher in rats (p < 0.001).

The predictions are alarming. Some models predict 29,000 future cancers and 14,500 deaths in the US will be directly caused by 1 year's worth of CT scanning. However, there are very few clinical data to justify or refute these claims. Young children are theoretically highly susceptible to the damaging effects of radiation. In this study, the authors examined children who underwent CSF shunt placement before 6 years of age. The authors chose to study shunt-treated patients with the assumption that these patients would undergo future imaging, facilitating surveillance. They chose a study period of 1991-2001 to allow more than 10 years of follow-up data. METHODS: The authors studied 104 consecutive children who underwent CSF shunt placement prior to 6 years of age and who had at least 10 years of follow-up data. Sixty-two of these patients underwent shunt placement prior to 1 year of age. The age at the initial scanning session, the number of future CT scanning sessions, diagnosis, and results of any future studies were recorded. The age-specific radiation dose was calculated for children younger than 1 year. Children younger than 1 year at the time of shunt placement were evaluated separately, based on the assumption that they represented the highest risk cohort. The authors examined all data for any evidence of future leukemia or head/neck tumor (benign or malignant). RESULTS: These children underwent a total of 1584 CT scanning sessions over a follow-up period of 1622 person-years. A total of 517 scanning sessions were performed prior to 6 years of age, including 260 in the 1st year of life. Children who underwent shunt placement before 1 year of age underwent an average of 16.3 +/- 13.5 CT sessions (range 1-41). Children undergoing placement between 1 and 6 years of age received an average of 14.1 +/- 12.5 CT studies (range 5-52). There were no subsequent tumors (benign or malignant) or leukemia detected. CONCLUSIONS: Previously published models predict a significant number of future cancers directly caused by CT scanning. However, there are very few published clinical data. In the authors' study, zero future radiation-induced malignancies were detected after routine CT scanning in a high-risk group. While the authors do not consider their single-institution study adequate to define the actual risk, their data suggest that the overall risk is low. The authors hope this study encourages future collaborative efforts to define the actual risk to patients.",,"['White, Ian K', 'Shaikh, Kashif A', 'Moore, Reilin J', 'Bullis, Carli L', 'Sami, Mairaj T', 'Gianaris, Thomas J', 'Fulkerson, Daniel H']","['White IK', 'Shaikh KA', 'Moore RJ', 'Bullis CL', 'Sami MT', 'Gianaris TJ', 'Fulkerson DH']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Indiana University School of Medicine; and.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140314,United States,J Neurosurg Pediatr,Journal of neurosurgery.

However, only a few studies have reported its anticancer effects. In this study, extracts were obtained from alfalfa leaves and their cytotoxic effects were assessed on several sensitive and multidrug-resistant tumor cells lines. Using the mouse leukaemia P388 cell line and its doxorubicin-resistant counterpart (P388/DOX), we showed that the inhibition of cell growth induced by alfalfa leaf extracts was mediated through the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation analysis. The execution of programmed cell death was achieved via the activation of caspase-3, leading to PARP cleavage. Fractionation of toluene extract (To-1), the most active extract obtained from crude extract, led to the identification of 3 terpene derivatives and 5 flavonoids. Among them, (-)-medicarpin, (-)-melilotocarpan E, millepurpan, tricin, and chrysoeriol showed cytotoxic effects in P388 as well as P388/DOX cells.

Recently, a sesquiterpene lactone, parthenolide, and several other compounds containing an alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone skeleton have become topics of interest as potential antileukemic agents. The recent research emphasizes their selective activity against leukemia cells while the normal hematopoietic cells remain unaffected. In this review, we give a brief description of natural alpha-Methylene-gamma-lactones isolated from plants and their derivates with minor chemical modifications that possess anti-leukemic activity. We also discuss molecular mechanisms of action of these compounds, in particular, their selectivity against leukemia cells.",,"['Gach, Katarzyna', 'Janecka, Anna']","['Gach K', 'Janecka A']","['Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Mazowiecka 6/8, 92-215 Lodz, Poland. anna.janecka@umed.lodz.pl.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lactones/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Sesquiterpenes/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane/chemistry/therapeutic use']",,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/18 06:00'],"['2013/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2013/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2013/08/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-59619 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520614666140313095010 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2014 Jun;14(5):688-94. doi: 10.2174/1871520614666140313095010.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes, Guaiane)', '0 (micheliolide)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine biological function of NS in MOLT-4 cells as a human T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) model. METHODS: Efficacy of a specific small interference RNA on NS depletion was studied by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The growth rate and viability were analyzed by trypan blue exclusion test. Fluorescent microscopy was used for detecting apoptosis. Cell cycle and apoptosis were mechanistically studied by flow cytometry and western blotting. RESULTS: Knockdown of NS inhibited proliferation, arrested the cell cycle, and induced apoptosis through p53 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) pathways in MOLT-4 cells.

One reason is that they are not capable to effectively activate their intracellular cell death pathways. Novel treatments designed to overcome these deficiencies in cancer cells present promising concepts to eradicate chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells. One of these approaches includes the membrane seeking compound erucylphosphohomocholine (ErPC3) which is part of the latest generation of alkylphospholipid analogs developed over the last two-and-a-half decades. ErPC3 exerts potent antineoplastic effects in animal models and against established cancer cell lines including, for example, glioblastoma and different types of leukemia, while sparing their normal counterparts. Starting with a historical survey, we report here on the anticancer activity of ErPC3 and on ErPC3's established mechanisms of action. We cover the current knowledge on the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis by ErPC3, including its interaction with the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). In addition we discuss other signaling pathways modulated by ErPC3. Interaction with the TSPO leads to activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade. This includes cardiolipin oxidation at mitochondrial levels, collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and release of cytochrome c, the initiating steps of the mitochondrial apoptosis cascade. Other pathways modulated by ErPC3 include different kinases for the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and the MAP kinase pathways. Furthermore, ErPC3's cytotoxic actions may include its effects on phosphatidylcholine synthesis to inhibit the endoplasmic reticulum enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidyltransferase. These basic research data hopefully will lead to effective approaches toward exploitation of ErPC3 for the treatment of cancer.",,"['Veenman, Leo', 'Gavish, Moshe', 'Kugler, Wilfried']","['Veenman L', 'Gavish M', 'Kugler W']","['Abteilung Padiatrie I, Zentrum Kinderheilkunde und Jugendmedizin, Robert-Koch-Str. 40, D- 37075 Gottingen, present address: Fluoron GmbH, Magirus-Deutz-Str. 10, D-89077 Ulm. wilfried.kugler@fluoron.de.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Erucic Acids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Glioblastoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, GABA/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,,,2014/03/19 06:00,2014/10/29 06:00,['2014/03/18 06:00'],"['2012/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2012/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2013/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-59573 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520614666140309230338 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2014 May;14(4):559-77. doi: 10.2174/1871520614666140309230338.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Erucic Acids)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, GABA)', '0 (TSPO protein, human)', '0 (erucylphosphohomocholine ErPC3)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different aspects of cellular activities like cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation are regulated by miRNAs through their regulatory effects on particular RNA species. In many tumors, up- or down-regulation of different miRNAs has been reported. In acute myeloid leukemia, up-regulation of miR-92a has been reported in human in-vitro studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed inhibition of miR-92a in an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60), using locked nucleic acid (LNA) Antagomir. At different time points after LNA-anti-miR92a transfection, qRT-Real-Time-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Annexin-V/Propidium Iodide staining were performed and the data was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: The assessment of the apoptosis and necrosis indicates that miR-92a inhibition can decrease the viable HL-60 cells and this is at least partially due to induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the inhibition of miR-92a as a novel approach for treatment of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL).",,"['Sharifi, Mohammadreza', 'Salehi, Rasoul', 'Gheisari, Yousof', 'Kazemi, Mohammad']","['Sharifi M', 'Salehi R', 'Gheisari Y', 'Kazemi M']","['Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Pediatric Inherited Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Pediatric Inherited Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Pediatric Inherited Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Pediatric Inherited Diseases Research Center, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140127,India,Adv Biomed Res,Advanced biomedical research,101586897,,,PMC3950842,,['NOTNLM'],"['MicroRNA', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'locked nucleic acid', 'miR-92a']",2014/03/15 06:00,2014/03/15 06:01,['2014/03/15 06:00'],"['2012/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2012/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/2277-9175.125826 [doi]', 'ABR-3-61 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Biomed Res. 2014 Jan 27;3:61. doi: 10.4103/2277-9175.125826. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, unclear, however, whether aCML-associated features are distinctive enough to allow its separation from unclassifiable MDS/MPN (MDS/MPN-U). To study these 2 rare entities, 134 patient archives were collected from 7 large medical centers, of which 65 (49%) cases were further classified as aCML and the remaining 69 (51%) as MDS/MPN-U. Distinctively, aCML was associated with many adverse features and an inferior overall survival (12.4 vs 21.8 months, P = .004) and AML-free survival (11.2 vs 18.9 months, P = .003). The aCML defining features of leukocytosis and circulating myeloid precursors, but not dysgranulopoiesis, were independent negative predictors. Other factors, such as lactate dehydrogenase, circulating myeloblasts, platelets, and cytogenetics could further stratify MDS/MPN-U but not aCML patient risks. aCML appeared to have more mutated RAS (7/20 [35%] vs 4/29 [14%]) and less JAK2p.V617F (3/42 [7%] vs 10/52 [19%]), but was not statistically significant.

The full-blown syndrome consists of unexplained fever, weight gain, dyspnea with pulmonary infiltrates, pleuropericardial effusion, hypotension, and renal failure. Most measures currently used for management of DS have very little evidence-based support, and therefore, many remain controversial. Despite the lack of evidence supporting DS prophylaxis, several groups have adopted a preventive strategy with corticosteroids, especially for patients with leukocyte levels higher than from 5 to 10 x 10(9)/L. DS diagnosis should be suspected in the presence of any of the above-mentioned signs and symptoms, and preemptive treatment with dexamethasone should be started immediately.

A subset of patients has 5q deletion (del(5q)) as the culprit pathogenetic trigger. Del(5q) affects critical regions 5q31 and 5q33, leading to gene haplodeficiency with subsequent RPS14 haplodeficiency and P53 activation. Subsequent to P53 activation, erythroid cell apoptosis and ineffective erythropoiesis occur. Other pathogenetic elements include protein phosphatase 2a and CDC25C haplodeficiency and decreased miR-145 and miR-146a expression. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent that selectively suppresses the del(5q) clone. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is associated with diverse molecular changes including stabilization of MDM2 with subsequent enhanced P53 degradation. Lenalidomide showed success in low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS as reported in the 002, 003, and 004 trials. However, in higher-risk MDS, the results of lenalidomide monotherapy were modest, mandating the use of combination therapy. The role and priority of lenalidomide varies between different guidelines, and accordingly, future efforts are necessary to reach a unified therapeutic algorithm. TP53 mutations are important predictors of AML progression and possible resistance to lenalidomide. It is recommended to identify TP53 mutation early in the disease since it may change the decision regarding choice of therapy.

In lower organisms, the small interfering RNA and miRNA pathways diverge due in part to sorting mechanisms that direct distinct small RNA (sRNA) duplexes onto specific Ago-RISCs. However, such sorting mechanisms appear to be lost in mammals. miRNAs appear not to distinguish among Ago1-4. To determine the effect of viral infection on the sorting system, we compared the content of deep-sequenced RNA extracted from immunoprecipitation experiments with the Ago1 and Ago2 proteins using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected cells. Consistent with previous observations, sequence tags derived from miRNA loci in EBV and humans globally associate in approximately equivalent amounts with Ago1 and Ago2. Interestingly, additional sRNAs, which have not been registered as miRNAs, were associated with Ago1. Among them, some unique sequence tags derived from tandem loci in the human genome associate exclusively with Ago1 but not, or rarely, with Ago2. This is supported by the observation that the expression of the unique sRNAs in the cells is highly dependent on Ago1 proteins. When we knocked down Ago1, the expression of the Ago1-specific sRNAs decreased dramatically. Most importantly, the Ago1-specific sRNAs bound to mRNAs and regulated target genes and were dramatically upregulated, depending on the EBV life cycle. Therefore, even in mammals, the sorting mechanism in the Ago1-4 family is functional. Moreover, the existence of Ago1-specific sRNAs implies vital roles in some aspects of mammalian biology.",,"['Yamakawa, Natsuko', 'Okuyama, Kazuki', 'Ogata, Jun', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Helwak, Aleksandra', 'Takamatsu, Masako', 'Imadome, Ken-ichi', 'Takakura, Kohei', 'Chanda, Bidisha', 'Kurosaki, Natsumi', 'Yamamoto, Haruna', 'Ando, Kiyoshi', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Kotani, Ai']","['Yamakawa N', 'Okuyama K', 'Ogata J', 'Kanai A', 'Helwak A', 'Takamatsu M', 'Imadome K', 'Takakura K', 'Chanda B', 'Kurosaki N', 'Yamamoto H', 'Ando K', 'Matsui H', 'Inaba T', 'Kotani A']","['Department of Regenerative Medicine, Division of Basic Clinical Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa 259-1193, Japan, Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan, Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell Biology, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH9 3JR, UK, Department of Infectious Diseases, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo 157-0074, Japan, Department of Biosciences, School of Science, Kitasato University, Kanagawa 252-0373, Japan, Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa 259-1193, Japan and Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Saitama 332-0012, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140313,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Argonaute Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/growth & development/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Untranslated/chemistry/classification/*metabolism', 'Ribonuclease III/metabolism']",PMC4005649,,,,2014/03/15 06:00,2014/07/23 06:00,['2014/03/15 06:00'],"['2014/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['gku137 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gku137 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2014 Apr;42(8):5289-301. doi: 10.1093/nar/gku137.

In the specific case of CML, a better understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disease has led to a targeted therapy. The presence of chromosome Philadelphia, t(9;22)(q34;11) results in the oncogene BCR-ABL, which characterizes the disease; this molecular rearrangement gives rise to a tyrosine-kinase, which in turn triggers the proliferation of the myeloid line through the activation of the signaling pathways downstream. Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have altered the therapy and monitoring of CML patients and improved both their prognosis and quality of life. In 2005, various groups of investigators described a new point mutation of the gene JAK2 associated to MPNs.

Thus, we aimed to explore the expression and function of miR-143 in leukemia cells. miR-143 expression was assessed in bone marrow samples from 63 leukemia patients and 15 healthy controls using q-PCR, and its correlation with DNMT3A expression was determined. In addition, after lentiviral-mediated miR-143 overexpression, K562 cell proliferation was evaluated using CCK-8 analysis; cell cycle progression and apoptosis were determined using flow cytometry. The expression of Bcl-2 and pro-caspase-3 and -9 was assessed by q-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. Leukemia patients had significantly lower relative miR-143 expression than healthy controls (P=0.004), and the expression levels of miR143 and DNMTA3A were negatively correlated (r=-0.663, P=0.001). Overexpression of miR-143 decreased DNMT3A mRNA and protein expression, and significantly reduced K562 cell proliferation at 72 and 96 h (both P </= 0.018). In addition, reduced colony formation and cell cycle progression were observed upon miR-143 overexpression. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the early apoptosis rate was higher in the miR-143 group than the rate in the NC group. Bcl-2 mRNA expression and pro-caspase-3 and -9 protein expression were reduced in the miR-143-expressing cells.

AIM: Identify most frequent oral manifestations in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia under chemotherapy treatment. METHODOLOGY: The research was conducted on the electronic database PubMed/Medline, Science Direct, Scielo and Scopus. It has been sought papers with full presentation, wrote in Portuguese, English and Spanish, published between January 1992 and April 2013. RESULTS: From studies primarily selected, only eight met the criteria of inclusion. All studies performed intraoral examinations to diagnose oral lesions. According to results, the most frequent lesions were mucositis, candidiasis, periodontitis and gingivitis.

Recent studies have that Nrf2 activation may be the result of an increase in Nrf2 protein stability. Mangiferin (MA), a compound monomer extracted from the mango plant, has antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. Our previous study demonstrated that MA increased Nrf2 expression and activated Nrf2 signaling in hematopoietic cells. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which MA increases Nrf2 expression in human HL60 myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. Our western blot analysis results revealed that MA markedly increased Nrf2 expression in dose- and time-dependent manner. However treatment with MA did not affect the Nrf2 mRNA level. The results of cycloheximide (CHX)-chase analysis demonstrated that the Nrf2 protein half-life was prolonged to 58 min when the HL60 cells were pre-incubated with 50 microM MA for 4 h, whereas its half-life was only 20 min in the non-MA treated control cells. Further experiments revealed that MA mainly enhanced non-ubiquitinated Nrf2 protein levels when increasing Nrf2 protein stability; these effects differed from those induced by the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. Subsequent immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that MA inhibited Nrf2 ubiquitination in HL60 cells. These results provide evidence that MA increases Nrf2 protein stability by inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation in hematopoietic cells. This may be one of the mechanisms through which MA activates the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response and exerts cytoprotective effects.",,"['Zhao, Jie', 'Zhang, Benping', 'Li, Shanshan', 'Zeng, Linglan', 'Chen, Yan', 'Fang, Jun']","['Zhao J', 'Zhang B', 'Li S', 'Zeng L', 'Chen Y', 'Fang J']","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, P.R.

METHODS: A search in Medline, Lilacs, and SciELO scientific publication databases initially using the descriptors ""childhood leukemia"" and ""infection"" and later searching for the words ""childhood leukemia"" and ""maternal infection or disease"" or ""breastfeeding"" or ""daycare attendance"" or ""vaccination"" resulted in 62 publications that met the following inclusion criteria: subject aged </= 15 years; specific analysis of cases diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or total leukemia; exposure assessment of mothers' or infants' to infections (or proxy of infection), and risk of leukemia. RESULTS: Overall, 23 studies that assessed infections in children support the hypothesis that occurrence of infection during early childhood reduces the risk of leukemia, but there are disagreements within and between studies. The evaluation of exposure to infection by indirect measures showed evidence of reduced risk of leukemia associated mainly with daycare attendance. More than 50.0% of the 16 studies that assessed maternal exposure to infection observed increased risk of leukemia associated with episodes of influenza, pneumonia, chickenpox, herpes zoster, lower genital tract infection, skin disease, sexually transmitted diseases, Epstein-Barr virus, and Helicobacter pylori .

To date, there is no conclusive evidence that TP53 is the critical gene. Furthermore, the functional effect of TP53 haploinsufficiency is not well characterized. By utilizing human myeloma cell lines, we showed that TP53 hemizygous loss was associated with decreased basal expression level with a partially or severely inactivated p53 response upon genotoxic and non-genotoxic stress. The pathway deficiency was manifested as defective p53 transcriptional activities, together with significant resistance to apoptosis. In some cases with p53 WT/- and no p53 protein expression, the remaining allele was silenced by promoter hypermethylation. We also developed a p53 target gene signature to summarize the complexity of the p53 pathway abnormalities in MM and showed that it is strongly associated with genomic complexity and patient survival. In conclusion, this study identified TP53 as the critical gene located in 17p13, and revealed its haploinsufficiency properties in MM.

Treatment failure is associated with resistance to prednisolone. We aimed to find new druggable targets that modulate prednisolone resistance. We generated microarray gene expression profiles of 256 pediatric ALL patient samples and identified a 3.4-fold increase in epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) expression in in vitro prednisolone-resistant compared with -sensitive patients (P=0.003).

Moreover, EMP1 silencing sensitized to prednisolone up to 18.8-fold (P<0.001). EMP1 silencing also abrogated migration and adhesion to mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) by 78.3+/-9.0 and 29.3+/-4.1% compared with shNSC (P<0.05). We discovered that EMP1 contributes to MSC-mediated prednisolone resistance. Pathway analysis indicated that EMP1 signals through the Src kinase family.

There are few cases of common variable immunodeficiency patients with leukemia. CLINICAL CASE: Female of 36 years old, with left upper quadrant pain, early satiety, weight loss of 8 kg in three months and splenomegaly. The complete blood count showed: leukocytosis 206 000/mL, with 8 % blasts, platelets 530 000/mL and hemoglobin 8 mg/dL. Abdominal ultrasound: 19??12 cm splenomegaly. Karyotype BCR/ABL IS 64.20 %, 100 % Philadelphia chromosome. The diagnosis was of chronic myeloid leukemia. Given the presence of recurrent respiratory tract infection, frequent diarrheas and reduced concentrations of IgG, IgM and IgA, common variable immunodeficiency was diagnosed and human immunoglobulin was used successfully. CONCLUSIONS: The association between chronic myeloid leukemia and common variable immunodefficiency is unusual. Given the high frequency of hematological neoplasm in common variable immunodeficiency patients, we suggest that hematological patients with repeated infections and decreased concentrations of immunoglobulin be referred to an immunological evaluation.",,"[""O'Farrill-Romanillos, Patricia Maria"", 'Galindo-Pacheco, Lucy Vania', 'Amaya-Mejia, Adela Sisy', 'Campos-Romero, Freya Helena', 'Mendoza-Reyna, Laura Dafne', 'Perez-Rocha, Fernando', 'Segura-Mendez, Nora Hilda']","[""O'Farrill-Romanillos PM"", 'Galindo-Pacheco LV', 'Amaya-Mejia AS', 'Campos-Romero FH', 'Mendoza-Reyna LD', 'Perez-Rocha F', 'Segura-Mendez NH']","['Servicio de Alergia e Inmunologia Clinica, Hospital de Especialidades, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Distrito Federal, Mexico. patyfritzenwalden@hotmail.com.']",['spa'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Mexico,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc,Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,101243727,IM,"['Adult', 'Common Variable Immunodeficiency/complications/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*etiology']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'Common variable immunodefiency']",2014/03/15 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/03/15 06:00'],"['2014/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Inst Mex Seguro Soc. 2014 Jan-Feb;52(1):94-7.,,,,,,Leucemia mieloide cronica en un adulto con inmunodeficiencia comun variable.,,,,,,,,,,

A recombinant plasmid (PET28a-gp85) containing the PET28a vector and gp85 gene was constructed and then expressed in Rosetta (DE3) cells with 0.5mM IPTG to produce recombinant gp85 proteins that could be entrapped by liposomes through reverse-phase evaporation. The chickens were inoculated intramuscularly either once or twice with the liposomes or with Freund's adjuvant emulsion containing recombinant gp85 protein. Sixty chickens were raised to one week old for the first inoculation and to three weeks old for the second inoculation. Chickens raised to five weeks old were challenged with a 10(2.4) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of ALV-J. Blood samples were collected from each chicken at weekly intervals for serum antibody and viremia analyses. Changes in serum antibodies showed that positive serum antibodies (S/P value >0.6) could be induced in all groups regardless of the frequency of inoculation but improved significantly in the twice-inoculated groups. As well, high levels of antibodies emerged earlier in the Freund's adjuvant groups but persisted longer in the liposome groups. Detection of viremia indicated that the liposomes provide better protection against ALV-J than Freund's adjuvant emulsion and that this protection is directly influenced by serum antibody levels. Overall, this study reveals the potential of liposome vaccines containing recombinant gp85 protein in the clinical prevention of ALV-J.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Among hereditary syndromes, Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) and Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) have received the most attention. HBOC is due to mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes and is characterized by breast adenocarcinoma and/or epithelial ovarian carcinoma. LFS is associated with germline mutations in TP53; the most frequent cancer types associated with this syndrome are sarcoma, breast cancer, leukemia, brain tumors and adrenocortical carcinomas. Other cancers related to LFS are found at lower frequencies. In Brazil, especially in the southern part of the country, a specific mutation in the TP53 gene, TP53 p.R337H, occurs at a high frequency in childhood adrenocortical tumors. It has been proposed that this mutation increases breast cancer risk in southern Brazilian women. METHODS: We carried out a case-control study to determine the prevalence of the TP53 p.R337H mutation in 28 female cancer patients attended at the Cancer Genetic Counseling Service of the General Hospital of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School of Ribeirao Preto who fulfilled Hereditary Breast and Ovary Cancer Syndrome genetic test criteria compared to healthy woman (controls). TP53 p.R337H mutation status was determined using the High Resolution Melting (HRM) method, followed by DNA sequencing. Fisher's test was used to compare the prevalence of TP53 p.R337H in the patient and control groups. RESULTS: Two of the breast cancer cases (7.1%) and none of the controls carried the TP53 p.R337H mutation. At the time of the investigation, both cases fulfilled testing criteria for Hereditary Breast and Ovary Cancer Syndrome but not Li-Fraumeni or Li-Fraumeni-like Syndrome, based on genetic testing criteria of NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (v.1.2010). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that genetic screening of Brazilian breast cancer patients who fulfill Hereditary Breast and Ovary Cancer Syndrome criteria and have a family history that includes other tumors of the LFS/LFL spectrum be tested for the TP53 p.R337H mutation.",,"['Cury, Nathalia M', 'Ferraz, Victor Ef', 'Silva, Wilson A Jr']","['Cury NM', 'Ferraz VE', 'Silva WA Jr']","['Department of Genetics, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo (FMRP/USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil. vferraz@usp.br.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140313,Poland,Hered Cancer Clin Pract,Hereditary cancer in clinical practice,101231179,,,PMC3995619,,,,2014/03/15 06:00,2014/03/15 06:01,['2014/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/15 06:01 [medline]']","['1897-4287-12-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1897-4287-12-8 [doi]']",epublish,Hered Cancer Clin Pract. 2014 Mar 13;12(1):8. doi: 10.1186/1897-4287-12-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Statistical methods for spatial data may accommodate either form of data, however the spatial aggregation can affect their performance. Previous work has studied the effect of spatial aggregation on cluster detection methods. Here we consider geographic health data at different levels of spatial resolution, to study the effect of spatial aggregation on disease mapping performance in locating subregions of increased disease risk. METHODS: We implemented a non-parametric disease distance-based mapping (DBM) method to produce a smooth map from spatially aggregated childhood leukaemia data. We then simulated spatial data under controlled conditions to study the effect of spatial aggregation on its performance. We used an evaluation method based on ROC curves to compare performance of DBM across different geographic scales. RESULTS: Application of DBM to the leukaemia data illustrates the method as a useful visualization tool. Spatial aggregation produced expected degradation of disease mapping performance. Characteristics of this degradation, however, varied depending on the interaction between the geographic extent of the higher risk area and the level of aggregation. For example, higher risk areas dispersed across several units did not suffer as greatly from aggregation. The choice of centroids also had an impact on the resulting mapping. CONCLUSIONS: DBM can be implemented for continuous and discrete spatial data, but the resulting mapping can lose accuracy in the second setting. Investigation of the simulations suggests a complex relationship between performance loss, geographic extent of spatial disturbances and centroid locations. Aggregation of spatial data destroys information and thus impedes efforts to monitor these data for spatial disturbances. The effect of spatial aggregation on cluster detection, disease mapping, and other useful methods in spatial epidemiology is complex and deserves further study.",,"['Jeffery, Caroline', 'Ozonoff, Al', 'Pagano, Marcello']","['Jeffery C', 'Ozonoff A', 'Pagano M']","['Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Department of International Public Health, Monitoring and Evaluation Technical assistance and Research group, Liverpool L3 5QA, UK. cjeffery@liv.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['R01 EB0006195/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 PH000021-01/PH/PHPPO CDC HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20140313,England,Int J Health Geogr,International journal of health geographics,101152198,IM,"['Data Collection/*methods/standards', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Geographic Information Systems/standards', '*Geographic Mapping', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Spatial Analysis']",PMC3995615,,,,2014/03/15 06:00,2014/10/19 06:00,['2014/03/15 06:00'],"['2013/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/19 06:00 [medline]']","['1476-072X-13-9 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-072X-13-9 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Health Geogr. 2014 Mar 13;13:9. doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-13-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies on this subject investigated childhood leukemia. Thyroid cancer may be another health outcome of interest, because some nuclear installations are a potential source of radioactive iodine isotopes in the environment and because thyroid cancer is known to occur after exposure to these isotopes. METHODS: This study describes an ecological study investigating whether there is excessive thyroid cancer incidence among residents living in the vicinity of nuclear sites. Single-site analyses using indirect standardization (standardized incidence ratios [SIRs]) and Poisson regression modeling (rate ratios [RRs]) were conducted. The proximity area is typically defined as a circular zone with a radius of 20 km centered on the site. However, the choice of the size of this area is somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate whether the results vary with radii of increasing proximity. RESULTS: No increased thyroid cancer incidence was found within the 20 km proximity area around the nuclear power plants of Doel (SIR=0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.64; 0.84] and RR=0.72 [95% CI=0.63; 0.83]) and Tihange (SIR=0.86 [95% CI=0.70; 1.01] and RR=0.85 [95% CI=0.70; 1.02]). For the sites of Mol-Dessel and Fleurus, where a combination of nuclear research and industrial activities are located, the incidences of thyroid cancer within the 20 km proximity area were higher than expected (Mol-Dessel: SIR=1.19 [95% CI=1.01; 1.36] and RR=1.19 [95% CI=1.02; 1.38]; Fleurus: SIR=1.15 [95% CI=1.02; 1.28] and RR=1.17 [95% CI=1.04; 1.33]). For Chooz, a French nuclear power plant close to the Belgian border, the results were unstable as a result of the small population denominator. For all Belgian nuclear sites, the results were generally insensitive to the choice of the proximity area. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence for excessive thyroid cancer incidence around the Belgian nuclear power plants was found. On the other hand, an increased incidence of thyroid cancer was observed around the sites with other nuclear activities. Further research is recommended to verify whether the observed increases could be related to the site-specific nuclear activities.",,"['Bollaerts, Kaatje', 'Fierens, Sebastien', 'Van Bladel, Lodewijk', 'Simons, Koen', 'Sonck, Michel', 'Poffijn, Andre', 'Geraets, David', 'Gosselin, Pol', 'Van Oyen, Herman', 'Francart, Julie', 'Van Nieuwenhuyse, An']","['Bollaerts K', 'Fierens S', 'Van Bladel L', 'Simons K', 'Sonck M', 'Poffijn A', 'Geraets D', 'Gosselin P', 'Van Oyen H', 'Francart J', 'Van Nieuwenhuyse A']","['1 Scientific Institute of Public Health, Operational Direction Surveillance and Public Health , Brussels, Belgium .']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Belgium/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Power Plants', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Radioactive Pollutants/*toxicity', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Factors', 'Spatio-Temporal Analysis', 'Thyroid Gland/*radiation effects', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/03/15 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/03/15 06:00'],"['2014/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2013.0227 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2014 May;24(5):906-17. doi: 10.1089/thy.2013.0227.,,['0 (Radioactive Pollutants)'],['Nat Rev Endocrinol. 2014 Jul;10(7):385-7.

MATERIALS & METHODS: We performed genome-wide SNP association studies of 6-thioguanine and 6-mercaptopurine cytotoxicity using lymphoblastoid cell lines. We then genotyped the top SNPs associated with lymphoblastoid cell line cytotoxicity, together with tagSNPs for genes in the 'thiopurine pathway' (686 total SNPs), in DNA from 589 Caucasian UK ALL97 patients. Functional validation studies were performed by siRNA knockdown in cancer cell lines. RESULTS: SNPs in the thiopurine pathway genes ABCC4, ABCC5, IMPDH1, ITPA, SLC28A3 and XDH, and SNPs located within or near ATP6AP2, FRMD4B, GNG2, KCNMA1 and NME1, were associated with clinical response and measures of thiopurine metabolism. Functional validation showed shifts in cytotoxicity for these genes.

Importantly, this crosstalk may also change the number, function, and memory phenotype of normal T-cells, thereby altering the amplitude and/or efficiency of adaptive immunity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. The present study presents an overview on important aspects of this immunological crosstalk, particularly on the abnormalities of chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cells and the alterations in normal T-cells, with focus on the CD4 memory T-cell compartment that could offer survival signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cell clone(s) and contribute to the establishment and progression of the disease.

It has been reported that polymorphisms of the mannosebinding lectin 2 (MBL2) genes are correlated with MBL protein serum levels and, consequently, are associated with the development of infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible association between MBL2 gene polymorphisms and risk of infection in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 116 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients were collected; after genomic DNA extraction, real time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the polymorphisms of the promoter region and exon 1 of the MBL2 gene. RESULTS: A high frequency of Binet stage A (p-value = 0.005) and absence of splenomegaly (p-value = 0.002) were observed in patients with no infection; however, variant alleles/ genotypes and haplotypes of this gene had no impact on the risk of infection. CONCLUSION: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study describing the association between MBL2 polymorphisms and infectious disease in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Although it was not possible to demonstrate any influence of MBL2 polymorphisms as a genetic modulator of infection in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the authors believe that the present data are clinically relevant and provide the basis for future studies.",,"['Holanda, Katarina', 'Lucena-Araujo, Antonio Roberto', 'Quintas, Adonis', 'Mendonca, Taciana', 'Lima, Aleide', 'Vasconcelos, Luydson Richardson', 'Moura, Patricia', 'Cavalcanti, Maria', 'Machado, Cintia', 'Araujo, Aderson Silva', 'Bezerra, Marcos Andre']","['Holanda K', 'Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Quintas A', 'Mendonca T', 'Lima A', 'Vasconcelos LR', 'Moura P', 'Cavalcanti M', 'Machado C', 'Araujo AS', 'Bezerra MA']","['Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Fundacao de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco (HEMOPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Fundacao de Hematologia e Hemoterapia de Pernambuco (HEMOPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Recife, PE, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Brazil,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter,Revista brasileira de hematologia e hemoterapia,101220159,,,PMC3948663,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell', 'Infection', 'Leukemia lymphocytic chronic', 'Mannose-binding lectin', 'Polymorphism single nucleotide']",2014/03/14 06:00,2014/03/14 06:01,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2013/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5581/1516-8484.20140010 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Bras Hematol Hemoter. 2014;36(1):29-34. doi: 10.5581/1516-8484.20140010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The co-occurrence of second primary malignancy (SPM) could be randomly occurring or association with risk factors such as environmental, genetic predisposition and therapy-related. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrieved approximately 782 million claim records consisting of 10.8 million males and 10.6 million females from Taiwan's National Health Insurance, which were collected for a period of 3 years (January 2000-December 2002). All the patient records were stratified by gender and ages at a 20-year interval with SPMs and specific groups. Interestingness or Q-value was used to measure strength of the disease-disease associations. RESULTS: A total of 9423 thyroid cancer (female: 7483, male: 1940), 276 184 SPM (female: 141 023, male: 135 161) and 861 co-occurrence cases (female: 583, male: 278) were recorded. The co-occurrence incidence rate of head and neck, breast, digestive system and lung was 1.93%, 1.59%, 1.44% and 1.18%, respectively. Malignancy of salivary glands, laryngx, sarcoma, lymphoid tissue, mouth, central nervous system and lungs found Q-value >10. Malignancies with intermediate Q-values (5.0-9.9) were observed in nasopharynx, kidney and ureter, breast, stomach and skin. Prostate, leukemia, urinary bladder, ovary, colon, liver and uterine cervix cancer have lower Q-values (1.0-4.9). CONCLUSION: Co-occurrence ratio of thyroid cancer and SPM was high, occurred in all organ systems. We postulated that the aggressive use of modern diagnostic modalities, aggressive radioiodine treatment, pre-existing molecular oncogen mutations, and thyroid hormone for simultaneously supple-mentary and suppressive therapies were responsible.","['(c) The Author 2014.

Two critical features necessary for maximizing TKI tolerability and response duration are kinase selectivity and invulnerability to resistance-conferring kinase domain (KD) mutations in the intended target. No prior TKI has demonstrated both of these properties. Aiming to maximize selectivity, medicinal chemists have largely sought to create TKIs that bind to an inactive (type II) kinase conformation. Here we demonstrate that the investigational type I TKI crenolanib is a potent inhibitor of Fms tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication, a validated therapeutic target in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as all secondary KD mutants previously shown to confer resistance to the first highly active FLT3 TKI quizartinib. Moreover, crenolanib is highly selective for FLT3 relative to the closely related protein tyrosine kinase KIT, demonstrating that simultaneous FLT3/KIT inhibition, a prominent feature of other clinically active FLT3 TKIs, is not required for AML cell cytotoxicity in vitro and may contribute to undesirable toxicity in patients. A saturation mutagenesis screen of FLT3-internal tandem duplication failed to recover any resistant colonies in the presence of a crenolanib concentration well below what has been safely achieved in humans, suggesting that crenolanib has the potential to suppress KD mutation-mediated clinical resistance. Crenolanib represents the first TKI to exhibit both kinase selectivity and invulnerability to resistance-conferring KD mutations, which is unexpected of a type I inhibitor. Crenolanib has significant promise for achieving deep and durable responses in FLT3-mutant AML, and may have a profound impact upon future medicinal chemistry efforts in oncology.",,"['Smith, Catherine Choy', 'Lasater, Elisabeth A', 'Lin, Kimberly C', 'Wang, Qi', 'McCreery, Melissa Quino', 'Stewart, Whitney K', 'Damon, Lauren E', 'Perl, Alexander E', 'Jeschke, Grace R', 'Sugita, Mayumi', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Kuriyan, John', 'Shah, Neil P']","['Smith CC', 'Lasater EA', 'Lin KC', 'Wang Q', 'McCreery MQ', 'Stewart WK', 'Damon LE', 'Perl AE', 'Jeschke GR', 'Sugita M', 'Carroll M', 'Kogan SC', 'Kuriyan J', 'Shah NP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA176091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 CA095274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA176091-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32CA108462-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA108462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008568/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Mutation', 'Piperidines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics']",PMC3986131,,['NOTNLM'],"['D835 mutations', 'activation-loop mutations', 'sorafenib']",2014/03/14 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['1320661111 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1320661111 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 Apr 8;111(14):5319-24. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1320661111.

The host bromo and extraterminal (BET) proteins Brd2, 3 and 4 interact with the MLV IN protein primarily through the BET protein ET domain. Using solution NMR, protein interaction studies, and next generation sequencing, we show that the C-terminal tail peptide region of MLV IN is important for the interaction with BET proteins and that disruption of this interaction through truncation mutations affects the global targeting profile of MLV vectors. The use of the unstructured tails of gammaretroviral INs to direct association with complexes at active promoters parallels that used by histones and RNA polymerase II. Viruses bearing MLV IN C-terminal truncations can provide new avenues to improve the safety profile of gammaretroviral vectors for human gene therapy.","['(c) The Author(s) 2014.

PROCEDURE: To explore leukemia characteristics of patients with CNS involvement at ALL diagnosis, we analyzed clinical features and early treatment response of 744 patients on Nordic-Baltic trials. CNS status was classified as CNS1 (no CSF blasts), CNS2 (<5 leukocytes/microl CSF with blasts), CNS3 (>/=5 leukocytes/microl with blasts or signs of CNS involvement), TLP+ (traumatic lumbar puncture with blasts), and TLP- (TLP with no blasts). RESULTS: Patients with CNS involvement had higher leukocyte count compared with patients with CNS1 (P < 0.002). Patients with CNS3 more often had T-ALL (P < 0.001) and t(9;22)(q34;q11)[BCR-ABL1] (P < 0.004) compared with patients with CNS1. Among patients with CNS involvement headache (17%) and vomiting (14%) were most common symptoms. Symptoms or clinical findings were present among 27 of 54 patients with CNS3 versus only 7 of 39 patients with CNS2 and 15 of 75 patients with TLP+ (P < 0.001). The majority of patients with CNS involvement received additional induction therapy. The post induction bone marrow residual disease level did not differ between patients with CNS involvement and patients with CNS1 (P > 0.15). The 12-year event-free survival for patients with leukemic mass on neuroimaging did not differ from patients with negative or no scan (0.50 vs. 0.60; P = 0.7) or between patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of CNS leukemia and patients without such characteristics (0.50 vs. 0.61; P = 0.2). CONCLUSION: CNS involvement at diagnosis is associated with adverse prognostic features but does not indicate a less chemosensitive leukemia.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Levinsen, Mette', 'Taskinen, Mervi', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Heyman, Mats', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Asberg, Ann', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Levinsen M', 'Taskinen M', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Forestier E', 'Frandsen TL', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Heyman M', 'Jonsson OG', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Lausen B', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Asberg A', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140212,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Central Nervous System Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/secondary', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'chemotherapy', 'minimal residual disease']",2014/03/14 06:00,2014/08/19 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.24981 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Aug;61(8):1416-21. doi: 10.1002/pbc.24981.

The previous report on cancer survival in Finland covered patients diagnosed in 1953-1995. Data on survival in the European and Nordic pediatric populations have been published with follow-up ending in 2002. We describe population-based survival of childhood cancer patients (n = 8270, age 0-14 years) in Finland overall and by disease category with follow-up extending from 1953 to 2010 and focusing on the modern treatment era. Data were collected from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Age-standardised observed survival proportions (rates) were calculated using the actuarial (or life-table) method. Trends in observed survival rates were studied over six diagnostic periods: 1953-1960, 1961-1970, 1971-1980, 1981-1990, 1991-2000 and 2001-2010. The overall 5-year survival reached 82.1% (95% CI 80.0-84.2) in the most recent period. In most diagnostic categories, the biggest leap in survival was seen between 1961-1970 and 1981-1990, after which slight improvements occurred between 1981-1990 and 1991-2000, with no significant increase thereafter. In analyses by diagnostic group, positive trends in survival over the last three decades were seen for leukemia (p = 0.000), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p = 0.002) and CNS tumours (p = 0.02). Although survival of childhood cancer patients overall has significantly improved from 1953 to 2000, improvement thereafter has been marginal. Future treatment efforts should be directed at bone tumours, soft-tissue sarcoma, neuroblastoma and malignant brain tumours as well as high-risk leukemia.",['(c) 2014 UICC.'],"['Madanat-Harjuoja, L M', 'Pokhrel, A', 'Kivivuori, S M', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, U M']","['Madanat-Harjuoja LM', 'Pokhrel A', 'Kivivuori SM', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM']","['Finnish Cancer Registry, Pieni Roobertinkatu 9, 00130, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140402,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['childhood cancer', 'population-based', 'registry', 'survival']",2014/03/14 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.28844 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2014 Nov 1;135(9):2129-34. doi: 10.1002/ijc.28844.

These systems generally initiate a segmentation stage where white blood cells are separated from the background and other nonsalient objects. As the success of such imaging systems mainly depends on the accuracy of this stage, studies attach great importance for developing accurate segmentation algorithms. Although previous studies give promising results for segmentation of sparsely distributed normal white blood cells, only a few of them focus on segmenting touching and overlapping cell clusters, which is usually the case when leukemic cells are present. In this article, we present a new algorithm for segmentation of both normal and leukemic cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow images. In this algorithm, we propose to model color and shape characteristics of white blood cells by defining two transformations and introduce an efficient use of these transformations in a marker-controlled watershed algorithm. Particularly, these domain specific characteristics are used to identify markers and define the marking function of the watershed algorithm as well as to eliminate false white blood cells in a postprocessing step. Working on 650 white blood cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow images, our experiments reveal that the proposed algorithm improves the segmentation performance compared with its counterparts, leading to high accuracies for both sparsely distributed normal white blood cells and dense leukemic cell clusters.",['(c) 2014 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.'],"['Arslan, Salim', 'Ozyurek, Emel', 'Gunduz-Demir, Cigdem']","['Arslan S', 'Ozyurek E', 'Gunduz-Demir C']","['Department of Computer Engineering, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140312,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

To ensure viral replication, these must be limited by expression of viral early regulatory proteins that functionally inhibit PML-NB-associated antiviral effects. To benefit from the activating capabilities of Sp100A and simultaneously limit repression by Sp100B, -C, and -HMG, adenoviruses (Ads) employ several features to selectively and individually target these isoforms. Ads induce relocalization of Sp100B, -C, and -HMG from PML-NBs prior to association with viral replication centers. In contrast, Sp100A is kept at the PML tracks that surround the newly formed viral replication centers as designated sites of active transcription. We concluded that the host restriction factors Sp100B, -C, and -HMG are potentially inactivated by active displacement from these sites, whereas Sp100A is retained to amplify Ad gene expression. Ad-dependent loss of Sp100 SUMOylation is another crucial part of the virus repertoire to counteract intrinsic immunity by circumventing Sp100 association with HP1, therefore limiting chromatin condensation. We provide evidence that Ad selectively counteracts antiviral responses and, at the same time, benefits from PML-NB-associated components which support viral gene expression by actively recruiting them to PML track-like structures. Our findings provide insights into novel strategies for manipulating transcriptional regulation to either inactivate or amplify viral gene expression. IMPORTANCE: We describe an adenoviral evasion strategy that involves isoform-specific and active manipulation of the PML-associated restriction factor Sp100. Recently, we reported that the adenoviral transactivator E1A targets PML-II to efficiently activate viral transcription. In contrast, the PML-associated proteins Daxx and ATRX are inhibited by early viral factors. We show that this concept is more intricate and significant than originally believed, since adenoviruses apparently take advantage of specific PML-NB-associated proteins and simultaneously inhibit antiviral measures to maintain the viral infectious program. Specifically, we observed Ad-induced relocalization of the Sp100 isoforms B, C, and HMG from PML-NBs juxtaposed with viral replication centers. In contrast, Sp100A is retained at Ad-induced PML tracks that surround the newly formed viral replication centers, acting as designated sites of active transcription. The host restriction factors Sp100B, -C, and -HMG are potentially inactivated by active displacement from these sites, whereas Sp100A is retained to amplify Ad gene expression.",,"['Berscheminski, Julia', 'Wimmer, Peter', 'Brun, Juliane', 'Ip, Wing Hang', 'Groitl, Peter', 'Horlacher, Tim', 'Jaffray, Ellis', 'Hay, Ron T', 'Dobner, Thomas', 'Schreiner, Sabrina']","['Berscheminski J', 'Wimmer P', 'Brun J', 'Ip WH', 'Groitl P', 'Horlacher T', 'Jaffray E', 'Hay RT', 'Dobner T', 'Schreiner S']","['Heinrich Pette Institute, Leibniz Institute for Experimental Virology, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['097945/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Adenovirus Infections, Human/*immunology', 'Adenoviruses, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Luciferases', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",PMC4093896,,,,2014/03/14 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00469-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00469-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Jun;88(11):6076-92. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00469-14.

The RNA genomes in both immature and infectious particles are dimers, and interactions between the RNA dimer and the viral Gag protein ensure selective packaging into nascent immature virions. We used high-sensitivity selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) to obtain nucleotide-resolution structural information from scarce, femtomole quantities of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) RNA inside authentic virions and from viral RNA extracted from immature (protease-minus) virions. Our secondary structure model of the dimerization and packaging domain indicated that a stable intermolecular duplex known as PAL2, previously shown to be present in mature infectious MuLV particles, was sequestered in an alternate stem-loop structure inside immature virions. The intermediate state corresponded closely to a late-folding intermediate that we detected in time-resolved studies of the free MuLV RNA, suggesting that the immature RNA structure reflects trapping of the intermediate folding state by interactions in the immature virion. We propose models for the RNA-protein interactions that trap the RNA in the immature state and for the conformational rearrangement that occurs during maturation of virion particles. IMPORTANCE: The structure of the RNA genome in mature retroviruses has been studied extensively, whereas very little was known about the RNA structure in immature virions. The immature RNA structure is important because it is the form initially selected for packaging in new virions and may have other roles. This lack of information was due to the difficulty of isolating sufficient viral RNA for study. In this work, we apply a high-sensitivity and nucleotide-resolution approach to examine the structure of the dimerization and packaging domain of Moloney murine leukemia virus. We find that the genomic RNA is packaged in a high-energy state, suggesting that interactions within the virion hold or capture the RNA before it reaches its most stable state. This new structural information makes it possible to propose models for the conformational changes in the RNA genome that accompany retroviral maturation.",,"['Grohman, Jacob K', 'Gorelick, Robert J', 'Kottegoda, Sumith', 'Allbritton, Nancy L', 'Rein, Alan', 'Weeks, Kevin M']","['Grohman JK', 'Gorelick RJ', 'Kottegoda S', 'Allbritton NL', 'Rein A', 'Weeks KM']","['Department of Chemistry, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM064803/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'GM064803/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Acylation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Electrophoresis, Capillary', 'Genome, Viral/*genetics', '*Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Virion/*genetics/growth & development']",PMC4093898,,,,2014/03/14 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.03277-13 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.03277-13 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Jun;88(11):6061-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.03277-13.

The mRNA of some complex retroviruses, including the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV), can initiate translation using a canonical cap-dependent mechanism or through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In this study, we present strong evidence showing that like HIV-1 and SIV, the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of the HTLV-1 full-length mRNA harbors an IRES. Cap-independent translational activity was evaluated and demonstrated using dual luciferase bicistronic mRNAs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, in mammalian cell culture, and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Characterization of the HTLV-1 IRES shows that its activity is dependent on the ribosomal protein S25 (RPS25) and that its function is highly sensitive to the drug edeine. Together, these findings suggest that the 5'UTR of the HTLV-1 full-length mRNA enables internal recruitment of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex. However, the recognition of the initiation codon requires ribosome scanning. These results suggest that, after internal recruitment by the HTLV-1 IRES, a scanning step takes place for the 40S ribosomal subunit to be positioned at the translation initiation codon. IMPORTANCE: The mechanism by which retroviral mRNAs recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit internally is not understood. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of translation initiation used by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The results show that the HTLV-1 mRNA can initiate translation via a noncanonical mechanism mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). This study also provides evidence showing the involvement of cellular proteins in HTLV-1 IRES-mediated translation initiation. Together, the data presented in this report significantly contribute to the understanding of HTLV-1 gene expression.",,"['Olivares, Eduardo', 'Landry, Dori M', 'Caceres, C Joaquin', 'Pino, Karla', 'Rossi, Federico', 'Navarrete, Camilo', 'Huidobro-Toro, Juan Pablo', 'Thompson, Sunnie R', 'Lopez-Lastra, Marcelo']","['Olivares E', 'Landry DM', 'Caceres CJ', 'Pino K', 'Rossi F', 'Navarrete C', 'Huidobro-Toro JP', 'Thompson SR', 'Lopez-Lastra M']","['Laboratorio de Virologia Molecular, Instituto Milenio de Inmunologia e Inmunoterapia, Centro de Investigaciones Medicas, Escuela de Medicina, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],"['R01GM084547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 AI102187/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM084547/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics/*physiology"", 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Edeine', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Luciferases', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational/genetics/*physiology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Xenopus laevis']",PMC4093887,,,,2014/03/14 06:00,2014/07/06 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['JVI.00279-14 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00279-14 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2014 Jun;88(11):5936-55. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00279-14.

Body composition was measured annually by dual X-ray absorptiometry, physical activity by accelerometry, and pubertal timing by age at peak high velocity. The effect of methylation on transcription factor binding was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Seven cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) loci were identified that showed no significant temporal change or association with leukocyte populations. Modeling using generalized estimating equations showed that methylation of four loci predicted adiposity up to 14 years independent of sex, age, pubertal timing, and activity. Methylation of one predictive locus modified binding of the proadipogenic pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1/homeobox 9 complex.

In this study, the biological properties and induction of antileukemic immunity of LEXs were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, western blot analysis, cytotoxicity assays, and animal studies. Similar to other tumor cells, leukemia cells release exosomes. Exosomes derived from K562 leukemia cells (LEXK562) are membrane-bound vesicles with diameters of approximately 50-100 mum and harbor adhesion molecules (e.g., intercellular adhesion molecule-1) and immunologically associated molecules (e.g., heat shock protein 70). In cytotoxicity assays and animal studies, LEXs-pulsed DCs induced an antileukemic cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune response and antileukemic immunity more effectively than did LEXs and non-pulsed DCs (P<0.05).

We report that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Bcl-w consistently protected leukemic cells better than Bcl-B, Bfl-1, or Mcl-1 against a wide variety of anticancer regimens. Current thinking would attribute this to differences in their ability to bind to BH3-only proteins, Bax, and Bak. To address this, we established the first complete, quantitative cellular interaction profile of all human prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins with all their proapoptotic relatives. Binding was unexpectedly promiscuous, except for Bad and Noxa, and did not explain the differential antiapoptotic capacity of the Bcl-2 proteins. Rather, Bcl-B, Bfl-1, or Mcl-1 proved less potent due to steady-state or drug-induced proteasomal degradation. All 6 Bcl-2 proteins similarly protected against the diverse anticancer regimens when expressed at equal protein levels, in agreement with their broad interaction profile.

We performed a retrospective study at Johns Hopkins Hospital to evaluate the epidemiology of C. kefyr colonization and infection in HM patients between 2004 and 2010. Eighty-three patients were colonized and/or infected with C. kefyr, with 8 (9.6%) having invasive candidiasis (IC). The yearly incidence of C. kefyr colonization and candidemia increased over the study period (P < 0.01), particularly after 2009. In 2010, C. kefyr caused 16.7% of candidemia episodes. The monthly incidence of C. kefyr was higher during the summer throughout the study. In a cohort of patients with acute myelogenic leukemia receiving induction chemotherapy, risks for C. kefyr colonization included the summer season (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; P = 0.03); administration of an azole (OR, 0.06; P < 0.001) or amphotericin B (OR, 0.35; P = 0.05) was protective. Fingerprinting of 16 isolates by repetitive sequence-based PCR showed that all were different genotypes. The epidemiology of C. kefyr candidemia was evaluated in another hospital in Montreal, Canada; data confirmed higher rates of C. kefyr infection in the summer. C. kefyr appears to be increasing in HM patients, with prominent summer seasonality. These findings raise questions about the effect of antifungal agents and health care exposures (e.g., yogurt) on the epidemiology of this yeast.","['Copyright (c) 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

A pooled analysis of phase II trials of gemcitabine-containing doublets plus bevacizumab.,343-9,10.1097/MPA.0000000000000095 [doi],"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether building upon multidrug chemotherapy regimens represents a viable strategy in pancreatic cancer clinical trial design. METHODS: We performed a pooled analysis of all single-arm phase II studies in which a specific targeted agent (the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab) was added to gemcitabine-based cytotoxic doublets. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included objective response rate, CA-19-9 biomarker response rate, and adverse event frequencies. Kaplan-Meier methods estimated time-to-event end points, whereas the Cox proportional hazard model estimated univariate hazard ratios of death. RESULTS: For the 300 patients included in the pooled analysis, median OS was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval, 8.3-10.2). Differences in OS were observed according to patients' baseline performance status (median OS, 10.4 vs 8.6 months for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 vs 1, respectively). Moreover, bevacizumab-related adverse events were not observed at increased frequency with gemcitabine-based doublets compared with historic data. CONCLUSIONS: Recognizing the limitations of cross-study comparisons, these results compare favorably to those from Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80303, a phase III trial testing bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine alone.

In vivo studies suggest an association between the ABCB1 1199G>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and tacrolimus intracellular accumulation. The aim of the present experimental study was to clarify in vitro the impact of the coding ABCB1 1199G>A SNP on ABCB1 transport activity towards both immunosuppressive drugs. METHOD: Two recombinant cell lines, i.e. Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) and Human Myelogenous Leukemia (K562) cells, overexpressing ABCB1 carrying either the wild-type allele (1199G) or its mutated counterpart (1199A), were generated. The impact of the 1199G>A SNP on ABCB1 activity towards rhodamine (Rh123), doxorubicin, vinblastine, tacrolimus and cyclosporine A was assessed by accumulation, cytotoxicity and/or kinetic experiments. RESULTS: Tacrolimus accumulation was strongly decreased in cells overexpressing the wild-type protein (1199G) compared to control cells, confirming the ability of ABCB1 to transport tacrolimus. By contrast, overexpression of the variant protein (1199A) had nearly no effect on tacrolimus intracellular accumulation whatever the model used and the concentration tested. Unlike tacrolimus, our results also indicate that cyclosporine A, Rh123 and doxorubicin are transported in a similar extent by the wild-type and variant ABCB1 proteins while the variant protein seems to be more efficient for the transport of vinblastine. CONCLUSION: ABCB1 encoded by the 1199G wild-type allele transports more efficiently tacrolimus in comparison to the 1199A variant protein. This observation indicates that the amino-acid substitution (Ser400Asn) encoded by the 1199A allele drastically decreases the ability of ABCB1 to drive the efflux of tacrolimus in a substrate-specific manner, in agreement with our previously published clinical data. Our study emphasizes the importance of the ABCB1 1199G>A polymorphism for ABCB1 activity and its potential to explain differences in drug response.",,"['Dessilly, Geraldine', 'Elens, Laure', 'Panin, Nadtha', 'Capron, Arnaud', 'Decottignies, Anabelle', 'Demoulin, Jean-Baptiste', 'Haufroid, Vincent']","['Dessilly G', 'Elens L', 'Panin N', 'Capron A', 'Decottignies A', 'Demoulin JB', 'Haufroid V']","['Louvain Centre for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Louvain Centre for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'De Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'De Duve Institute, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Louvain Centre for Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclosporine/metabolism', 'DNA, Recombinant/*genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tacrolimus/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",PMC3951418,,,,2014/03/14 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0091555 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-32059 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 12;9(3):e91555. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0091555. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(10):e112519'],,,,,,,

Nevertheless, it is not known how the observed clones may differ with respect to cell properties, such as proliferation and self-renewal. There are scarcely any data on how these cell properties change due to chemotherapy and relapse. We propose a new mathematical model to investigate the impact of cell properties on the multi-clonal composition of leukaemias. Model results imply that enhanced self-renewal may be a key mechanism in the clonal selection process. Simulations suggest that fast proliferating and highly self-renewing cells dominate at primary diagnosis, while relapse following therapy-induced remission is triggered mostly by highly self-renewing but slowly proliferating cells. Comparison of simulation results to patient data demonstrates that the proposed model is consistent with clinically observed dynamics based on a clonal selection process.",,"['Stiehl, Thomas', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Marciniak-Czochra, Anna']","['Stiehl T', 'Baran N', 'Ho AD', 'Marciniak-Czochra A']","['Institute of Applied Mathematics, BIOQUANT and IWR, Im Neuenheimer Feld 294, University of Heidelberg, , 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140312,England,J R Soc Interface,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",101217269,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Clonal Selection, Antigen-Mediated', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Recurrence']",PMC3973374,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer stem cells', 'clonal evolution', 'leukaemia', 'mathematical models', 'selection process']",2014/03/14 06:00,2014/10/16 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/16 06:00 [medline]']","['rsif.2014.0079 [pii]', '10.1098/rsif.2014.0079 [doi]']",epublish,J R Soc Interface. 2014 Mar 12;11(94):20140079. doi: 10.1098/rsif.2014.0079.

Being a proliferation marker, it may be used as a prognostic marker in malignant diseases, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our aim was to establish age-specific reference ranges for TK1 and examine its utility as a screening marker in CLL, a disease of the elderly. METHODS: Serum TK1 activity was measured by a competitive chemiluminescent immunoassay in 369 healthy adults and 115 de novo CLL patients. RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant decline in TK1 activity from young (18-35 years) to middle-aged (36-60 years) and further on to elderly (60-86 years) healthy individuals. Age-related reference range was: <30 U/L for young, <25 U/L for middle-aged and <19 U/L for elderly. There was no difference in TK1 activity between the studied healthy men and women. In CLL patients, TK1 activity was the highest in the advanced Rai stages. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for TK1 was 0.840 (95% CI: 0.787-0.892), for differentiating CLL patients from age and sex matched healthy controls, with a cut-off value of 10.5 U/L (sensitivity: 80.9%, specificity: 73.4%). TK1 was significantly elevated in CD38+/Zap70+ CLL patients, and showed significant correlation with WBC and absolute B-cell count. CONCLUSION: In the healthy, serum TK1 activity does not differ in the two sexes but declines significantly with age. As such, use of age-related reference ranges is warranted, especially when evaluating CLL patients who generally belong to the elderly age group.",,"['Szantho, Eszter', 'Bhattoa, Harjit Pal', 'Csoban, Maria', 'Antal-Szalmas, Peter', 'Ujfalusi, Aniko', 'Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna']","['Szantho E', 'Bhattoa HP', 'Csoban M', 'Antal-Szalmas P', 'Ujfalusi A', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Hevessy Z']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Blood Chemical Analysis/*methods/*standards', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/enzymology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood', 'Young Adult', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/metabolism']",PMC3951402,,,,2014/03/14 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2013/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0091647 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-51827 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 12;9(3):e91647. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0091647. eCollection 2014.,,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the screening of umbilical cord blood (UCB) for PGF may be of high importance for developing strategies for childhood leukemia prevention and treatment. However, the data on incidence of PGF in UCB are contradictive. We have compared multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (RT qPCR) in neonates from Slovak National Birth Cohort. According to multiplex PCR, all 135 screened samples were negative for the most frequent PGF of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To explore the prevalence of prognostically important TEL-AML1, MLL-AF4 and BCR-ABL (p190), 200 UCB were screened using RT qPCR. The initial screening showed an unexpectedly high incidence of studied PGF. The validation of selected samples in two laboratories confirmed approximately (1/4) of UCB positive, resulting in approximately 4% incidence of TEL-AML1, approximately 6.25% incidence of BCR-ABL1 p190, and approximately 0.75% frequency of MLL-AF4. In most cases, the PGF presented at very low level, about 1-5 copies per 105 cells.

Here we examined whether such failure might be related to the cell cycle stage of donor nuclei. Porcine iPSC, derived here from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, have a prolonged S phase and are highly sensitive to drugs normally used for synchronization. However, a double-blocking procedure with 0.3 muM aphidicolin for 10 h followed by 20 ng/ml nocodazole for 4 h arrested 94.3% of the cells at G2/M and, after release from the block, provided 70.1% cells in the subsequent G1 phase without causing any significant loss of cell viability or pluripotent phenotype. Nuclei from different cell cycle stages were used as donors for NT to in vitro-matured metaphase II oocytes. G2/M nuclei were more efficient than either G1 and S stage nuclei in undergoing first cleavage and in producing blastocysts, but all groups had a high incidence of chromosomal/nuclear abnormalities at 2 h and 6 h compared with non-synchronized NT controls from fetal fibroblasts. Many G2 embryos extruded a pseudo-second polar body soon after NT and, at blastocyst, tended to be either polyploid or diploid. By contrast, the few G1 blastocysts that developed were usually mosaic or aneuploid. The poor developmental potential of G1 nuclei may relate to lack of a G1/S check point, as the cells become active in DNA synthesis shortly after exit from mitosis. Together, these data provide at least a partial explanation for the almost complete failure to produce cloned piglets from piPSC.",,"['Yuan, Ye', 'Lee, Kiho', 'Park, Kwang-Wook', 'Spate, Lee D', 'Prather, Randall S', 'Wells, Kevin D', 'Roberts, R Michael']","['Yuan Y', 'Lee K', 'Park KW', 'Spate LD', 'Prather RS', 'Wells KD', 'Roberts RM']","['Division of Animal Sciences and Bond Life Sciences Center; University of Missouri; Columbia, MO USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences; University of Missouri; Columbia, MO USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences; University of Missouri; Columbia, MO USA; Department of Animal Science and Technology; Sunchon National University; Suncheon, Jeonnam, Korea.', 'Division of Animal Sciences; University of Missouri; Columbia, MO USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences; University of Missouri; Columbia, MO USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences; University of Missouri; Columbia, MO USA.', 'Division of Animal Sciences and Bond Life Sciences Center; University of Missouri; Columbia, MO USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HD067759/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HD069979/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HD069979/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HD067759/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20140217,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Animals', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Blastocyst/cytology/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cloning, Organism/*methods', 'DNA/biosynthesis', '*Embryo, Mammalian/embryology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', '*Nuclear Transfer Techniques', 'Ploidies', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Tissue Culture Techniques']",PMC4049963,,['NOTNLM'],"['G1 check point', 'cell cycle', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'nuclear transfer', 'porcine']",2014/03/14 06:00,2015/08/15 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/15 06:00 [medline]']","['28176 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.28176 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2014;13(8):1265-76. doi: 10.4161/cc.28176.

Symptoms of HCL are related to pancytopenia and immune deficiency. Patients with HCL have an increased risk of second malignancy either in a form of synchronous disease or in a form of an increased incidence of a second neoplasm after the treatment of HCL. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare form of aggressive extranodal T-cell lymphoma. Its pathogenesis is connected to a chronic immune deficiency status and its coexistence with other neoplasms is practically non-existent. CASE: We present a case of a 53-year-old female patient suffering from hepatosplenomegaly, peripheral lymphadenopathy and related B symptoms. An excisional biopsy of the enlarged axillary lymph node revealed partial infiltration with CD3+/CD56+/TIA + T cell lymphoma. Bone marrow trephine biopsy and flow cytometric immunophenotypization of bone marrow cells and peripheral blood showed presence of two types of neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood and in the bone marrow (composite lymphoma). One of them showed typical morphologic characteristics and immunohistochemical features of HCL, while another one was morphologically and immunophenotypically consistent with the diagnosis of HSTCL, respectively. The patient was treated with multivalent chemotherapy including rituximab but all treatments turned out to be only partially effective. While HCL responded to the treatment, HSTCL was refractory to the chemotherapy and the patient died 7 months after the initial diagnosis because of haematemesis induced by Mallory-Weiss syndrome. CONCLUSION: This is the first recorded case of coexistent HCL and HSTCL in the same patient. A multidisciplinary approach, encompassing careful morphology interpretation, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and molecular analyses, is mandatory to obtain an accurate diagnosis of composite lymphoma.

METHODS: We quantitatively evaluated BAX gene transcripts by real-time polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan probe chemistry) and protein expression by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Consecutive 112 AML patients with a median age of 16 (1-59) years were recruited in the study. By flow cytometry, the percentage expression was in linear correlation with relative median fluorescent intensity (RMFI; R = 0.4425; P < 0.001). However, there was no linear relationship between the transcript copies of the BAX with its RMFI (R = -0.0559; P = 0.586). The expression of the BAX at both protein and transcript level was significantly higher in AML patients as compared with normal control. RMFI of the BAX were higher in the cohort with lower white blood cell count (P = 0.029). None of the other baseline characteristics correlated with either the BAX transcript or the RMFI.

The ICU outcome of the HSCT recipients is claimed to have improved significantly over the last two decades. Our aim was to investigate the ICU outcome of the HSCT recipients who required management in ICU, together with the factors that are likely to affect the results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the ICU outcome of 48 adults (>/=18 years of age) who received HSCT in the bone marrow transplant unit of our hospital and required admission to ICU between 01 January 2007 and 31 December 2010. The data were retrieved from the databases of the adult bone marrow transplantation unit and the ICU. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of the patients were male with a median age of 39 years (28-46.75) in the study cohort. Leukemia (54%) and lymphoma (27%) were the leading underlying disorders. The type of HSCT was autologous in 14.6% and allogeneic in 85.4% of the patients. The reason for admission to ICU was acute respiratory failure in 85.5% of the HSCT recipients and 75% had sepsis/septic shock. The mean duration of ICU stay was 104.5 (48-168) hours. Sixty-nine percent of the patients died during their ICU stay while 31% survived. Besides the several statistically significant differences between the patients who survived or died in ICU in univariate analysis, baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score (odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-1.79) and requirement of vasopressors in the ICU (odds ratio 72.29, 95% confidence interval:4.47-1169.91) were found to be independent risk factors for mortality in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Baseline APACHE II score and requirement of vasopressors during ICU stay were the most significant independent risk factors for mortality in HSCT recipients who required ICU management in our center.",,"['Boyaci, Nazlihan', 'Aygencel, Gulbin', 'Turkoglu, Melda', 'Yegin, Zeynep Arzu', 'Acar, Kadir', 'Sucak, Gulsan Turkoz']","['Boyaci N', 'Aygencel G', 'Turkoglu M', 'Yegin ZA', 'Acar K', 'Sucak GT']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140103,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['APACHE', 'Adult', 'Critical Care/*methods', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/complications', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Intensive care unit', 'Mortality', 'Risk factors']",2014/03/14 06:00,2015/03/31 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000130 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Sep;19(6):338-45. doi: 10.1179/1607845413Y.0000000130.

In this study, we have evaluated the pattern of IgH, IgK chains, and TCRG/D gene rearrangements in precursor-B ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our prospective study, hyper-variable regions (CDRI and III) of IgH, TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3), TCRG (Vgamma, VgammaI, and VgammaII), and IgK (Vkappa-Kde) were studied in 126 cases with diagnosis of B-precursor ALL. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen (90.5%) out of 126 patients had clonal rearrangements of IgH using consensus primers for CDRI and/or CDRIII regions. Monoclonal, biclonal, and oligoclonal patterns were observed in 63 (57.8%), 38 (34.9%), and 6 (5.5%) patients with IgH (CDRIII) rearrangements, respectively. Clonal rearrangements of TCRG (Vgamma) and VgammaI/II were present in 79.3 and 64.9% of patients, respectively, and only 5% of cases showed biclonal pattern. The VgammaII rearrangement was the most common (46.8%) type in TCRG. Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3 partial gene rearrangements were observed in 47 (45.2%; n = 104) and 11 (16.6%; n = 66) patients, respectively. Biclonal/oligoclonal patterns were present in 13 (27.7%) and 2 (4.3%) cases with Vdelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement, respectively. Only one patient had biclonal Ddelta2-Ddelta3 rearrangement. Clonal pattern of IgK-Kde was detected in 59 cases (67%; n = 88). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that clonal rearrangements of IgH and TCRD (Vdelta2-Ddelta3 and Ddelta2-Ddelta3) genes had similar patterns to other studies. Frequency of TCRG (VgammaI and VgammaII) and IgK rearrangements was found to be slightly higher than previous reports.

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of acute GVHD (aGVHD) and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) according to relapse status on the survival rate in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Patients with ALL (n = 425) between 1991 and 2011, who underwent bone marrow transplantation and stem cell transplantation in Tehran (Iran), were recruited into a longitudinal study. All patient records were screened for the occurrence of adverse events including GVHD and relapse. Data were assessed using SPSS software with log-rank, univariate, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Five-year survival rate based on a Kaplan-Meier curve was 60.2% overall (95% confidence interval (CI): 54.32-66.08) and 66.6% (95% CI: 59.35-73.86) for individuals in their first complete remission (CR1) disease stage. A significantly higher survival rate was observed for patients who developed cGVHD in comparison with those who did not develop it, with a 2.7 fold increased risk of mortality for the latter group (P < 0.001). A significant Cox proportional hazard ratio of 2.3 was observed for mortality following adjustments for age and gender. The presence of cGVHD, reduced the risk of mortality for all individuals, which was observed to be significant for those patients without relapse (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: This study is one of the largest studies (regarding the number of participants) done to date in the Middle East with quite a long duration (20 years). Findings suggest that cGVHD has a positive influence on the survival rates for ALL patients, which subsequently may assist physicians to make optimal treatment decisions. Additional research is now needed to determine the mechanisms around this increased survival and its influence on patients' survival.",,"['Sayehmiri, Kourosh', 'Carson, Kristin V', 'Bakhtiyari, Salar', 'Shokouhi, Shabnam', 'Alimoghadam, Kamran']","['Sayehmiri K', 'Carson KV', 'Bakhtiyari S', 'Shokouhi S', 'Alimoghadam K']",,['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140123,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphocytic leukemia', 'HSCT', 'Survival rate', 'aGVHD', 'cGVHD']",2014/03/14 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/03/14 06:00'],"['2014/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000151 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Dec;19(8):441-7. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000151.

We have used primary CLL cells and CLL-derived MEC-1 cells transfected with empty (mock cells) or proMMP-9-encoding (MMP-9 cells) lentiviral vectors. The constitutive (pro)MMP-9 expression in mock cells and primary CLL cells was similar, whereas in MMP-9 cells, expression resembled that of CLL cells incubated with proMMP-9. In xenograft models, in NOD/SCID mice, MMP-9-MEC-1 transfectants showed significantly reduced homing to bone marrow and spleen compared with mock cells. Likewise, incubation of primary CLL cells with proMMP-9, before injection into mice, inhibited their homing to these organs. This inhibition was specific, dose-dependent, and observed in all CLL tested, independently of prognostic markers or disease stage. Additionally, the MMP-9 catalytic activity was only partially involved, as the inactive mutant proMMP-9MutE had a partial effect. MMP-9 cells also showed impaired migration in vitro, which was reverted by reducing (pro)MMP-9 expression with siRNAs. CLL migration thus requires optimal (pro)MMP-9 expression levels, below or above which migration is hampered. Biochemical analysis of the (pro)MMP-9 effect indicated that MMP-9 cells or primary CLL cells incubated with proMMP-9 had reduced activation of migration regulatory molecules, including RhoAGTPase, Akt, ERK, and FAK. In contrast, p190RhoGAP (RhoA inhibitor) and PTEN (Akt/ERK/FAK inhibitor) were up-regulated in MMP-9 cells. Reduction of (pro)MMP-9 expression by siRNAs restored RhoA activity and diminished PTEN levels. Our results reveal a novel function for (pro)MMP-9 in modulating signaling pathways leading to CLL cell arrest. Therefore, local high (pro)MMP-9 expression may contribute to malignant cell retention in lymphoid organs and disease progression.",,"['Bailon, Elvira', 'Ugarte-Berzal, Estefania', 'Amigo-Jimenez, Irene', 'Van den Steen, Philippe', 'Opdenakker, Ghislain', 'Garcia-Marco, Jose A', 'Garcia-Pardo, Angeles']","['Bailon E', 'Ugarte-Berzal E', 'Amigo-Jimenez I', 'Van den Steen P', 'Opdenakker G', 'Garcia-Marco JA', 'Garcia-Pardo A']","['*Cellular and Molecular Medicine Department, Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain;']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140311,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'PTEN', 'RhoA', 'lymphoid organs']",2014/03/13 06:00,2014/03/13 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jlb.0913521 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0913521 [doi]']",aheadofprint,J Leukoc Biol. 2014 Mar 11. pii: jlb.0913521. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0913521.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the neurobiologic mechanisms underlying these impairments, particularly in young survivors, are not well understood. This study aimed to examine intrinsic functional brain connectivity in pediatric ALL and its relationship with cognitive status. PROCEDURE: We obtained resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and cognitive testing data from 15 ALL survivors age 8-15 years and 14 matched healthy children. The ALL group had a history of intrathecal chemotherapy treatment but were off-therapy for at least 6 months at the time of enrollment. We used seed-based analyses to compare intrinsic functional brain network connectivity between the groups. We also explored correlations between connectivity and cognitive performance, demographic, medical, and treatment variables. RESULTS: We demonstrated significantly reduced connectivity between bilateral hippocampus, left inferior occipital, left lingual gyrus, bilateral calcarine sulcus, and right amygdala in the ALL group compared to controls. The ALL group also showed regions of functional hyperconnectivity including right lingual gyrus, precuneus, bilateral superior occipital lobe, and right inferior occipital lobe. Functional hypoconnectivity was associated with reduced cognitive function as well as younger age at diagnosis in the ALL group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that intrinsic functional brain connectivity is disrupted in pediatric ALL following chemotherapy treatment. These results help explain cognitive dysfunction even when objective test performance is seemingly normal. Children diagnosed at a younger age may show increased vulnerability to altered functional brain connectivity.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kesler, Shelli R', 'Gugel, Meike', 'Pritchard-Berman, Mika', 'Lee, Clement', 'Kutner, Emily', 'Hosseini, S M Hadi', 'Dahl, Gary', 'Lacayo, Norman']","['Kesler SR', 'Gugel M', 'Pritchard-Berman M', 'Lee C', 'Kutner E', 'Hosseini SM', 'Dahl G', 'Lacayo N']","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.']",['eng'],['K07 CA134639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20140312,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*physiopathology', 'Child', '*Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders/etiology/*physiopathology/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nerve Net/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/psychology/therapy', '*Survivors']",PMC4028071,['NIHMS582519'],['NOTNLM'],"['chemotherapy', 'cognition', 'fMRI', 'leukemia', 'resting state']",2014/03/13 06:00,2014/06/17 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25022 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2014 Jul;61(7):1295-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25022.

The hypodiploid subgroup is heterogeneous and comprises ALL with a chromosome number of <46. To characterize a specific subset with low hypodiploid karyotype, we performed chromosome banding analysis, FISH, array comparative genomic hybridization, and mutational analyses of FBXW7, NOTCH1, KRAS, NRAS, TP53, and IKZF1 in 29 cases. We observed a nonrandom pattern of chromosome losses, including chromosomes 3, 7, 13, 15, 16, and 17. A deletion encompassing the CDKN2A/B locus was the only recurrent structural abnormality. A duplication of the low hypodiploid karyotype occurred frequently, resulting in a near triploid karyotype based on the definition by merely counting chromosomes but in fact was a very low tetraploid chromosome set. Mutational analyses revealed no mutations in IKZF1, FBXW7, NOTCH1, and KRAS and only one mutation in NRAS. However, we discovered a high frequency of TP53 mutations in 93% (27/29) of cases. In 26/27 cases with TP53 mutation, the second TP53 allele was lost due to monosomy 17. Median overall survival was short (18.5 months), which might be related to the high frequency of TP53 alterations. Therefore, ALL with low hypodiploidy is characterized by a typical pattern of chromosome losses and a remarkably high TP53 mutation frequency. Our data suggest the introduction of a novel WHO entity within the B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma group showing low hypodiploid/very low tetraploid karyotype and concomitant TP53 mutation.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Muhlbacher, Verena', 'Zenger, Melanie', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Weissmann, Sandra', 'Kunze, Franziska', 'Kohlmann, Alexander', 'Bellos, Frauke', 'Kern, Wolfgang', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia']","['Muhlbacher V', 'Zenger M', 'Schnittger S', 'Weissmann S', 'Kunze F', 'Kohlmann A', 'Bellos F', 'Kern W', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C']","['MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140311,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation Rate', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Triploidy', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/10/11 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/gcc.22163 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2014 Jun;53(6):524-36. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22163.

OBJECTIVE: To document the prevalences of HBV and HCV infections in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, and to determine whether infected patients experience more aggressive disease than those without infection. METHODS: Patient sera were screened for antibodies to HBV core antigen and HCV (anti-HCV) using ELISA; both sera and peripheral blood lymphocytes were further tested (regardless of antibody results) for HBV-DNA and HCV-RNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Prognostic markers for chronic lymphocytic leukemia included Rai stage, IgVH mutational status, beta2-microglobulin levels, Zap-70 and CD38 status. RESULTS: Fourteen of 222 (6.3%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and two of 72 (2.8%) healthy controls tested positive for previous or ongoing HBV infection (OR 2.4 [95% CI 0.5 to 7.7]; P=0.25) while four of 222 (1.8%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and one of 72 (1.4%) controls tested positive for HCV markers (OR 1.3 [95% CI 0.2 to 6.4]; P=0.81). The levels and distribution of the various indicators of aggressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia disease were similar among HBV- and HCV-infected and uninfected patients. Survival times were also similar. Occult HBV and HCV infection (HBV-DNA or HCV-RNA positive in the absence of diagnostic serological markers) were uncommon in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (0.5% and 1.8%, respectively).

These patients regularly develop resistance to FLT3 inhibitors suggesting that targeted combination drug strategies are needed to enhance AML therapy efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Acquired point mutations of FLT3-ITD gene were screened using cDNA-based sequencing approach in vitro sorafenib-resistant cells, which were developed by long-term exposure of Ba/F3-ITD to increasing doses of sorafenib, and in FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients, who developed relapse following sorafenib therapy. Drug effects (e.g., proliferation inhibition, apoptosis induction, and changes in signal transduction protein expression) were assessed in AML cells harboring the point mutations in vitro and in FLT3-ITD-mutated AML patient samples. RESULTS: We identified several acquired point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains (TKD) of the FLT3 gene in sorafenib-resistant murine leukemia cell line carrying human FLT3-ITD mutations, which were also detected in two of four sorafenib-resistant patient samples. Engineering these point mutations into Ba/F3-ITD cells generated sublines that demonstrated varying degrees of sorafenib [a type II tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)] resistance. A similar pattern of resistance could be observed by exposing these sublines to the other type II TKIs AC220 and MLN518. However, these sublines retained sensitivity to the type I TKIs PKC412 or crenolanib. The combination of crenolanib with sorafenib demonstrated marked cytotoxic effects in all of the sorafenib-resistant sublines.

Therefore there is a need for an in vitro model that would enable long term survival and propagation of spermatogonia. We aimed at the most simplified approach to enable all different cell types within the seminiferous tubules to contribute to the creation of a niche for spermatogonia. In the present study we describe the establishment of a co-culture of mouse testicular cells that is based on proliferative and migratory activity of seminiferous tubule cells and does not involve separation, purification or differential plating of individual cell populations. The co-culture is composed of the constituents of testicular stem cell niche: Sertoli cells [identified by expression of Wilm's tumour antigen 1 (WT1) and secretion of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, GDNF], peritubular myoid cells (expressing alpha smooth muscle actin, alphaSMA) and spermatogonia [expressing MAGE-B4, PLZF (promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger), LIN28, Gpr125 (G protein-coupled receptor 125), CD9, c-Kit and Nanog], and can be maintained for at least five weeks. GDNF was found in the medium at a sufficient concentration to support proliferating spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) that were able to start spermatogenic differentiation after transplantation to an experimentally sterile recipient testis. Gdnf mRNA levels were elevated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which shows that the Sertoli cells in the co-culture respond to physiological stimuli. After approximately 2-4 weeks of culture a spontaneous formation of cord-like structures was monitored. These structures can be more than 10 mm in length and branch. They are formed by peritubular myoid cells, Sertoli cells, fibroblasts and spermatogonia as assessed by gene expression profiling.

Normal primary inoculation of the core human microbiome is circumvented by cesarean section (CS) delivery, which is a proposed modulator of both immune response and early-life infection. METHODS: In this study, we examined CS delivery and the risk of childhood leukemia using data from the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS) case-control study and additive logistic regression models. RESULTS: We observed no association between CS and acute myelogenous leukemia [OR, 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-1.55]. We observed a suggestive association for ALL and CS (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.97-1.54). When examining common ALL (cALL), defined as ALL with expression of CD10 and CD19 surface antigens and diagnosis occurring between 2 and 5.9 years of age, we found a significant association with CS (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.0-2.06). ALL subjects that are not cALL showed a similar risk as ALL overall (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.91-1.44). Because of previous findings suggesting effect modification, we stratified cALL subjects by Hispanic status. Although we observed no relationship for CS in non-Hispanics (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.72-1.79), we did observe a strong association between cALL and CS in Hispanics (OR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.23-4.46). CONCLUSION: Within the CCLS, CS delivery seems to be associated with cALL and Hispanic subjects may be driving the association.

Although the mRNA export complex TREX, which contains Aly/REF, UAP56, and the THO complex, is involved in the NXF1-mediated nuclear export of cellular mRNAs, its contribution to the export of MLV mRNA transcripts remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the involvement of TREX components in the export of MLV transcripts. Depletion of UAP56, but not Aly/REF, reduced the level of both unspliced and spliced viral transcripts in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, depletion of THO components, including THOC5 and THOC7, affected only unspliced viral transcripts in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the RNA immunoprecipitation assay showed that only the unspliced viral transcript interacted with THOC5. These results imply that MLV requires UAP56, THOC5 and THOC7, in addition to NXF1, for nuclear export of viral transcripts. Given that naturally intronless mRNAs, but not bulk mRNAs, require THOC5 for nuclear export, it is plausible that THOC5 plays a key role in the export of unspliced MLV transcripts.",,"['Sakuma, Toshie', 'Tonne, Jason M', 'Ikeda, Yasuhiro']","['Sakuma T', 'Tonne JM', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905 USA. sakuma.toshie@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905 USA. tonne.jason@mayo.edu.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905 USA. ikeda.yasuhiro@mayo.edu.']",['eng'],['P30 CA015083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140310,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,IM,"['*Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Virus Replication']",PMC3970143,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/10/17 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/17 06:00 [medline]']","['v6031135 [pii]', '10.3390/v6031135 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2014 Mar 10;6(3):1135-48. doi: 10.3390/v6031135.,,"['0 (NXF1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (THOC5 protein, mouse)', '0 (THOC7 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Ddx39b protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the prognostic utility of quantitating cPCs using multiparametric flow cytometry in multiple myeloma (MM) patients with current treatments is unknown. There were 157 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed MM seen at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester from 2009 to 2011 that had their peripheral blood evaluated for cPCs by multiparameter flow cytometry. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and differences assessed using the log-rank test. Using a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, 400 cPCs were considered as the optimal cutoff for defining high-risk disease. The presence of 400 cPCs was associated with higher plasma cell (PC) proliferation and adverse cytogenetics. The median time-to-next-treatment and overall survival (OS) in patients with 400 cPCs (N=37, 24%) was 14 months and 32 months compared with 26 months and not reached for the rest (P<0.001). In a multivariable model, the presence of 400 cPCs and older age adversely affected OS.

Herein, we designed an experimental strategy with the aim of mimicking the microenvironment found in the proliferative centers to specifically target actively proliferating CLL cells. For this, we co-cultured CLL cells and bone marrow stromal cells with concomitant CD40 and Toll-like receptor 9 stimulation. This co-culture system induced proliferation, cell-cycle entry and marked resistance to treatment with fludarabine and bendamustine. Proliferating CLL cells clustered together showed a typical morphology of activated B cells and expressed survivin protein, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family that is mainly expressed by CLL cells in the proliferation centers. With the aim of specifically targeting actively proliferating and chemoresistant CLL cells, we investigated the effects of treatment with YM155, a small-molecule survivin inhibitor. YM155 treatment suppressed the co-culture-induced survivin expression and that was sufficient to inhibit proliferation and effectively induce apoptosis particularly in the proliferative subset of CLL cells. Interestingly, sensitivity to YM155 was independent from common prognostic markers, including 17p13.1 deletion. Altogether, these findings provide a rationale for clinical development of YM155 in CLL.",,"['Purroy, N', 'Abrisqueta, P', 'Carabia, J', 'Carpio, C', 'Calpe, E', 'Palacio, C', 'Castellvi, J', 'Crespo, M', 'Bosch, F']","['Purroy N', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Carabia J', 'Carpio C', 'Calpe E', 'Palacio C', 'Castellvi J', 'Crespo M', 'Bosch F']","[""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Department of Pathology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'CD40 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthoquinones/chemistry', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/chemistry', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Survivin', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/chemistry']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201496 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.96 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Oct;28(10):1993-2004. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.96.

CALR mutations are heterogeneous spanning over the exon 9, but all result in a novel common protein C terminus. We developed a polyclonal antibody against a 17-amino-acid peptide derived from mutated calreticulin that was used for immunostaining of bone marrow biopsies. We show that this antibody specifically recognized patients harboring different types of CALR mutation with no staining in healthy controls and JAK2- or MPL-mutated ET and PMF. The labeling was mostly localized in megakaryocytes, whereas myeloid and erythroid cells showed faint staining, suggesting a preferential expression of calreticulin in megakaryocytes. Megakaryocytic-restricted expression of calreticulin was also demonstrated using an antibody against wild-type calreticulin and by measuring the levels of calreticulin RNA by gene expression analysis. Immunostaining using an antibody specific for mutated calreticulin may become a rapid, simple and cost-effective method for identifying CALR-mutated patients complementing molecular analysis; furthermore, the labeling pattern supports the preferential expansion of megakaryocytic cell lineage as a result of CALR mutation in an immature hematopoietic stem cell.",,"['Vannucchi, A M', 'Rotunno, G', 'Bartalucci, N', 'Raugei, G', 'Carrai, V', 'Balliu, M', 'Mannarelli, C', 'Pacilli, A', 'Calabresi, L', 'Fjerza, R', 'Pieri, L', 'Bosi, A', 'Manfredini, R', 'Guglielmelli, P']","['Vannucchi AM', 'Rotunno G', 'Bartalucci N', 'Raugei G', 'Carrai V', 'Balliu M', 'Mannarelli C', 'Pacilli A', 'Calabresi L', 'Fjerza R', 'Pieri L', 'Bosi A', 'Manfredini R', 'Guglielmelli P']","['1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', ""Centre for Regenerative Medicine 'Stefano Ferrari', Department of Life Science, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy."", '1] Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Laboratorio Congiunto MMPC, University of Florence, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy [2] Hematology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140312,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Calreticulin/analysis/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics']",PMC4158831,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/11/02 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2014100 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Sep;28(9):1811-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.100.

One patient had a myelodysplastic syndrome with colon infiltration and agranulocytosis. The outcome was favorable with efficient antiretroviral therapy and steroids in HIV-infected patients and intravenous immunoglobulins in 2/3 non-HIV patients. Six patients had an agranulocytosis of favorable outcome with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor only (3 cases), cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cyclosporine A, or no treatment (1 case each). Three patients had a pure red cell aplasia, of favorable outcome in 2 cases with methotrexate and cyclosporine A; one patient was unresponsive. Chronic CD8(+) T-cell expansions with organ infiltration in immunocompromised patients may involve other organs than parotid glands; they are non clonal and of favorable outcome after correction of the immune deficiency and/or steroids. In patients with bone marrow infiltration and unexplained cytopenia, CD8(+) T-cell expansions can be clonal or not; their identification suggests that cytopenias are immune-mediated. Our results extend the clinical spectrum of chronic CD8(+) T-cell expansions.",,"['Ghrenassia, Etienne', 'Roulin, Louise', 'Aline-Fardin, Aude', 'Marzac, Christophe', 'Feger, Frederic', 'Gay, Julie', 'Pacanowski, Jerome', 'Hertig, Alexandre', 'Coppo, Paul']","['Ghrenassia E', 'Roulin L', 'Aline-Fardin A', 'Marzac C', 'Feger F', 'Gay J', 'Pacanowski J', 'Hertig A', 'Coppo P']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), Univ Paris 06, Paris, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Immuno-Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Immuno-Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), Univ Paris 06, Paris, France."", ""Service de Maladies Infectieuses et Tropicales, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France."", ""Urgences Nephrologiques et Transplantation Renale, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), Univ Paris 06, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopitaux Universitaire de L'Est Parisien, AP-HP, Paris, France; Universite Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), Univ Paris 06, Paris, France; Inserm U1009, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Centre de Reference des Microangiopathies thrombotiques, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140311,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Coinfection', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HIV Infections/*complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytosis/diagnosis/etiology/pathology', 'Leukopenia/etiology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/diagnosis/*etiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/diagnosis/etiology/pathology']",PMC3950180,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2015/05/30 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0091505 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-49698 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 11;9(3):e91505. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0091505. eCollection 2014.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the histopathologic features, immunohistochemistry, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status of 29 patients with scrotal SCC. The mean age at presentation was 55 years (range, 30 to 74 y). White to black ratio was 1.9:1. There was no predominant occupation, with the majority being white-collar professionals. Clinical history of condylomas was present in 5 patients, and 7 patients had a history of multiple skin cancers including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and other SCCs. Other comorbidities included human immunodeficiency virus infection (n=2), kidney transplant (n=1), leukemia/lymphoma (n=2), hidradenitis suppurativa (n=1), chronic scrotal infections with abscess (n=1), inflamed epidermal inclusion cyst (n=1), and lichen planus (n=1). One patient had a history of regular tanning bed use. Morphologically, the majority was usual type (n=17), followed by basaloid (n=7) and warty (n=5). Nineteen cases were in situ, and 10 were invasive. Three patients had inguinal lymphadenopathy; in 1, metastasis was confirmed. Suprabasal nuclear staining for Ki67 was considered positive. For p16, a continuous band of nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was considered positive, and a noncontinuous or absence of staining was considered negative. p16 was positive in 10 cases; high-risk HPV was confirmed in 7 cases. Ki67 was positive in 8/17 (47%) usual, 6/7 (85.7%) basaloid, and 3/5 (60%) warty type. p53 was positive in 5/17 (29.4%) usual, 2/7 (28.6%) basaloid, and 1/5 (20%) warty type. All patients were treated with local excision only; 13 had positive margins. Three patients were treated with imiquimod after local excision. The median follow-up was 30 months. Three patients recurred and were treated with re-excision; 1 patient received radiotherapy. Overall, the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and HPV studies show that, similar to SCC of the vulva or penis, the SCC of the scrotum can be divided into 2 major groups. Group 1 (38.5%): positive for p16 and elevated Ki67. This group is associated with HPV infection and displays predominantly a basaloid or warty morphology, although a number of them are of usual type. Group 2 (61.5%): negative for p16. This group has variable Ki67 expression, is consistently negative for HPV, and displays predominantly usual-type morphology. SCC of the scrotum in the United States currently affects primarily white-collar professionals. The majority present with in situ lesions, and the high rate of positive margins at first excision suggests that they are clinically ill-defined lesions. No longer are occupational exposures to carcinogens the major etiology of scrotal SCC. Rather in contemporary times, common risk factors include HPV infection, immunocompromised states, and chronic scrotal inflammatory conditions.",,"['Matoso, Andres', 'Ross, Hillary M', 'Chen, Sonja', 'Allbritton, Jill', 'Epstein, Jonathan I']","['Matoso A', 'Ross HM', 'Chen S', 'Allbritton J', 'Epstein JI']","['Departments of *Pathology section signOncology parallelUrology, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore double daggerMiraca LifeScience Laboratory, Glen Burnie, MD daggerDepartment of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/chemistry/ethnology/*pathology/secondary/therapy/virology', 'Comorbidity', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/analysis', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Genital Neoplasms, Male/chemistry/ethnology/*pathology/therapy/virology', 'Human Papillomavirus DNA Tests', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Papillomaviridae/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reoperation', 'Risk Factors', 'Scrotum/chemistry/*pathology/virology', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/08/02 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PAS.0000000000000192 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2014 Jul;38(7):973-81. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000000192.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of them focused on coding regions. However, those regions represent only 1.5% of the entire genome. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), it has been suggested that the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is dysregulated, which suggests that they may have a role in ALL risk. Changes in miRNA function may occur through single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs, and/or miRNA-processing genes, contribute to a predisposition for childhood ALL. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 118 SNPs in pre-miRNAs and miRNA-processing genes in 213 B-cell ALL patients and 387 controls. RESULTS: We found 11 SNPs significantly associated with ALL susceptibility. These included three SNPs present in miRNA genes (miR-612, miR-499, and miR-449b) and eight SNPs present in six miRNA biogenesis pathway genes (TNRC6B, DROSHA, DGCR8, EIF2C1, CNOT1, and CNOT6). Among the 118 SNPs analyzed, rs12803915 in mir-612 and rs3746444 in mir-499 exhibited a more significant association, with a P value <0.01. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that SNP rs12803915 located in pre-mir-612, and SNP rs3746444 located in pre-mir-499, may represent novel markers of B-cell ALL susceptibility.",,"['Gutierrez-Camino, Angela', 'Lopez-Lopez, Elixabet', 'Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Pinan, Maria A', 'Garcia-Miguel, Purificacion', 'Sanchez-Toledo, Jose', 'Carbone Baneres, Ana', 'Uriz, Javier', 'Navajas, Aurora', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa']","['Gutierrez-Camino A', 'Lopez-Lopez E', 'Martin-Guerrero I', 'Pinan MA', 'Garcia-Miguel P', 'Sanchez-Toledo J', 'Carbone Baneres A', 'Uriz J', 'Navajas A', 'Garcia-Orad A']","['Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology and Hemotherapy, University Hospital Cruces, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Service of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.', ""Service of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Vall d' Hebron, VHIR, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Unit of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.', 'Unit of Pediatric Oncohematology, University Hospital Donostia, San Sebastian, Spain.', 'Unit of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Cruces, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Leioa, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140311,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Child', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Untranslated/*genetics']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2015/02/03 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2013/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/03 06:00 [medline]']","['pr201443 [pii]', '10.1038/pr.2014.43 [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2014 Jun;75(6):767-73. doi: 10.1038/pr.2014.43.

STWS usually results in infant mortality, yet some STWS patients survive into and, in some cases, beyond adolescence. STWS is caused by a mutation in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene, which is inherited in an autosomally recessive pattern. Most LIFR mutations resulting in STWS are null mutations which cause instability of the mRNA and prevent the formation of LIFR, impairing the signaling pathway. LIFR signaling usually follows the JAK/STAT3 pathway, and is initiated by several interleukin-6-type cytokines.

To gain a better insight into the signal transduction mechanisms of PDGFRalpha oncogenes, we mutated twelve potentially phosphorylated tyrosine residues of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and identified three mutations that affected cell proliferation. In particular, mutation of tyrosine 720 in FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha or PDGFRalpha(D842V) inhibited cell growth and blocked ERK signaling in Ba/F3 cells. This mutation also decreased myeloproliferation in transplanted mice and the proliferation of human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors transduced with FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. We showed that the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 bound directly to tyrosine 720 of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. SHP2 knock-down decreased proliferation of Ba/F3 cells transformed with FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and PDGFRalpha(D842V) and affected ERK signaling, but not STAT5 phosphorylation. Remarkably, SHP2 was not essential for cell proliferation and ERK phosphorylation induced by the wild-type PDGF receptor in response to ligand stimulation, suggesting a shift in the function of SHP2 downstream of oncogenic receptors. In conclusion, our results indicate that SHP2 is required for cell transformation and ERK activation by mutant PDGF receptors.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

During development, NK cells become ""licensed"" only after they encounter cognate human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, leading to the acquisition of effector function. NK cells can be exploited for cancer therapy in several ways. These include targeting with monoclonal antibodies alone or combined with ex vivo and in vivo NK cell activation to facilitate adoptive immunotherapy using donor-derived NK cell products to induce graft-vs-tumor effects. In the adoptive transfer setting, persistence and in vivo expansion requires lymphodepleting chemotherapy to prevent rejection and provide homeostatic cytokines (such as IL-15) that activate NK cells. IL-15 has the advantage of avoiding regulatory T-cell expansion. Clinical applications are currently being tested. To enhance in vivo expansion, IL-2 has been used at low doses. However, low dose administration also leads to the stimulation of regulatory T cells. Monoclonal antibodies and bispecific killer engagers (BiKEs) may enhance specificity by targeting CD16 on NK cells to tumor antigens. Inhibition of CD16 shedding may also promote enhanced cytotoxicity. Future strategies include exploiting favorable donor immunogenetics or ex vivo expansion of NK cells from blood, progenitors, or pluripotent cells. Comparative clinical trials are needed to test these approaches.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Different tissue-culture systems promote the survival of the neoplastic lymphocytes from CLL, partly replicating the in vivo tissue environment of the disorder. In the present study, we focussed on the initial adaptive changes to the tissue culture environment focussing particularly on migratory behaviour and cellular interactions. METHODS: A high-density CLL culture system was employed to test CLL cell-responses using a range of microscopic techniques and flow cytometric analyses, supported by mathematical measures of cell shape-change and by biochemical techniques. The study focussed on the evaluation of changes to the F-actin cytoskeleton and cell behaviour and on ABL1 signalling processes. RESULTS: We showed that the earliest functional response by the neoplastic lymphocytes was a rapid shape-change caused through rearrangement of the F-actin cytoskeleton that resulted in amoeboid motility and promoted frequent homotypic interaction between cells. This initial response was functionally distinct from the elongated motility that was induced by chemokine stimulation, and which also characterised heterotypic interactions between CLL lymphocytes and accessory cells at later culture periods. ABL1 is highly expressed in CLL lymphocytes and supports their survival, it is also recognised however to have a major role in the control of the F-actin cytoskeleton. We found that the cytoplasmic fraction of ABL1 became co-localised with F-actin structures of the CLL lymphocytes and that the ABL1 substrate CRKL became phosphorylated during initial shape-change. The ABL-inhibitor imatinib mesylate prevented amoeboid movement and markedly reduced homotypic interactions, causing cells to acquire a globular shape to rearrange F-actin to a microvillus form that closely resembled that of CLL cells isolated directly from circulation. CONCLUSION: We suggest that ABL1-induced amoeboid motility and homotypic interaction represent a distinctive early response to the tissue environment by CLL lymphocytes. This response is separate from that induced by chemokine or during heterotypic cell-contact, and may play a role in the initial entry and interactions of CLL lymphocytes in tissues.",,"['Hutchinson, Claire V', 'Natarajan, Shiva', 'Johnson, Suzanne M', 'Adams, Julie A', 'Rees-Unwin, Karen S', 'Burthem, John']","['Hutchinson CV', 'Natarajan S', 'Johnson SM', 'Adams JA', 'Rees-Unwin KS', 'Burthem J']","[""Institute of Cancer Sciences, Haematological Oncology, University of Manchester, Level 5 Research St, Mary's Hospital, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9WL, UK.

These cells have potential therapeutic applications, but are recognised to have defective function. In normal DCs, activation and maturation depend on ABL1 dependent signals. We therefore tested the hypothesis that in the DCs of chronic myeloid leukaemia, the presence of the BCR/ABL1 molecule disrupts normal ABL1 signal pathways, and contributes to the observed functional defects of the cells. METHODS: We employed in vitro culture of clinical samples, combining microscopic and biochemical techniques with a phosphoproteomic approach to compare and characterise DCs from normal individuals and chronic myeloid leukaemia patients. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified an altered intracellular localisation for ABL1 within DCs derived from the monocytes of chronic myeloid leukaemia. The protein was found in the perinuclear region co-distributed with the adapter-protein CRKL and the BCR/ABL1 protein. This altered distribution was associated with defective generation of ABL1-dependent maturation signals, and a dislocation of ABL1 from the F-actin cytoskeleton. We suggest that abnormal ABL1-dependent signals contribute to the recognised functional defects affecting chronic myeloid leukaemia DCs.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The regulation of MEIS1 is complex, and its expression is known to be influenced by changes of promoter methylation and binding of microRNA-204 (miR-204). Therefore, in our study, we assessed the expression of MEIS1 and PBX2 and the factors regulating expression of MEIS1 in nephroblastomas. MEIS1 and PBX2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were investigated by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Promoter methylation of MEIS1 was evaluated using a methylation-specific PCR assay. Expression levels of miR-204 were examined by qRT-PCR. Eighteen of 21 nephroblastomas showed a high level of MEIS1 mRNA, and 22 of 26 samples had a specific nuclear protein expression. MicroRNA-204 had a statistically significantly lower expression in all nephroblastomas investigated compared with renal parenchyma, but no change of MEIS1 promoter methylation status was noted. Eleven of 23 nephroblastomas had a high expression of PBX2 mRNA, and 15 of 23 samples had a specific nuclear protein expression was noted. In our study, we demonstrated an expression of MEIS1 and its binding partner PBX2 in most nephroblastomas. The statistically significantly lower expression of miR-204 in all nephroblastomas investigated might point to an involvement of miR-204 in the regulation of MEIS1 in nephroblastomas.",,"['Koller, Karin', 'Pichler, Martin', 'Koch, Karin', 'Zandl, Martina', 'Stiegelbauer, Verena', 'Leuschner, Ivo', 'Hoefler, Gerald', 'Guertl, Barbara']","['Koller K', 'Pichler M', 'Koch K', 'Zandl M', 'Stiegelbauer V', 'Leuschner I', 'Hoefler G', 'Guertl B']","['1 Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 25, 8036 Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140311,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics/metabolism']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['MEIS1', 'PBX2', 'miR-204', 'nephroblastoma']",2014/03/13 06:00,2014/09/10 06:00,['2014/03/13 06:00'],"['2014/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2350/13-01-1288-OA.1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2014 May-Jun;17(3):169-75. doi: 10.2350/13-01-1288-OA.1.

We found that casein kinase 1 alpha (Csnk1a1), a serine-threonine kinase, is essential for AML cell survival in vivo. Normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were relatively less affected by shRNA-mediated knockdown of Csnk1a1. To identify downstream mediators of Csnk1a1 critical for leukemia cells, we performed an in vivo pooled shRNA screen and gene expression profiling. We found that Csnk1a1 knockdown results in decreased Rps6 phosphorylation, increased p53 activity, and myeloid differentiation. Consistent with these observations, p53-null leukemias were insensitive to Csnk1a1 knockdown. We further evaluated whether D4476, a casein kinase 1 inhibitor, would exhibit selective antileukemic effects. Treatment of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) with D4476 showed highly selective killing of LSCs over normal HSPCs. In summary, these findings demonstrate that Csnk1a1 inhibition causes reduced Rps6 phosphorylation and activation of p53, resulting in selective elimination of leukemia cells, revealing Csnk1a1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AML.",,"['Jaras, Marcus', 'Miller, Peter G', 'Chu, Lisa P', 'Puram, Rishi V', 'Fink, Emma C', 'Schneider, Rebekka K', 'Al-Shahrour, Fatima', 'Pena, Pablo', 'Breyfogle, L Jordan', 'Hartwell, Kimberly A', 'McConkey, Marie E', 'Cowley, Glenn S', 'Root, David E', 'Kharas, Michael G', 'Mullally, Ann', 'Ebert, Benjamin L']","['Jaras M', 'Miller PG', 'Chu LP', 'Puram RV', 'Fink EC', 'Schneider RK', 'Al-Shahrour F', 'Pena P', 'Breyfogle LJ', 'Hartwell KA', 'McConkey ME', 'Cowley GS', 'Root DE', 'Kharas MG', 'Mullally A', 'Ebert BL']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['P01 CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007753/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL082945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140310,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Casein Kinase Ialpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ribosomal Protein S6/metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC3978274,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/05/31 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/31 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20131033 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20131033 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2014 Apr 7;211(4):605-12. doi: 10.1084/jem.20131033.

We assessed the prognostic value of CTCs for overall survival (OS) and disease response in S0421, a phase III trial of docetaxel plus prednisone with or without atrasentan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CTCs were enumerated at baseline (day 0) and before cycle two (day 21) using CellSearch. Baseline counts and changes in counts from day 0 to 21 were evaluated for association with OS, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and RECIST response using Cox regression as well as receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) analysis, and regression trees. RESULTS: Median day-0 CTC count was five cells per 7.5 mL, and CTCs < versus >/= five per 7.5 mL were significantly associated with baseline PSA, bone pain, liver disease, hemoglobin, alkaline phosphatase, and subsequent PSA and RECIST response. Median OS was 26 months for < five versus 13 months for >/= five CTCs per 7.5 mL at day 0 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74 [adjusting for covariates]). ROC curves had higher areas under the curve for day-0 CTCs than for PSA, and IDI analysis showed that adding day-0 CTCs to baseline PSA and other covariates increased predictive accuracy for survival by 8% to 10%. Regression trees yielded new prognostic subgroups, and rising CTC count from day 0 to 21 was associated with shorter OS (HR, 2.55). CONCLUSION: These data validate the prognostic utility of CTC enumeration in a large docetaxel-based prospective cohort. Baseline CTC counts were prognostic, and rising CTCs at 3 weeks heralded significantly worse OS, potentially serving as an early metric to help redirect and optimize therapy in this clinical setting.",,"['Goldkorn, Amir', 'Ely, Benjamin', 'Quinn, David I', 'Tangen, Catherine M', 'Fink, Louis M', 'Xu, Tong', 'Twardowski, Przemyslaw', 'Van Veldhuizen, Peter J', 'Agarwal, Neeraj', 'Carducci, Michael A', 'Monk, J Paul 3rd', 'Datar, Ram H', 'Garzotto, Mark', 'Mack, Philip C', 'Lara, Primo Jr', 'Higano, Celestia S', 'Hussain, Maha', 'Thompson, Ian Murchie Jr', 'Cote, Richard J', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J']","['Goldkorn A', 'Ely B', 'Quinn DI', 'Tangen CM', 'Fink LM', 'Xu T', 'Twardowski P', 'Van Veldhuizen PJ', 'Agarwal N', 'Carducci MA', 'Monk JP 3rd', 'Datar RH', 'Garzotto M', 'Mack PC', 'Lara P Jr', 'Higano CS', 'Hussain M', 'Thompson IM Jr', 'Cote RJ', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Amir Goldkorn, David I.

RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcript is a well-established marker for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. In this study, we investigated the feasibility and performances of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 DNA as MRD marker in AML with t(8;21). In 17/22 patients with t(8;21)-positive AML treated in the French CBF-2006 trial, breakpoints in RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 were identified using long-range PCR followed by next-generation sequencing. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 DNA quantification was performed by real-time quantitative PCR using patient-specific primers and probe. MRD levels were evaluated in 71 follow-up samples from 16 patients, with a median of four samples [range 2-7] per patient. RUNX1 breakpoints were located in intron 5 in all cases. RUNX1T1 breakpoints were located in intron 1b in 15 cases and in intron 1a in two cases. RUNX1-RUNX1T1 MRD levels measured on DNA and RNA were strongly correlated (r = 0.8, P < 0.0001). Discordant MRD results were observed in 10/71 (14%) of the samples: in three samples from two patients who relapsed, RUNX1-RUNX1T1 was detectable only on DNA, while RUNX1-RUNX1T1 was detectable only on RNA in seven samples. MRD monitoring on genomic DNA is feasible, but with sensitivity variations depending on the patient breakpoint sequence and the qPCR assay efficiency.

Patients were treated at 6 dose levels of oral idelalisib (range 50-350 mg once or twice daily) and remained on continuous therapy while deriving clinical benefit. Idelalisib-mediated inhibition of PI3Kdelta led to abrogation of Akt phosphorylation in patient CLL cells and significantly reduced serum levels of CLL-related chemokines. The most commonly observed grade >/=3 adverse events were pneumonia (20%), neutropenic fever (11%), and diarrhea (6%). Idelalisib treatment resulted in nodal responses in 81% of patients. The overall response rate was 72%, with 39% of patients meeting the criteria for partial response per IWCLL 2008 and 33% meeting the recently updated criteria of PR with treatment-induced lymphocytosis.(1,2) The median progression-free survival for all patients was 15.8 months. This study demonstrates the clinical utility of inhibiting the PI3Kdelta pathway with idelalisib. Our findings support the further development of idelalisib in patients with CLL.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Records of leukaemia patients aged 0-14 years at diagnosis were identified in the National Registry of Childhood Tumours and linked to birth registrations, Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group records, Hospital Episode Statistics and Medical Research Council clinical trial registers. Trial entry rates were compared between categories of birth weight, congenital malformation, socioeconomic status and ethnicity. RESULTS: 9147 ALL and 1466 AML patients were eligible for national clinical trials during 1980-2007. Overall recruitment rates were 81% and 60% respectively. For ALL, rates varied significantly with congenital malformation (Down syndrome 61%, other malformations 80%, none 82%; p<0.001) and ethnicity (South Asian 78%, other minority groups 80%, white 85%; p<0.001).

However, they are also associated with significant adverse effects and their molecular mechanism of action is not fully understood. Glucocorticoid treatment induces expression of the mTORC1 inhibitor Regulated in Development and DNA Damage Response 1 (REDD1), also known as DNA-Damage Inducible Transcript 4 (DDIT4), and mTORC1 inhibition may distinguish glucocorticoid-sensitive from glucocorticoid-resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Interestingly, REDD1 induction was impaired in glucocorticoid-resistant ALL cells and inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin restored glucocorticoid sensitivity. These data suggest that REDD1 may be essential for the response of ALL cells to glucocorticoids. To further investigate the role of REDD1, we evaluated the effects of glucocorticoids on primary thymocytes from wild-type and REDD1-deficient mice. Glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis was blocked by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist and by an inhibitor of transcription, which interfered with REDD1 induction and mTORC1 inhibition. However, REDD1 ablation had no effect on glucocorticoid-induced mTORC1 inhibition and apoptosis in thymocytes ex vivo. Overall, these data not only demonstrate the contextual differences of downstream signaling following glucocorticoid treatment but also provide a better mechanistic understanding of the role of REDD1. IMPLICATIONS: These molecular findings underlying glucocorticoid action and the role of REDD1 are fundamental for the design of novel, more efficacious, and less toxic analogs.

The gain of function mutation (A572V)JAK3 has been discovered in acute megakaryoplastic leukemia. JAK3 is inactivated by replacement of lysine by alanine in the catalytic subunit ((K855A)JAK3). Regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis involves altered activity of Cl(-) channels. The present study, thus, explored whether JAK3 modifies the function of the small conductance Cl(-) channel ClC-2. To this end, ClC-2 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes with or without wild-type JAK3, (A568V)JAK3 or (K851A)JAK3, and the Cl(-) channel activity determined by dual-electrode voltage clamp. Channel protein abundance in the cell membrane was determined utilizing chemiluminescence. As a result, expression of ClC-2 was followed by a marked increase of cell membrane conductance. The conductance was significantly decreased following coexpression of JAK3 or (A568V)JAK3, but not by coexpression of (K851A)JAK3. Exposure of the oocytes expressing ClC-2 together with (A568V)JAK3 to the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P154 (4-[(3'-bromo-4'-hydroxyphenyl)amino]-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline, 22 muM) increased the conductance. Coexpression of (A568V)JAK3 decreased the ClC-2 protein abundance in the cell membrane of ClC-2 expressing oocytes. The decline of conductance in ClC-2 and (A568V)JAK3 coexpressing oocytes following inhibition of channel protein insertion by brefeldin A (5 muM) was similar in oocytes expressing ClC-2 with (A568V)JAK3 and oocytes expressing ClC-2 alone, indicating that (A568V)JAK3 might slow channel protein insertion into rather than accelerating channel protein retrieval from the cell membrane. In conclusion, JAK3 downregulates ClC-2 activity and thus counteracts Cl(-) exit-an effect possibly influencing cell proliferation and apoptosis.",,"['Warsi, Jamshed', 'Elvira, Bernat', 'Hosseinzadeh, Zohreh', 'Shumilina, Ekaterina', 'Lang, Florian']","['Warsi J', 'Elvira B', 'Hosseinzadeh Z', 'Shumilina E', 'Lang F']","['Department of Physiology I, University of Tubingen, Gmelinstr. 5, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140311,United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Cell Size', 'Chloride Channels/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 3/genetics', 'Xenopus']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/12/19 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00232-014-9645-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 2014 May;247(5):387-93. doi: 10.1007/s00232-014-9645-0.

So far, there is no validation of the FSI with regard to patients with cancer. METHODS: The scales leisure time, relatives and partnership of the FSI were test-statistically analyzed in hemato-oncological patients. Concordant validity was examined referring to the German version of the ""Social Support Questionnaire (F-Sozu)"" and one scale of the ""EORTC QLQ-C30"". RESULTS: In N = 184 participants, we observed in 1% - 20% missing values for several items. Ceiling effects could be observed for the scales relatives (1.22-2.20), whereby for the scales leisure time (1.27-2.95) and partnership (1.51-3.91) the range was substantially higher. Internal consistency averaged about 0.75 (leisure time, partnership), respectively, 0.69 (relatives). Analyses for validity showed values of -0.23 to -0.50 (F-Sozu) as well as -0.29 to -0.40 (EORTC QLQ-C30), respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 48 AL patients received chemotherapy were divided into four groups: recurrent acute myeloid leukemia group (R-AML; n=15); AML continue remission group (AML-CR; n = 13); recurrent acute lymphocytic leukemia group (R-ALL; n=13); and ALL-CR group (n=7). Fifteen age-matched patients with non-hematologic disease were used as controls. RESULTS: Expression levels of P-gp, LRP/MVP, BCL-2, GST-pi, PCNA, CXCR4 were increased significantly in both AML-R and ALL-R groups (p < 0.05). Besides, LFA-1 and TRAIL-R were also up-expressed significantly in ALL-R group (p < 0.05). In addition, the levels of P-gp, GST-pi expressed in AML-R group were higher than those in AML-CR group (p < 0.05) and P-gp, LRP/MVP, GST-pi, LFA-1 and CXCR4 in ALL-R were expressed higher than those in ALL-CR group (p < 0.05).

Therefore, it would be useful to identify predictors of adverse effects. In the last years, several studies have investigated the relationship between genetic variation and treatment-related toxicity. However, most of these studies are focused in coding regions. Nowadays, it is known that regions that do not codify proteins, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), may have an important regulatory function. MiRNAs can regulate the expression of genes affecting drug response. In fact, the expression of some of those miRNAs has been associated with drug response. Genetic variations affecting miRNAs can modify their function, which may lead to drug sensitivity. The aim of this study was to detect new toxicity markers in pediatric B-ALL, studying miRNA-related polymorphisms, which can affect miRNA levels and function. We analyzed 118 SNPs in pre-miRNAs and miRNA processing genes in association with toxicity in 152 pediatric B-ALL patients all treated with the same protocol (LAL/SHOP). Among the results found, we detected for the first time an association between rs639174 in DROSHA and vomits that remained statistically significant after FDR correction. DROSHA had been associated with alterations in miRNAs expression, which could affect genes involved in drug transport.

The authors have observed that secondary causes are frequently associated with bilateral lacrimal outflow disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate this relationship to help the clinician prioritize which patients to evaluate for secondary causes. METHODS: This is a retrospective case-controlled review of patients who underwent bilateral DCR from 1986 to 2012 at this institution. They are compared with an age and gender-matched control group who underwent unilateral DCR. Statistical analysis was undertaken using the Pearson chi-square test for p value, except for age, which used the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Logistic regression was used for comparing prevalence of secondary issues in bilateral disease versus unilateral disease, with age as covariate. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients underwent bilateral (91) or unilateral DCR (144). Twice as many patients undergoing bilateral DCR had an underlying secondary cause compared with the patients undergoing unilateral DCR. (38%, 19%, p= 0.001, odds ratio 2.59). In patients <50, the odds ratio of a secondary cause in bilateral disease would be 5.34 compared with patients older than 80. (p = 0.0002) Patients in the bilateral DCR group underwent revisions at more than twice the rate as patients in the unilateral DCR group (26%, 12%, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists should have a high index of suspicion for secondary conditions underlying bilateral lacrimal outflow obstruction, especially in patients <50. These patients should undergo laboratory workup and intraoperative biopsy. They should also be counseled regarding a higher failure rate.",,"['Sobel, Rachel K', 'Carter, Keith D', 'Allen, Richard C']","['Sobel RK', 'Carter KD', 'Allen RC']","['Departments of *Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, and daggerOtolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa, U.S.A.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dacryocystorhinostomy', 'Eye Diseases/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lacrimal Duct Obstruction/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasolacrimal Duct/*pathology/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/09/11 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/IOP.0000000000000034 [doi]', '00002341-201403000-00012 [pii]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2014 Mar-Apr;30(2):152-6. doi: 10.1097/IOP.0000000000000034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since HIV-1 envelope gp41 antibodies also frequently use IGHV1-69 gene segments, we hypothesized that IGHV1-69 B-CLL precursors may contribute to the gp41 B cell response during HIV-1 infection. To test this hypothesis, we rescued 5 IGHV1-69 unmutated antibodies as heterohybridoma IgM paraproteins and as recombinant IgG1 antibodies from B-CLL patients, determined their antigenic specificities and analyzed BCR sequences. IGHV1-69 B-CLL antibodies were enriched for reactivity with HIV-1 envelope gp41, influenza, hepatitis C virus E2 protein and intestinal commensal bacteria. These IGHV1-69 B-CLL antibodies preferentially used IGHD3 and IGHJ6 gene segments and had long heavy chain complementary determining region 3s (HCDR3s) (>/=21 aa). IGHV1-69 B-CLL BCRs exhibited a phenylalanine at position 54 (F54) of the HCDR2 as do rare HIV-1 gp41 and influenza hemagglutinin stem neutralizing antibodies, while IGHV1-69 gp41 antibodies induced by HIV-1 infection predominantly used leucine (L54) allelic variants. These results demonstrate that the B-CLL cell population is an expansion of members of the innate polyreactive B cell repertoire with reactivity to a number of infectious agent antigens including intestinal commensal bacteria. The B-CLL IGHV1-69 B cell usage of F54 allelic variants strongly suggests that IGHV1-69 B-CLL gp41 antibodies derive from a restricted B cell pool that also produces rare HIV-1 gp41 and influenza hemagglutinin stem antibodies.",,"['Hwang, Kwan-Ki', 'Trama, Ashley M', 'Kozink, Daniel M', 'Chen, Xi', 'Wiehe, Kevin', 'Cooper, Abby J', 'Xia, Shi-Mao', 'Wang, Minyue', 'Marshall, Dawn J',

Immunoblot analysis revealed collectively high protein levels of prosurvival Bcl-2 members in cell lines and a panel of MCC tumors. Downregulation of individual Bcl-2 proteins by RNAi promoted death in a subset of MCC cell lines, whereas simultaneous inhibition of multiple family members by using the small-molecule antagonist ABT-263 led to a marked induction of cell death in 10 of 11 lines. ABT-263 induced Bax-dependent apoptosis with rapid cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, regardless of Bcl-2 family profile or the presence of Merkel cell polyomavirus. Furthermore, ABT-263 treatment led to rapid and sustained growth suppression of MCC xenografts from a representative cell line, accompanied by a striking increase in apoptosis.

We identified 11 additional de novo mutations by sequencing DNMT3A in a further 142 individuals with overgrowth. The mutations alter residues in functional DNMT3A domains, and protein modeling suggests that they interfere with domain-domain interactions and histone binding. Similar mutations were not present in 1,000 UK population controls (13/152 cases versus 0/1,000 controls; P < 0.0001). Mutation carriers had a distinctive facial appearance, intellectual disability and greater height.

Although clearly beneficial, there are concerns that the chronic use of G-CSF in certain conditions increases the risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The most striking example is in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Patients with SCN develop MDS/AML at a high rate that is directly correlated to the cumulative lifetime dosage of G-CSF. Myelodysplastic syndrome and AML that arise in these settings are commonly associated with chromosomal deletions. We have demonstrated in this study that chronic G-CSF treatment in mice results in expansion of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population. In addition, primitive hematopoietic progenitors from G-CSF-treated mice show evidence of DNA damage as demonstrated by an increase in double-strand breaks and recurrent chromosomal deletions. Concurrent treatment with genistein, a natural soy isoflavone, limits DNA damage in this population. The protective effect of genistein seems to be related to its preferential inhibition of G-CSF-induced proliferation of HSCs. Importantly, genistein does not impair G-CSF-induced proliferation of committed hematopoietic progenitors, nor diminishes neutrophil production. The protective effect of genistein was accomplished with plasma levels that are attainable through dietary supplementation.",,"['Souza, Liliana R', 'Silva, Erica', 'Calloway, Elissa', 'Kucuk, Omer', 'Rossi, Michael', 'McLemore, Morgan L']","['Souza LR', 'Silva E', 'Calloway E', 'Kucuk O', 'Rossi M', 'McLemore ML']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, 1365C Clifton Road, Room C3078, Atlanta, GA 30322. lsouza@emory.edu.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140310,United States,Cancer Prev Res (Phila),"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",101479409,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomal Instability/drug effects', 'Cytoprotection/*drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/prevention & control']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2015/01/13 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['1940-6207.CAPR-13-0295 [pii]', '10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0295 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Prev Res (Phila). 2014 May;7(5):534-44. doi: 10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0295.

DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients were identified from the orbital databases at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, England, and the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. METHODS: A retrospective, noncomparative review of the clinical case notes, radiology, and histopathology was performed. The English-language medical literature was reviewed for reports of enlargement of the infraorbital canal or nerve. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Extent of clinical and radiologic changes in patients with enlargement of the infraorbital canal. RESULTS: A total of 14 patients (10 male) presented between the ages of 29 and 76 years with proptosis, eyelid swelling or a mass (10/14 cases), and periocular ache (5/14 cases). Clinical evidence of bilateral involvement was present in 6 of 14 patients. None had impairment of visual functions or facial sensation, but 4 of 14 patients had some reduction in ocular motility. Imaging showed a focal orbital mass in 10 of 14 patients (16/28 orbits), and all patients (22/28 orbits) had enlargement of some extraocular muscles. The infraorbital canal was enlarged in 20 of the 28 orbits, with associated ipsilateral orbital changes in 19 of 20 (all 14 patients) and ipsilateral maxillary sinus changes in 12 of 20 (11 patients). Biopsy-proven chronic orbital inflammation was present in all patients; this resembled reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) in 7 patients and immunoglobulin (Ig) G4-related sclerosing inflammation in 7 patients. When tested, serum IgG4 was elevated in 6 of 7 patients. Clinical or histologically proven enlargement of cervical lymph nodes was present in 7 of 14 patients. All patients responded well to systemic corticosteroid therapy, although some had a relapse upon withdrawal. One patient developed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and subsequently leukemia, of which he later died 20 years after presentation. CONCLUSIONS: Enlargement of the infraorbital nerve and canal is rare and strongly suggests a diagnosis of RLH or IgG4-related disease, especially in the presence of ipsilateral extraocular muscle enlargement, sinus disease, or focal orbital disease.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The most common complication is neutropenia, but other immune-mediated cytopenia may also occur. There are no unified treatment recommendations and initiation of treatment mainly depends on the severity of the symptoms.

METHOD: The authors retrospectively analyzed the data of 17 large granular lymphocyte leukemia patients. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients, 7 patients required treatment because of transfusion dependent anemia (4 patients) or neutropenia (3 patients). In 4 patients corticosteroid was given (supplemented with cyclosporine in one patients), while the other patients received anti-CD52 (one patient), low dose methotrexate (one patient) and combined chemotherapy (one patient). Five patients achieved partial response, and two patients died in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort only a smaller proportion of patients required therapy.

This evidence has also opened new scenarios for the treatment of patients with other haematological malignancies/solid tumours. In particular, donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in the eradication of cancer cells in patients given an allograft from an HLA-haploidentical relative, especially when there is a killer inhibitory-receptor (KIR)-KIR ligand mismatched in the donor-recipient direction. Alloreactive donor-derived NK cells have been also demonstrated to kill recipient antigen-presenting cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus preventing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and graft rejection and to largely contribute to the defence against cytomegalovirus infection in the early post-transplant period. Several clinical studies have recently focused also on the influence of NK-cell activating receptors on the outcome of allo-HSCT recipients; in particular, B/x haplotype donors offer clinical advantages compared with A/A donors, even when the donor is an HLA-identical volunteer. Altogether, these data have provided the rationale for implementing phase I/II clinical trials based on adoptive infusion of either selected or ex vivo activated NK cells from an HLA-mismatched donor. This review summarizes the biological and clinical data on the role played by NK cells in patients with high-risk acute leukaemia, focusing also on the still unsolved issues and the future perspectives related to the approaches of adoptive NK cell therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To gain an insight into the new biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of chronic benzene poisoning, DNA methylation profiles and mRNA expression pattern from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four chronic benzene poisoning patients and four health controls that matched age and gender without benzene exposure were performed using the high resolution Infinium 450K methylation array and Gene Chip Human Gene 2.0ST Arrays, respectively. By integrating DNA methylation and mRNA expression data, we identified 3 hypermethylated genes showing concurrent down-regulation (PRKG1, PARD3, EPHA8) and 2 hypomethylated genes showing increased expression (STAT3, IFNGR1). Signal net analysis of differential methylation genes associated with chronic benzene poisoning showed that two key hypomethylated STAT3 and hypermethylated GNAI1 were identified.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP), Rawalpindi, from December 2010 to January 2012. METHODOLOGY: A total number of 40 patients were studied, in which all were diagnosed as CML on peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration. The subjects were tested for the presence of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome by cytogenetics and BCR-ABL fusion gene by RT-PCR. 2-3 ml of venous blood was collected, half in sodium heparin (anti-coagulant) for cytogenetics and half in EDTA for PCR. For cytogenetics, cells were cultured for 72 hours in RPMI 1640 medium and examined by arresting in metaphase using Colchicine to identify Philadelphia chromosome. For PCR, RNA extraction was done by Tri Reagent LS (MRC, USA) and cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase and gene specific primer. RT- PCR was done on ABI-7500. The positive samples were identified when fluorescence exceeded threshold limit. Results of cytogenetics and RT PCR were compared. RESULTS: Out of the 40 patients, PCR showed 37 (92.5%) were positive and 3 (7.5%) were negative for BCR-ABL fusion gene, whereas in cytogenetics 28 (70%) were positive for Ph chromosome and 12 (30%) were negative for Ph chromosome. Sensitivity and specificity of cytogenetics was 75.6% and 100% respectively. CONCLUSION: Real time PCR as compared to cytogenetics is less tedious, gives quick results, does not require multiple sampling due to culture failure and can be done on peripheral blood.",,"['Tashfeen, Sunila', 'Ahmed, Suhaib', 'Bhatti, Farhat Abbas', 'Ali, Nadir']","['Tashfeen S', 'Ahmed S', 'Bhatti FA', 'Ali N']","['Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi.', 'Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi.', 'Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi.', 'Department of Haematology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/05/28 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['040579197 [pii]', '03.2014/JCPSP.190193 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2014 Mar;24(3):190-3. doi: 03.2014/JCPSP.190193.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In medulloblastoma, basal cell carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, mutations in Hh pathway genes lead to ligand-independent pathway activation. In many other tumor types, ligand-dependent activation of Hh signaling is potentiated through crosstalk with other critical molecular signaling pathways. Among such pathways, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, EGFR, and Notch are of particular interest because agents that selectively inhibit these pathways are available and can be readily combined with agents such as vismodegib, sonidegib (LDE225), and BMS-833923, which target smoothened-a key Hh pathway regulator. Numerous preclinical studies have revealed the ways in which Hh intersects with each of these pathways, and combination therapies have resulted in improved antitumor efficacy and survival in animal models. Hh also plays an important role in hematopoiesis and in the maintenance of BCR-ABL-driven leukemic stem cells. Thus, combined inhibition of the Hh pathway and BCR-ABL has emerged as a promising potential therapeutic strategy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A number of clinical trials evaluating combinations of Hh inhibitors with other targeted agents are now underway in CML and a variety of solid tumors. This review highlights these trials and summarizes preclinical evidence of crosstalk between Hh and four other actionable pathways-RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, EGFR, and Notch-as well as the role of Hh in the maintenance of BCR-ABL-driven leukemic stem cells.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Results of that work also posed the hypothesis that the OVOLs impact MET in a range of cancers. We now test this hypothesis by developing a model, OVOL Induced MET (OI-MET), and sub-model (OI-MET-TF), to characterize differential gene expression in MET common to prostate cancer (PC) and breast cancer (BC). RESULTS: In the OI-MET model, we identified 739 genes differentially expressed in both the PC and BC models. For this gene set, we found significant enrichment of annotation for BC, PC, cancer, and MET, as well as regulation of gene expression by AP1, STAT1, STAT3, and NFKB1. Focusing on the target genes for these four TFs plus the OVOLs, we produced the OI-MET-TF sub-model, which shows even greater enrichment for these annotations, plus significant evidence of cooperation among these five TFs. Based on known gene/drug interactions, we prioritized targets in the OI-MET-TF network for follow-on analysis, emphasizing the clinical relevance of this work. Reflecting these results back to the OI-MET model, we found that binding motifs for the TF pair AP1/MYC are more frequent than expected and that the AP1/MYC pair is significantly enriched in binding in cancer models, relative to non-cancer models, in these promoters. This effect is seen in both MET models (solid tumors) and in non-MET models (leukemia). These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the OVOLs impact cancer susceptibility by regulating MET, and extend the hypothesis to include mechanisms not specific to MET. CONCLUSIONS: We find significant evidence of the OVOL, AP1, STAT1, STAT3, and NFKB1 TFs having important roles in MET, and more broadly in cancer. We prioritize known gene/drug targets for follow-up in the clinic, and we show that the AP1/MYC TF pair is a strong candidate for intervention.",,"['Roca, Hernan', 'Pande, Manjusha', 'Huo, Jeffrey S', 'Hernandez, James', 'Cavalcoli, James D', 'Pienta, Kenneth J', 'McEachin, Richard C']","['Roca H', 'Pande M', 'Huo JS', 'Hernandez J', 'Cavalcoli JD', 'Pienta KJ', 'McEachin RC']","['Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. kpienta1@jhmi.edu.']",['eng'],"['CA163124/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54CA143803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA093900/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA143055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140310,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Computational Biology/*methods', '*Disease Progression', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC4008156,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/09/23 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1752-0509-8-29 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-8-29 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2014 Mar 10;8:29. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-8-29.,,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are few studies on aberrant MLL signal patterns such as concurrent 3' MLL deletion. METHODS: A total of 84 patients with acute leukemia (AL) who had MLL rearrangements detected by florescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were enrolled in the study. The distribution of MLL fusion partner genes was analyzed, and aberrant MLL signals were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-seven (91.7%) patients had MLL rearrangements, involving previously described translocation partner genes (TPGs). Among these TPGs, the frequencies of MLLT3, AFF1, MLLT4, and ELL were 29.8%, 17.9%, 15.5%, and 13.1%, respectively. A high frequency of MLLT4 in our study was due to the high proportion of acute myeloid leukemia cases in pediatric and adult patients. Aberrant MLL signals were found in 18 patients: 11 (61.1%) with 3' MLL signal loss and 7 with 3' MLL signal gain. All cases with 3' MLL signal gain were due to an extra derivative partner chromosome. The median overall survival period of patients with 3' MLL gain was shorter than that in patients without aberrant MLL signal patterns. CONCLUSION: Aberrant MLL signals were frequently detected by FISH analysis. The 3' MLL gain was associated with poor prognosis in patients with AL. Therefore, it is important to detect aberrant MLL signal patterns using FISH analysis.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Lim, J-H', 'Jang, S', 'Park, C-J', 'Chi, H-S', 'Lee, J-O', 'Seo, E-J']","['Lim JH', 'Jang S', 'Park CJ', 'Chi HS', 'Lee JO', 'Seo EJ']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine and Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140225,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,IM,"[""*3' Flanking Region"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Mixed-lineage leukemia', ""aberrant 3' signal gain or loss"", 'fluorescence in situ hybridization']",2014/03/13 06:00,2015/05/23 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12192 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2014 Oct;36(5):571-9. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12192.

New, more effective antifungal drugs have been available for more than a decade but are extremely expensive suggesting the need for judicious prescribing. INTERVENTION: Infectious diseases physicians had been closely collaborating with hematologists on antimicrobial use since 2000. In 2002, an antifungal stewardship program (ASP) was implemented. It included discussing antifungal prescriptions with a dedicated infectious diseases physician twice weekly, telephone counseling 5 days a week from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M., and training meetings for junior/senior prescribers organized at least once yearly. The same year, a multidisciplinary group drafted evidence-based local guidelines on the use of antifungals in the hematology unit, which were published in 2004. These guidelines included decision algorithms and preprinted prescription forms that allowed only guideline-recommended drugs for a given indication. These guidelines have been updated and simplified at least every 2 years (current version 7.0; 2012). RESULTS: Between 2003 and 2012, in the 20-bed isolated hematology sector (allograft and acute leukemia induction chemotherapy patients), antifungal consumption decreased by 40% (from approximately 1000 to 620 defined daily doses per 1000 hospitalization days). Invasive fungal infections (IFI) remained stable in the whole 51-bed department, during the study period, with 1 to 2 IFI per month. In 2005, the 12-week survival rate for 29 cases of invasive aspergillosis was 72%. Early IFI related mortality has decreased recently. CONCLUSION: A permanent collaboration between hematologists and an infectious diseases physician can improve antifungal prescribing.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Protoporphyrin is the main pigment in brown and light-brown eggshells, whereas very little protoporphyrin is found in white eggshells. Eggshell protoporphyrin is derived from the heme formation in birds. Coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (CPOX) and ferrochelatase (FECH) represent rate-limiting enzymes for the heme-biosynthetic pathway. Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), feline leukemia virus receptor (FLVCR), and heme-responsive gene-1 (HRG1) serve as primary transporters for both protoporphyrinogen and heme. Finally, four organic anion transporting polypeptide family members (including solute carrier organic anion transporter family, SLCO1C1, SLCO1A2, SLCO1B3 and LOC418189) may affect pigment transport within eggshells. Here we measured gene expression levels in key tissues of egg-producing hens. We analyzed three different types of hens that generated distinct eggshell colors: white, pink or brown. Our data revealed three ways in which eggshell color was genetically influenced. First, high-level expression of CPOX generated more protoporphyrinogen and a brown eggshell color. In contrast, high expression of FECH likely converted more protoporphyrinogen into heme, reduced protoporphyrinogen levels within the eggshell and generated a light color. Second, heme transporters also affected eggshell color. High-level expression of BCRP, HRG1 and FLVCR were associated with brown, white and generally lighter eggshell colors, respectively. Finally, protoporphyrin precipitation also affected eggshell color, as high expression of both SLCO1A2 and SLCO1C1 were associated with brown eggshell color. As such, we have identified seven genes in which expression levels in different tissues were associated with eggshell color.",['(c) 2014 Japanese Society of Animal Science.'],"['Zheng, Chuanwei', 'Li, Zesheng', 'Yang, Ning', 'Ning, Zhonghua']","['Zheng C', 'Li Z', 'Yang N', 'Ning Z']","['College of Animal Science and Technology, China Agricultural University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140310,Australia,Anim Sci J,Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,100956805,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Proteins/*genetics', 'Chickens/anatomy & histology/*genetics', 'Color', '*Eggs', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['eggshell-color', 'heme', 'protoporphyrin', 'real-time PCR']",2014/03/13 06:00,2015/04/14 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2012/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2013/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/asj.12182 [doi]'],ppublish,Anim Sci J. 2014 May;85(5):506-10. doi: 10.1111/asj.12182.

The number of longitudinal nutritional studies during treatment, however, is limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the longitudinal changes in anthropometric measures and serum albumin level during chemotherapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 23 patients (19 boys, four girls) with ALL from April 2007 to March 2010. The median age at diagnosis was 4.5 years. Bodyweight, height, and serum albumin levels were measured at the start and the end point of each chemotherapy phase. RESULTS: At diagnosis, two patients (8.7%) were underweight and five patients (21.7%) were overweight according to body mass index z-score, while five patients were underweight and three (13.0%) were overweight according to Waterlow score. The prevalence of malnourished patients did not change significantly throughout chemotherapy by either assessment. The absolute scores in either assessment were significantly reduced at the sanctuary treatment phase. Low serum albumin (<3.2 g/dL) was found in two patients at diagnosis. Mean albumin decreased significantly at the induction and the re-induction phases. CONCLUSIONS: Given that nutritional status under a similar chemotherapeutic regimen as assessed by anthropometric measures and albumin level differed among patients, careful observation of the nutritional status and intervention may be necessary at different phases of chemotherapy.",['(c) 2014 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['Higashiyama, Yukie', 'Kojima, Chiaki', 'Kubota, Masaru', 'Nagai, Ayako', 'Watanabe, Ken-Ichiro', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Usami, Ikuya']","['Higashiyama Y', 'Kojima C', 'Kubota M', 'Nagai A', 'Watanabe K', 'Adachi S', 'Usami I']","[""Faculty of Human Life and Environment, Nara Women's University, Nara, Japan.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140530,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', '*Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional Status', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Waterlow score', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'albumin', 'body mass index z-score', 'chemotherapy', 'nutritional assessment']",2014/03/13 06:00,2016/09/09 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2013/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ped.12326 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2014 Aug;56(4):541-6. doi: 10.1111/ped.12326.

However, information on genetic or epigenetic regulation of stem cell properties is still limited and LSC-targeted drugs have scarcely been identified. Epigenetic regulators are associated with many cellular processes including maintenance of stem cells. Of note are polycomb group proteins, because they potentially control stemness, and can be pharmacologically targeted by a selective inhibitor (DZNep). Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic potential of EZH2 inhibition in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion leukemia. Intriguingly, EZH2 inhibition by DZNep or shRNA not only suppressed MLL fusion leukemia proliferation but also reduced leukemia initiating cells (LIC) frequency. Expression analysis suggested that p16 upregulation was responsible for LICs reduction. Knockdown of p16 canceled the survival advantage of mice treated with DZNep. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that EZH2 was highly enriched around the transcription-start-site of p16, together with H3K27 methylation marks in MLL/ENL and Hoxa9/Meis1 transduced cells but not in E2A/HLF transduced cells. Although high expression of Hoxa9 in MLL fusion leukemia is supposed to be responsible for the recruitment of EZH2, our data also suggest that there may be some other mechanisms independent of Hoxa9 activation to suppress p16 expression, because expression levels of Hoxa9 and p16 were not inversely related between MLL/ENL and Hoxa9/Meis1 transduced cells. In summary, our findings show that EZH2 is a potential therapeutic target of MLL fusion leukemia stem cells.","['(c) 2014 The Authors.

Here, we describe the interplay of HSCs and their niche, in particular the involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway. Although the prevailing notion has been that malignant transformation of HSCs is the main cause of leukemia, evidence is mounting that disruption of niche regulation by transformed hematopoietic cells, which may overexpress Wnt signaling or intrinsic stromal defects in gene expression, is at least a collaborative factor in leukemogenesis.

Little is known about the characteristics of A20 mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). In this study, we analyzed A20 polymorphisms and characterized their features in 11 cases with T-ALL, 30 samples from healthy Chinese individuals, and 3 cells lines including CCRF-CEM, Molt-4, and Toledo cells. Two frequent A20 polymorphisms were found: a CCT deletion at position 12384 and a nucleotide exchange (A to C) at position 13751 (rs2307859 and rs661561). The homozygous form (CC) of rs661561 was detected in all 10 cases with detectable T-ALL, while only 80% (24/30) of the healthy controls had this genotype. We found one T-ALL case without the above frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in which a T to G mutation at position 12486 was found, which results in an amino acid exchange (Phe127Cys; rs2230926). Similar results were found in Molt-4 cells, which lack the frequent SNPs but have a heterozygous polymorphism at position 13749 (C > T) (rs5029948). Interestingly, the T-ALL case with the Phe127Cys mutation and Molt-4 cells demonstrated a high A20 copy number as measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification with three primer sets that cover different regions of the A20 gene, corresponding to a high A20 and low NF-kappaB expression level. In conclusion, we characterized the features of A20 polymorphisms in T-ALL, and found that a low frequency A20 mutation, which was thought to be involved in malignant T-ALL development, might function differently in T cell lymphomas.",,"['Zhu, Lihua', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Shen, Qi', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Wang, Xu', 'Wang, Liang', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Wu, Xiuli', 'Huang, Suming', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zhu L', 'Zhang F', 'Shen Q', 'Chen S', 'Wang X', 'Wang L', 'Yang L', 'Wu X', 'Huang S', 'Schmidt CA', 'Li Y']",,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140311,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['A20', 'Gene expression', 'NF-kappaB', 'Polymorphisms', 'T-ALL']",2014/03/13 06:00,2015/07/15 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000160 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2014 Dec;19(8):448-54. doi: 10.1179/1607845414Y.0000000160.

During hematological and molecular remission verified at the level of iliac crest aspiration, extra-medullary relapse in the bones was apparent. A novel procedure of donor lymphocyte injection to the bone leukemic lesions was developed and employed. A dose of 10(6) donor lymphocytes/kg body weight (BW) of the recipient were each time injected to the plane of the right and left tibia, the head of the humerus, and the calcaneus, which resulted in healing of the destructive process. In consequence of this novel approach, in addition to the healing of bone lesions, an accumulation of cytotoxic activated T-cells in the marrow was documented, which was mirrored by an increase in the number of transcripts for interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-17, as well as RORgammat.

Advances in stem cell biology, molecular genetics, and computational biology reveal that the immortality, self-renewal, and maintenance of blood homeostasis generally attributed to individual HSCs are functions of the cells' behavior in the normal BM environment. Here we discuss how these advances, together with results of outcomes-based clinical epidemiology studies, provide new insight into the importance of epigenetic events in leukemogenesis. For the chemical benzene (Bz), development of myeloid neoplasms depends predominantly on alterations within the microenvironments in which they arise. The primary persistent disease in Bz myelotoxicity is myelodysplastic syndrome, which precedes cytogenetic injury. Evidence indicates that acute myeloid leukemia arises as a secondary event, subsequent to evolution of the leukemia-initiating cell phenotype within the altered BM microenvironment. Further explorations into the nature of chemical versus de novo disease should consider this mechanism, which is biologically distinct from previous models of clonal cytogenetic injury. Understanding alterations of homeostatic regulation in the BM niche is important for validation of models of leukemogenesis, monitoring at-risk populations, and development of novel treatment and prevention strategies.",['(c) 2014 New York Academy of Sciences.'],"['Irons, Richard D', 'Kerzic, Patrick J']","['Irons RD', 'Kerzic PJ']","['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Anshutz Medical Center, University of Colorado, Aurora, Colorado; Cinpathogen, Inc, Boulder, Colorado.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20140212,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Toxicity Tests']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MDS', 'benzene', 'cytogenetics']",2014/03/13 06:00,2014/05/27 06:00,['2014/03/12 06:00'],"['2014/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/nyas.12336 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2014 Mar;1310:84-8. doi: 10.1111/nyas.12336.

We here delineate molecular growth kinetics of AML harbouring MLL partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD; 37 cases) compared to those harbouring MLL translocations (43 cases). The kinetics of MLL-PTD relapses was both significantly slower than those of MLL translocation positive ones (median doubling time: MLL-PTD: 24 d, MLL-translocations: 12 d, P = 0.015, Wilcoxon rank sum test), and displayed greater variation depending on additional mutations. Thus, MLL-PTD+ cases with additional RUNX1 mutations or FLT3-internal tandem duplication relapsed significantly faster than cases without one of those two mutations (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = 0.042). As rapid relapses occurred in all MLL subgroups, frequent sampling are necessary to obtain acceptable relapse detection rates and times from molecular relapse to haematological relapse (blood sampling every second month: MLL-PTD: 75%/50 d; MLL translocations: 85%/25 d).

CLL is characterized by a chronically relapsing course and clinical and biological heterogeneity. Many patients do not require any treatment for years. Although important progress has been made in the treatment of CLL, none of the conventional treatment options are curative. Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been identified and are associated with prognosis and pathogenesis of the disease. More recently, unbiased genome-wide technologies have identified multiple additional recurrent aberrations.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Combinations of different experimental approaches were used to assess induction of autophagy, including immunoblotting to detect effects on LC3II and p62/SQTM1 expression and on ULK1 phosphorylation, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Functional responses were assessed using cell viability and apoptosis assays, and clonogenic leukemic progenitor assays in methylcellulose. RESULTS: We provide evidence that treatment of AML cells with catalytic mTOR inhibitors results in induction of autophagy, which acts as a regulatory mechanism to promote leukemic cell survival. Such induction of autophagy by dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitors partially protects primitive leukemic precursors from the inhibitory effects of such agents and limits their activities. Simultaneous blockade of the autophagic process using chloroquine or by knockdown of ULK1 results in enhanced antileukemic responses. CONCLUSIONS: Dual targeting of mTORC2 and mTORC1 results in induction of autophagy in AML cells.

A 95-year-old female with a history of CLL presented with a slow growing left malar mass was referred to our clinic for US-FNA. US scan showed a well-defined subcutaneous mass (2.78 cm) with complex echogenicity. On-site assessment showed a cellular aspiration which was interpreted as small blue round cell tumor. On further examination, smears and cell block showed dimorphic populations of relatively larger cells with neuroendocrine features and smaller lymphoid cells. Immunocytochemical studies of cell block sections revealed that the larger cells were positive for CD56, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, CK8/18, CK20 (dot-like pattern); and the smaller cells were positive for CD45. Flow cytometric analysis showed a majority of CD16/CD56 positive cells, 17% of monoclonal B-cells, and 14% of reactive T cells. The immunophenotype of the monoclonal B cells were of CLL/SLL. The diagnosis of a collision tumor composed of primary MCC and CLL/SLL was confirmed. Surgical resection of the mass one month later concurred with the FNA cytological diagnosis. The fact that surgical specimen displayed a solid tumor with both CLL/SLL and MCC components ruled out the possibility that the FNA merely had MCC with peripheral leukemic blood contaminant. No additional MCC lesion was found in the patient, which ruled out the possibility of metastatic MCC to a lymphomatous lymph node.","['(c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Zhonghua', 'Yang, Jing-Jing', 'Wu, Maoxin']","['Li Z', 'Yang JJ', 'Wu M']","['Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, One Gustave L.

METHODS: The commercial Chinese patent medicine of Danshen Injection was extracted and isolated from Chinese herb of Salvia miltiorrhiza bung. The inhibition effects of proliferation were assayed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method in HEL cells treated by Danshen Injection at various concentrations for 48 h. The cellular apoptosis was observed in morphology, analyzed by flow cytometry with annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining, and examined by DNA degradation ladder on agarose gel electrophoresis. Meanwhile, the expression levels of mutant Janus kinasez (JAK2) gene and phosphorylation-JAK2 (P-JAK2) protein were detected by allele specific-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. RESULTS: The proliferation of HEL cells was effectively inhibited by Danshen Injection in a dose-dependent manner, with suppression rates from 19.46+/-2.31% to 50.20+/-5.21%. Typical apoptosis cells was observed in Danshen Injection treated HEL cells, the rates of annexin V positive cells increased obviously in a dose-dependent manner, as well as the DNA degradation ladder of apoptosis revealed on gel electrophoresis. The expression levels of mutant JAK2 gene and P-JAK2 protein reduced gradually with increasing dosage of Danshen injection.

Qinghuang Powder (, QHP), which includes Qing Dai (Indigo naturalis) and Xiong Huang (realgar) in the formula, is effective in treating MDS or MDS/AML even with the unfavorable karyotype, and its therapeutic efficacy could be enhanced by increasing the Xiong huang content in the formula, while Xiong huang contains > 90% arsenic disulfide (As2S2). F-36p cell line was established from a MDS/AML patient with complex karyotype including -7, and was in cytokine-dependent. The present study was to investigate the effects of As2S2 on F-36p cells. METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured by an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell apoptosis was identified by Annexin V-staining. Cell viability was determined by a propidium iodide (PI) exclusion. Erythroid differentiation was evaluated by the expression of cell surface antigen CD235a (GpA). RESULTS: After treatment with As2S2 at concentrations of 0.5 to 16 mumol/L for 72 h, As2S2 inhibited the proliferation of F-36p cells. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of As2S2 against the proliferation of F-36p cells was 6 mumol/L. The apoptotic cells significantly increased in a dose-dependent mannar (P<0.05). The cell viabilities were significantly inhibited by As2S2 dose-dependent in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). Significant increases of CD235a-positive cells were concurrently observed (P<0.05) also in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: As2S2 could inhibit proliferation and viability, induce apoptosis, and concurrently promote erythroid differentiation dose-dependently in F-36p cells. As2S2 can inhibit proliferation and viability, induce apoptosis, and concurrently promote erythroid differentiation in cytokine-dependent MDS-progressed human leukemia cell line F-36p with complex karyotype including -7.

Characterization of genomic aberrations may help to understand the pathogenesis of CLL and may give prognostic information independent from conventional clinical markers for a risk-adapted management of CLL patients. AIM: The aim of the present study is to determine the most common cytogenetics abnormalities between patients with CLL and its prognostic impact. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present study was carried out on 20 adult patients presented with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The patients were diagnosed on the basis of standard clinical (lymph node involvement and/or hepatosplenomegaly), hematological and immunophenotypic criteria for diagnosis of B-CLL. All cases were studied at the time of their diagnosis. FISH technique was successfully performed on PB samples using CLL LSI probes for ATM (11q22) / GLI (12q13) and 13q14/ p53 (17p13). RESULTS: For comparative statistical studies, the patients were divided into group I (patients with favorable outcome) and group II (patients with unfavorable outcome). All patients showed one or more cytogenetic abnormality with the prevalence of p53 in 16 patients out of 20 that perfectly correlated with the poor outcome of the patients. This is followed by deletion in the 13q14 and to a lesser extent deletion in ATM gene, but no one has exhibited amplification in the 12q13 locus. CONCLUSION: p53 deletion as a sole abnormality has a higher prognostic power than other cytogenetics abnormalities. The cytogenetics study using FISH panel for CLL patients in a complementary fashion to the other clinical and laboratory findings may overcome the pitfalls in the diagnosis and may also assess the assignment of therapeutic protocols for CLL patients according to the results of their cytogenetic analysis at the time of diagnosis.

In leukemia, the processes directing self-renewal, differentiation and progenitor cell expansion are disrupted, leading to the accumulation of immature, non-functioning malignant cells. Insights into these processes have come in stages, based on technological advances in genetic analyses, bioinformatics and biological sciences. The first cytogenetic studies of leukemic cells identified chromosomal translocations that generate oncogenic fusion proteins and most commonly affect regulators of transcription. This was followed by the discovery of recurrent somatic mutations in genes encoding regulators of the signal transduction pathways that control cell proliferation and survival. Recently, studies of global changes in methylation and gene expression have led to the understanding that the output of transcriptional regulators and the proliferative signaling pathways are ultimately influenced by chromatin structure. Candidate gene, whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing studies have identified recurrent somatic mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers in both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL). In contrast to the two-hit model of leukemogenesis, emerging evidence suggests that these epigenetic modifiers represent a class of mutations that are critical to the development of leukemia and affect the regulation of various other oncogenic pathways. In this review, we discuss the range of recurrent, somatic mutations in epigenetic modifiers found in leukemia and how these modifiers relate to the classical leukemogenic pathways that lead to impaired cell differentiation and aberrant self-renewal and proliferation.",,"['Greenblatt, S M', 'Nimer, S D']","['Greenblatt SM', 'Nimer SD']","['Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA166835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA166835/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20140310,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Chromatin/*drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",PMC5555411,['NIHMS898627'],,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/09/12 06:00,['2014/03/11 06:00'],"['2013/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201494 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2014.94 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2014 Jul;28(7):1396-406. doi: 10.1038/leu.2014.94.

Sorafenib is effective in clearing leukemic blasts in chemorefractory FLT3-ITD(+) AML, but leukemia progression invariably occurs. Mechanisms of drug resistance are not completely understood. We hypothesized that a gene encoding tescalcin (TESC), known to be upregulated at leukemia progression during continuous sorafenib treatment and activate an Na(+)/H(+) exchanger type-1 (NHE1), may underlie tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance. TESC was highly expressed in FLT3-ITD(+) AML lines MOLM-13 and MV4-11, and its knockdown by small-interfering RNA lowered intracellular pH (pHi) and induced apoptosis. The results were recapitulated by treatment with an NHE1 inhibitor, 5-(N,N-hexamethylene) amiloride (HMA). Induction of sorafenib resistance in the MOLM-13 cell line (M13-RE) significantly increased its sensitivity to HMA. The later also enhanced suppression of FLT3 signaling by sorafenib in otherwise resistant cell lines. HMA treatment of MOLM-13 and MV4-11 as well as primary FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells significantly reduced leukemia initiation in anti-CD122-primed NOD/SCID mouse xenotransplantation.

Whereas involvement of Notch as an oncogene in several lymphoid malignancies (T-ALL, B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, splenic marginal zone lymphoma) is well characterized, there is growing evidence involving Notch signaling as a tumor suppressor in myeloid malignancies.

In this study, we have studied the role of zebrafish Noxa (zNoxa) by using zNoxa-specifc morpholino knockdown and overexpression approaches in developing zebrafish embryos. Expression pattern analysis indicates that zNoxa transcript is of maternal origin, which displays a uniform distribution in early embryonic development until shield stage, and the zygote zNoxa transcription is initiated from this stage and mainly localized in YSL of the embryos. The zNoxa expression alterations result in strong embryonic development defects, demonstrating that zNoxa regulates apoptosis from 75% epiboly stage of development onward, in which zNoxa firstly induces the expression of zBik, and then cooperates with zBik to regulate apoptosis. Moreover, zNoxa knockdown also causes a reduction in number of mitotic cells before 8 h.p.f., suggesting that zNoxa also promotes mitosis before 75% epiboly stage. The effect of zNoxa on mitosis is mediated by zWnt4b in early embryos, whereas zMcl1a and zMcl1b suppress the ability of zNoxa to regulate mitosis and apoptosis at different developmental stages. In addition, mammalian mouse Noxa (mNoxa) mRNA was demonstrated to rescue the arrest of mitosis when zNoxa was knocked down, suggesting that mouse and zebrafish Noxa might have similar dual functions. Therefore, the current findings indicate that Noxa is a novel regulator of early mitosis before 75% epiboly stage when it translates into a key mediator of apoptosis in subsequent embryogenesis.",,"['Zhong, J-X', 'Zhou, L', 'Li, Z', 'Wang, Y', 'Gui, J-F']","['Zhong JX', 'Zhou L', 'Li Z', 'Wang Y', 'Gui JF']","['State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Freshwater Ecology and Biotechnology, Institute of Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140307,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian', '*Embryonic Development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Wnt4 Protein/metabolism', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/metabolism']",PMC4013518,,,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/12/31 06:00,['2014/03/11 06:00'],"['2013/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/02 00:00 [revised]', '2014/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201422 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2014.22 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2014 Jun;21(6):1013-24. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2014.22.

Both VTE and cancer disproportionately affect older adults. METHODS: Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, we evaluated 1.2 million cancer cases and 200,000 controls (66-99 years old, 1992-2005). VTEs occurring before selection were identified using Medicare claims. Logistic regression was used to estimate ORs. RESULTS: VTE was present in 2.5% of cases and 2.2% of controls. VTE was associated with risk of cancers of the lung [OR = 1.18; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-1.23], stomach (OR = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.09-1.30), small intestine (OR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.17-1.71), colon (OR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.18-1.31), gallbladder (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.16-1.67), pancreas (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.43-1.64), soft tissue (OR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.21-1.68), ovary (OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.50), and kidney/renal pelvis (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.23-1.46), and melanoma (OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.27), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.20- 1.35), myeloma (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.35-1.63), and acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.19-1.54). Strongest risks were observed within 1 year of VTE diagnosis, but risks were elevated more than 6 years after VTE for colon cancer (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12-1.37), pancreatic cancer (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15-1.54), and myeloma (OR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.10-1.66). Few differences in risk were observed by VTE subtype. Cancers of the lung, stomach, and pancreas were more likely to have distant metastases within one year after VTE. CONCLUSION: Among elderly adults, cancer risk is elevated following VTE diagnosis. IMPACT: Short-term associations with cancer are likely driven by enhanced screening following VTE and reverse causation. While obesity, other comorbidities, and smoking cannot be excluded as explanations, longer-term elevations for select cancers suggest that some VTEs may be caused by cancer precursors.",['(c)2014 AACR.'],"['Marks, Morgan A', 'Engels, Eric A']","['Marks MA', 'Engels EA']","[""Authors' Affiliation: Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland.""]",['eng'],['ZIA CP010150-14/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20140308,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United States', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*complications/diagnosis']",PMC4020513,['NIHMS569707'],,,2014/03/13 06:00,2014/12/23 06:00,['2014/03/11 06:00'],"['2014/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/12/23 06:00 [medline]']","['1055-9965.EPI-13-1138 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-1138 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2014 May;23(5):774-83. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-1138.

It was the aim of this study to comprehensively analyze clinical and functional properties of various FLT3 mutants. In 672 normal karyotype AML patients FLT3-ITD, but not FLT3-TKD mutations were associated with a worse relapse free and overall survival in multivariate analysis. In paired diagnosis-relapse samples FLT3-ITD showed higher stability (70%) compared to FLT3-TKD (30%). In vitro, FLT3-ITD induced a strong activating phenotype in Ba/F3 cells. In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutations and other point mutations--including two novel mutations--showed a weaker but clear gain-of-function phenotype with gradual increase in proliferation and protection from apoptosis. The pro-proliferative capacity of the investigated FLT3 mutants was associated with cell surface expression and tyrosine 591 phosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor. Western blot experiments revealed STAT5 activation only in FLT3-ITD positive cell lines, in contrast to FLT3-non-ITD mutants, which displayed an enhanced signal of AKT and MAPK activation. Gene expression analysis revealed distinct difference between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD for STAT5 target gene expression as well as deregulation of SOCS2, ENPP2, PRUNE2 and ART3. FLT3-ITD and FLT3 point mutations show a gain-of-function phenotype with distinct signalling properties in vitro.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1994 to 1999, the Pediatric Oncology Group conducted a randomized phase III clinical trial in higher risk pediatric B-precursor ALL. A total of 784 patients were randomized in a 2x2 factorial design to receive MTX 1 g/m versus 2.5 g/m and to cytosine arabinoside/teniposide versus high-dose cytosine arabinoside/asparaginase during intensified continuation therapy. RESULTS: Patients receiving standard dose MTX had a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 71.8+/-2.4%; patients receiving higher dose MTX had a 5-year DFS of 71.7+/-2.4% (P=0.55). Outcomes on cytosine arabinoside/teniposide (DFS of 70.4+/-2.4) were similar to higher dose cytosine arabinoside/asparaginase (DFS of 73.1+/-2.3%) (P=0.41).

Spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase (SSAT), which regulates intracellular levels of polyamines by catabolizing spermidine and spermine, has a controversial role in the development of cancers. In this study, the polyamine metabolism and function of SSAT were characterized in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and acute lymphoid leukemia patient samples. Also, mice overexpressing SSAT and having a myeloproliferative phenotype were analyzed for their response to decitabine and histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. The presence of epigenetic factors in the bone marrow cells of SSAT mice was analyzed. Elevated levels of spermidine and spermine, as well as increased activity of SSAT, were detected in AML, CML, and acute lymphoid leukemia patients compared with the controls. However, we found SSAT activity to be associated with white blood cell count only in AML and CML patients. Decitabine treatment brought the peripheral blood and bone marrow cell counts of SSAT mice to the level of wild-type mice. Spermidine/spermine N(1)-acetyltransferase mice had increased histone methylation and an increased level of histone deacetylase 1 in their bone marrow cells. The study suggests that SSAT influences the development of myeloid malignancies, and epigenetic factors partly contribute to the SSAT overexpression-induced myeloproliferative disease in mice.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Despite the fact that hematologic malignancies are often characterized by chromosomal rearrangements, no studies have hitherto investigated the expression pattern of the gene in these disorders. We hypothesized that a high expression of SETMAR protected the cells from chromosomal rearrangements; thus, we examined the mRNA expression of SETMAR transcript variants in hematologic patients. We identified six transcript variants (var1, var2, var5, varA, varB, varC), of which three had not been reported previously. Expression levels were quantified by transcript-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 15 healthy individuals, 70 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (translocation positive, n= 30 [AML(TPos)], translocation negative, n = 40 [AML(TNeg)]), seven patients with mantle cell lymphoma (t [11,14] positive), and 13 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (t [9,22] positive). All variants were significantly overexpressed in both subgroups of AML compared with healthy individuals (var1 and var2: p < 0.00001 for both AML subgroups, varA and varB: p = 0.0002, var5: p = 0.0008, and varC: p = 0.0001 for AML(TNeg); varA: p = 0.0048, varB and var5: p = 0.0001, varC: p = 0.0017). When comparing the expression in AML(TNeg) and AML(TPos), we found a significantly increased expression of the full length SETMAR in AML(TNeg) (var1: p = 0.047), suggesting a protective effect of high SETMAR expression on formation of chromosomal translocations. In conclusion, we have found known and novel SETMAR splice variants to be significantly increased in AML. To our knowledge, this is the first study that describes an expression profile of SETMAR in subgroups of hematologic malignancies, which can be linked to the incidence of chromosomal rearrangements.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Activating mutations in c-Mpl constitutively stimulate downstream signaling pathways, leading to aberrant hematopoiesis, and contribute to development of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Several studies have mapped the tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of c-Mpl that mediate these cellular signals; however, secondary signaling pathways are incompletely understood. In this study, we focused on c-Mpl tyrosine 591 (Y591). We found Y591 of wild-type c-Mpl to be phosphorylated in the presence of TPO. Additionally, eliminating Y591 phosphorylation by mutation to Phe resulted in decreased total receptor phosphorylation. Using a Src homology 2/phosphotyrosine-binding (SH2/PTB) domain binding microarray, we identified novel c-Mpl binding partners for phosphorylated Y591, including Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). The functional significance of binding partners was determined through small interfering RNA treatment of Ba/F3-Mpl cells, confirming that the increase in pERK1/2 resulting from removal of Y591 may be mediated by spleen tyrosine kinase. These findings identify a novel negative regulatory pathway that controls TPO-mediated signaling, advancing our understanding of the mechanisms required for successful maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocyte development.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Here, we use global gene expression analysis to identify 28 transcription factors and 19 transcriptional cofactors induced during terminal erythroid differentiation whose promoters are enriched for binding by GATA1 and TAL1. Utilizing protein-protein interaction databases to identify cofactors for each transcription factor, we pinpoint several co-induced pairs, of which E2f2 and its cofactor transcription factor Dp-2 (Tfdp2) were the most highly induced. TFDP2 is a critical cofactor required for proper cell cycle control and gene expression. GATA1 and TAL1 are bound to the regulatory regions of Tfdp2 and upregulate its expression and knockdown of Tfdp2 results in significantly reduced rates of proliferation as well as reduced upregulation of many erythroid-important genes. Loss of Tfdp2 also globally inhibits the normal downregulation of many E2F2 target genes, including those that regulate the cell cycle, causing cells to accumulate in S phase and resulting in increased erythrocyte size. Our findings highlight the importance of TFDP2 in coupling the erythroid cell cycle with terminal differentiation and validate this study as a resource for future work on elucidating the role of diverse transcription factors and coregulators in erythropoiesis.","['Copyright (c) 2014 ISEH - Society for Hematology and Stem Cells.

Data were retrieved from the prospective Cologne Cohort of Neutropenic Patients. Patients hospitalized for aSCT as well as patients receiving treatment for AML were included in the analysis. Risk factor analysis for the occurrence of CDI was performed by backward-stepwise logistic regression (P < .1). During the period from January 2007 to August 2010, 310 hospitalizations of 152 patients with AML and 229 hospitalizations of 223 patients undergoing aSCT were eligible for analysis. Incidence rates for CDI per 10,000 patient days were 17.9 for AML patients and 27.4 for aSCT recipients. Among AML and aSCT patients, median time from initiation of chemotherapy to CDI was 10 days (range, -8 to 101 days) and 17 days (range, 6 to 79), respectively. Logistic regression identified carbapenem exposure to be associated with development of CDI in AML patients (odds ratio [OR], 2.2) and aSCT recipients (OR, 1.4). In both groups, previous exposure to carbapenems was significantly associated with development of CDI. A follow-up study, assessing the effect of an antibiotic stewardship intervention to decrease the administration of carbapenems in hematological high-risk patients, is warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

It has been hypothesized that T cells recognizing hematopoiesis-restricted MiHA mediate specific graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity without inducing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereas T cells recognizing ubiquitously expressed MiHA induce both GVL and GVHD reactivity. It also has been hypothesized that alloreactive CD4 T cells are capable of mediating specific GVL reactivity due to the hematopoiesis-restricted expression of HLA class II. However, clinical observations suggest that an overt GVL response, associated with expansion of T cells specific for hematopoiesis-restricted antigens, is often associated with GVHD reactivity. Therefore, we developed in vitro models to investigate whether alloreactive T cells recognizing hematopoiesis-restricted antigens induce collateral damage to surrounding nonhematopoietic tissues. We found that collateral damage to MiHA-negative fibroblasts was induced by misdirection of cytotoxic granules released from MiHA-specific T cells activated by MiHA-positive hematopoietic cells, resulting in granzyme-B-mediated activation of apoptosis in the surrounding fibroblasts. We demonstrated that direct contact between the activated T cell and the fibroblast is a prerequisite for this collateral damage to occur. Our data suggest that hematopoiesis-restricted T cells actively participate in an overt GVL response and may contribute to GVHD via induction of collateral damage to nonhematopoietic targets.","['Copyright (c) 2014 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In particular, epigenetic silencing of genes by promoter hypermethylation is associated with increased tumor severity and poor survival. The RASSF (Ras association domain family) family of proteins consists of 10 members, many of which are tumor suppressor proteins that undergo loss of expression through promoter methylation in numerous types of cancers such as leukemia, melanoma, breast, prostate, neck, lung, brain, colorectal and kidney cancers. In addition to their tumor suppressor function, RASSF proteins act as scaffolding agents in microtubule stability, regulate mitotic cell division, modulate apoptosis, control cell migration and cell adhesion, and modulate NFkappaB activity and the duration of inflammation. The ubiquitous functions of these proteins highlight their importance in numerous physiological pathways. In this review, we will focus on the biological roles of the RASSF family members and their regulation.","['Copyright (c) 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

However, differentiation therapy is limited because ATRA is the sole efficient agent. Dasatinib is reported to induce myeloid differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in vitro, but its mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, the ability of dasatinib to cause differentiation of AML cells has not yet been proven. We assessed the contribution of autophagy to dasatinib-induced differentiation of AML cells. We found that dasatinib induces myeloid differentiation of AML cells accompanied with autophagy induction. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA, Wortmannin, LY294002 and chloroquine block dasatinib-induced AML cell differentiation, whereas the induction of autophagy by rapamycin enhances AML cell differentiation. Our results suggest that retinoic acid receptors alpha (RARalpha) may not be involved in dasatinib-induced differentiation. In addition, we further illustrated that even low concentration of dasatinib can enhance ATRA-induced differentiation capability through initiation of autophagy. Taken together, we conclude that autophagy enhances the dasatinib-induced differentiation, which may provide theoretical support for developing dasatinib as a promising strategy for future differentiation therapy in AML patients.",['Copyright (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: BCR-ABL mRNA could be stably detected both in MP and peripheral blood cells; BCR-ABL in MP showed significant difference within complete molecular response, major molecular response and complete cytogenetic response (9.1+/-2.8, 25.2+/-6.9 and 62.8+/-6.3 respectively, P<0.05). BCR-ABL was detected in MP even when it was negative in peripheral blood cells (3.7-15.3). For patients with complete molecular response, BCR-ABL in MP but not cells were significantly different between imatinib and stem cell transplant recipients (3.3+/-2.1 vs 9.1+/-2.8, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study indicated that MP may serves as a new target for monitoring of CML.

METHODS: In 2012, the international reference laboratory in Adelaide, Australia (IMVS) sent two batches of RNA samples, 30 samples per batch, to Peking University People's Hospital (PKUPH). By comparing BCRABL (P210) transcript levels reported by the two laboratories, CF of PKUPH was calculated and validated by IMVS. In 2013, PKUPH prepared the exchange samples for validation of CF of 9 hospitals who have calculated CFs before. The fresh BCR-ABL (P210) (+) cells were serially diluted by BCR-ABL (P210) (-) cells to prepare 22 kinds of samples with different BCR-ABL transcript levels, each kind had 10 parallel samples. Trizol reagent was added in each tube. Ten hospitals tested BCR-ABL transcript levels of one set of 22 samples. Agreement between BCR-ABL transcript levels of each laboratory and PKUPH was assessed by the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: PKUPH successfully validated its CF with bias 1.1 fold and 95% limits of agreement between -4.7 and 4.9 fold. Of 9 hospitals whose validation performed by sample exchanges with PKUPH, 6 hospitals successfully validated their CF with bias </=+/-1.4 fold and 95% limits of agreement within +/-6 fold.

METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed 97 newly diagnosed adult Ph(+) ALL patients from 2005 to 2013. According to whether administrated imatinib in the induction therapy and the administrating duration (>/=3 d) , they were divided into imatinib (n=37) and non-imatinib group (n=60), and the former group was further divided into early-use (n=26) and late-use imatinib groups (n=11) (bounded by the fourteenth day of induction chemotherapy). We compared the overall response rate (ORR) and the negative rate of BCR-ABL fusion gene in patients who achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete recovery of blood cells (CRi) among the three groups at the end of the first induction therapy. There were 44 cases underwent allo-HSCT (transplant group) and 33 cases only adopted imatinib-based chemotherapy (non-transplant group) in 77 patients who administrated imatinib as a maintenance therapy, we further compared the incidences of overall survival (OS) , disease-free survival (DFS), relapse and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) between the two groups; and dynamically monitor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negativity of patients who were in CR1 state before transplant (n=34) at the following timepoints of achieving CR or CRi, the first consolidation therapy, beginning the pretreatment of transplant and attaining hematopoietic reconstruction after transplant. RESULTS: After the first induction therapy, the ORR of imatinib group was significantly higher than of non-imatinib group (97.3%, 72.9% respectively, P=0.002), but early-use and late-use imatinib groups had no statistical significance in ORR (100% , 90.9% respectively, P=0.297); the rate of negativity of imatinib and non- imatinib groups were 20.0% and 0 respectively (P=0.041) in patients who achieved CR or CRi. The negative rate of patients in CR1 state before transplant attained 20.8%, 42.3%, 51.8%, 76.8%, respectively at the previously described 4 timepoints. And the differences between the fourth and the third, the third and the first timepiont all reached statistical significance (P=0.044, 0.022, respectively).

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 72 patients with Ph(+) ALL to probe prognostic factors including sex, age, high white cell counts at diagnosis, additional chromosome abnormality, BCR-ABL transcripts type, imatinib based therapy, allo-HSCT and complete remission (CR) after one-course induction on the outcomes of Ph(+)ALL patients. RESULTS: Of 72 patients with median age 40.5 (13-68) years, 38 patients received imatinib plus chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 11 (0.2-96) months, total CR rate in patients receiving imatinib plus chemotherapy was higher than of patients receiving chemotherapy only (97.4% vs 62.3%, P=0.019). High white blood counts at diagnosis or additional chromosome abnormality had no effects on CR rate. 2-year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) in imatinib plus chemotherapy group were (28.9+/-7.4) % and (25+/-7.4) %, respectively, which were higher than those in chemotherapy group (P<0.001). OS rate in HSCT group was significantly higher than that in non-HSCT group[ (61.1+/-11.5) % vs (5.6+/-3.1) %, P<0.001]. Multivariate prognostic analysis for OS showed that imatinib-based therapy [RR=0.413 (95% CI 0.237-0.721), P=0.002], allo-HSCT [RR=0.175 (95% CI 0.075-0.389), P=0.000] and CR after one-course induction [RR=0.429 (95% CI 0.245-0.750), P=0.003] were of importance for survival. CONCLUSION: allo-HSCT was an optimal choice for Ph(+)ALL patients. Imatinib-based therapy could increase CR rate, maintain CR duration and decrease relapse, resulting in more chance of HSCT.

METHODS: A total of 1 030 pairs of simultaneous bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 419 patients with CML during TKI treatment were analyzed with standard G-banding techniques and real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (Q-PCR). RESULTS: The Spearman correlation coefficient for the paired analysis of the percentage of Ph- positive metaphases versus Q-PCR (BCR-ABL/ABL) values was 0.655 (n=1 030, P<0.01). There was a significant difference in terms of BCR-ABL values among all three cytogenetic response groups of no partial cytogenetic (no PCyR), partial cytogenetic (PCyR) and complete cytogenetic responses(CCyR) (P<0.01). 93.8% of the patients in CCyR had BCR-ABL</=1% [International Scale (IS)], and 97.5% of those with BCR-ABL</=0.1% (IS) were in CCyR. There was good concordance of 86.2% (888 of 1 030 samples) when BCR-ABL values according to cutoffs of BCR-ABL>10%(IS), </=10%->1%(IS)and </=1%(IS) were coupled with cytogenetic responses including no PCyR, PCyR and CCyR.

As microtubule inhibitors could represent a therapeutic strategy for CLL, this study investigated the capability of nocodazole, a synthetic depolymerizing agent, to kill CLL leukaemic cells. We demonstrated that nocodazole was highly specific for the in vitro induction of apoptosis in leukaemic cells from 90 CLL patients, without affecting the viability of T-cells and/or mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) recovered from the same patients. Nocodazole was observed to overcome the pro-survival signals provided by MSCs. Competing with ATP for the nucleotide-binding site, nocodazole has been observed to turn off the high basal tyrosine phosphorylation of leukaemic cells mediated by the Src-kinase Lyn. Considering that most anti-microtubule drugs have limited clinical use because of their strong toxic effects, the high selectivity of nocodazole for leukaemic cells in CLL and its capability to bypass microenvironmental pro-survival stimuli, suggests the use of this inhibitor for designing new therapeutic strategies in CLL treatment.",['(c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Frezzato, Federica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Gattazzo, Cristina', 'Ave, Elisa', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Cabrelle, Anna', 'Olivieri, Valeria', 'Zambello, Renato', 'Facco, Monica', 'Zonta, Francesca', 'Cristiani, Andrea', 'Brunati, Anna Maria', 'Moro, Stefano', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Frezzato F', 'Trimarco V', 'Martini V', 'Gattazzo C', 'Ave E', 'Visentin A', 'Cabrelle A', 'Olivieri V', 'Zambello R', 'Facco M', 'Zonta F', 'Cristiani A', 'Brunati AM', 'Moro S', 'Semenzato G', 'Trentin L']","['Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica, Padova, Italy; Department of Medicine, Haematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, Padova University School of Medicine, Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20140307,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Nocodazole/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/physiology', 'Tubulin Modulators/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['Lyn', 'apoptosis', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'inhibitor', 'nocodazole']",2014/03/13 06:00,2014/07/01 06:00,['2014/03/11 06:00'],"['2013/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2013/12/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.12815 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2014 Jun;165(5):659-72. doi: 10.1111/bjh.12815.

No report is yet available from Iran regarding epidemiological and survival rate of cancers diagnosed in this age group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The population under study comprised of patients which were diagnosed and admitted to Ali-Asghar hospital between years 1996-2005. In total, 287 infants were included in the retrospective descriptive survey. Patient files were evaluated for age of patient at the time of diagnosis, sex, geographical residence, consanguinity of parents, histological diagnosis, site of cancer involvement, type of therapy, date of last follow-up and cause of death (if applicable). RESULTS: The average age at the time of diagnosis was 7.2 months old. The most frequent malignancy was retinoblastoma (44%), followed by leukemia (19%) and neuroblastoma (10%), with five-year overall survival rates of 77.7%, 41% and 90%, respectively Parents of 40 infants (13.9%) had consanguinity relationships.

Although its effects on cancer are significant, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we sought to elucidate possible links between ginsenoside Rh2 and phosphoglucose isomerase/autocrine motility factor (PGI/AMF). METHODS: KG1alpha, a leukemia cell line highly expressing PGI/AMF was assessed by western blot analysis and reverse transcription- PCR (RT-PCR) assay after transfection of a small interfering (si)-RNA to silence PGI/AMF. The effect of PGI/ AMF on proliferation was measured by typan blue assay and antibody array. A cell counting kit (CCK)-8 and flow cytometry (FCM) were adopted to investigate the effects of Rh2 on PGI/AMF. The relationships between PGI/AMF and Rh2 associated with Akt, mTOR, Raptor, Rag were detected by western blot analysis. RESULTS: KG1alpha cells expressed PGI/AMF and its down-regulation significantly inhibited proliferation. The antibody array indicated that the probable mechanism was reduced expression of PARP, State1, SAPK/JNK and Erk1/2, while those of PRAS40 and p38 were up-regulated. Silencing of PGI/AMF enhanced the sensibility of KG1alpha to Rh2 by suppressing the expression of mTOR, Raptor and Akt. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that ginsenoside Rh2 suppressed the proliferation of KG1alpha, the same as down-regulation of PGI/AMF.

The mechanisms underlying FPD/AML platelet dysfunction remain incompletely clarified. We aimed to determine the contribution of platelet structural abnormalities and defective activation pathways to the platelet phenotype. In addition, by using a candidate gene approach, we sought to identify potential RUNX1-regulated genes involved in these defects. METHODS: Lumiaggregometry, alpha-granule and dense granule content and release, platelet ultrastructure, alphaIIb beta3 integrin activation and outside-in signaling were assessed in members of one FPD/AML pedigree. Expression levels of candidate genes were measured and luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to study NF-E2 regulation by RUNX1. RESULTS: A severe decrease in platelet aggregation, defective alphaIIb beta3 integrin activation and combined alphadelta storage pool deficiency were found. However, whereas the number of dense granules was markedly reduced, alpha-granule content was heterogeneous. A trend towards decreased platelet spreading was found, and beta3 integrin phosphorylation was impaired, reflecting altered outside-in signaling. A decrease in the level of transcription factor p45 NF-E2 was shown in platelet RNA and lysates, and other deregulated genes included RAB27B and MYL9. RUNX1 was shown to bind to the NF-E2 promoter in primary megakaryocytes, and wild-type RUNX1, but not FPD/AML mutants, was able to activate NF-E2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The FPD/AML platelet function defect represents a complex trait, and RUNX1 orchestrates platelet function by regulating diverse aspects of this process. This study highlights the RUNX1 target NF-E2 as part of the molecular network by which RUNX1 regulates platelet biogenesis and function.",['(c) 2014 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],"['Glembotsky, A C', 'Bluteau, D', 'Espasandin, Y R', 'Goette, N P', 'Marta, R F', 'Marin Oyarzun, C P', 'Korin, L', 'Lev, P R', 'Laguens, R P', 'Molinas, F C', 'Raslova, H', 'Heller, P G']","['Glembotsky AC', 'Bluteau D', 'Espasandin YR', 'Goette NP', 'Marta RF', 'Marin Oyarzun CP', 'Korin L', 'Lev PR', 'Laguens RP', 'Molinas FC', 'Raslova H', 'Heller PG']","['Departamento de Hematologia Investigacion, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/*blood/*complications', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*complications', 'Male', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit/metabolism', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,['NOTNLM'],"['FPD/AML', 'NF-E2 transcription factor', 'RUNX1 protein', 'Rab27B protein, human', 'blood platelet disorder', 'platelet function tests']",2014/03/13 06:00,2015/01/30 06:00,['2014/03/11 06:00'],"['2013/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jth.12550 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2014 May;12(5):761-72. doi: 10.1111/jth.12550.,,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Integrin beta3)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoprotein IIb)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When patients die from SS, it frequently is due to the sequela of the profound endogenous immunosuppression that is typical of this condition. Most cases of SS represent neoplasms of mature postthymic CD4(+) T cells. We present a case of SS that exhibited an unusual double-positive phenotype in which the neoplastic T cells demonstrated CD4 and CD8 expression. The patient's clinical course was unusually aggressive with rapid clinical demise occurring less than 1 year from the initial cutaneous eruption.

RESULTS: Of the total, 50.4% had a higher incidence of T-ALL and 47.6% had pro-B, B-cell precursor ALL. Disease free survival and event free survival were remarkably higher in B-ALL adolescent patients as compared to T-ALL, who had significantly lower overall survival ratio. Prevalence of T-ALL was also observed in relapse cases for adolescent patients. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is an increased prevalence of T-ALL among adolescents in Eastern India.

Currently known risk loci, however, explain only one third of the estimated total risk related to common genetic variations. PROCEDURE: We genotyped 1,421 polymorphisms in 407 candidate genes from the SNP500Cancer database (National Cancer Institute) using the Illumina Cancer SNP Panel. We investigated 78 cases (aged 0-19 years at diagnosis, and mixed ethnic background) of childhood B-precursor ALL and compared genotype data with those of 1,417 HapMap controls. To account for the ethnic diversity of the study population, structured association by genetically matching cases and controls using identity-by-state similarity was used. Case-control association analyses were performed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests, adjusted for the population substructure. RESULTS: Common variations rs6966 (3' UTR of PPP1R13L, chr 19q13.32, P = 4.55 x 10(-9)) and rs414580 (intron 2 of MSR1, chr 8p22, P = 6.09 x 10(-8)) were significantly associated with ALL. These SNPs remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing. The SNP rs6966 tags a haplotype block which includes SNPs in PPP1R13L and ERCC2 genes, which are related to DNA repair and cell survival. rs6966 and rs414580 conferred allelic odds ratios of 3.74 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.31-6.04) and 3.93 (95% CI 2.31-6.69), respectively.

This article reviews the available pharmacological properties of intravenous infusions of alemtuzumab and its clinical efficacy and tolerability in adult patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Alemtuzumab is an effective treatment for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, and has a generally acceptable tolerability profile. In phase III trials, it was shown to be more effective than a current first-line treatment, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in decreasing relapse rate in treatment-naive and previously treated patients and in decreasing disability progression in previously treated patients. Of note, these results appear to have extended into the long-term follow-up, despite no further treatment. There was an increased risk of autoimmunity and infection associated with alemtuzumab in these trials; while these adverse events were generally mild to moderate, some were severe. Alemtuzumab is a highly convenient treatment, requiring hospital attendance for an intravenous infusion for a handful of days on two consecutive years, with no treatment required in between; however, this convenience is counterbalanced by the need for regular monitoring for the increased risk of autoimmunity.

However, severe anemia is sometimes seen in patients with hyperthyroidism, and the mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Bone marrow is comprised about 2-8% oxygen, and the characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells have been shown to be influenced under hypoxia. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is a critical mediator of cellular responses to hypoxia and an important mediator in signal transduction of thyroid hormone [triiodothyronine (T3)]. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of T3 on erythropoiesis under hypoxia mimicking physiological conditions in the bone marrow. We maintained human erythroleukemia K562 cells under hypoxic atmosphere (2% O(2)) and examined their cellular characteristics. Compared to that under normal atmospheric conditions, cells under hypoxia showed a reduction in the proliferation rate and increase in the hemoglobin content or benzidine-positive rate, indicating promotion of erythroid differentiation. T3 had no effect on hypoxia-induced erythroid differentiation, but significantly inhibited activin A/erythroid differentiation factor-induced erythroid differentiation. Moreover, GATA2 mRNA expression was suppressed in association with erythroid differentiation, while T3 significantly diminished that suppression. These results suggest that T3 has a direct suppressive effect on erythroid differentiation under hypoxic conditions.",,"['Yamamoto, Yoritsuna', 'Shiraishi, Mieno', 'Fujita, Masanori', 'Kojima, Itaru', 'Tanaka, Yuji', 'Tachibana, Shoichi']","['Yamamoto Y', 'Shiraishi M', 'Fujita M', 'Kojima I', 'Tanaka Y', 'Tachibana S']","['Division of Environmental Medicine, National Defense Medical College Research Institute, National Defense Medical College, 3-2 Namiki, Tokorozawa, Saitama, 359-8513, Japan, yoritsuna@dream.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140307,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Activins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Hypoxia/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Triiodothyronine/*pharmacology']",,,,,2014/03/08 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2014/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2014/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11010-014-2005-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2014 Jun;391(1-2):217-24. doi: 10.1007/s11010-014-2005-7.

The human body consists of approximately 210 different somatic cell types, the majority of which have limited proliferative capacity. However, both stem cells and cancer cells bypass this replicative barrier and undergo symmetric division indefinitely when cultured under defined conditions. Several signal transduction pathways play important roles in regulating stem cell development, and aberrant expression of components of these pathways is linked to cancer. Among signaling systems, the critical role of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) coupled to the Jak/STAT3 (signal transduction and activation of transcription-3) pathway in maintaining stem cell self-renewal has been extensively reviewed. This pathway additionally plays multiple roles in tumorigenesis. Likewise, the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway has been determined to play an important role in both stem cell maintenance and tumor development. This pathway is often induced in cancer with frequent mutational activation of the catalytic subunit of PI3K or loss of a primary PI3K antagonist, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN). This review focusses on roles of the PI3K signal transduction pathway components, with emphasis on functions in stem cell maintenance and cancer. Since the PI3K pathway impinges on and collaborates with other signaling pathways in regulating stem cell development and/or cancer, aspects of the canonical Wnt, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and TGF-beta signaling pathways are also discussed.","['(c) The Authors.

It was first identified in cells that were derived from laboratory mice and was found to be homologous to the gag gene of an endogenous retrovirus (ERV). To understand the evolution of the host restriction gene from its retroviral origins, Fv1s from wild mice were isolated and characterized. Most of these possess intact open reading frames but not all restricted N-, B-, NR-or NB-tropic MLVs, suggesting that other viruses could have played a role in the selection of the gene. The Fv1s from Mus spretus and Mus caroli were found to restrict equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) and feline foamy virus (FFV) respectively, indicating that Fv1 could have a broader target range than previously thought, including activity against lentiviruses and spumaviruses. Analyses of the Fv1 sequences revealed a number of residues in the C-terminal region that had evolved under positive selection. Four of these selected residues were found to be involved in the novel restriction by mapping studies. These results strengthen the similarities between the two capsid binding restriction factors, Fv1 and TRIM5alpha, which support the hypothesis that Fv1 defended mice against waves of retroviral infection possibly including non-MLVs as well as MLVs.",,"['Yap, Melvyn W', 'Colbeck, Emily', 'Ellis, Scott A', 'Stoye, Jonathan P']","['Yap MW', 'Colbeck E', 'Ellis SA', 'Stoye JP']","['Division of Virology, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Virology, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Virology, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Virology, National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, United Kingdom; Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['MC_U117512710/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'U117512710/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140306,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phylogeny', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC3948346,,,,2014/03/08 06:00,2014/11/05 06:00,['2014/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/11/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1003968 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-13-03256 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2014 Mar 6;10(3):e1003968. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003968. eCollection 2014 Mar.,,"['0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BCR-ABL(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), accelerated telomere shortening has been shown to correlate with leukemia progression, risk score and response to treatment. Here, we demonstrate that proliferation of murine CML-like bone marrow cells strongly depends on telomere maintenance. CML-like cells of telomerase knockout mice with critically short telomeres (CML-iG4) are growth retarded and proliferation is terminally stalled by a robust senescent cell cycle arrest. In sharp contrast, CML-like cells with pre-shortened, but not critically short telomere lengths (CML-G2) grew most rapidly and were found to express a specific 'telomere-associated secretory phenotype', comprising secretion of chemokines, interleukins and other growth factors, thereby potentiating oncogene-driven growth.

However, the role of the SP in leukemic pathogenesis remains controversial. The resistance of leukemic stem cells to targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), results in therapeutic failure or refractory/relapsed disease in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The drug pump, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), is well known as a specific marker of the SP and could be controlled by several pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway. Our data demonstrated that compared with wild-type K562 cells, the higher percentage of ABCG2+ cells corresponded to the higher SP fraction in K562/ABCG2 (ABCG2 overexpressing) and K562/IMR (resistance to imatinib) cells, which exhibited enhanced drug resistance along with downregulated phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome -10 (PTEN) and activated phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt). PTEN and p-Akt downregulation could be abrogated by both the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Moreover, in CML patients in the accelerated phase/blastic phase (AP/BP), increased SP phenotype rather than ABCG2 expression was accompanied by the loss of PTEN protein and the up-regulation of p-Akt expression. These results suggested that the expression of ABCG2 and the SP may be regulated by PTEN through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which would be a potentially effective strategy for targeting CML stem cells.",,"['Huang, Fang-Fang', 'Zhang, Li', 'Wu, Deng-Shu', 'Yuan, Xiao-Yu', 'Yu, Yan-Hui', 'Zhao, Xie-Lan', 'Chen, Fang-Ping', 'Zeng, Hui']","['Huang FF', 'Zhang L', 'Wu DS', 'Yuan XY', 'Yu YH', 'Zhao XL', 'Chen FP', 'Zeng H']","['Department of Hematology, Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Si Chuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xiang Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140306,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Side-Population Cells/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",PMC3945754,,,,2014/03/08 06:00,2015/02/11 06:00,['2014/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/02/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0088298 [doi]', 'PONE-D-13-32678 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2014 Mar 6;9(3):e88298. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0088298. eCollection 2014.,,"['0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2014;9(6):e99917'],,,,,,,

We aimed to examine the role of 14-3-3zeta in AML chemosensitivity using HL-60 and vincristine-resistant HL-60/VCR cells. METHODS: The effects of 14-3-3zeta siRNA on the growth and cell cycle progression of HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells were determined. The effect of 14-3-3zeta siRNA on topotecan (TPT)-induced apoptosis was evaluated by several assays. RESULTS: Compared to HL-60 cells, HL-60/VCR cells had increased 14-3-3zeta mRNA and protein expression. Increased mdr-1 mRNA as well as mdr-1, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 protein expression were observed in HL-60/VCR cells. In both HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells, 14-3-3zeta was observed in the cytoplasm and nuclear compartments. 14-3-3zeta siRNA significantly reduced HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cell growth after 48 h and increased the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, 14-3-3zeta siRNA significantly increased the sensitivity of both HL-60 and HL-60/VCR cells to TPT, possibly through the inhibition of Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and mdr-1 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Silencing of 14-3-3zeta increased the sensitivity of both sensitive and resistant HL-60 cells to TPT-induced apoptosis, possibly through altering the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins, suggesting that it may be a potential target for MDR AML.","['(c) 2014 S.

Tumors from various histological origins exhibit FAS mutations, the most frequent being hematological malignancies. However, data regarding FAS mutations or FAS signaling alterations are still lacking in precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas (T-LBLs). The available data on acute lymphoblastic leukemia, of precursor origin as well, indicate a low frequency of FAS mutations but often report a serious reduction in FAS-mediated apoptosis as well as chemoresistance, thus suggesting the occurrence of mechanisms able to deregulate the FAS signaling pathway, different from FAS mutation. Our aim at this study was to determine whether FAS-mediated apoptotic signaling is compromised in human T-LBL samples and the mechanisms involved. This study on 26 T-LBL samples confirms that the FAS system is impaired to a wide extent in these tumors, with 57.7% of the cases presenting any alteration of the pathway. A variety of mechanisms seems to be involved in such alteration, in order of frequency the downregulation of FAS, the deregulation of other members of the pathway and the occurrence of mutations at FAS. Considering these results together, it seems plausible to think of a cumulative effect of several alterations in each T-LBL, which in turn may result in FAS/FASLG system deregulation. Since defective FAS signaling may render the T-LBL tumor cells resistant to apoptotic cell death, the correct prognosis, diagnosis and thus the success of anticancer therapy may require such an in-depth knowledge of the complete scenario of FAS-signaling alterations.",,"['Villa-Morales, M', 'Cobos, M A', 'Gonzalez-Gugel, E', 'Alvarez-Iglesias, V', 'Martinez, B', 'Piris, M A', 'Carracedo, A', 'Benitez, J', 'Fernandez-Piqueras, J']","['Villa-Morales M', 'Cobos MA', 'Gonzalez-Gugel E', 'Alvarez-Iglesias V', 'Martinez B', 'Piris MA', 'Carracedo A', 'Benitez J', 'Fernandez-Piqueras J']","['1] Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, Madrid, Spain [2] Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain [3] Instituto de Investigacion Sanitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.', '1] Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, Madrid, Spain [2] Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain [3] Instituto de Investigacion Sanitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.', 'Musculoskeletal Research Center, NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York, NY, USA.', 'Grupo de Medicina Xenomica, CIBERER, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', '1] Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain [2] Instituto de Investigacion de Enfermedades Raras, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Fundacion IFIMAV, Santander, Spain.', '1] Grupo de Medicina Xenomica, CIBERER, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain [2] Center of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, KSA.', '1] Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain [2] Human Genetics Group, CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', '1] Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC-UAM, Madrid, Spain [2] Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), Madrid, Spain [3] Instituto de Investigacion Sanitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20140306,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Fas Ligand Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC3973220,,,,2014/03/08 06:00,2014/10/22 06:00,['2014/03/08 06:00'],"['2013/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2014/01/17 00:00 [revised]', '2014/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2014/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201483 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2014.83 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2014 Mar 6;5:e1110. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2014.83.,,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent study reports that CX3CL1 is released from apoptotic cells to stimulate macrophages chemotaxis. In this study, we investigated the role of CX3CL1 in the apo-MPs in the cell-cell interaction between alveolar macrophage NR8383 cells and apoptotic all-trans retinoic acid-treated NB4 (ATRA-NB4) cells. METHODS/RESULTS: Apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cells and their conditioning medium (CM) enhanced the chemoattraction of NR8383 cells as well as their phagocytosis activity in engulfing apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cells. The levels of CX3CL1(+) apo-MPs and CX3CL1 were rapidly elevated in the CM of ATRA-NB4 cell culture after induction of apoptosis. Both exogenous CX3CL1 and apo-MPs enhanced the transmigration of NR8383 cells toward apoptotic ATRA-NB4 cells. This pro-transmigratory activity was able to be partially inhibited either by blocking the CX3CR1 (CX3CL1 receptor) of NR8383 cells with its specific antibody or by blocking the surface CX3CL1 of apo-MPs with its specific antibody before incubating these apo-MPs with NR8383 cells. CONCLUSION: CX3CL1(+) apo-MPs released by apoptotic cells mediate the chemotactic transmigration of alveolar macrophages.","['(c) 2014 S.
