Some of the H-2b- H-2d+ variants: (1) lack the restriction enzyme fragments characteristic of the missing H-2b haplotype, as assessed by Southern blot analysis; (2) express more cell surface H-2d antigens than wild-type cells, as assessed by flow microfluorimetry; and (3) appear to have become homozygous for the more active H-2d-linked allele at the Glyoxalase I locus. These variants thus seem to have lost genetic material corresponding to the H-2b haplotype and may have gained genetic material corresponding to the H-2d haplotype. These results are consistent with the possibility that these variants were generated by mitotic recombination.","['Rajan, T V', 'Halay, E D', 'Potter, T A', 'Evans, G A', 'Seidman, J G', 'Margulies, D H']","['Rajan TV', 'Halay ED', 'Potter TA', 'Evans GA', 'Seidman JG', 'Margulies DH']","['Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['1-R0-1-CA-29194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 10702/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Variation', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Haplotypes', 'Heterozygote', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/genetics/immunology', 'Models, Genetic', '*Mutation', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC555319,1983/01/01 00:00,2002/04/04 10:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/04 10:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1983;2(9):1537-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first was a 75-year-old male with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. During a therapeutic course with fludarabine, he developed severe autoimmune thrombocytopenia resistant to conventional treatment, followed by persistent uncontrollable nasal bleeding. Platelet transfusions failed to increase the platelet count and control the hemorrhage. When hemoglobin levels fell below 8.5 g/dL and the patient's clinical condition got much worse, a single dose of 4.8 mg rFVIIa (90 microg/kg) was given as an i.v. bolus. Ten minutes after the rFVIIa injection, nasal bleeding stopped, the patient's clinical condition progressively improved, and splenectomy could be carried out uneventfully 2 days later. The second patient, a 52-year-old female, was under treatment for pre-B lymphoblastic leukemia. She developed severe thrombocytopenia, secondary to chemotherapy, complicated by massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Despite intensive treatment with platelet transfusions, hemorrhage continued and her condition deteriorated rapidly. She was then given an i.v. bolus injection of 4.8 mg rFVIIa, which resulted in cessation of hemorrhage and dramatic improvement of her clinical status. No adverse effects from the treatment with rFVIIa were observed.

What is not clear, though, is the clinical prognostic significance of the angiogenic factors in malignant haematological diseases. In this study, we have assessed the plasma and serum levels of two major angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) in 55 patients affected by chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD). This series included 25 patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 10 patients with chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML), 14 patients with polycythemia vera (PV), and 6 patients with primary myelofibrosis (MF), and they were compared to 20 healthy control subjects. In all patients the plasma VEGF concentration was significantly increased to the healthy control group (P < 0.004). The highest concentrations were found in the patients with ET (178.25 +/- 125.22 pg/ml). The VEGF levels were significantly higher in CMD patients with vascular complications than those in CMD patients without complications (P < 0.01). The b-FGF serum levels also appeared to be significantly higher in almost all the CMD patients compared to the control group (P < 0.07). A significant correlation was found between the VEGF levels and the platelet count in the ET patients and the spleen index in the CML patients. VEGF level, in this study, is associated with increased risk of thrombotic complications. There is evidence of increased levels of soluble angiogenic factors in malignant haematological disorders, but their contribution to the progression of diseases is yet unclear.","['Musolino, C', ""Calabro', L"", 'Bellomo, G', 'Martello, F', 'Loteta, B', 'Pezzano, C', 'Rizzo, V', 'Alonci, A']","['Musolino C', ""Calabro' L"", 'Bellomo G', 'Martello F', 'Loteta B', 'Pezzano C', 'Rizzo V', 'Alonci A']","['Division of Hematology, University of Messina, Italy. camilla.si@tiscalinet.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*blood', 'Humans', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/complications/etiology', 'Solubility', 'Thrombosis/blood/etiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2002 Mar;69(3):159-63. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10020.,,,"['10.1002/ajh.10020 [pii]', '10.1002/ajh.10020 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We made repeat spot and 24 h measurements in 51 children's home, located in the Detroit, MI, and the Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN metropolitan areas, on a regular bimonthly schedule over a 1 year period, as well as a single 2 week measurement, for total of eight visits, producing 21 days of data for each residence. We defined the long term estimate (LTE) as the geometric mean of all available 24 h geometric means from the first six bimonthly visits. The LTE served as the reference level for assessing seasonal, day of week, and diurnal effects, as well as the potential for misclassification. We found a small, but statistically significant (P<.05), seasonal effect, with levels approximately 3% lower than the LTE in the spring and about 4% greater during the summer. No effect was found for day of week. However, we did find a systematic and appreciable diurnal effect, suggesting that, for example, an evening spot measurement may overestimate the LTE by 20% or more. We also assessed how well the 24 h measurement from the last visit, which was not used in calculation of the LTE, estimated the LTE. We found a high degree of correlation (r=.92) and fair to good agreement using four exposure categories (kappa=.53). Thus, the 24 h measurement appears to be a satisfactory LTE estimator. However, this finding must be interpreted with caution since considerable unexplained variability was present among the repeat 24 h measurements in about one-third of the homes. While the 2 week measurement does somewhat decrease exposure misclassification, its added intrusiveness and cost are likely to outweigh the improved precision.","['Banks, Robert S', 'Thomas, William', 'Mandel, Jack S', 'Kaune, William T', 'Wacholder, Sholom', 'Tarone, Robert E', 'Linet, Martha S']","['Banks RS', 'Thomas W', 'Mandel JS', 'Kaune WT', 'Wacholder S', 'Tarone RE', 'Linet MS']","['Division of Environmental and Occupational Health, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. bobbanks@usinternet.com']",['eng'],['N01-CP-05626/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Bioelectromagnetics,Bioelectromagnetics,8008281,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Circadian Rhythm', '*Electromagnetic Fields/adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods', 'Housing/classification', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Seasons', 'Time']",,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioelectromagnetics. 2002 Apr;23(3):196-205. doi: 10.1002/bem.10002.,,,"['10.1002/bem.10002 [pii]', '10.1002/bem.10002 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, neither the generality of Notch involvement in leukemia, nor the molecules with which Notch may interact have been clarified. Recently, we showed that transgenic mice expressing the constitutively active intracellular domain of Notch3 in thymocytes and T cells developed early and aggressive T cell neoplasias. Although primarily splenic, the tumors sustained features of immature thymocytes, including expression of pTalpha, a defining component of the pre T cell receptor, known to be a potent signaling complex provoking thymocyte survival, proliferation, and activation. Thus, enforced expression of Notch3, which is ordinarily down-regulated as thymocytes mature, may sustain pre T cell receptor expression, causing dysregulated hyperplasia. This hypothesis has been successfully tested in this article by the observation that deletion of pTalpha in Notch3 transgenic mice abrogates tumor development, indicating a crucial role for pTalpha in T cell leukemogenesis. Parallel observations were made in humans, in that all T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias examined showed expression of Notch3 and of the Notch target gene HES-1, as well as of pTalpha a and b transcripts, whereas the expression of all these genes was dramatically reduced or absent in remission. Together, these results suggest that the combined expression of Notch3 and pTalpha sustains T cell leukemogenesis and may represent pathognomonic molecular features of human T-ALL.","['Bellavia, Diana', 'Campese, Antonio F', 'Checquolo, Saula', 'Balestri, Anna', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Lendahl, Urban', 'Fehling, Hans J', 'Hayday, Adrian C', 'Frati, Luigi', 'von Boehmer, Harald', 'Gulino, Alberto', 'Screpanti, Isabella']","['Bellavia D', 'Campese AF', 'Checquolo S', 'Balestri A', 'Biondi A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Lendahl U', 'Fehling HJ', 'Hayday AC', 'Frati L', 'von Boehmer H', 'Gulino A', 'Screpanti I']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Pathology, University La Sapienza, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pre-T cell receptor alpha)', '146991-60-8 (Notch4 protein, mouse)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', 'Receptor, Notch3', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Spleen/immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/immunology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', '*Transcription Factors']",PMC122602,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/04/25 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Mar 19;99(6):3788-93. doi: 10.1073/pnas.062050599.

Microarray analyses previously revealed induction of UBE1L (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1-like) after RA treatment of NB4 APL cells. We report here that this occurs within 3 h in RA-sensitive but not RA-resistant APL cells, implicating UBE1L as a direct retinoid target. A 1.3-kb fragment of the UBE1L promoter was capable of mediating transcriptional response to RA in a retinoid receptor-selective manner. PML/RARalpha, a repressor of RA target genes, abolished this UBE1L promoter activity. A hallmark of retinoid response in APL is the proteasome-dependent PML/RARalpha degradation. UBE1L transfection triggered PML/RARalpha degradation, but transfection of a truncated UBE1L or E1 did not cause this degradation. A tight link was shown between UBE1L induction and PML/RARalpha degradation. Notably, retroviral expression of UBE1L rapidly induced apoptosis in NB4 APL cells, but not in cells lacking PML/RARalpha expression. UBE1L has been implicated directly in retinoid effects in APL and may be targeted for repression by PML/RARalpha. UBE1L is proposed as a direct pharmacological target that overcomes oncogenic effects of PML/RARalpha by triggering its degradation and signaling apoptosis in APL cells.","['Kitareewan, Sutisak', 'Pitha-Rowe, Ian', 'Sekula, David', 'Lowrey, Christopher H', 'Nemeth, Michael J', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Freemantle, Sarah J', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan']","['Kitareewan S', 'Pitha-Rowe I', 'Sekula D', 'Lowrey CH', 'Nemeth MJ', 'Golub TR', 'Freemantle SJ', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Pharmacology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA. sutisak.kitareewan@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 HL052243/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA62275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL52243/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA87546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Ligases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC122605,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/04/25 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Mar 19;99(6):3806-11. doi: 10.1073/pnas.052011299.

CD4 T cell lines can induce apoptosis of CD40-activated CLL cells via a CD95 ligand (CD95-L)-dependent mechanism. To examine whether CD95-L was sufficient to induce cytolysis of CD40-activated CLL cells, we used Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with CD95-L as cytotoxic effector cells. CD40-activated CLL cells were initially resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis despite high-level expression of CD95. However, after 72 h, CLL cells from seven of seven patients became increasingly sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis. This sensitivity correlated with a progressive decline in Flice-inhibitory protein (FLIP), which was induced within 24 h of CD40 ligation. Down-regulation of FLIP with an antisense oligonucleotide or a pharmacologic agent, however, was not sufficient to render CLL cells sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis in the 24-72 h after CD40 activation. Although the levels of pro-Caspase-8 appeared sufficient, inadequate levels of Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and DAP3 may preclude assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex. Seventy-two hours after CD40 ligation, sensitivity to CD95 and a progressive increase in FADD and DAP3 were associated with the acquired ability of FADD and FLIP to coimmunoprecipitate with the death-inducing signaling complex after CD95 ligation. Collectively, these studies reveal that CD40 ligation on CLL B cells induces a programmed series of events in which the cells initially are protected and then sensitized to CD95-mediated apoptosis through shifts in the balance of the anti- and proapoptotic proteins FLIP and FADD.","['Chu, Peter', 'Deforce, Dieter', 'Pedersen, Irene M', 'Kim, Youngsoo', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Reed, John C', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Chu P', 'Deforce D', 'Pedersen IM', 'Kim Y', 'Kitada S', 'Reed JC', 'Kipps TJ']","['The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Stein Institute for Research on Aging, School of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],['P01-81534/PHS HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand/administration & dosage/genetics/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",PMC122613,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/04/25 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Mar 19;99(6):3854-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.022604399.

Our recent studies suggest that disruption of TASR-mediated pre-mRNA splicing is involved in the pathogenesis of human leukemia and sarcomas. The mRNA transcripts for TASR-1 and -2 share an identical sequence at the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) and in part of the coding region; however the other regions of the transcripts diverge from each other and it was not clear whether the differences resulted from alternative splicing or transcription from two distinct genes. Here we describe the assignment of both TASR cDNAs to the same 16 kb DNA segment located on chromosome 1. Despite the presence of at least three retroposed products of TASR-1 mRNA in the human genome, only the 16 kb structural TASR gene on chromosome 1 is actively transcribed. In addition, multiple polyadenylation sites and a rare U12-type intron were found within the TASR gene. Transcription initiation site of the TASR gene was determined by primer extension; analysis of the TASR promoter revealed that it lacks the TATA box but contains a GC-rich sequence. When cloned into a luciferase reporter and transfected into human cells, the TASR promoter construct generated luciferase activity that was at least 2000 fold greater than the promoterless plasmid. Northern blot analysis showed that at least five different TASR-1 and -2 transcripts are expressed in a broad range of human tissues.","['Clinton, Jeremiah M', 'Chansky, Howard A', 'Odell, David D', 'Zielinska-Kwiatkowska, Anna', 'Hickstein, Dennis D', 'Yang, Liu']","['Clinton JM', 'Chansky HA', 'Odell DD', 'Zielinska-Kwiatkowska A', 'Hickstein DD', 'Yang L']","['Department of Orthopedics and Sports Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, 1660 South Columbian Way, GMR 151, Seattle, WA 98108, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (SRSF10 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes/genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Transcription Initiation Site']",,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/05/15 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 2002 Feb 6;284(1-2):141-7. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00382-7.,,,"['S0378111902003827 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(02)00382-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its chemical structure and clinical experience indicate that CLB is mutagenic and carcinogenic. We have investigated the ability of CLB to induce mutations and gene expression changes in the wild-type (WT) Escherichia coli strain AB1157 and in the base excision repair-deficient (alkA1, tag-1) E. coli strain MV1932 using a rifampicin (rif) forward mutation system and a cDNA array method. The results showed that CLB is a potent mutagen in MV1932 cells compared with the E. coli WT strain AB1157, emphasizing the role of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylases I and II in protecting the cells from CLB-induced DNA damage and subsequent mutations. Global gene expression profiling revealed that nine genes in WT E. coli and 100 genes in MV1932, of a total of 4290 genes, responded at least 2.5-fold to CLB. Interestingly, all of these MV1932 genes were downregulated, while 22% were upregulated in WT cells. The downregulated genes in MV1932 represented most (19/23) functional categories, and unexpectedly, many of them code for proteins responsible for genomic integrity. These include: (i) RecF (SOS-response, adaptive mutation), (ii) RecC (resistance to cross-linking agents), (iii) HepA (DNA repair, a possible substitute of RecBCD), (iv) Ssb (DNA recombination repair, controls RecBCD), and (v) SbcC (genetic recombination). Our results strongly suggest that in addition to the DNA damage itself, the downregulation of central protecting genes is responsible for the decreased cell survival (demonstrated in a previous work) and the increased mutation rate (this work) of DNA repair-deficient cells, when exposed to CLB.","['Salmelin, Camilla', 'Vilpo, Juhani']","['Salmelin C', 'Vilpo J']","['Leukemia Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Hospital and Tampere University Medical School, P.O.

However, fetal sensitivity and dose-response characteristics with regard to transplacental mutagenesis by X-rays have never been quantified. In the current experiment, pregnant Syrian hamsters at day 12 of gestation were irradiated with 300-kV X-rays. Twenty-four hours later, the fetuses were removed and their cells were allowed a 5 day expression time in culture. They were then seeded for colony formation and also for mutation selection by 6-thioguanine (6-TG). Mutation frequency was linear over the entire dose range, 10-600 R. The average induced 6-TG mutant frequency was 4.7 x 10(-7) per R. These results suggest that fetal cells are highly sensitive to induction of mutations by X-rays, and that a no-effect threshold is not likely. The 10 R dose caused a 25-fold increase in mutation frequency over the historical control, 45 x 10(-7) versus 1.8 x 10(-7), an increase per R of 2.5-fold. Increased risk of childhood cancer related to obstetrical transabdominal X-ray has also been estimated at 2.5-fold per R.

The ETS protein Fli-1 is known to induce differentiation in the erythroblastic leukemia cell line K562 along megakaryocytic developmental pathways. Here we show that IL-6 treatment of K562 induces the expression of Fli-1 via the STAT3 transcription factor.

SETTING: A French university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients age 65 and older with a diagnosis of myelodysplasia made in the hospital between January 1993 and December 1998. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical presentation, initial hematological features, type of myelodysplasia (French American British classification), treatment, and evolution at 36 months were studied. RESULTS: The mean age of the group was 78. Anemia was the initial hematological feature in 30 patients out of 45 and was symptomatic in 24 patients. Refractory anemia was diagnosed in 20 patients; 11 patients presented with refractory anemia with excess blast cells, eight with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Thirty-one patients received erythrocyte transfusions, no patient received chemotherapy. At 36 months, 68.8% of the patients were dead. The median survival (22 months) was lower than in other reported series even in types of myelodysplasia with a classically better prognosis.

Combination therapies have proven to be more beneficial than treatment with single agents. We hypothesized that immunization of mice with killed erythroleukemia cells prior to the induction of erythroleukemia via injection of viable tumor cells, plus dietary administration of a known immuno-enhancing phytocompound, Echinacea purpurea, would be more effective than immunization alone. DESIGN: A commercially available extract of E. purpurea root, already proven as a natural killer (NK) cell stimulant, was administered via the chow, for periods of 9 days or 3 months after the onset of leukemia to mice which had been injected (immunized) 5 weeks earlier with killed leukemia cells. RESULTS: Immunized mice (+/- E. purpurea) had significantly prolonged life spans versus non-immunized mice, with an even greater proportion of hosts surviving long-term in the E. purpurea-fed group. NK cells, the mediators of nonspecific immunity and well-demonstrated mediators of tumor cytolysis, were very significantly elevated in immunized, leukemic mice receiving E. purpurea in their diet versus those receiving untreated chow. Early in tumor development (9 days), cells mediating specific immunity (T, B lymphocytes) were 10-12 times higher in absolute numbers in the spleens in all immunized, leukemic mice vs unimmunized, leukemic mice at the same stage of tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that combination therapy, involving specific tumor cell immunization, followed by daily phytotherapy (dietary E. purpurea), sensitized the immune cells and led to life span prolongation greater than that provided by immunization alone.","['Currier, Nathan L', 'Miller, Sandra C']","['Currier NL', 'Miller SC']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Altern Complement Med,"Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)",9508124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/immunology', 'Echinacea/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy, Active/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Roots', 'Spleen/drug effects/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Altern Complement Med. 2002 Feb;8(1):49-58. doi: 10.1089/107555302753507177.,,,['10.1089/107555302753507177 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such outcome-adaptive methods may require repeated interim suspension of accrual in order to follow each patient for the time period required to evaluate response. This may increase trial duration, and eligible patients arriving during such delays either must wait for accrual to reopen or be treated outside the trial. Alternatively, monitoring may be done continuously by ignoring censored data each time the stopping rule is applied, which wastes information. We propose an adaptive Bayesian method that eliminates these problems. At each patient's accrual time, an approximate posterior for the response probability based on all of the event-time data is used to compute an early stopping criterion. Application to a leukemia trial with a composite event shows that the method can reduce trial duration substantially while maintaining the reliability of interim decisions.","['Cheung, Ying Kuen', 'Thall, Peter F']","['Cheung YK', 'Thall PF']","['Department of Biostatistics, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA. cheung@biostat.columbia.edu']",['eng'],['CA-83932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['*Bayes Theorem', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic/*methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/therapy', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous']",,2002/03/14 10:00,2002/09/06 10:01,['2002/03/14 10:00'],"['2002/03/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biometrics. 2002 Mar;58(1):89-97. doi: 10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.00089.x.,,,['10.1111/j.0006-341x.2002.00089.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of action underlying ATRA treatment are (1) relocalization of the PML restoration of normal structure of nuclear bodies and degradation of PML-RAR alpha protein via caspase-mediated cleavage and proteosome-dependent degradation; (2) conversion of PML-RAR alpha from a transcription repressor (CoR) to a transcription activator (CoA) under therapeutic concentration of ATRA (3) coordinated genes expression induced by ATRA resulting in an elegant and intricate cellular program for the commitment to differentiation. 169 genes were modulated to express, with 100 genes up-regulated and 69 down-regulated. As2O3 exerts its action by dual dose-dependent manner. At higher concentration (1-2 microns/l), it induces apoptosis of the leukemic cells associated with disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, elevation of caspase-3 and other caspases activity and decline of Bcl-2 expression. At lower concentration (0.1-0.5 micron/l), it triggers differentiation with elevation of CD11b expression accompanied by morphologically partial differentiation. At both concentrations, As2O3 causes degradation of PML-RAR alpha protein implicated probably in its mechanisms of action.","['Wang, Zhen-yi']",['Wang ZY'],"['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we have characterized the permeation and selectivity properties of store-operated channels in the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cell line. Store depletion by dialysis with InsP(3) and 10 mM EGTA resulted in the rapid development of large inward currents in Na(+)- and Li(+)-based divalent-free solutions. Cs(+) permeated the channels poorly (P(Cs)/ P(Na)=0.01). Trimethylamine (TMA(+)), tetramethylammonium (TeMA(+)), tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)), N-methyl- D-glucamine (NMDG(+)) and TRIS(+) were not measurably permeant. NH(4)(+) was conducted well. We estimated the minimum pore diameter under divalent-free conditions to be between 0.32 nm and 0.55 nm. When cells were dialysed with buffered Ca(2+) solution and I(CRAC) activated by application of thapsigargin, P(Cs)/ P(Na) was still low (0.08). Outward currents through CRAC channels were carried by intracellular Na(+), K(+) and, to a much lesser extent, by Cs(+). Currents were unaffected by dialysis with Mg(2+)-free solution. The Na(+) current was inhibited by external Ca(2+) (half-maximal blocking concentration of 10 microM). This Ca(2+)-dependent block could be alleviated by hyperpolarization. The monovalent Na(+) current was voltage dependent, increasing as the holding potential depolarized above 0 mV. Our results suggest that CRAC channels in RBL-1 cells have a smaller pore diameter than voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels, discriminate between Group I cations, and differ markedly in their selectivity from CRAC channels reported in lymphocytes.","['Bakowski, Daniel', 'Parekh, Anant B']","['Bakowski D', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pflugers Arch,Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology,0154720,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Cations, Monovalent)', '1KSV9V4Y4I (Cesium)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism', 'Cations, Monovalent/pharmacokinetics', 'Cesium/pharmacokinetics', 'Electrophysiology', 'Ion Channel Gating/drug effects/*physiology', '*Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Rats', 'Sodium/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/03/13 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/03/13 10:00'],"['2001/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2001/12/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pflugers Arch. 2002 Mar;443(5-6):892-902. doi: 10.1007/s00424-001-0775-8.

Concentrations of both adducts increased with benzene exposure [range = 0.07-46.6 parts/million (ppm); median = 3.55 ppm] and with urinary cotinine. Adduct levels were less than proportional to benzene exposure, suggesting saturable CYP 2E1 metabolism of benzene. Because the transition from linear to saturable metabolism began at approximately 1 ppm, the common assumption of linear kinetics at much higher benzene exposures could lead to substantial underestimation of leukemia risks. Adduct levels were generally lower in older workers, indicating that CYP 2E1 metabolism diminished with age, at approximately 2%/year of life. The ratio of 1,4-BQ-Alb:BO-Alb decreased with age and coexposure to toluene, and increased with alcohol consumption. This indicates that factors affecting CYP 2E1 metabolism exerted a greater role on production of 1,4-BQ than BO, presumably because of the second oxidation step from phenol to hydroquinone. The adduct ratio was also positively associated with urinary cotinine, suggesting that both benzene and hydroquinone from cigarette smoke affected adduct levels. Results of a limited time course study of 11 subjects indicated moderate chemical instability of 1,4-BQ-Alb (half life = 13.5 days compared with 21 days for normal Alb turnover), whereas no evidence of instability of BO-Alb was observed. This study illustrates that Alb adducts can be used to investigate the dispositions of reactive metabolites of procarcinogens in humans, provided that exposures are adequately characterized in the month preceding blood collection.","['Rappaport, Stephen M', 'Waidyanatha, Suramya', 'Qu, Qingshan', 'Shore, Roy', 'Jin, Ximei', 'Cohen, Beverly', 'Chen, Lung-Chi', 'Melikian, Assieh A', 'Li, Guilan', 'Yin, Songnian', 'Yan, Huifang', 'Xu, Bohong', 'Mu, Ruidong', 'Li, Yuying', 'Zhang, Xiaoling', 'Li, Keqi']","['Rappaport SM', 'Waidyanatha S', 'Qu Q', 'Shore R', 'Jin X', 'Cohen B', 'Chen LC', 'Melikian AA', 'Li G', 'Yin S', 'Yan H', 'Xu B', 'Mu R', 'Li Y', 'Zhang X', 'Li K']","['School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7400, USA. stephen_rappaport@unc.edu']",['eng'],"['P30ES10126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Cyclohexanes)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'V2WDI94M5S (benzene oxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Albumins/*metabolism', 'Benzene/*metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/*metabolism', 'Cyclohexanes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Smoking/metabolism']",,2002/03/13 10:00,2002/04/06 10:01,['2002/03/13 10:00'],"['2002/03/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Mar 1;62(5):1330-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, the genetic studies are rare, and no global theory exists. Two cytogenetic profiles are described, one with translocations and one with genetic material losses, evoking two different genetic evolutions. Two questions are stated. What are the radiation-induced genetic mechanisms? Is it possible to differentiate the radiation-induced and spontaneous tumors with genetic approaches? With 37 cytogenetic cases, 12 analyzed in our laboratory, the radiation-induced tumors were characterized by genetic material losses. An anti-oncogenic evolution is probable. A new molecularly study confirm these results. Only thyroid tumors do not have this evolution.

This has come about in a variety of clinical circumstances, including use of fludarabine alone as well as in combinations with DNA-damaging agents or membrane-targeted antibodies. Other strategies have used fludarabine to reduce immunological function, thus facilitating non-myeloablative stem cell transplants. Fludarabine is a prodrug that is converted to the free nucleoside 9-beta-D-arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A) which enters cells and accumulates mainly as the 5'-triphosphate, F-ara-ATP. The rate-limiting step in the formation of triphosphate is conversion of F-ara-A to its monophosphate, which is catalyzed by deoxycytidine kinase. Although F-ara-A is not a good substrate for this enzyme, the high specific activity of this protein results in efficient phosphorylation of F-ara-A in certain tissues. F-ara-ATP has multiple mechanisms of action, which are mostly directed toward DNA. These include inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, incorporation into DNA resulting in repression of further DNA polymerisation, and inhibition of DNA ligase and DNA primase. Collectively these actions affect DNA synthesis, which is the major mechanism of F-ara-A-induced cytotoxicity. Secondarily, incorporation into RNA and inhibition of transcription has been shown in cell lines. With the standard dose of fludarabine (25 to 30 mg/m(2)/day given over 30 minutes for 5 days), plasma concentrations of about 3 micromol/L F-ara-A are achieved at the end of each infusion. Serial sampling of leukaemia cells from patients receiving these standard doses of fludarabine has demonstrated that the peak concentrations of F-ara-ATP are achieved 4 hours after start of fludarabine infusion. Although there is heterogeneity among individuals with respect to rate of F-ara-ATP accumulation, the peak concentrations are generally proportional to the dose of the drug. Knowledge of the plasma pharmacokinetics of its principal nucleoside metabolite F-ara-A, and the cellular pharmacology of the proximal active metabolite, F-ara-ATP, has provided some understanding of the activity of fludarabine when used as a single agent. Preclinical studies directed toward learning the mechanisms of action of this agent have formed the basis for several mechanism-based strategies for its combination and scheduling with other agents. As a single agent fludarabine has been effective for the indolent leukaemias. Biochemical modulation strategies resulted in enhanced accumulation of cytarabine triphosphate and led to the use of fludarabine for the treatment of acute leukaemias. Combination of fludarabine with DNA damaging agents to inhibit DNA repair processes has been highly effective for indolent leukaemias and lymphomas. The current review brings together knowledge of the mechanisms of fludarabine, the state of understanding of the plasma pharmacokinetics, and cellular pharmacodynamics of fludarabine nucleotides. This may be useful in the design of future therapeutic approaches.","['Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William']","['Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Safety, hematologic recovery, kinetics, and complications.",136-43,"BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplants are an accepted treatment for several malignant and nonmalignant hematologic diseases. Recently, the peripheral blood, after mobilization of stem cells with growth factors, has become the source of choice for hematopoietic stem cells. We report on a series of patients who received peripheral blood stem cell transplants at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCAN) in Mexico City. METHODS: Between May 1995 and December 1999, 33 patients received peripheral blood stem cell transplants to treat hematologic diseases. Sixty percent of our patients had chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML). All had a matched related donor. Patients were conditioned with one of five different conditioning regimens and subsequently received one of two different graft-vs.-host disease prophylaxis regimens. Stratified Wilcoxon rank-sum, chi square, and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze the results. RESULTS: In our series, median time to achieve a total neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 14 days and to achieve a platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/L, 15 days. Acute graft-vs.-host disease occurred in seven patients. Chronic graft-vs.-host disease occurred in 69% of surviving patients. Survival for low-risk patients was 67% and for the high-risk group, 9%. CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral blood stem cells produce a faster hematopoietic recovery. The rate of acute graft-vs.-host disease is not increased using the peripheral blood as source of stem cells; however, chronic graft-vs.-host disease continues to be a significant problem. Donors tolerated the procurement procedure without complications.","['Sobrevilla-Calvo, Pedro', 'Rivas-Vera, Silvia', 'Cervera-Ubierna, Alfonso', 'Lopez-P, Martha Patricia', 'Acosta-Barreda, Aurora', 'Salles, Maria Teresa', 'Marche-Cova, Alejandro']","['Sobrevilla-Calvo P', 'Rivas-Vera S', 'Cervera-Ubierna A', 'Lopez-P MP', 'Acosta-Barreda A', 'Salles MT', 'Marche-Cova A']","['Departamento de Hematologia, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCAN), Av.

Respiratory failure, intracranial bleeding, and severe metabolic abnormalities frequently occur in acute hyperleukocytic leukemias (AHLs) and are the primary determinants of the high early mortality (20% to 40%) observed. The process leading to these complications has long been known as leukostasis, but the biological mechanisms underlying its development and progression have remained unclear. Traditionally, leukostasis has been attributed to overcrowding of leukemic blasts in the microcirculation, and its treatment has focused on prompt leukocytoreduction. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that leukostasis results from the adhesive interactions between leukemic blasts and the endothelium; a mechanism that none of the current therapies directly addresses. The endothelial damage associated with leukostasis is likely to be mediated by cytokines released in situ and by subsequent migration of leukemic blasts in the perivascular space. The adhesion molecules displayed by the leukemic blasts and their chemotactic response to the cytokines in the vascular microenvironment are probably more important in causing leukostasis than the cell number. This may explain why leukostasis may develop in some patients with AHL and not in others, and why some patients with acute leukemia without hyperleukocytosis (<50,000 blasts/mm(3)) develop leukostasis and respond to leukocytoreduction. Leukapheresis effectively reduces the blast count in many patients with AHL and is routinely used for immediate leukocytoreduction. However, the most appropriate use of leukapheresis in acute leukemia remains unclear, and the procedure may not prevent early death more efficiently than fluid therapy, hydroxyurea, and prompt induction chemotherapy. The use of cranial irradiation remains very controversial and is not generally recommended.

Post transplant, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia always occur and patients require platelet transfusions. It may be possible to reduce the period of thrombocytopenia by re-infusion of ex vivo expanded megakaryocyte progenitors (MP), derived from the progenitor cell graft. We have investigated the expansion of MP from CD34+ enriched cells from normal bone marrow (NBM) and peripheral blood (PB) and remission BM or PB samples from patients with haematological malignancies. CD34+ cells were cultured in serum-free medium supplemented with thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6 and stem cell factor (SCF) for 7 d, then cell proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry using lineage-specific markers. It was possible to significantly expand the number of MP cells from all sources. There were no major differences in yields of MP from normal BM or PB, or BM from multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. However, expansion of MP in acute myeloid leukaemia samples was lower than all other samples and the number of megakaryocyte colony-forming units was reduced. Several cytokine combinations were evaluated to optimize MP expansion from NBM. Equivalent yields of MP were obtained using TPO and one of IL-1, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or SCF, suggesting that large cytokine combinations are not necessary for this procedure. It should be possible to scale up the culture conditions described to produce effective MP doses for clinical transplantation.","['Blair, Allison', 'Baker, Caroline L', 'Pamphilon, Derwood H', 'Judson, Philip A']","['Blair A', 'Baker CL', 'Pamphilon DH', 'Judson PA']","['Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences and Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK. allison.blair@nbs.nhs.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokines', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/therapy', '*Megakaryocytes', 'Remission Induction']",,2002/03/12 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/03/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Mar;116(4):912-9. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-1048.2002.03354.x.,,,"['3354 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-1048.2002.03354.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1978 to 2000, with a median follow-up of 10 years, 118 previously untreated high-risk ET patients (median age 62 years, range 25-82), were treated with PB at the starting dose of 0.8-1 mg/kg/d. All patients reached a platelet count <600 x 10(9)/l and 91% achieved a platelet count <400 x 10(9)/l. During follow-up, 13 patients had thrombosis, with a 10-year cumulative risk of 14%. Acute myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis and solid tumours occurred in three, two and seven patients with a 10-year cumulative risk of 3%, 2% and 7% respectively. Actuarial survival at 20 years was 64% and the standardized mortality ratio was 1.1 (95% CI: 0.7-1.7), not statistically different from the general population (P = 0.54).

This study, with a median follow-up of 10 years, demonstrates that pipobroman is effective and well tolerated.

According to the diagnostic criteria of the Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG), ET lacks features diagnostic for other MPDs, including the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) or bcr-abl rearrangement. Recently, some authors have reported bcr-abl transcript positivity in ET patients, but these findings remain controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the bcr-abl transcript could be found in ET patients and to verify the hypothesis of a new ET variant. ET patients (n = 121) with a median age at diagnosis of 55 years were enrolled. The bcr-abl transcript status was examined by multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Only two cases were positive for bcr-abl, one of which had the Ph at diagnosis. The positive bcr-abl transcript was associated, in both cases, with mild basophilia at diagnosis. After a median follow-up of 43 months (0-309 months), two patients in the bcr-abl-negative group developed Ph and bcr-abl-negative acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In contrast, one of the two patients in the bcr-abl-positive group died from AML 13 years after diagnosis. In conclusion, our data on a large group of patients shows the rarity of the bcr-abl transcript in well-established ET. However, a subset of patients with apparent ET and basophilia may express the transcript and may constitute a novel entity intermediate between chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and typical ET. A prospective study is warranted in order to define better the clinical and biological characteristics of bcr-abl-expressing ET.","['Damaj, G', 'Delabesse, E', 'Le Bihan, C', 'Asnafi, V', 'Rachid, M', 'Lefrere, F', 'Radford-Weiss, I', 'Macintyre, E', 'Hermine, O', 'Varet, B']","['Damaj G', 'Delabesse E', 'Le Bihan C', 'Asnafi V', 'Rachid M', 'Lefrere F', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Macintyre E', 'Hermine O', 'Varet B']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Departement de Biostatistique et d'Informatique Medicale, and Laboratoire de Cytogenetique, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France. damajg@marseille.fnclcc.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Basophils/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*etiology/immunology']",,2002/03/12 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/03/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Mar;116(4):812-6. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-1048.2002.03343.x.,,25,"['3343 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-1048.2002.03343.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a recently developed two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect 10 fg of Aspergillus DNA, corresponding to 1-5 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml of spiked samples in vitro, we prospectively examined 197 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 176 subjects, including 141 neutropenic, febrile patients with lung infiltrates, at risk for invasive fungal disease. Underlying diseases of these patients were haematological malignancies; 93 patients suffered from acute leukaemias.

Six patients (4.3%) of this group had positive PCR results without any correlation to clinical or other diagnostic data, probably owing to contamination of the samples by ubiquitous Aspergillus spores. The samples of two patients (1.4%) with a subsequent histologically proven mould infection were PCR negative. All 102 immunocompromised patients (72.3%) with a negative PCR showed no evidence of invasive fungal disease. From 35 patients without immunodeficiency, four (11.4%) showed positive results, without evidence of invasive or non-invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. In this haematological population, the sensitivity and specificity values of the test reached 93.9% and 94.4%, the positive predictive value 83.8%, the negative predictive value 98.1%.

There is evidence in the literature that increasing the dose of chlorambucil produces better results than 'standard' doses in terms of response rates and overall survival. There is also evidence that this approach may be at least as effective as the use of fludarabine, as well as being very much less expensive. We describe a high-dose chlorambucil (HDC) regimen, which involves a sustained but intermittent dose of chlorambucil, i.e. 30 mg/d for 4 d per week for 4 weeks, followed by a further four courses at fortnightly intervals for 8 weeks (a total of eight 4-d courses) given as a single drug over an initial 12-week period.

On the molecular level, the MLL gene on 11q23 is fused to the AF4 gene in the 4q21 region, resulting in a chimaeric MLL/AF4 fusion transcript. These particular chromosome rearrangements are generally considered to be associated with poor prognosis, and therefore accurate detection at diagnosis is of clinical significance. In this study we developed a highly specific dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for the detection of the t(4;11) and demonstrate its usefulness for interphase molecular cytogenetics. In our approach, differentially labelled genomic clones that span the breakpoint cluster regions of both genes involved in the specific translocation were used. Thus, t(4;11)-positive nuclei will display two fusion signals and for t(4;11) cases with concurrent 3' MLL deletions only one fusion signal will be displayed. A very low false-positive value of less than 0.1% was obtained for interphase cells with two fusion signals. In contrast, in cases with 3' MLL deletions that display only one fusion signal, the rate of false-positive nuclei was 10.4%. This FISH assay enables the screening of larger series of patients with haematological diseases for t(4;11) translocations and allows the unambiguous detection of associated cryptic deletions.","['Konig, Margit', 'Reichel, Martin', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Strehl, Sabine']","['Konig M', 'Reichel M', 'Marschalek R', 'Haas OA', 'Strehl S']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St. Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"[""3' Flanking Region"", 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Interphase', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/03/12 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/03/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Mar;116(4):758-64. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-1048.2002.03340.x.,,,"['3340 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-1048.2002.03340.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genomes of some retroviruses contain sequences that could lead to self-priming of their minus signsssDNA. Self-priming was prevented by annealing a DNA oligonucleotide to the 3' end of model DNAs that corresponded to the 3' ends of the -sssDNAs (-R ssDNA) from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), type 2 (HIV-2), and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) but nonspecific strand transfer to ssDNA molecules in solution was induced in vitro (Golinelli and Hughes, 2001). This nonspecific strand transfer involved the addition of a nontemplated base to the 3' end of -R ssDNAs that was part of a blunt-ended duplex. In the case of HIV-2 -R ssDNA, A and C were added more efficiently than G and T. Strand transfer to ssDNA in solution occurred only if the nontemplated base could form a basepair with the last base at the 3' end of the ssDNA. If there was a mismatch, strand transfer did not occur. There was no detectable strand transfer to internal sites in the target ssDNA except to the second position from the 3' end of the DNA acceptor when the sequences at the 3' ends of the two DNAs allowed the formation of two basepairs. The nontemplated base addition and the one-basepair strand transfer were both affected by the salt concentration in the reaction, the nature of the reverse transcriptase (HIV-1 versus Moloney murine leukemia virus), and the sequence at the 3' end of -R ssDNA. NC reduced the efficiency of nonspecific strand transfer in vitro, suggesting that NC may have a role in reducing nonspecific strand transfer in vivo.","['Golinelli, Marie-Pierre', 'Hughes, Stephen H']","['Golinelli MP', 'Hughes SH']","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, NCI-Frederick, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/enzymology/genetics', 'HIV-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleocapsid/metabolism', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",,2002/03/12 10:00,2002/04/18 10:01,['2002/03/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Mar 1;294(1):122-34. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1322.,,,"['10.1006/viro.2001.1322 [doi]', 'S0042682201913224 [pii]']",['(C)2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here report that infection of newborn NIH Swiss mice gives rise to EGFP expression in a majority of spleen cells within the first days after infection. Among the nonadherent spleen cells, B, T, and NK lymphocytes were found to be efficiently marked by EGFP by flow cytometry analysis, whereas the adherent spleen cells were negative in most animals. Analysis at time points up to 60 days after infection reveals a decline in EGFP-positive spleen cells over time. Viremia analysis and PCR analysis of spleen DNA indicate that viruses that have lost the translation cassette predominate at later stages. The results provide a model for efficient gene delivery to spleen cells in a time window of 1 to 2 weeks after infection of newborns. Although this type of vector will not in itself be applicable in the clinic, we envision that efficient in vivo gene delivery will be valuable by analysis of differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells in animal models and by development and evaluation of effectors interfering with these processes.","['Bachrach, Estanislao', 'Pelegrin, Mireia', 'Piechaczyk, Marc', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou', 'Duch, Mogens']","['Bachrach E', 'Pelegrin M', 'Piechaczyk M', 'Pedersen FS', 'Duch M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, UMR 5535/IFR24, CNRS, 1919, Route de Mende, 34293 Montpellier Cedex 05, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Count', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Spleen/immunology/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2002/03/12 10:00,2002/05/02 10:01,['2002/03/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Feb 15;293(2):328-34. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1284.,,,"['10.1006/viro.2001.1284 [doi]', 'S004268220191284X [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we reexamined this issue by applying two approaches previously demonstrated to amplify murine leukemia virus neurovirulence. The first approach involved introducing the 4070A env gene into the background of Friend virus clone FB29 to enhance peripheral virus replication kinetics and central nervous system entry. The resulting chimeric virus, FrAmE, exhibited widespread vascular infection throughout the central nervous system (CNS); however, parenchymal infection was quite limited. Neither clinical neurological signs nor spongiform neurological changes accompanied FrAmE CNS infection. To overcome this CNS entry limitation, 4070A and FrAmE were delivered directly into the CNS via transplantation of infected C17.2 neural stem cells (NSCs). Significantly, NSC dissemination of either 4070A or FrAmE resulted in widespread, high-level amphotropic virus expression within the CNS parenchyma, including the infection of microglia, the critical target required for inducing neurodegeneration. Despite the extensive CNS infection, no associated clinical neurological signs or acute neuropathological changes were observed. Interestingly, we observed the frequent appearance of circulating polytropic (MCF) virus in the serum of amphotropic virus-infected animals. However, neither peripheral inoculation of an amphotropic/MCF virus mixture nor transplantation of NSCs expressing both amphotropic and MCF viruses induced acute clinical neurological signs or spongiform neuropathology. Thus, the results generated in this study suggest that the 4070A env gene is not inherently neurovirulent. However, the frequent appearance of endogenous MCF viruses suggests the possibility that the interactions of amphotropic viruses with endogenous retroviral elements could contribute to the development of retrovirus-induced neurodegenerative disease.","['Traister, Russell S', 'Lynch, William P']","['Traister RS', 'Lynch WP']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, 4209 State Route 44, Rootstown, Ohio 44272, USA.']",['eng'],['1 R29 NS37614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Line', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*pathology/virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microglia/pathology/virology', '*Reassortant Viruses/pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*pathology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Viremia', 'Virulence']",,2002/03/12 10:00,2002/05/02 10:01,['2002/03/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Feb 15;293(2):262-72. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1299.,,,"['10.1006/viro.2001.1299 [doi]', 'S0042682201912991 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Following a nested case-control study, we used the data of 7 leukemia deaths in 1973-1997 and 28 controls matched for sex and age from the same cohort of a rubber plant. Leukemia risks due to exposure to rubber were assessed, unadjusted and adjusted for non-occupational factors by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: OR for leukemia was found to be 7.81 (95% CI = 0.77-78) in grouped analysis for one or more years of work in the inner tire tube department. The models for continuous exposure variables indicated that working for one year in the inner tire tube department was associated with a 10 percent increment in the OR (95% CI = 1.00-1.24; score test for linear trend: chi 1(2) = 6.27, P = 0.012). The confounding effects studied could not be ruled out for the excess risks. No excess risk was found in the remaining four departments. CONCLUSIONS: Because of widespread exposure to various carcinogens in the process of making inner tire tubes, removal of a single agent (benzene) may not eliminate the risk of leukemia in the entire industry.","['Li, Ke', 'Yu, Shunzhang']","['Li K', 'Yu S']","['Preventive Branch, Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, 515031, P.R. of China. kli@stu.edu.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int J Hyg Environ Health,International journal of hygiene and environmental health,100898843,"['0 (Solvents)', '9006-04-6 (Rubber)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Leukemia/*etiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Odds Ratio', 'Rubber/*adverse effects', 'Solvents/*adverse effects']",,2002/03/12 10:00,2002/08/21 10:01,['2002/03/12 10:00'],"['2002/03/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hyg Environ Health. 2002 Feb;204(5-6):317-21. doi: 10.1078/1438-4639-00104.,,,['10.1078/1438-4639-00104 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are only very few data about non-surgical treatment in immunocompetent patients. METHODS: We evaluated 30 patients (19 male/11 female; mean age: 54 years) with pulmonary aspergillosis, their symptoms, treatment and outcome during a time period of 9 years. All patients had either definitive (18/60 %) or probable (12/40 %) aspergillosis with a cultural confirmation. RESULTS: Underlying diseases were tuberculosis (16/53 %), malignancy (8/30 %), COPD (15/50 %), pneumonia (3/10 %). Only five patients were immunocompromised (steroid medication: n = 4, chronic lymphatic leukemia: n = 1) All patients had a contraindication against surgery, 26 received antifungal treatment (mostly with voriconazole or itraconazole). The overall response was 61 %, there was an improvement of radiological signs in seven (23 %). Especially hemoptysis and dyspnea resolved. 12 patients died during the 9 years (40 %), nine from their underlying disease, three from the pulmonary aspergilloses (hemoptysis: n = 2, secondary invasive aspergillosis: n = 1). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary aspergilloma in its chronic form is a disease of patients with pulmonary disease but who are immunocompetent. Antifungal treatment seems to be a therapeutic option, if surgery is not possible.","['Grysczyk, H', 'De Roux, A', 'Grassot, A', 'Mauch, H', 'Lode, H']","['Grysczyk H', 'De Roux A', 'Grassot A', 'Mauch H', 'Lode H']","['Abteilung fur Pneumologie und Infektiologie, Lungenklinik Heckeshorn, Zentralklinik Emil von Behrin, Germany. haloheck@zedat.fu-berlin.de']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis, Allergic Bronchopulmonary/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Itraconazole/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole']",,2002/03/09 10:00,2002/04/19 10:01,['2002/03/09 10:00'],"['2002/03/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2002 Mar 8;127(10):492-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-20940.,Antimykotische Therapie pulmonaler Aspergillome bei nicht neutropenischen Patienten.,,['10.1055/s-2002-20940 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interaction partners so far identified are either transcription factors or proteins that can support or counteract apoptosis. Thus, Dlk might be involved in regulating transcription or, more generally, survival or apoptosis. Here we report on a new interaction partner, the rat homolog of Schizosaccharomyces pombe CDC5 protein, a presumptive transcription and splicing factor involved in the G(2)/M transition. In vitro, rat CDC5 forms complexes with, but is not phosphorylated by, Dlk. Rather, it was phosphorylated by an associated kinase which was identified as CK2. The interaction domain of Dlk was mapped to the leucine zipper, while that of CDC5 was mapped to the C-terminal region between residues 500 and 802. In vivo, both proteins co-localize perfectly in distinct speckle-like structures in the nucleus, some of which overlap with promyelocytic leukemia protein. Interestingly, splicing factor SC35, which also resides in speckles, was partially displaced upon overexpression of either CDC5 or Dlk, perhaps due to phosphorylation by Dlk. Together with previous data, these results suggest that Dlk might play a role in coordinating specific transcription and splicing events.","['Engemann, Harry', 'Heinzel, Volker', 'Page, Grit', 'Preuss, Ute', 'Scheidtmann, Karl Heinz']","['Engemann H', 'Heinzel V', 'Page G', 'Preuss U', 'Scheidtmann KH']","['Institute of Genetics, University of Bonn, Roemerstrasse 164, D-53117 Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (cdc5 protein, S pombe)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 12)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'G2 Phase', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Localization Signals', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Rats', '*Ribonucleoproteins', 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",PMC101352,2002/03/09 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/03/09 10:00'],"['2002/03/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2002 Mar 15;30(6):1408-17. doi: 10.1093/nar/30.6.1408.,,,['10.1093/nar/30.6.1408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the importance of hnRNP A1 as a regulator of nuclear pre-mRNA and mRNA processing and export is well established, it is unknown whether this is relevant for the control of proliferation, survival, and differentiation of normal and transformed cells. We show here that hnRNP A1 levels are increased in myeloid progenitor cells expressing the p210(BCR/ABL) oncoprotein, in mononuclear cells from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis patients, and during disease progression. In addition, in myeloid progenitor 32Dcl3 cells, BCR/ABL stabilizes hnRNP A1 by preventing its ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation. To assess the potential role of hnRNP A1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling activity in normal and leukemic myelopoiesis, a mutant defective in nuclear export was ectopically expressed in parental and BCR/ABL-transformed myeloid precursor 32Dcl3 cells, in normal murine marrow cells, and in mononuclear cells from a CML patient in accelerated phase. In normal cells, expression of this mutant enhanced the susceptibility to apoptosis induced by interleukin-3 deprivation, suppressed granulocytic differentiation, and induced massive cell death of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-treated cultures. In BCR/ABL-transformed cells, its expression was associated with suppression of colony formation and reduced tumorigenic potential in vivo. Moreover, interference with hnRNP A1 shuttling activity resulted in downmodulation of C/EBPalpha, the major regulator of granulocytic differentiation, and Bcl-X(L), an important survival factor for hematopoietic cells. Together, these results suggest that the shuttling activity of hnRNP A1 is important for the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of mRNAs that encode proteins influencing the phenotype of normal and BCR/ABL-transformed myeloid progenitors.","['Iervolino, Angela', 'Santilli, Giorgia', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Guerzoni, Clara', 'Cesi, Vincenzo', 'Bergamaschi, Anna', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Calabretta, Bruno', 'Perrotti, Danilo']","['Iervolino A', 'Santilli G', 'Trotta R', 'Guerzoni C', 'Cesi V', 'Bergamaschi A', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Calabretta B', 'Perrotti D']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA009662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA09662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein A1', '*Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein Group A-B', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', '*Leukopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",PMC133663,2002/03/09 10:00,2002/04/04 10:01,['2002/03/09 10:00'],"['2002/03/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Apr;22(7):2255-66. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.7.2255-2266.2002.,,,['10.1128/MCB.22.7.2255-2266.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now find that HA95 and EBNA-LP are highly associated in LCLs and in B-lymphoma cells where EBNA-LP is expressed by gene transfer. Binding was also evident in yeast two-hybrid assays. HA95 binds to the EBNA-LP repeat domain that is the principal coactivator of transcription. EBNA-LP localizes with HA95 and causes HA95 to partially relocalize with EBNA-LP in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Protein kinase A catalytic subunit alpha (PKAcsalpha) is significantly associated with HA95 in the presence or absence of EBNA-LP. Although EBNA-LP is not a PKA substrate, HA95 or PKAcsalpha expression in B lymphoblasts specifically down-regulates the strong coactivating effects of EBNA-LP. The inhibitory effects of PKAcsalpha are reversed by coexpression of protein kinase inhibitor. PKAcsalpha also inhibits EBNA-LP coactivation with the EBNA-2 acidic domain fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Furthermore, EBNA-LP- and EBNA-2-induced expression of the EBV oncogene, LMP1, is down-regulated by PKAcsalpha or HA95 expression in EBV-infected lymphoblasts.

Previously, relatively large (>100 residues) protein ligands to cell surface receptors have been inserted at or near the N terminus of retroviral envelope proteins. Although viral tropism could be altered, the chimeric envelope proteins lacked full activity, and coexpression of wild-type envelope was required for production of transducing virus. Here we analyze more than 40 derivatives of ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope, containing insertions of short RGD-containing peptides, which are ligands for integrin receptors. In many cases pseudotyped viruses containing only the chimeric envelope protein could transduce human cells. The precise location, size, and flanking sequences of the ligand affected transduction specificity and efficiency.

To establish infection, HTLV-1 must activate targeted T cells during early stages of infection. We recently demonstrated that the HTLV-1 accessory protein p12(I) is critical for persistent infection in vivo and for viral infectivity in quiescent primary lymphocytes, suggesting a role for p12(I) in lymphocyte activation. To test whether p12(I) modulates signaling pathways required for T-lymphocyte activation, we examined AP-1-, NF-kappaB-, and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-driven reporter gene activity in p12(I)-expressing Jurkat T cells compared to vector-transfected control cells. HTLV-1 p12(I) specifically induced NFAT-mediated transcription approximately 20-fold in synergy with the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but did not influence AP-1- or NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression. Inhibition of calcium-dependent signals by cyclosporin A, BAPTA-AM [glycine, N,N'-1,2-ethanediylbis(oxy-2,1-phenylene)-bis-N-2-(acetyloxy)methoxy-2-oxoethyl]- [bis(acetyloxy)methyl ester], and a dominant negative mutant of NFAT2 abolished the p12(I)-mediated activation of NFAT-dependent transcription. In contrast, inhibition of phospholipase C-gamma and LAT (linker for activation of T cells) did not affect p12(I)-induced NFAT activity. Importantly, p12(I) functionally substituted for thapsigargin, which selectively depletes intracellular calcium stores. Our data are the first to demonstrate a role for HTLV-1 p12(I) in calcium-dependent activation of NFAT-mediated transcription in lymphoid cells. We propose a novel mechanism by which HTLV-1, a virus associated with lymphoproliferative disease, dysregulates common T-cell activation pathways critical for the virus to establish persistent infection.","['Albrecht, Bjorn', ""D'Souza, Celine D"", 'Ding, Wei', 'Tridandapani, Susheela', 'Coggeshall, K Mark', 'Lairmore, Michael D']","['Albrecht B', ""D'Souza CD"", 'Ding W', 'Tridandapani S', 'Coggeshall KM', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research and Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Medicine and Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 RR014324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-70529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K02 AI01474/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/virology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",PMC136046,2002/03/09 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/03/09 10:00'],"['2002/03/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Apr;76(7):3493-501. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.7.3493-3501.2002.,,,['10.1128/jvi.76.7.3493-3501.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, one recent study has demonstrated that the murine leukemia virus Pol can be incorporated into virions independently of Gag-Pol expression, implying a possible interaction between the Pol and Gag precursor. To test whether the HIV-1 Pol can be incorporated into virions on removal of the N-terminal Gag domain and to define sequences required for the incorporation of Gag-Pol into virions in more detail, a series of HIV Gag-Pol expression plasmids with various extensive deletions in the region upstream of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain was constructed, and viral incorporation of the Gag-Pol deletion mutants was examined by cotransfecting 293T cells with a plasmid expressing Pr55(gag). Analysis indicated that deletion of the N-terminal two-thirds of the gag coding region did not significantly affect the incorporation of Gag-Pol into virions. In contrast, Gag-Pol proteins with deletions covering the capsid (CA) major homology regions and the adjacent C-terminal CA regions were impaired with respect to assembly into virions. However, Gag-Pol with sequences deleted upstream of the protease, or of the RT domain but retaining 15 N-terminal gag codons, could still be rescued into virions at a level about 20% of the wild-type level.

For certain viruses, this dimerization has been shown to depend on a unique RNA stem-loop locus, called the dimer initiation site (DIS), that efficiently homodimerizes through a palindromic base sequence in its loop. Previous studies with Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) identified two alternative DIS loci that can each independently support RNA dimerization in vitro but whose relative contributions are unknown. We now report that both of these loci contribute to the assembly of the Mo-MuLV dimer. Using targeted deletions, point mutagenesis, and antisense oligonucleotides, we found that each of the two stem-loops forms as predicted and contributes independently to dimerization in vitro through a mechanism involving autocomplementary interactions of its loop. Disruption of either DIS locus individually reduced both the yield and the thermal stability of the in vitro dimers, whereas disruption of both eliminated dimerization altogether. Similarly, the thermal stability of virion-derived dimers was impaired by deletion of both DIS elements, and point mutations in either element produced defects in viral replication that correlated with their effects on in vitro RNA dimerization. These findings support the view that in some retroviruses, dimer initiation and stability involve two or more closely linked DIS loci which together align the nascent dimer strands in parallel and in register.","['Ly, Hinh', 'Parslow, Tristram G']","['Ly H', 'Parslow TG']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143-0511, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 AI007395/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI37036/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI40317/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI040317/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI07395/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Deletion', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry', '*Virus Assembly']",PMC136039,2002/03/09 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/03/09 10:00'],"['2002/03/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Apr;76(7):3135-44. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.7.3135-3144.2002.,,,['10.1128/jvi.76.7.3135-3144.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In sharp contrast, spontaneous virus-expressing AKR.H-2(b) congenic mice are low/nonresponders for the generation of AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL. Furthermore, when viable AKR.H-2(b) spleen cells are cocultured with primed responder B6 antiviral precursor CTL, the AKR.H-2(b) cells function as ""veto"" cells that actively mediate the inhibition of antiviral CTL generation. AKR.H-2(b) veto cell inhibition is virus specific, MHC restricted, contact dependent, and mediated through veto cell Fas ligand/responder T cell Fas interactions. In this study, following specific priming and secondary in vitro restimulation, antiretroviral CD8(+) CTL were identified by a labeled K(b)/KSPWFTTL tetramer and flow cytometry, enabling direct visualization of AKR.H-2(b) veto cell-mediated depletion of these CTL. A 65-93% reduction in the number of B6 K(b)/KSPWFTTL tetramer(+) CTL correlated with a similar reduction in antiviral CTL cytotoxicity. Addition on sequential days to the antiviral CTL restimulation cultures of either 1) AKR.H-2(b) veto cells or 2) a blocking Fas-Ig fusion protein (to cultures also containing AKR.H-2(b) veto cells) to block inhibition demonstrated that AKR.H-2(b) veto cells begin to inhibit B6 precursor CTL/CTL expansion during days 2 and 3 of the 6-day culture. Shortly thereafter, a high percentage of B6 tetramer(+) CTL cocultured with AKR.H-2(b) veto cells was annexin V positive and Fas(high), indicating apoptosis as the mechanism of veto cell inhibition. Experiments using the irreversible inhibitor emetine demonstrated that AKR.H-2(b) cells had to be metabolically active and capable of protein synthesis to function as veto cells. Of the tetramer-positive CTL that survived veto cell-mediated apoptosis, there was no marked skewing from the preferential usage of Vbeta4, 8.1/8.2, and 11 TCR normally observed. These findings provide further insight into the complexity of host/virus interactions and suggest a fail-safe escape mechanism by virus-infected cells for epitopes residing in critical areas of viral proteins that cannot accommodate variations of amino acid sequence.","['Rich, Robert F', 'Green, William R']","['Rich RF', 'Green WR']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and The Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, NH 03756, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA-23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82755/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/growth & development/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Clonal Deletion', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/analysis/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'H-2 Antigens/*analysis', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology']",,2002/03/09 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/03/09 10:00'],"['2002/03/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Mar 15;168(6):2751-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.6.2751.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.168.6.2751 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the kinetics of IL-6, IL-11, oncostatinM (OSM) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induction in the splenocytes of tumour-bearing mice. Using a lung carcinoma line, which grows in C57BL/6J mice, we observed that when the tumour grew and cachexia was observed, the splenocytes produced IL-6, IL-11, and OSM, but not LIF. Cytokine expression was observed within 1 week (day 3 for IL-6 and IL-11, and day 1 for OSM) of administration of tumour cells, and was observed in splenocytes without tumour metastases to the spleen. Cytokine expression preceded cachexia (determined by changes in serum triglyceride levels and decrease in epididymal fat-pad weights) development by over 1 week. Exogenous administration of IL-11 resulted in the accelerated onset of cachexia, compared to control protein treatment, but without an effect on the tumour burden. In vivo treatment with a neutralizing dose of anti-OSM antibody inhibited the triglyceride dysregulation only until the synthesis of IL-6 and IL-11 began in the spleen (day 3).

Formed syncytium numbers were reduced less than 1/20 when these cells were treated with 10 units/ml of rbIFN-gamma. However, the antiviral effects on cells of heterologous species were decreased and more than 1000 units/ml of rbIFN-gamma were required to induce an anti-BLV effect on the combination of CC81 cells as target cells and Bat2Cl6 cells as effector cells, which originated from the cat and bat, respectively. When the degree of BLV production was estimated by reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, no antiviral effect of rbIFN-gamma was induced soon after the treatment, but it was evident in the cells persistently infected with BLV.

Consequently, their integration allows passage of the transgene to all progeny cells, which makes them particularly suitable for stem cell transduction. However, a disadvantage of oncoretroviral vectors based on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) is that cell division is required for transduction and integration, thereby limiting oncoretroviral-mediated gene therapy to actively dividing target cells. In contrast, lentiviral vectors can transduce both dividing and nondividing cells. Lentiviral vectors have been derived from either human or primate lentiviruses, with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as prototype, or from nonprimate lentiviruses, such as the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). The ability to pseudotype oncoretroviral and lentiviral vectors with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G) allowed for the production of high-titer vectors (10(9)-10(10) transducing units/ml). These high-titer vector preparations were shown to effectively cure genetic diseases in experimental animal models and constitute an essential step toward direct in vivo gene therapy applications.

Detection of occult micrometastases in lymph nodes by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA in non-small cell lung cancer has not been reported. Detection of occult micrometastases by standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction provides only yes or no answers about their presence, whereas quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction permits reproducible quantitation of target molecules. This study evaluated the ability of quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to quantitate lymph node occult metastases with carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA as a tumor marker. METHODS: Standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA were performed on 232 lymph nodes from 53 patients with stage I disease (node negative according to histologic examination). Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction determined carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA quantity by detecting fluorescence increase at a threshold polymerase chain reaction cycle. Threshold polymerase chain reaction cycle values were correlated with standard curves created from serially diluted carcinoembryonic antigen-positive HTB-174 tumor cells to estimate the number of micrometastatic tumor cells in a lymph node. RESULTS: Detection rates of occult metastases were similar for standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at 38 of 232 (16.4 %) and 59 of 232 (25.4 %), respectively. Upstaging rates among 53 cases of stage I non-small cell lung cancer were also similar for standard reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at 23 of 53 (43.4 %) and 30 of 53 (56.6%), respectively. Comparison of positive lymph node stations according to quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (threshold polymerase chain reaction cycle <45) with HTB-174 tumor cell standard curves yielded estimates of metastatic tumor cell burden of 1.07 x 10(3)to 3.24 x 10(5)cells per lymph node station (median 7190 tumor cells per lymph node station). CONCLUSIONS: Standard and quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for carcinoembryonic antigen detected occult metastases in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer at similar rates; both upstaged about 50% of cases. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction allows estimation of the number of metastatic cells per lymph node, however, which potentially allows greater precision in predicting recurrence risk.","[""D'Cunha, Jonathan"", 'Corfits, Angela L', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Kern, Jeffrey A', 'Kohman, Leslie J', 'Patterson, G Alexander', 'Kratzke, Robert A', 'Maddaus, Michael A']","[""D'Cunha J"", 'Corfits AL', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Kern JA', 'Kohman LJ', 'Patterson GA', 'Kratzke RA', 'Maddaus MA']","['Division of Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, University of Minnesota Medical School, 420 Delaware Street, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,"['0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/03/08 10:00,2002/04/27 10:01,['2002/03/08 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 2002 Mar;123(3):484-91; discussion 491. doi: 10.1067/mtc.2002.119883.,,,"['S0022522302940559 [pii]', '10.1067/mtc.2002.119883 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In laboratory animals treated with various environmental chemicals, inhibition of NQO1 metabolism has long been known to increase the risk of toxicity or cancer. Currently, there are 22 reported single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NQO1 gene. Compared with the human consensus (reference, ""wild-type"") NQO1*1 allele coding for normal NQO1 enzyme and activity, the NQO1*2 allele encodes a nonsynonymous mutation (P187S) that has negligible NQO1 activity. The NQO1*2 allelic frequency ranges between 0.22 (Caucasian) and 0.45 (Asian) in various ethnic populations. A large epidemiologic investigation of a benzene-exposed population has shown that NQO1*2 homozygotes exhibit as much as a 7-fold greater risk of bone marrow toxicity, leading to diseases such as aplastic anemia and leukemia. The extent of the contribution of polymorphisms in other genes involved in the metabolism of benzene and related compounds-such as the P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM1, GSTT1), microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1), and other genes-should also be considered. However, it now seems clear that a lowered or absent NQO1 activity can increase one's risk of bone marrow toxicity, after environmental exposure to benzene and benzene-like compounds. In cancer patients, the NQO1*2 allele appears to be associated with increased risk of chemotherapy-related myeloid leukemia. Many other epidemiological studies, attempting to find an association between the NQO1 polymorphism and one or another human disease, have now begun to appear in the medical literature.","['Nebert, Daniel W', 'Roe, Amy L', 'Vandale, Susan E', 'Bingham, Eula', 'Oakley, Gregory G']","['Nebert DW', 'Roe AL', 'Vandale SE', 'Bingham E', 'Oakley GG']","['Department of Environmental Health, Center for Environmental Genetics, University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Ohio 45267-0056, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 ES06096/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Genet Med,Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics,9815831,"['EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/enzymology/*genetics', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetics, Population', 'Humans', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",,2002/03/08 10:00,2002/06/28 10:01,['2002/03/08 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genet Med. 2002 Mar-Apr;4(2):62-70. doi: 10.1097/00125817-200203000-00003.,,59,['10.1097/00125817-200203000-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pipette solutions containing 10 mM BAPTA and no added ATP induced both currents in the same cell, but the time to half-maximal activation for MagNuM was about two to three times slower than that of I(CRAC). Differential suppression of I(CRAC) was achieved by buffering free [Ca(2+)](i) to 90 nM and selective inhibition of MagNuM was accomplished by intracellular solutions containing 6 mM Mg.ATP, 1.2 mM free [Mg(2+)](i) or 100 microM GTP-gamma-S, allowing investigations on these currents in relative isolation. Removal of extracellular Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) caused both currents to be carried significantly by monovalent ions. In the absence or presence of free [Mg(2+)](i), I(CRAC) carried by monovalent ions inactivated more rapidly and more completely than MagNuM carried by monovalent ions. Since several studies have used divalent-free solutions on either side of the membrane to study selectivity and single-channel behaviour of I(CRAC), these experimental conditions would have favoured the contribution of MagNuM to monovalent conductance and call for caution in interpreting results where both I(CRAC) and MagNuM are activated.","['Hermosura, Meredith C', 'Monteilh-Zoller, Mahealani K', 'Scharenberg, Andrew M', 'Penner, Reinhold', 'Fleig, Andrea']","['Hermosura MC', 'Monteilh-Zoller MK', 'Scharenberg AM', 'Penner R', 'Fleig A']","[""Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Signaling, Center for Biomedical Research at The Queen's Medical Center and John A.

In the human cell line (SH-SY5Y), STAT1 and STAT3 activation by CNTF-like cytokines showed tyrosine phosphorylation peaking at 0.5 h and inactivating within 2 h. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Jak1 and Jak2 showed a similar time course of activation and inactivation in response to CNTF. The STAT1 response to the non-CNTF-like cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did not inactivate. Inactivation to CNTF was not due to a decrease in CNTF receptor subunit gp130 or in levels of Jak1 or Jak2. STAT inactivation was inhibited by the protein kinase blocker H7 and a tyrosine phosphatase blocker, but not by inhibitors of protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, mTOR-P70/S6 kinase or phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase (PI-3 kinase). Surprisingly, CNTF caused only a minor increase in levels of suppressors of cytokine signalling, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3. CNTF pretreatment desensitized the cells to the CNTF-like cytokines, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin-M but not to IFN-gamma. These results reveal a complex level of regulation of shared signalling pathways for cytokines that is dependent on both the type of cell and cytokine.","['Kaur, Navjot', 'Wohlhueter, Ann L', 'Halvorsen, Stanley W']","['Kaur N', 'Wohlhueter AL', 'Halvorsen SW']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, 102 Faber Hall, University at Buffalo, The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY 14214-3000, USA.']",['eng'],['NS30232/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/03/08 10:00,2002/07/03 10:01,['2002/03/08 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2002 May;14(5):419-29. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(01)00280-7.,,,"['S0898656801002807 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(01)00280-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 33-year-old female HIV(+), HCV(+) in complete remission after standard chemotherapy was submitted to CD34(+) selected allogeneic transplantation from her HLA-identical HIV(-) brother after myeloablative regimen. HAART was started before transplantation, achieving a reduction of HIV load to undetectable levels. GVHD prophylaxis was carried out with cyclosporine A alone. RESULTS: The patient achieved prompt and durable engraftment with acute GVHD grade II easily managed with steroids; CMV prophylaxis was prolonged, no clinically relevant infectious complications developed early after transplantation and during follow-up. HIV viremia was controlled by HAART although medication adherence was reduced early after transplantation and required drug adjustment. There was a gradual recovery of immune cells with normal CD4-cell count 39 months after engraftment, a significantly higher level than before transplantation. At 39 months post-transplantation follow-up the patient is alive and in continuous complete remission with undetectable levels of plasma HIV RNA on HAART. CONCLUSION: The introduction of HAART has recently changed the paradigm of AIDS, allowing the control of HIV replication, the reduction of opportunistic infections, and the overall improvement of survival. One may therefore reconsider the current exclusion of patients with AIDS and a concomitant lethal malignancy from programs of high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation, as suggested by this report.","['Sora, Federica', 'Antinori, Andrea', 'Piccirillo, Nicola', 'De Luca, Andrea', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Cingolani, Antonella', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Rutella, Sergio', 'Ortona, Luigi', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Sica, Simona']","['Sora F', 'Antinori A', 'Piccirillo N', 'De Luca A', 'Chiusolo P', 'Cingolani A', 'Laurenti L', 'Rutella S', 'Ortona L', 'Leone G', 'Sica S']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', '*Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'HIV/genetics', 'HIV Infections/complications/immunology/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Hepatitis C/complications/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/immunology/*therapy', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Viremia/prevention & control']",,2002/03/08 10:00,2002/05/04 10:01,['2002/03/08 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Mar;30(3):279-84. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00793-7.,,,"['S0301472X01007937 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00793-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In hematopoietic and epithelial cells, activation of STAT 1 induces apoptosis and growth arrest, whereas activation of STAT3 and STAT5 transduces growth-promoting signals. We and others have previously described a high expression and constitutive activation of STAT1, 3, and 5 in AML blasts. In this report we focused on the mechanisms and also the biologic relevance of STAT activation in AML.Results. RESULTS: We report here that a constitutive STAT activation can be detected in up to 95% of primary AML blasts. In vitro, neither induction of the leukemic fusion protein PML-RAR alpha in U937 cells nor expression of transforming ras-mutants, but several leukemic protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), strongly induced activation of STAT3 and 5. Stable transfection of BA/F3 cells with TEL-JAK2, TEL-ABL, and BCR-ABL resulted in IL-3 independent growth and strong activation of STAT3 and STAT5 by TEL-JAK2 and TEL-ABL, but not by BCR-ABL. In addition, expression of constitutive active mutants of STAT3 and STAT5 alone were sufficient to transform BA/F3 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that STAT3 and STAT5 are activated in the majority of primary AML blasts and are major targets of leukemic fusion proteins with PTK activity. However, the STAT activation pattern by leukemic PTKs differed significantly and might reflect their transforming potential in acute (TEL-JAK2 and TEL-ABL) and chronic leukemias (p210BCR-ABL). The transforming capacity of constitutively activated STAT3 and STAT5 mutants strongly supports their fundamental role in the process of malignant transformation in hematopoietic cells.","['Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Pau, Michael', 'Schwab, Ruth', 'Schmieja, Karin', 'Franzrahe, Sabine', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang']","['Spiekermann K', 'Pau M', 'Schwab R', 'Schmieja K', 'Franzrahe S', 'Hiddemann W']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, LMU and GSF, Clinical Cooperative Group Leukemia, Munich, Germany. k.spiekermann@gmx.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (TEL-ABL fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2002/03/08 10:00,2002/05/04 10:01,['2002/03/08 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Mar;30(3):262-71. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00787-1.,,,"['S0301472X01007871 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00787-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a patient with multiple myeloma who underwent a B-cell leukemic blast transformation, using the immunoglobulin molecular signature, we characterized the clonal relationship to autologous plasma cells and the impact on normal polyclonal B-lymphocyte populations. METHODS: Single-cell reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/PCR was used to determine the clonal relationship between autologous MM plasma cells and leukemic B cells. A murine xenograft model was used to determine the myelomagenic potential of the leukemic B cells. RESULTS: Single-cell analysis showed that circulating leukemic-phase cells were clonotypic, with an IgH VDJ sequence identical to that of diagnosis plasma cells. Analysis of IgH transcripts indicates MM clonal dominance over normal B-cell components of the immune system at diagnosis and during leukemic disease. Leukemic B cells were xenografted to irradiated NOD/SCID mice, leading to lytic bone lesions and clonotypic cells in murine BM. Although human cells in murine BM expressed CD138, a marker largely absent from ex vivo leukemic cells, the expression of CD45, CD19, and CD20 confirmed that engrafting cells were mature, probably late-stage B cells rather than plasma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic B cells are able to exert strong clonal dominance over normal components of the immune system, colonize the murine BM in a xenograft model, and disrupt normal bone metabolism leading to lytic bone lesions. This supports the hypothesis that clonotypic MM B cells are reservoirs of disease that persist throughout therapy and give rise to relapse.","['Pilarski, Linda M', 'Seeberger, Karen', 'Coupland, Robert W', 'Eshpeter, Alana', 'Keats, Jonathan J', 'Taylor, Brian J', 'Belch, Andrew R']","['Pilarski LM', 'Seeberger K', 'Coupland RW', 'Eshpeter A', 'Keats JJ', 'Taylor BJ', 'Belch AR']","['Department of Oncology, University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. lpilarski@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca']",['eng'],['CA80963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Sdc1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', '0 (Syndecans)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Proteoglycans/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Syndecan-1', 'Syndecans', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2002/03/08 10:00,2002/05/04 10:01,['2002/03/08 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Mar;30(3):221-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00788-3.,,,"['S0301472X01007883 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00788-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanical injury was introduced by abrading the luminal surface of the vein patch with a sterile cotton bud. Both injured and non-injured vein patches were cultured and transduced with retroviral vectors carrying marker or therapeutic genes. After a 14-day culture, the thickness of the intimal layer of non-injured vein patches reached 90+/-28 microm at the edge and 61+/-22 microm at the center (n=29) from the original 22+/-12 microm at harvest (n=6, P=0.02). Mechanical injury to the intimal surface prior to culture resulted in an exaggerated proliferative response. The intimal thickness of injured vein patches increased from 3.4+/-1 microm right after injury to 128+/-23 microm (n=12, P<0.001) at the edge after 14-day culture. Genes were transduced efficiently into a luminal layer of cultured veins using a pseudotyped murine leukemia viral vector. Transduction of gene encoding nitric oxide synthase resulted in reduction of neointima formation to 33+/-7 microm (n=12) at the edge after 14-day culture compared to 90 microm (P<0.01) seen in untransduced non-injured vein patches. Marker gene transduction did not alter intimal proliferative response or its immunohistochemical profile.

Identification of the peptide epitopes allows T-cell responses to these antigens following transplantation of MHC-matched, minor H-mismatched tissues to be enumerated using tetramers and elispot assays.

However, a small number of cyclin D1-positive lymphomas other than MCL have been encountered. Our goal was to investigate the morphological spectrum of MCL as a disease entity, based on cyclin D1 overexpression. We reviewed 181 biopsy specimens obtained from 168 cases of cyclin D1-positive MCL. Typical findings were the presence of nodular (53.9% of cases) or diffuse (46.1%) histological patterns, containing mantle zone patterns (16.8%), naked germinal centers (33.5%) and perivascular hyaline deposition (83.2%). Unusual findings of residual germinal centers with a mantle cuff (four cases) and follicular colonization (two cases) were seen. High magnification showed a monotonous proliferation of tumor cells with cytological diversity including small (3.0%), intermediate (43.1%), medium (34.1%), medium-large (13.2%) and large (6.6%) cells. Pleomorphic and blastic/blastoid variants were encountered in 9.6 and 7.2% of cases, respectively. Three cases had foci of cells of considerable size, with a moderately abundant pale cytoplasm resembling marginal zone B cells. Two cases showed an admixture of cells which appeared transformed and mimicked the histology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic leukemia. In one, neoplastic mantle zones were surrounded by sheets of mature plasma cells, resembling the plasma cell type of Castleman's disease. An admixture of areas characteristic of MCL and of other larger cells, indicating histological progression or a composite lymphoma, were observed in seven cases. In high-grade lesions of five cases, nuclear staining of cyclin D1 was rarely detected. In our experience, cyclin D1 expression was also found in nine lymphomas other than MCL (five plasma cell myelomas, three Hodgkin's disease and one anaplastic large cell lymphoma). The application of cyclin D1 staining prompted us to recognize the broad morphological spectrum of MCL. MCL can be diagnosed with the application of cyclin D1 immunostaining, if careful attention is given to architectural and cytological features.","['Yatabe, Y', 'Suzuki, R', 'Matsuno, Y', 'Tobinai, K', 'Ichinohazama, R', 'Tamaru, J', 'Mizoguchi, Y', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Yamaguchi, M', 'Kojima, M', 'Uike, N', 'Okamoto, M', 'Isoda, K', 'Ichimura, K', 'Morishima, Y', 'Seto, M', 'Suchi, T', 'Nakamura, S']","['Yatabe Y', 'Suzuki R', 'Matsuno Y', 'Tobinai K', 'Ichinohazama R', 'Tamaru J', 'Mizoguchi Y', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Kojima M', 'Uike N', 'Okamoto M', 'Isoda K', 'Ichimura K', 'Morishima Y', 'Seto M', 'Suchi T', 'Nakamura S']","['Department of Pathology and Clinical Laboratories, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,['136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cyclin D1/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Single-Blind Method']",,2002/03/08 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/03/08 10:00'],"['2002/03/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Int. 2001 Oct;51(10):747-61. doi: 10.1046/j.1440-1827.2001.01277.x.,,,['10.1046/j.1440-1827.2001.01277.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further on it was shown that ND10 were sites of locality of the number of proteins (PML, Sp 100, pRB) (Sterndorf et al., 1992; Kamitani et al., 1998), the majority of which are modified with ubiquitin-like small proteins-modifiers (SUMO) (Ishov, Maul, 1996). In addition, it was shown that ND10 were sites of primary localization, transcription and replication of some DNA-viruses (SV40, virus of simple herpes 1, adenovirus 5) (Ishov, Maul, 1996; Ishov et al., 1997). Except for SV40, these viruses produce proteins able to modify ND10, or leading to degradation of ND10-associated proteins (Maul et al., 1993; Maul, Everett, 1994). This degradation is accompanied with protein desumofication and, later, with hydrolysis on the ubiquitin-proteosomal way (Everett et al., 1998, 1999). Cell incubation with interferon leads to augmentation of the number and dimension of ND10 owing to increased expression of Sp100 and PML (Lavau et al., 1995; Grotzinger et al., 1996). In all, these data make it possible to put forward a hypothesis that ND10 may represent a peculiar cell storage (""depot"") of proteins regulated according to the ""accumulation-drop"" principle (Ishov et al., 1997; Maul, 1998).

The situation is less clear for adult acute lymphocytic leukemia in which results achieved with all strategies are disappointing. In acute myelocytic leukemia, autografts should be done in patients with good and standard risk factors. Patients with high-risk acute myelocytic leukemia defined by poor cytogenetics or failure to achieve remission with the first induction course, should proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation with the best available human leukocyte antigen-identical donor (family or unrelated), and the nature of the conditioning regimen (myelo-ablative or non-myelo-ablative) should be decided in relation to age, and the patient's clinical condition. Results of autografting in acute myelocytic leukemia rely strongly on the quality of the graft. Higher doses of infused stem cells translate into lower relapse rates. Marrow purging with cyclophosphamide derivatives also diminishes the relapse incidence. Autologous stem cell transplantations using peripheral blood are presently preferred to marrow as the source of stem cells, but an aggressive prior in vivo purge (high-dose consolidation course(s) before cytaphereses) is then mandatory. In good-risk acute myelocytic leukemia, autografting is superior to high-dose ARA-C; in standard-risk acute myelocytic leukemia, both are supposedly equivalent. There is no prospective randomized study testing the two approaches in the good-standard-risk population. We presently test the combination of marrow and blood both purged by mafosfamide. In adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, good-risk patients get the best benefit from autografting over conventional chemotherapy. Maintenance chemotherapy after transplant is likely to bring benefit.

Previous results from this laboratory showed supra-additivity for the induction of micronuclei in p53-mutated mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells after combined treatment with gamma-radiation from a 137Cs source and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). The question now was whether supra-additivity was a general phenomenon for the genotoxicity of this combination of a physical and a chemical DNA-damaging agent or whether the result was species- and cell type-specific. The same combination of agents was investigated in two human lymphoblastoid cell lines, TK6 (wild-type p53) and WTK1 (mutated p53), and primary fibroblasts from a fetal human lung. Doses were in the linear dose-effect range, resulting in a 1.5- to 3-fold increase in micronuclei above control. Radiation doses were between 125 and 350 mGy, while the EMS concentrations were 20-50 microg/ml for the cell lines and 250-350 microg/ml for the primary cells. In none of the human test systems was supra-additivity observed. With the WTK1 cells, which are most similar to the mouse cells regarding p53 status, there was even a tendency for a sub-additive combination effect. Possible explanations for the difference to the mouse cells could be related to species-specific aspects, different consequences of the p53 mutations or the presence of additional mutations. It is concluded that caution is advised in the interpretation and extrapolation of experimental results of mixture toxicity data because the outcome could be highly specific for the given selection of agents, doses and assays.","['Stopper, Helga', 'Lutz, Werner K']","['Stopper H', 'Lutz WK']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Strasse 9, D-97078 Wurzburg, Germany. stopper@toxi.uni-wuerzburg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9H154DI0UP (Ethyl Methanesulfonate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Ethyl Methanesulfonate/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fetus/embryology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Lung/physiology', 'Mice', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Mutagens/*adverse effects', 'Mutation', 'Pregnancy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2002 Mar;17(2):177-81. doi: 10.1093/mutage/17.2.177.,,,['10.1093/mutage/17.2.177 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the mutagenicity of ENU at the Tk(+/-) locus of mouse lymphoma cells and to confirm the ability of the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) to detect both point mutations and large DNA alterations, Tk(+/-) L5178Y cells were exposed to different doses of ENU. Treatment of the cells with ENU resulted in a linear dose response with mutant frequencies of up to 16-fold over control. Evaluation of mutant clone size showed that 36% of the 100 microg/ml ENU-induced clones (66% in control) were small colony mutants and 64% (34% in control) were large colony mutants. DNA isolated from mutants in the control culture and the 100 microg/ml ENU treatment group was analyzed for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using allele-specific PCR. The majority of the small colony mutants, both ENU-treated (97%) and spontaneous (91%), lost the Tk1b allele. The percentage of allele loss in ENU-induced large colony mutants was distinctly different from that of the control. Twenty-three percent of ENU-induced large colony mutants lost their Tk1b alleles, whereas 73% of the large colony mutants from the control culture lost the allele (P < 0.001). Overall, 50% of the Tk mutants from the 100 microg/ml ENU-treated cultures (86% in control) showed LOH. Our data indicate that ENU is a potent mutagen in mouse lymphoma cells and that 100 microg/ml ENU induces equal numbers of point mutations and chromosomal mutations.

This suggests a functional screen for transforming genes is required to identify genetic mutations that are missed by cytogenetic analyses. We utilized a retrovirus-based cDNA expression system to identify transforming genes expressed in cytogenetically normal AML patients. We identified a new member of the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, designating it RasGRP4. Subsequently, cDNA sequences encoding rodent and human RasGRP4 proteins were deposited in GenBank. RasGRP4 contains the same protein domain structure as other members of the RasGRP family, including a Ras exchange motif, a CDC25 homology domain, a C1/diacyglycerol-binding domain, and putative calcium-binding EF hands. We show that expression of RasGRP4 induces anchorage-independent growth of Rat1 fibroblasts. RasGRP4 is a Ras-specific activator and, interestingly, is highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and myeloid cell lines. Unlike other RasGRP proteins, RasGRP4 is not expressed in the brain or in lymphoid cells. We demonstrated that 32D myeloid cells expressing RasGRP4 have elevated levels of activated Ras compared with control cells, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment greatly enhanced Ras activation. PMA induced membrane localization of RasGRP4 and 32D cells expressing RasGRP4 were capable of cytokine-independent proliferation in the presence of PMA. We conclude that RasGRP4 is a member of the RasGRP family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors that may play a role in myeloid cell signaling growth regulation pathways that are responsive to diacylglycerol levels.","['Reuther, Gary W', 'Lambert, Que T', 'Rebhun, John F', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Quilliam, Lawrence A', 'Der, Channing J']","['Reuther GW', 'Lambert QT', 'Rebhun JF', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Quilliam LA', 'Der CJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7295, USA. greuther@med.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['CA 42978/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 H 07774/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (RASGRP4 protein, human)', '0 (ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytokines/physiology', '*Genes, ras', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/09/24 06:00,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Aug 23;277(34):30508-14. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111330200.

Hence, TNF induces apoptosis in the presence of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis. We report that a novel triterpenoid, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9,-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) inhibits NF-kappaB-mediated gene expression at a step after translocation of activated NF-kappaB to the nucleus. This effect appears specific for the NF-kappaB pathway as CDDO does not inhibit gene expression induced by the phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). CDDO in combination with TNF caused a dramatic increase in apoptosis in ML-1 leukemia cells that was associated with activation of caspase-8, cleavage of Bid, translocation of Bax, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation. Experiments with caspase inhibitors demonstrated that caspase-8 was an initiator of this pathway. TNF also induced a transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which upon addition of CDDO was converted to a sustained activation. The activation of JNK was also dependent on caspase-8. Sustained activation of JNK is frequently pro-apoptotic, yet inhibition of JNK did not prevent Bax translocation or cytochrome c release, demonstrating its lack of involvement in CDDO/TNF-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was acutely induced by CDDO/TNF in every leukemia cell line tested including those that overexpress Bcl-x(L), suggesting that the mitochondrial pathway is not required for apoptosis by this combination. These results suggest that the apoptotic potency of the CDDO/TNF combination occurs through selective inhibition of NF-kappaB-dependent anti-apoptotic proteins, bypassing potential mitochondrial resistance mechanisms, and thus may provide a basis for the development of novel approaches to the treatment of leukemia.","['Stadheim, Terrance A', 'Suh, Nanjoo', 'Ganju, Neema', 'Sporn, Michael B', 'Eastman, Alan']","['Stadheim TA', 'Suh N', 'Ganju N', 'Sporn MB', 'Eastman A']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA50224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA86476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Carcinogens', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Immunoblotting', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/06/14 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 May 10;277(19):16448-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M108974200.

Compared with hereditary or even sporadic carcinomas, MMR gene mutations are very uncommon in leukemia. However, genetic instability, attested by either loss of heterozygosity or microsatellite instability, has been extensively documented in chronic or acute malignant myeloid disorders. This observation suggests that in leukemia some internal or external signals may interfere with MMR protein expression and/or function. We investigated the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) stimulation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on MMR protein expression and activity in human myeloid leukemia cell lines. First, we show here that unstimulated U937 cells displayed low level of PKC activity as well as MMR protein expression and activity compared with a panel of myeloid cell lines. Second, treatment of U937 cells with TPA significantly increased (3-5-fold) hMSH2 expression and, to a lesser extent, hMSH6 and hPMS2 expression, correlated to a restoration of MMR function. In addition, diacylglycerol, a physiological PKC agonist, induced a significant increase in hMSH2 expression, whereas chelerythrine or calphostin C, two PKC inhibitors, significantly decreased TPA-induced hMSH2 expression. Reciprocally, treatment of HEL and KG1a cells that exhibited a high level of PKC expression, with chelerythrine significantly decreased hMSH2 and hMSH6 expression. Moreover, the alteration of MMR protein expression paralleled the difference in microsatellite instability and cell sensitivity to 6-thioguanine. Our results suggest that PKC could play a role in regulating MMR protein expression and function in some myeloid leukemia cells.","['Humbert, Odile', 'Hermine, Thierry', 'Hernandez, Helene', 'Bouget, Thomas', 'Selves, Janick', 'Laurent, Guy', 'Salles, Bernard', 'Lautier, Dominique']","['Humbert O', 'Hermine T', 'Hernandez H', 'Bouget T', 'Selves J', 'Laurent G', 'Salles B', 'Lautier D']","['Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, UMR 5089, CNRS, 205 route de Narbonne, 31077 Toulouse cedex, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (G-T mismatch-binding protein)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,"['Base Pair Mismatch', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Guanine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 May 17;277(20):18061-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M103451200.

The significance of these findings and the role of factor(s) in the sups of irradiated leukemic lymphocytes as inducers of apoptosis are discussed.","['Bessler, Hanna', 'Bergman, Michael', 'Salman, Hertzel', 'Cohen, Amos M', 'Fenig, Eyal', 'Djaldetti, Meir']","['Bessler H', 'Bergman M', 'Salman H', 'Cohen AM', 'Fenig E', 'Djaldetti M']","['Laboratory for Immunology and Hematology Research, Rabin Medical Center, Golda Campus, Petah Tiqva and the Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/*radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/05/16 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2002 May 8;179(1):103-8. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00868-0.,,,"['S0304383501008680 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00868-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One strategy to augment the avidity and aggregating properties of these mediators is to maximize the number of their ligand binding sites. The valency of lectins and antibodies, however, is limited by their quaternary structures. To overcome this limitation, we explored the use of polymers generated by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) as scaffolds to noncovalently assemble multiple copies of a lectin, the tetravalent protein concanavalin A (Con A). We demonstrate that complexes between Con A and multivalent scaffolds aggregate cells of a T cell leukemia line (Jurkat) more effectively than Con A alone. We anticipate that synthetic scaffolds will offer a new means of facilitating processes that rely on cell aggregation, such as pathogen clearance and immune recognition.","['Gestwicki, Jason E', 'Strong, Laura E', 'Cairo, Christopher W', 'Boehm, Frederick J', 'Kiessling, Laura L']","['Gestwicki JE', 'Strong LE', 'Cairo CW', 'Boehm FJ', 'Kiessling LL']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI 53706, USA.']",['eng'],"['GM 08349/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 18750/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 55984/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']",IM,"['Cell Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Concanavalin A/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Energy Transfer', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Folding', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A/drug effects']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/07/02 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 2002 Feb;9(2):163-9. doi: 10.1016/s1074-5521(02)00102-3.,,,"['S1074552102001023 [pii]', '10.1016/s1074-5521(02)00102-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A commercially available gene coding for blasticidin S deaminase (bsr) when used to construct retroviral vectors, LBSN and LNSB, provided very low levels of BS deaminase activity, precluding their routine use in gene transfer experiments.

Ten copies of HTLV-I DNA could be detected with 100% sensitivity, and the assay had a wide range of at least 5 log(10). Intra- and inter-assay reproducibility was evaluated using independent extractions of PBMCs from an HTLV-I-infected patient (coefficients of variation, 24 and 7% respectively). The performance of this TaqMan PCR assay, coupled with its high throughput, thus allows reliable routine follow-up of HTLV-I proviral load in infected patients. Preliminary results using clinical samples indicate a higher proviral load in patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis than in asymptomatic carriers, and also suggest the usefulness of this quantitative measurement to assess the etiological link between HTLV-I and adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-like syndromes.","['Dehee, Axelle', 'Cesaire, Raymond', 'Desire, Nathalie', 'Lezin, Agnes', 'Bourdonne, Olivier', 'Bera, Odile', 'Plumelle, Yves', 'Smadja, Didier', 'Nicolas, Jean Claude']","['Dehee A', 'Cesaire R', 'Desire N', 'Lezin A', 'Bourdonne O', 'Bera O', 'Plumelle Y', 'Smadja D', 'Nicolas JC']","['Laboratoire de Microbiologie, Hopital Rothschild, Paris, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Taq Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier State', 'DNA, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*virology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/blood/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Proviruses/genetics/*growth & development', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Taq Polymerase', '*Viral Load']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/07/09 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2002 Apr;102(1-2):37-51. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(01)00445-1.,,,"['S0166093401004451 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(01)00445-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This discussion presents the findings from recent research on accessing support from the perspective of parents with a child undergoing treatment for ALL. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY: A longitudinal, qualitative study informed by a phenomenological methodology. The results are taken from parent interviews undertaken during the time period from the end of induction-remission to the end of the 5-week period (time period T1), collected over the first year of operation of the study. RESULTS: The need for support was reported as intense, and offers of support tend to lessen over time. Among the sources of support noted were partners, family, friends, employers, hospital staff, and other parents in the same situation. However, community resources appeared to be lacking, underused, or both. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Suggestions for support include the provision of practical assistance through appropriately trained volunteers, the involvement of a liaison person to mentor families through the initial stages of treatment, development of parent support groups, and the opportunity for families to meet children who are successfully off treatment. Such support strategies involve sensitivity to particularly vulnerable families who have limited support available and respect for the variation in individual styles of accessing support.","['McGrath, P']",['McGrath P'],"['Centre for Public Health Research, Queensland University of Technology, Red Hill, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Pract,Cancer practice,9312355,,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Parents/*psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', '*Social Support']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Pract. 2001 Jul-Aug;9(4):198-205. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-5394.2001.94008.x.,,,"['94008 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-5394.2001.94008.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OVERVIEW: The history of clinical applications of monoclonal antibodies has been intertwined with that of lymphomas. The first report of a complete remission in 1981 described a patient with follicular lymphoma who was treated with a murine anti-idiotype antibody. Later that decade there appeared additional encouraging reports of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, immunotoxins, and other antibodies with antitumor effects against lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies as a treatment of malignancy became reality in late 1997 when the US Food and Drug Administration approved the anti-CD20 chimeric monoclonal antibody rituximab for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma. Since that time an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (dacliximab) and an anti-CD25 immunotoxin fusion product (denileukin diftitox) have become clinically available. Several radio- labeled antibodies, including the murine anti-CD20 products (131)I-tositumomab and (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, are in advanced stages of clinical testing as are other unlabeled monoclonal antibodies with antilymphoma activity. Other antilymphoma immunotoxins that react with CD25, CD19, and CD22 also have shown promise. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The therapeutic arsenal against lymphoma has been significantly changed by the addition of these antibody products that are active as single agents, and are synergistic, additive, or both with other antilymphoma treatments.","['Dillman, R O']",['Dillman RO'],"['Laboratory and Clinical Research, Hoag Cancer Center, Newport Beach, California 92658, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Pract,Cancer practice,9312355,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Pract. 2001 Mar-Apr;9(2):71-80. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-5394.2001.009002071.x.,,,"['92004 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-5394.2001.009002071.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It inhibits equally well the RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities of retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) (i.e. of HIV, murine leukaemia virus and mouse mammary tumour virus) as well as cellular DNA polymerases (i.e. DNA polymerases alpha and beta and Escherichia coli polymerase I). A study of the mode and mechanism of the polymerase inhibition by PAT has been conducted with HIV-1 RT. PAT was shown to be a reversible non-competitive inhibitor. PAT binds RT independently and at a site different from that of the primer-template and dNTP substrates with high affinity (K(i)=0.51 microM and K(i)=0.53 microM with dTTP and with dGTP as the variable substrates respectively). Blocking the polar hydroxy groups of PAT has only a marginal effect on the inhibitory capacity, thus hydrophobic interactions are likely to play a major role in inhibiting RT. Preincubation of RT with the primer-template substrate prior to the interaction with PAT reduces substantially the inhibition capacity, probably by preventing these contacts. PAT does not interfere with the first step of polymerization, the binding of RT to DNA, nor does the inhibitor interfere with the binding of dNTP to RT/DNA complex, as evident from the steady-state kinetic study, whereby K(m) remains unchanged. We assume, therefore, that PAT interferes with subsequent catalytic steps of DNA polymerization. The inhibitor may alter the optimal stereochemistry of the polymerase active site relative to the primer terminus, bound dNTP and the metal ions that are crucial for efficient catalysis or, alternatively, may interfere with the thumb sub-domain movement and, thus, with the translocation of the primer-template following nucleotide incorporation.","['Loya, Shoshana', 'Rudi, Amira', 'Kashman, Yoel', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Loya S', 'Rudi A', 'Kashman Y', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Alkynes)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (polyacetylenetriol)', '25067-58-7 (Polyynes)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'OC7TV75O83 (Acetylene)']",IM,"['Acetylene/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Alkynes', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Polymerase I/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'Polyynes', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology']",PMC1222433,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2002 Mar 15;362(Pt 3):685-92. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3620685.,,,['10.1042/0264-6021:3620685 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vif gene is conserved among all primate and most nonprimate lentiviruses. However, previous reports demonstrated that, in their respective host cells, primate Vif deleted lentiviruses could not be complemented by nonprimate Vif proteins, suggesting that species-specific restrictions between Vif and the virus-producing cells may modulate the Vif function on viral infectivity. Here we bring further support to this hypothesis since we show that CAEV Vif, when expressed in goat cells, is able to increase the infectivity of Vif deleted human immunodeficiency type-1 virus and of murine leukemia virus. Moreover, we demonstrate in vitro interactions between different Vif proteins and NC domains of heterologous Gag precursors, supporting the notion that species specificity of lentiviral infection is not due to molecular interactions between Vif and viral components.","['Seroude, Virginie', 'Audoly, Gilles', 'Gluschankof, Pablo', 'Suzan, Marie']","['Seroude V', 'Audoly G', 'Gluschankof P', 'Suzan M']","['INSERM U372, Marseille cedex 09, 13276, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, vif)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis-Encephalitis Virus, Caprine/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, gag/metabolism', 'Gene Products, vif/genetics/*metabolism', 'Goats', 'HIV-1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus Infections/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'vif Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/04/18 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2002 Jan 5;292(1):156-61. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1269.,,,"['10.1006/viro.2001.1269 [doi]', 'S0042682201912693 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that Tax-mediated apoptosis in response to UV irradiation was inhibited by Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) overexpression and by treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAd-FMK. Since Tax has been shown to functionally inactivate the apoptosis regulator p53, the effect of Tax on apoptosis in the absence of p53 was examined. In these studies, Tax sensitized p53-negative cells to apoptose, suggesting that Tax can mediate a p53-independent form of apoptosis. In addition, cells expressing both Tax and p53 displayed higher levels of apoptosis than cells expressing either protein alone, suggesting that the apoptosis-inducing activities of Tax and p53 are not completely overlapping. These observations demonstrate that Tax can utilize a p53-independent mechanism to induce apoptotic cell death following UV irradiation.","['Kao, S Y', 'Lemoine, F J', 'Marriott, S J']","['Kao SY', 'Lemoine FJ', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 09197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 77371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Rats', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/04/03 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 Dec 20;291(2):292-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1200.,,,"['10.1006/viro.2001.1200 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(01)91200-0 [pii]']",['(C)2001 Elsevier Science.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have tested the replication of an amphotropic MLV, MLV-(MOA), and an enhancer-deficient mutant of this virus in human breast carcinoma-derived cell lines. The proviral expression plasmids use a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter for the initial transcription of virus RNA. We found that all cells analyzed are permissive for replication of MLV-(MOA). Enhancer-deficient virus is unable to replicate. However, in two lines the replication defect can be rescued by the spontaneous insertion of a CMV promoter and enhancer into the U3 region.

The function of the N-terminus of M-MuLV IN was studied through deletional and mutational analyses. The IN 1-105 domain was dissected into two halves expressing either the unique N-terminus or the HHCC domain. Although the parental IN 1-105 could functionally complement the core-C-terminus for integration reactions, neither half of the N-terminus was sufficient. Partial complementation of strand transfer, but not 3prime prime or minute processing, could be obtained through mixing the two halves. The dimerization of the M-MuLV N-terminus was dependent on the expression of the intact 1-105. Critical basic amino acids within the HHCC domain which are required for 3' processing and strand transfer reactions were identified through alanine mutagenesis. Loss of in vitro strand transfer activity correlated with loss of viral titer in vivo for this cluster of basic amino acids within the HHCC domain.","['Yang, F', 'Seamon, J A', 'Roth, M J']","['Yang F', 'Seamon JA', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA76545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI7403/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Integrases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/04/02 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 Dec 5;291(1):32-45. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1218.,,,"['10.1006/viro.2001.1218 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(01)91218-8 [pii]']",['Copyright 2001 Elsevier Science.'],,"['GENBANK/D88386', 'GENBANK/J02255', 'GENBANK/M18247', 'GENBANK/M77194', 'GENBANK/P03356', 'GENBANK/X52622']",,,,,,,,,,,

Very large cell contacts can be obtained by a filter aspiration method. A cell monolayer is created by controlled suction on biocompatible filter. No spontaneous fusion results. Just after filtration, electrofusion is obtained by field pulses applied parallel to the filter. Cell viability is not strongly affected and cells recover their spherical shape in the minute time range after filtration. The electrical parameters, the cell density, and the flow rate control fusion. Fusion is obtained with cells of different origins with very different adhesion properties.

METHODS: A decision tree for the initial management of a child older than age 6 months, presenting with idiopathic thrombocytopenia, without blasts on the peripheral smear was constructed. The three strategies are: 1) initial BMA in all patients; 2) initial BMA only in patients at high risk; and 3) empiric therapy for all patients without initial BMA. High-risk criteria include any of: platelet count >50 x 10(9)/L; hemoglobin <100 g/L (age younger than 12 months) or <110 g/L (age older than 12 months): white blood cell count <5 x 10(9)/L (younger than 6 years) or <4 x 10(9)/L (older than 6 years); or absolute neutrophil count <1.5 x 10(9)/L (younger than 6 years) or <2 x 10(9)/L (older than 6 years). The results are expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), a measure that estimates the overall life expectancy in years for patients receiving a particular treatment strategy, corrected for the patient's quality of life. RESULTS: The base case results are: 1) BMA all = 69.649 QALYs; 2) high-risk BMA = 69.652 QALYs; and 3) empiric therapy = 69.644 QALYs. These results indicate a three-way toss-up because there is less than a 4-day quality-adjusted difference (0.01) between strategies. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the initial BMA does not significantly change the overall QALYs of a child presenting with thrombocytopenia and, consequently, is not mandatory in every patient before starting steroids.","['Klaassen, R J', 'Doyle, J J', 'Krahn, M D', 'Blanchette, V S', 'Naglie, G']","['Klaassen RJ', 'Doyle JJ', 'Krahn MD', 'Blanchette VS', 'Naglie G']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Canada. rklaassen@cheo.on.ca""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2001 Nov;23(8):511-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200111000-00009.,,,['10.1097/00043426-200111000-00009 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records of 146 children with cancer who died at Children's Hospital were reviewed for demographics, diagnosis, location of death, withdrawal of life support, use of ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR) orders, and the length of time that those orders were in effect. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were evaluated. Fifty-nine died of progressive disease and 36 deaths were therapy-related. Sixty-four percent of disease-related deaths occurred at home with support from home care or hospice. Only 10% of all patients died while receiving maximal aggressive support in the intensive care unit. Age, diagnosis (solid tumor vs. leukemia), cause of death, length of last hospital admission, and the duration of DNR orders had a significant correlation with the place of death and referral to and use of hospice.

Therefore, the detailed study of immunological function of salivary gland epithelial cells (SGEC) may provide useful information for the understanding of Sjogren's syndrome pathogenesis. In this report we aimed to formulate a protocol for the establishment of human non-neoplastic SGEC lines as a tool for the study of the physiology and pathophysiology of these cells. Pointing towards a practical approach, we sought to establish SGEC lines from quite a limited amount of biopsy tissue obtained during the diagnostic evaluation of patients. Herein, the favorable conditions for the long-term maintenance of human non-neoplastic SGEC lines are presented and involve the successive application of a serum-containing and a serum-free culture medium, supplemented with essential epithelial growth factors. This protocol has been found reliable and convenient, as attested by the reproducible establishment of non-neoplastic SGEC lines. The analysis of SGEC phenotypic features, as well as a coculture system for the study of interactions between epithelial cells and lymphocytes, are also described. Such techniques may provide valuable means for the functional and molecular investigation of human SGEC and particularly for the study of Sjogren's syndrome and other disorders of glandular epithelia.","['Dimitriou, Ioannis D', 'Kapsogeorgou, Efstathia K', 'Abu-Helu, Rasmi F', 'Moutsopoulos, Haralampos M', 'Manoussakis, Menelaos N']","['Dimitriou ID', 'Kapsogeorgou EK', 'Abu-Helu RF', 'Moutsopoulos HM', 'Manoussakis MN']","['Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, National University of Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Oral Sci,European journal of oral sciences,9504563,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/pathology', 'Biopsy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Communication', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Division', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Epidermal Growth Factor', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Salivary Glands/*cytology/immunology', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/immunology/pathology"", 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Time Factors']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/06/14 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Oral Sci. 2002 Feb;110(1):21-30. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0722.2002.00152.x.,,,['10.1034/j.1600-0722.2002.00152.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six subjects (median age, 20.9 years; median interval since completion of therapy, 13.3 years) were evaluated. Ten participants had received cranial irradiation (CRT), whereas 16 had received only chemotherapy. Primary outcome measures included body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting lipoprotein, glucose, and insulin levels. Secondary measures included insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and IGF binding protein-3 levels, physical activity index, a 7-day dietary recall, tobacco product use, and measurement of the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent (16/26) of participants had at least one CVRF potentially related to their cancer treatment (obesity, dyslipidemia, increased blood pressure, or insulin resistance), with 30% (7/26) having more than two CVRF. Thirty-one percent (8/26) of subjects were obese (BMI > or = 30). Subjects who were treated with CRT (BMI, 30.4 +/- 6.7) had an increased BMI (P = 0.039) in comparison with those who received only chemotherapy (BMI, 25.4 +/- 5.1). Triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein C levels were significantly higher in those treated with CRT (P = 0.027 and 0.022, respectively). The IGF-1 was inversely correlated with IMT (total group, -0.514, P = 0.009; females only, -0.729, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Young adult survivors of childhood ALL, especially those treated with CRT, are at risk for obesity and dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.

Children treated with anthracyclines undergo several cardiac screening procedures before therapy, but the usefulness of these pretherapy cardiac studies has never been evaluated. The authors examined whether induction chemotherapy in patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was altered based on a pretherapy left ventricular shortening fraction (SF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of 134 children registered on treatment protocols of the Pediatric Oncology Group for high-risk B-precursor and T-cell ALL between 1987 and 1998 were reviewed. Demographic information consisting of age at diagnosis, sex, and past cardiac history was collected, as were the results of all echocardiographic evaluations for SF and actions taken based on these evaluations. The outcome measured was whether any changes were made in induction therapy based on initial SF. In addition, secondary SF results obtained at the cumulative anthracycline dose range of 90 to 150 mg/m2 were studied to determine whether modifications of future chemotherapy were made after this limited exposure. RESULTS: Three of 128 children (2.3%) without a previous cardiac history had an initial SF on their pretherapy echocardiogram that prompted additional evaluation but no change in therapy. A secondary analysis of SF in 85 children who completed anthracycline doses of 90 to 150 mg/m2 was performed. There were three (3.5%) with abnormal study results who were evaluated further. Again, no changes were made in the anthracycline doses based on these findings. No cardiac dysfunction occurred among these six patients during later follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a previous cardiac history or signs and symptoms or cardiac disease, pretherapy evaluation of left ventricular function may not be indicated in children about to undergo anthracycline-based treatment of acute leukemia. The timing of initiation of cardiac evaluation remains unclear, but these results suggest that even at a cumulative dose of 90 to 150 mg/m2, studies to determine left ventricular function do not yield data sufficient to warrant a change in the clinical management of these patients.","['Porea, T J', 'Dreyer, Z E', 'Bricker, J T', 'Mahoney, D H Jr']","['Porea TJ', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Bricker JT', 'Mahoney DH Jr']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Texas Children's Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Echocardiography', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Ventricular Function, Left/*physiology']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2001 Oct;23(7):420-3. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200110000-00006.,,,['10.1097/00043426-200110000-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1990 to December 1995, 403 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled in the authors' protocol 1-ALL90-BFM/HPG. Prednisone good response was defined as a blast count of less than 1,000/microL and a prednisone poor response (PPR) as a blast count of at least 1,000/microL, both in peripheral smears, after 7 days of oral prednisone (60 mg/m2 per day) and one intrathecal dose of methotrexate. In the PGR group, patients were divided into two subgroups: patients who had less than 1,000 blasts/microL at diagnosis and those with at least 1,000 blasts/microL at diagnosis. RESULTS: Three-hundred thirty-seven patients (90%) had PGR and 37 had (10%) PPR. At 5-year follow-up, event-free survival estimates were 67 +/- 3.8% and 38 +/- 8% for PGR and PPR, respectively (P = 0.0001). In the PGR group, 114 patients (34%) had an initial blast count of less than 1,000/microL and 223 (66%) had an initial blast count of at least 1,000/microL. The authors compared the clinical and laboratory characteristics of these subgroups at diagnosis and outcome and detected significant differences in white cell count, incidence of T immunophenotype, and presence of mediastinal or spleen enlargement. However, there were no differences in response to induction treatment, death in complete remission, relapses, or event-free survival probability. CONCLUSIONS: In the PGR group, regardless of the initial blast count, both subgroups had the same outcome. The PGR group with an initial blast count of at least 1,000/microL had significantly higher white cell counts. T markers, and mediastinal or spleen enlargement at diagnosis.

The significance of enteric infections caused by these pathogens has not been systematically investigated in severely immunosuppressed patients with acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened all patients treated on the leukemia ward of a university medical center. A total of 1,185 stool cultures from 371 episodes of diarrhea, mostly following myelosuppressive chemotherapy, were examined for the complete range of classic bacterial enteric pathogens (i.e. SSYC). RESULTS: Only three (0.25%) cultures from one patient were positive for Salmonella enteritidis. This patient suffered from cholangitis. S. enteritidis could also be detected by liver biopsy. Other infections by classic enteric pathogens were not observed. CONCLUSION: Symptomatic infections by classic bacterial enteric pathogens in hospitalized patients with acute leukemia are very rare. Stool cultures for these pathogens cannot be recommended as a routine test in uncomplicated diarrhea occurring after the 3rd hospital day.","['Gorschluter, M', 'Hahn, C', 'Ziske, C', 'Mey, U', 'Schottker, B', 'Molitor, E', 'Becker, S', 'Marklein, G', 'Sauerbruch, T', 'Schmidt-Wolf, I G H', 'Glasmacher, A']","['Gorschluter M', 'Hahn C', 'Ziske C', 'Mey U', 'Schottker B', 'Molitor E', 'Becker S', 'Marklein G', 'Sauerbruch T', 'Schmidt-Wolf IG', 'Glasmacher A']","['Dept of Internal Medicine I, University of Bonn, Germany. gorschlueter@uni-bonn.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Campylobacter/isolation & purification', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Diarrhea/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Salmonella/isolation & purification', 'Shigella/isolation & purification', 'Yersinia/isolation & purification']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/08/30 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infection. 2002 Jan;30(1):22-5. doi: 10.1007/s15010-002-1178-2.,,,['10.1007/s15010-002-1178-2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The basic idea is to first arrange the observations in increasing order of the covariate and then base the test on a certain point process defined by the observation times. Tests constructed by this approach are robust against outliers in the covariate values or misspecification of the covariate scale since they only use the ordering of the covariate. Of particular interest is a test based on the Anderson-Darling statistic.

Vatican Radio, a very powerful radio station transmitting all over the world (up to 600 kW) is located in Santa Maria di Galeria, in the northern suburbs of the city of Rome. Electric field measurements in the proximity of the radio station ranged between 1.5 and 25 V/m. In the 10 km area around the station, with 60.182 residents (1999), leukaemia mortality among adults (> 14 years, 40 cases) in the period 1987-98 and childhood leukaemia incidence in the period 1987-99 (8 cases) were evaluated. The analysis (Stone's conditional test) was performed computing observed and expected cases (reference: population of Rome) in 5 bands of increasing radius (2 km width). The risk of childhood leukaemia was higher than expected within 6 km from the station (Standardized Incidence Ratio = 217; 95% Confidence Interval 99-405). Stone's test showed a significant decrease in risk with increasing distance both for male adult mortality (p-value = 0.03) and for childhood incidence (p-value = 0.04). A Score test, showed a significant decrease in risk of childhood incidence as function of the distance. The main limitations of this study are the small number of observed cases and the use of distance as a proxy for RF exposure. Further research will require a systematic campaign of electromagnetic field measurements to allow better assessment of the population exposure.","['Michelozzi, P', 'Kirchmayer, U', 'Capon, A', 'Forastiere, F', 'Biggeri, A', 'Barca, A', 'Ancona, C', 'Fusco, D', 'Sperati, A', 'Papini, P', 'Pierangelini, A', 'Rondelli, R', 'Perucci, C A']","['Michelozzi P', 'Kirchmayer U', 'Capon A', 'Forastiere F', 'Biggeri A', 'Barca A', 'Ancona C', 'Fusco D', 'Sperati A', 'Papini P', 'Pierangelini A', 'Rondelli R', 'Perucci CA']","['Dipartimento di epidemiologia ASL RM/E, Roma. salute@asplazio.it']",['ita'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', '*Radio', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Vatican City']",,2002/03/07 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/03/07 10:00'],"['2002/03/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2001 Nov-Dec;25(6):249-55.,Mortalita per leucemia e incidenza di leucemia infantile in prossimita della stazione di Radio Vaticana di Roma.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, instead of conjugating ubiquitin, it conjugates a ubiquitin homologue, small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1), also known as UBL1, GMP1, SMTP3, PIC1, and sentrin. The SUMO-1 conjugation pathway is very similar to that of ubiquitin with regard to the primary sequences of the ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), the three-dimensional structures of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and the chemistry of the overall conjugation pathway. The interaction of substrates with Ubc9 has been studied using NMR spectroscopy. Peptides with sequences that correspond to those of the SUMO-1 conjugation sites from p53 and c-Jun both bind to a surface adjacent to the active site Cys93 of human Ubc9, which has been previously shown to include residues that demonstrate the most significant dynamics on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Mutations in this region, Q126A, Q130A, A131D, E132A, Y134A, and T135A, were constructed to evaluate the role of these residues in SUMO-1 conjugation. These alterations have significant effects on the conjugation of SUMO-1 with the target proteins p53, E1B, and promyelocytic leukemia protein and define a substrate binding site on Ubc9. Furthermore, the SUMO-1 conjugation site of p53 does not form any defined secondary structure when either free or bound to Ubc9. This suggests that a defined secondary structure at SUMO-1 conjugation sites in target proteins is not necessary for recognition and conjugation by the SUMO-1 pathway.","['Lin, Donghai', 'Tatham, Michael H', 'Yu, Bin', 'Kim, Suhkmann', 'Hay, Ronald T', 'Chen, Yuan']","['Lin D', 'Tatham MH', 'Yu B', 'Kim S', 'Hay RT', 'Chen Y']","['Division of Immunology, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']",['eng'],['GM59887/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine/chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Ligases/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Peptides/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*chemistry', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*chemistry', '*Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Jun 14;277(24):21740-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M108418200.

Transcription factors such as NF-kappa B provide powerful targets for drugs to use in the treatment of cancer. In this report parthenolide (PT), a sesquiterpene lactone of herbal remedies such as feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) with NF-kappa B inhibitory activity, markedly increased the degree of human leukaemia HL-60 cell differentiation when simultaneously combined with 5 nM 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)). PT by itself did not induce HL-60 cell differentiation. 2. Cytofluorometric analysis indicated that PT stimulated 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells predominantly into monocytes. 3. Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with PT before the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) addition also potentiated the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced HL-60 cell differentiation in both a dose- and a time-dependent manner, in which the enhanced levels of cell differentiation closely correlated with the inhibitory levels of NF-kappa B binding activity by PT. 4. In contrast, santonin, a sesquiterpene lactone without an inhibitory activity of NF-kappa B binding to the kappa B sites, did not enhance the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. 5. In transfection experiments, PT enhanced 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced VDRE-dependent promoter activity. Furthermore, PT restored 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced VDRE-dependent promoter activity inhibited by TNF-alpha, an activator of NF-kappa B signalling pathway. 6. These results indicate that PT strongly potentiates the 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)-induced HL-60 cell differentiation into monocytes via the inhibition of NF-kappa B activity and provide evidence that inhibition of NF-kappa B activation can be a pre-requisite to the efficient entry of promyelocytic leukaemia cells into a differentiation pathway.","['Kang, S N', 'Kim, S H', 'Chung, S W', 'Lee, M H', 'Kim, H J', 'Kim, T S']","['Kang SN', 'Kim SH', 'Chung SW', 'Lee MH', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim TS']","['Immunology Laboratory, College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Kwangju 500-757, Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (2-methyl-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '1VL8J38ERO (Santonin)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Santonin/pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",PMC1573237,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/08/17 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2002 Mar;135(5):1235-44. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0704573.,,,['10.1038/sj.bjp.0704573 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the efficacy of ATRA as an anticancer drug has been demonstrated by the successful treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the molecular mechanisms of ATRA-induced cell cycle arrest of myeloid cells have not been fully investigated. In this study, we show that the onset of ATRA-induced G(0)/G(1) arrest of human monoblastic U-937 cells is linked to a sharp down-regulation of c-Myc and cyclin E levels and an increase in p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression. This is followed by an increase in p27(Kip1) protein expression due to enhanced protein stability. The importance of an early decrease in Myc expression for these events was demonstrated by the failure of a U-937 subline with constitutive exogenous expression of v-Myc to cell cycle arrest and regulate cyclin E and p27(Kip1) in response to ATRA. Preceding the initiation of G(1) arrest, a transient rise in retinoblastoma protein (pRb), p107, and cyclin A levels was detected. Later, a rapid fall in the levels of cyclins A and B and a coordinate dephosphorylation of pRb at Ser780, Ser795, and Ser807/811 coincided with the accumulation of cells in G(1). These results thus identify a decrease in c-Myc and cyclin E levels and a posttranscriptional up-regulation of p27(Kip1) as important early changes, and position them in the complex chain of events regulating ATRA-induced cell cycle arrest of myeloid cells.","['Dimberg, Anna', 'Bahram, Fuad', 'Karlberg, Inger', 'Larsson, Lars-Gunnar', 'Nilsson, Kenneth', 'Oberg, Fredrik']","['Dimberg A', 'Bahram F', 'Karlberg I', 'Larsson LG', 'Nilsson K', 'Oberg F']","['Department of Genetics and Pathology, Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala University, S-751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cyclin E/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):2199-206. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.6.2199.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.6.2199 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38111-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to find a genetic basis for this heterogeneity. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we analyzed a prospective cohort of 901 patients with various plasma-cell disorders--monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance, smoldering MM, MM, and primary plasma-cell leukemia--for genetic abnormalities involving the 13q14 and 14q32 chromosomal regions; the patients were consecutively enrolled in the Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome clinical trials, We performed statistical analyses comparing these chromosomal abnormalities in terms of immunological (ie, immunoglobulin types and light-chain subtypes) and clinical status and, to some extent, prognostic features. It was found that 14q32 translocations and del(13) are the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities, observed in 75% and 45% of the patients, respectively, and are not randomly distributed, but interconnected. Second, correlations between them allowed us to define 4 major genetic categories of patients: (1) patients lacking any 14q32 abnormality (25%) and generally also lacking del(13); (2) patients presenting either t(4;14) or t(14;16), almost always associated with a del(13) (15% of patients); (3) patients with other 14q32 abnormalities and presenting del(13) (25%); and (4) patients with other 14q32 abnormalities but not presenting del(13) (35%). Third, we show that this genetic stratification is highly correlated with immunological status and clinical presentation and with some major prognostic factors. For the first time, this study gives genetic support to the heterogeneity observed in patients with MM and demonstrates that the 14q32 and 13q chromosomal abnormalities are not randomly distributed. The strong correlations we found might be the basis for a novel genetic classification of MM, as has been previously demonstrated for leukemias and lymphomas.

Furthermore, tyrosine kinase receptors specific to endothelial cells are expressed on certain subsets of leukemias. We have previously demonstrated the existence of a VEGF/VEGFR-2 autocrine loop on leukemic cells that supports their growth and migration. Here, we demonstrate that in response to leukemia-derived proangiogenic and proinflammatory cytokines such as basic fibroblast growth factor and IL-1, endothelial cells release increasing amounts of another vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family member, VEGF-C. In turn, interaction of VEGF-C with its receptor VEGFR-3 (FLT-4) promotes leukemia survival and proliferation. We demonstrate in 2 cell lines and 5 FLT-4(+) leukemias that VEGF-C and a mutant form of the molecule that lacks the KDR-binding motif induce receptor phosphorylation, leukemia proliferation, and increased survival, as determined by increased Bcl-2/Bax ratios. Moreover, VEGF-C protected leukemic cells from the apoptotic effects of 3 chemotherapeutic agents. Because most leukemic cells release proangiogenic as well as proinflammatory cytokines, our data suggest that the generation of a novel paracrine angiogenic loop involving VEGF-C and FLT-4 may promote the survival of a subset of leukemias and protect them from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. These results identify the VEGF-C/FLT-4 pathway as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of subsets of acute leukemia.","['Dias, Sergio', 'Choy, Margaret', 'Alitalo, Kari', 'Rafii, Shahin']","['Dias S', 'Choy M', 'Alitalo K', 'Rafii S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 1300 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL 58707/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 61849/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 66592/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 67839/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/drug effects/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Paracrine Communication/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Umbilical Cord', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor C', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-3']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):2179-84. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.6.2179.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.6.2179 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38108-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of B7 molecules in inducing tumor immunity is controversial because of conflicting results and reports of differential signaling through the B7 molecules and their ligands CD28 and CTLA-4. In this study, we compared the effect of B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on the induction of T-cell immunity to C1498, a murine myelogenous leukemia. When cultured with exogenous cytokines in vitro, C1498/B7-1 and C1498/B7-2 induced syngeneic CD8+ T cells to kill parental C1498. In vivo, C1498/B7-1 grew progressively after subcutaneous injection, whereas C1498/B7-2 completely regressed after transient growth in naive mice. Spontaneous rejection of C1498/B7-2 resulted in immunity to challenge doses of C1498 and C1498/B7-1. Antibody-depletion studies in vivo showed that CD8+ T cells rejected C1498/B7-2, whereas only natural killer cells affected the growth of C1498/B7-1. Two approaches were used to determine whether preferential interaction of B7-1 with CTLA-4 contributed to the failure of C1498/B7-1 to activate CD8+ T cells in vivo. First, CTLA-4 specific monoclonal antibody was used to block B7-1-CTLA-4 interaction. Second, CTLA-4 deletional mutant (-/-) bone marrow chimeras were used as tumor hosts. In both systems, there was a significant increase in the rate of rejection of C1498/B7-1 tumors. Resistance to C1498/B7-1 in CTLA-4(minus sign/minus sign) hosts was mediated by CD8+ T cells. Blocking or deletion of CTLA-4 did not affect the growth of parental C1498, indicating that B7-1 was important for the induction of CD8+ T-cell immunity in the absence of CTLA-4.","['LaBelle, James L', 'Hanke, Carrie A', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Truitt, Robert L']","['LaBelle JL', 'Hanke CA', 'Blazar BR', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['AI 35225/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Cd86 protein, mouse)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",IM,"['Abatacept', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Immunity, Cellular/*drug effects', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Binding', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):2146-53. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.6.2146.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.6.2146 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38104-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the influence of BCR-ABL expression on cell-mediated cytotoxicity is poorly understood. In the present study, we asked whether BCR-ABL expression interferes with leukemic target sensitivity to natural killer (NK) cell cytolysis. Our approach was based on the use of 2 BCR-ABL transfectants of the pluripotent hematopoietic cell line UT-7 expressing low (UT-7/E8, UT-7/G6) and high (UT-7/9) levels of BCR-ABL. As effector cells, we used CD56(bright), CD16-, CD2- NK cells differentiated in vitro from CD34 cord blood progenitors. We demonstrated that BCR-ABL transfectants UT-7/9 were lysed by NK cells with a higher efficiency than parental and low UT-7/E8.1 and UT-7/G6 transfectants. This enhanced susceptibility to lysis correlated with an increase in expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) by target cells. Treatment of UT-7/9 cells by STI571 (a specific inhibitor of the abl kinase) resulted in a decrease in NK susceptibility to lysis and ICAM-1 down-regulation in target cells. Furthermore, the constitutive activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) detected in BCR-ABL transfectant UT-7/9, was significantly attenuated when cells were treated by STI571. Interestingly, inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by BAY11-67082 (a specific NF-kappaB inhibitor) resulted in down-regulation of ICAM-1 expression and a subsequent decrease in NK-induced killing of UT-7/9 transfectants. Our results show that oncogenic transformation by BCR-ABL may increase susceptibility of leukemic progenitors to NK cell cytotoxicity by a mechanism involving overexpression of ICAM-1 as a consequence of NF-kappaB activation.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Turhan, Ali G', 'Giron-Michel, Julien', 'Azzarone, Bruno', 'Bentires-Alj, Mohamed', 'Bours, Vincent', 'Bourhis, Jean Henri', 'Chouaib, Salem', 'Caignard, Anne']","['Baron F', 'Turhan AG', 'Giron-Michel J', 'Azzarone B', 'Bentires-Alj M', 'Bours V', 'Bourhis JH', 'Chouaib S', 'Caignard A']","['INSERM 487, Laboratoire de therapie cellulaire, Institut Gustave Roussy, 39 rue Camille Desmoulins, F-94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):2107-13. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.6.2107.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.6.2107 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38099-X [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients treated with pegaspargase had more rapid clearance of lymphoblasts from day 7 and day 14 bone marrow aspirates and more prolonged asparaginase activity than those treated with native asparaginase. In the first delayed intensification phase, 26% of native asparaginase patients had high-titer antibodies, whereas 2% of pegaspargase patients had those levels. High-titer antibodies were associated with low asparaginase activity in the native arm, but not in the pegaspargase arm. Adverse events, infections, and hospitalization were similar between arms. Event-free survival at 3 years was 82%. A population pharmacodynamic model using the nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM) program was developed that closely fit the measured enzyme activity and asparagine concentrations. Half-lives of asparaginase were 5.5 days and 26 hours for pegaspargase and native asparaginase, respectively. There was correlation between asparaginase enzymatic activity and depletion of asparagine or glutamine in serum. In cerebrospinal fluid asparagine, depletion was similar with both enzyme preparations.

We compared prospectively collected results of 2464 unrelated donor (URD) transplantations with 450 HLA-identical, matched sibling donor (MSD) transplantations performed at collaborating National Marrow Donor Program institutions. A total of 63% of URDs were matched at HLA-A, -B, and at -DRB1 alleles; all MSDs were genotypically identical at major histocompatibility loci. URD recipients were younger (median 36 vs 39, P =.001) than MSDs and underwent BMT later after diagnosis (median 17 [0-325 months] vs 7 [1-118 months], P =.001) and less often in chronic phase (CP) (67% vs 82%, P =.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a significantly increased risk of graft failure and acute graft versus host disease after URD BMT. The risk of hematologic relapse was low after either matched URD or MSD transplantations. We observed significantly though modestly poorer survival and disease-free survival (DFS) after URD transplantations. However, for those undergoing transplantation during CP within 1 year from diagnosis, 5-year DFS was similar or only slightly inferior after matched URD versus MSD transplantation (age < 30: URD 61% +/- 8% vs MSD 68% +/- 15%, P =.18; 30-40: URD 57% +/- 9% vs MSD 67% +/- 10%, P =.05; > 40: URD 46% +/- 9% vs MSD 57% +/- 9%, P =.02). Delay from diagnosis to BMT in CP patients led to substantially poorer 5-year DFS after matched URD than MSD BMT (CP 1-2 years: URD 39% +/- 6% vs MSD 63% +/- 12%; beyond 2 years: URD 33% +/- 7% vs MSD 50% +/- 20%). Outcome of matched URD BMT for early CP chronic myelogenous leukemia yields survival and DFS approaching that of MSD transplantation. However, delay may compromise URD outcomes to a greater extent. Improvements in URD and MSD transplantation are still needed, and results of newer, nontransplantation therapies should be evaluated against the established curative potential of URD and MSD marrow transplantation.","['Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Kernan, Nancy A', 'Kollman, Craig', 'Snyder, David', 'Petersdorf, Effie', 'Nelson, Gene', 'McGlave, Philip']","['Weisdorf DJ', 'Anasetti C', 'Antin JH', 'Kernan NA', 'Kollman C', 'Snyder D', 'Petersdorf E', 'Nelson G', 'McGlave P']","['University of Minnesota--Mayo Mail Code 480, 420 Delaware Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. weisd001@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/mortality/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/immunology', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/epidemiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear Family', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology/mortality/statistics & numerical data']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):1971-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.6.1971.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.6.1971 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38081-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies were invariably based on relative quantification and did not investigate sample-inherent parameters that influence test accuracy, which makes comparisons and clinical conclusions cumbersome. Hence, we conducted a prospective, population-based MRD study in 108 sequentially recruited children with ALL uniformly treated with the ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ALL-BFM) 95 protocol in Austria (median follow-up of 40 months). Using sensitive, limited antibody panel flow cytometry applicable to 97% of patients, we investigated 329 bone marrow samples from 4 treatment time points. MRD was quantified by blast percentages among nucleated cells (NCs) and by absolute counts (per microliter). Covariables such as NC count, normal B cells, and an estimate of the test sensitivity were also recorded. Presence and distinct levels of MRD correlated with a high probability of early relapse at each of the time points studied. Sequential monitoring at day 33 and week 12 was most useful for predicting outcome independently from clinical risk groups: patients with persistent disease (> or =1 blast/microL) had a 100% probability of relapse, compared to 6% in all others. Absolute MRD quantification was more appropriate than relative, due to considerable variations in total NC counts between samples. Regeneration of normal immature B cells after periods of rest from treatment limited the test sensitivity. In conclusion, MRD detection by flow cytometry is a strong and independent outcome indicator in childhood ALL. Standardization regarding absolute quantification on the basis of NCs and assessment during periods of continuous treatment promise to increase the accuracy, simplicity, and cost efficiency of the approach.","['Dworzak, Michael N', 'Froschl, Gertraud', 'Printz, Dieter', 'Mann, Georg', 'Potschger, Ulrike', 'Muhlegger, Nora', 'Fritsch, Gerhard', 'Gadner, Helmut']","['Dworzak MN', 'Froschl G', 'Printz D', 'Mann G', 'Potschger U', 'Muhlegger N', 'Fritsch G', 'Gadner H']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderspital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria. dworzak@ccri.univie.ac.at""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques/instrumentation/standards', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/standards', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):1952-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.6.1952.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.6.1952 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38078-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,['Austrian Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group'],,,,

Patients with CML in accelerated phase have rapidly progressive disease and are characteristically unresponsive to existing therapies. Imatinib (formerly STI571) is a rationally developed, orally administered inhibitor of the Bcr-Abl kinase. A total of 235 CML patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 181 had a confirmed diagnosis of accelerated phase. Patients were treated with imatinib at 400 or 600 mg/d and were evaluated for hematologic and cytogenetic response, time to progression, survival, and toxicity. Imatinib induced hematologic response in 82% of patients and sustained hematologic responses lasting at least 4 weeks in 69% (complete in 34%). The rate of major cytogenetic response was 24% (complete in 17%). Estimated 12-month progression-free and overall survival rates were 59% and 74%, respectively. Nonhematologic toxicity was usually mild or moderate, and hematologic toxicity was manageable. In comparison to 400 mg, imatinib doses of 600 mg/d led to more cytogenetic responses (28% compared to 16%), longer duration of response (79% compared to 57% at 12 months), time to disease progression (67% compared to 44% at 12 months), and overall survival (78% compared to 65% at 12 months), with no clinically relevant increase in toxicity.

We have examined the molecular mechanisms that promote the survival of MM cells and have identified a key role for myeloid cell factor-1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. These experiments were initiated by the observation that MM cells were exquisitely sensitive to culture in the presence of actinomycin D: caspase activation occurred within 3 hours of treatment and cells were not protected by interleukin-6, the main MM cell growth and survival factor. Actinomycin D-induced apoptosis was blocked by proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that a labile protein was required for MM cell survival. Further analysis demonstrated that Mcl-1 was likely to be the labile factor governing MM cell survival. Mcl-1 protein levels decreased rapidly after culture in the presence of actinomycin D in concordance with effector caspase activation, but addition of proteasome inhibitors reversed the loss of Mcl-1 and maintained cell viability. The levels of other antiapoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2 and members of the inhibitors-of-apoptosis family, were unaffected by these interventions. Furthermore, Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides caused a rapid down-regulation of Mcl-1 protein levels and the coincident induction of apoptosis, whereas overexpression of Mcl-1 delayed actinomycin D-induced apoptosis with kinetics that correlated with expression levels of Mcl-1. These data indicate that Mcl-1 expression is required for the survival of MM cells and may represent an important target for future therapeutics.","['Zhang, Bin', 'Gojo, Ivana', 'Fenton, Robert G']","['Zhang B', 'Gojo I', 'Fenton RG']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Bressler Research Building, 655 W Baltimore St., Rm 7-023, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 15;99(6):1885-93. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.6.1885.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.6.1885 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38069-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Leukemic transformation of MDS patients was dynamically followed up and the clinical manifestations, peripheral blood and bone marrow pictures, karyotypes, immunophenotypes, response to treatment and prognosis of post MDS acute leukemia (postMDS-AL) were observed. RESULTS: During the past eight year and seven months, 21 (13.91%) of 151 MDS patients progressed to overt leukemia with a median interval of 5 (1 - 21) months. There were no significant differences among the rates of leukemia from RA, RAEB and RAEB-t groups. The transformation was developed either gradually or rapidly. There were five parameters related to the leukemic transformation: under 40 years of age, pancytopenia, more than 0.15 blasts in bone marrow, at least two types of abnormal karyotype and combined chemotherapy. All of the 21 post MDS-AL were acute myeloid leukemia (AML); and most of them were M(2), M(4) and M(5). Two (9.52%) post MDS-AML developed extramedullary infiltration. Leukopenia was found in 47.62% of patients. Two third of the patients, whose bone marrows were generally hypercellular, showed neutropenias. After evolving into AML, 8 (47.06%) patients developed abnormal karyotypes. High expression of immature myeloid antigens, including CD(33) (49.83 +/- 24.50)%, CD(13) (36.38 +/- 33.84)%, monocytic antigen CD(14) (38.50 +/- 24.60)%, and stem cell marker CD(34) (34.67 +/- 30.59)% were found on bone marrow mononuclear cells of post MDS-AML cases. In some cases, lymphoid antigens, such as CD(5), CD(7), CD(9) and CD(19) were coexisted with myeloid antigens. A low complete remission rate (31.25%) and short survival duration with median survival of 6 (1 - 28) months were found in patients with post MDS-AML treated by induction therapy. CONCLUSION: MDS was at high risk of evolving into AML, either gradually or rapidly. Patients with post MDS-AML had specific biologic features and worse prognoses.","['Shi, J', 'Shao, Z', 'Liu, H', 'Li, K', 'Song, L', 'Zhang, Y', 'Zheng, Y', 'Chen, G', 'Chu, Y', 'He, H', 'Zhao, M', 'He, G', 'Feng, B', 'Hao, Y', 'Yang, T', 'Yang, C']","['Shi J', 'Shao Z', 'Liu H', 'Li K', 'Song L', 'Zhang Y', 'Zheng Y', 'Chen G', 'Chu Y', 'He H', 'Zhao M', 'He G', 'Feng B', 'Hao Y', 'Yang T', 'Yang C']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Jul;22(7):351-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The expression of P-gp was analyzed by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibody UIC2, the expressions of mdr1, MRP and Topo II by RT-PCR in 45 AL samples. RESULTS: The expressions of P-gp, mdr1 and MRP were significantly higher in resistant group than that in sensitive group (P < 0.01). The expression of Topo II was lower in resistant group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Logistic regression of univariate analysis showed that the overexpression of P-gp, mdr1 and MRP, the lower expression of Topo II and age over 55 were the prognostic factors of clinical resistance in AL. Sex, initial white blood cell count (WBC), bone marrow (BM) blast percentage and FAB subtypes were not significant for the clinical resistance. Multivariate analysis adjusted by above factors showed that the overexpression of P-gp, mdr1 and MRP, the low expression of Topo II and age over 55 were still highly significant for clinical resistance. It was also found that there were significant correlations between P-gp, mdr1, MRP and complete remission in 36 newly diagnosed AL.

METHODS: The telomerase activity in bone marrow cells of 47 leukemia patients were detected by a semi-quantitative telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP)-silver staining, and the expression of telomerase related genes hEST2, TP1 and hTR by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The telomerase activity and expression of telomerase related genes were significantly higher in 42 leukemia patients in progress stage than that in complete remission/chronic stage and in normal/anemia cases (P < 0.01). The telomerase activity and expression of TP1, hTR gene in 14 cases of acute leukemia complete remission (AL-CR)/chronic myelogenous (CML)-chronic stage were higher than that in normal/anemia cases (P < 0.05). Low levels of telomerase activity and telomerase related genes expression could be detected in part of normal bone marrow cells. The levels of telomerase activity and telomerase related genes expression in 3 cases of anemia increased after short-term culture. CONCLUSIONS: High level of telomerase activity and its related genes expression were specific markers of malignant hematopoietic cells and their changes might be useful for observation of treatment effectiveness in leukemia. Low level of telomerase activity was associated with hematopoietic stem cells with the ability of proliferation. hEST2 gene might be a up-regulation gene of telomerase; hTR might be related to feedback regulation of telomerase.","['Xia, F', 'Yuan, Y', 'Chen, R', 'Liu, P', 'Zhou, H', 'Wang, J']","['Xia F', 'Yuan Y', 'Chen R', 'Liu P', 'Zhou H', 'Wang J']","['Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Feb;22(2):86-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Ten normal controls, seven untreated CGL patients and eleven CGL patients after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) were studied by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) with the FITC fluorescein labeled BCR probe. Conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were also employed. RESULTS: The normal cutoff was defined as less than 6.68% (x +/- 3s) from the analysis of normal controls. The reproduciblity of FISH method was confirmed by serial dilutions by mixing Ph positive cells and normal cells. Forty specimens from 11 CGL patients at 1 week to 6 years post-BMT were investigated after PBSCT and the results showed that (1) FISH and RT-PCR could accurately evaluate Ph (+) cells during early transplantation period (within one month), but RT-PCR was more sensitive in six months after BMT. (2) Residual Ph (+) cells tended to be linear decreasing with the time after transplantation and fell in normal range in most samples three months later. The mean time of normaligation was 57 days (20 to 170 days). (3) One case relapsed and received a second transplantation. FISH presented more precise data for predicting relapse as compared to CCA and RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: I-FISH as a useful tool can not only offer more precise assessment of residual leukemic cells compared with CCA and RT-PCR, but also provide dynamic monitoring during early post-BMT period to evaluate the transplantation outcome and predict relapse.","['Liu, S', 'Li, Q', 'Han, M', 'Pan, W', 'Bo, L', 'Qin, S', 'Liu, X', 'Li, X', 'Qian, L']","['Liu S', 'Li Q', 'Han M', 'Pan W', 'Bo L', 'Qin S', 'Liu X', 'Li X', 'Qian L']","['Institute of Hematology, CAMS and PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2010/05/26 06:00,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2010/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2001 Feb;22(2):68-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BMMNC obtained from the patients were divided into 3 groups to set up Dexter systems: the control group, rhIL-2 containing, and the third group having DC added at day 4. After 10 days of culture, non-adherent cells were harvested and the changes of immunological phenotype and the percentage of P210 positive cells were analyzed. The cytotoxicity were assayed with two-colour flow cytometry. The non-adherent cells from all the 3 systems served as effector cells, those from control system as target cells. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activity against target cells was greater in the DC-activated effector cells than that in rhIL-2-activated ones. The percentages of death cells in target cells were 63.12% versus 42.59% (case 1) and 61.60% versus 21.46% (case 2), respectively.

METHODS: Cell morphology, intracellular DNA distribution, bcl-2 expression and telomerase activity were evaluated in HL-60 and NB4 cells exposed to As(2)O(3) or ATRA. RESULTS: The differentiation induction of HL-60 and NB4 cells by low concentration of As(2)O(3) was weaker than that by ATRA, but downregulation effect of As(2)O(3) on telomerase activity was more strong and quick. Higher concentration of As(2)O(3) induced apoptosis in HL-60 or NB4 cells accompanied by more rapid down regulation of telomerase activity and bcl-2 expression. Neither As(2)O(3) nor ATRA showed direct inhibition effect on telomerase activity.

Bcl-2 may play an important role in these mechanisms.","['Chen, F', 'Xu, G', 'Li, Y', 'Zhang, M']","['Chen F', 'Xu G', 'Li Y', 'Zhang M']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong Medical University, Jinan 250012, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Telomerase/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Jul;21(7):366-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: (1) Treatment of HL-60 cells with bufalin remarkably inhibited the cell growth, the IC(50) value of bufalin for HL-60 cells was 0.025 micromol/L. (2) Apoptosis of HL-60 cells could be efficiently induced by bufalin at concentration of 0.010 micromol/L or higher. (3) Bufalin induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. (4) With G(1) phase cells decreasing, S phase cells increased, and then apoptotic cells increased with a diminution of S phase cells.

TF antigen of U937 cells transfected with pMSCV-PML-RARalpha treated with or without ATRA and As(2)O(3) was detected. RESULTS: CHX treatment completely suppressed the down-regulation effect of ATRA on the TF mRNA expression, Act D inhibition test showed that half-life of TF mRNA in treated NB4 cells was shortened to about 30 min from that of around 60 min in untreated NB4 cells. The TF antigen contents in U937 cells transfected with pMSCV-PML-RARalpha were significantly higher than that in transfected U937 cells with retrovirus vector. Both ATRA and As(2)O(3) could down-regulate the TF antigen level in U937 cells transfected with or without PML-RARalpha. CONCLUSION: The modulation of the TF mRNA expression in NB4 cells by ATRA might be indirect. TF mRNA destabilization was involved in the TF regulation process mediated by ATRA.

METHODS: Data of clinical observation, seven year follow-up survey were analysed with American SAS system software, concentration of arsenic in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was determined by atomic absorbing spectrum. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) and effectiveness rates were 87.9% and 94.4% for the previously untreated group; 60.0% and 65.0% for the relapsed in As(2)O(3) maintenance treatment group; 69.5% and 84.8% for the relapsed in other than As(2)O(3) maintenance treatment group; and 48.7% and 94.1% for the refractory group, respectively. In the previously untreated group, the relapse rate at 3 years after CR was 26.7%. The probability of survival in 136 follow-up survey patients was 92.0% and 76.7% at 5 years and 7 years, respectively. There were mild side effects.

RESULTS: (1) CBMC activated by 10 IU/ml IL-12 produced significant cytotoxic activities which were (27.23 +/- 4.92)% and (29.12 +/- 3.46)% against K562 and Raji cells, respectively; moreover, 10 IU/ml IL-12 could be synergized with the same dose of IL-2 in enhancing the cytotoxicities which were (47.60 +/- 4.60)% and (38.69 +/- 4.86)% against the two target cells, respectively. (2) Short-term incubation with IL-12 activated CBMC increased the cytotoxicity to K562 cells, and long-term incubation increased the cytotoxicity to Raji cells. (3) No NK lytic activity of CBMC could be detected before cytokines stimulation. After stimulated by 10 IU/ml IL-12, NK lytic activity of CBMC was similar to that of PBMC. (4) K562 cells demonstrated obvious apoptosis after cultured with activated CBMC.

In particular, a decrease of the efficacy of treatment has been reported in patients dually infected with S. stercoralis and human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I), both of which are endemic in Okinawa, Japan. However, the factors influencing this resistance remain unclear. In the present study, patients infected with S. stercoralis, with or without HTLV-I infection, were treated with albendazole, followed up for one year and separated into two groups, cured and non-cured. The cure rate of S. stercoralis was lower in HTLV-I carriers (P < 0.05). Serum levels of S. stercoralis-specific IgA, IgE, IgG, IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies were estimated, and a decrease of IgE (P < 0.05) and an increase of IgG4 (P < 0.05) were observed in the non-cured group, especially in HTLV-I carriers. RT-PCR of cytokines using peripheral blood mononuclear cells revealed that S. stercoralis patients with HTLV-I showed a high frequency of expression of IFN-gamma and TGF-beta1, whereas those without HTLV-I showed no expression of these cytokines. IFN-gamma- and TGF-beta1-positive HTLV-I carriers showed a decrease of IgE (P < 0.05), an increase of IgG4 (P < 0.01) and a lower cure rate (P < 0.01) compared with those who were negative for both cytokines. These results suggest that persistent infection with HTLV-I affected S. stercoralis-specific immunity and reduced therapeutic efficacy.","['Satoh, M', 'Toma, H', 'Sato, Y', 'Takara, M', 'Shiroma, Y', 'Kiyuna, S', 'Hirayama, K']","['Satoh M', 'Toma H', 'Sato Y', 'Takara M', 'Shiroma Y', 'Kiyuna S', 'Hirayama K']","['Department of Medical Zoology, Saitama Medical School, Moroyama, Saitama, Japan. satoma@saitama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Anthelmintics)', '0 (Antibodies, Helminth)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'F4216019LN (Albendazole)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Albendazole/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Anthelmintics/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Helminth/blood/immunology', 'Feces/parasitology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunoglobulin E/blood/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic/*complications/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/parasitology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Strongyloides stercoralis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Strongyloidiasis/*complications/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Treatment Failure']",PMC1906331,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2002 Feb;127(2):354-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01733.x.,,,"['1733 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01733.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 50% of patients with PN-MGUS have serum antibodies against peripheral nerve myelin, but the specific role of these antibodies remains uncertain. The aims of the study were to establish, and characterize, myelin-specific B cell clones from peripheral blood of patients with PN-MGUS, by selection of cells bearing specific membrane Ig-receptors for myelin protein P0, using beads coated with P0. P0-coated magnetic beads were used for selection of cells, which subsequently were transformed by Epstein--Barr virus. The specificity of secreted antibodies was tested by ELISA. Two of the clones producing anti-P0 antibodies were selected and expanded. The magnetic selection procedure was repeated and new clones established. The cells were CD5+ positive, although the expression declined in vitro over time. The anti-P0 antibodies were of IgM-lambda type. The antibodies belonged to the VH3 gene family with presence of somatic mutations. The IgM reacted with P0 and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), and showed no evidence for polyreactivity, in contrast to other IgM CD5+ clones included in the study as controls. The expanded clones expressed CD80 and HLA-DR, which is compatible with properties of antigen-presenting cells. The immunomagnetic selection technique was successfully used for isolation of antimyelin protein P0-specific clones. The cell lines may provide useful tools in studies of monoclonal gammopathies, leukaemia, and autoimmune diseases, including aspects of antigen-presentation by these cells followed by T cell activation.","['Kvarnstrom, M', 'Sidorova, E', 'Nilsson, J', 'Ekerfelt, C', 'Vrethem, M', 'Soderberg, O', 'Johansson, M', 'Rosen, A', 'Ernerudh, J']","['Kvarnstrom M', 'Sidorova E', 'Nilsson J', 'Ekerfelt C', 'Vrethem M', 'Soderberg O', 'Johansson M', 'Rosen A', 'Ernerudh J']","['Department of Health and Environment, Linkoping University, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Myelin P0 Protein)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases of the Nervous System/etiology/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelin P0 Protein/*immunology', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Polyneuropathies/etiology/*immunology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",PMC1906329,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 2002 Feb;127(2):255-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01739.x.,,,"['1739 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2249.2002.01739.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the major regulatory elements in the immune system, helper (CD4+) and suppressor (CD8+) T cells are required for recognizing a large scale of surface antigen on tumor cells and subsequently, for mediating the regression of cancers. Many data suggest that T cell immunity system is not intact in different malignant diseases. The malignant disorders of hemopoietic tissue are frequently associated with T cell functional impairment, the mechanism(s) of which is still unresolved. In recent years, defects in immunoregulatory T cell network have been repeatedly proposed as the cause of this alteration and might be considered as a parameter of immunodeficiency in those patients. The additional disturbance of T cell immunoregulatory system may be induced by different extrinsic factors. In this context the chemotherapeutic agents with their non-selective action, including an immunomodulatory activity, should be involved in the evaluation of lymphocyte subset changes during treatment. In this brief review we analyzed the data concerning the T cell subset changes, both numerical and functional, before and in course of the treatment of patients with different hematologic malignancies. According to this consideration, it might be suggested that the immune system of these patients have some capacity to recover from the suppressive effect of chemotherapy, although not sufficiently to be normalized. The long-term monitoring of a larger scale of immunological parameters may probably help us to resolve whether T lymphocyte subset changes are related only to the therapy or, in some instance, might be connected with compromised natural host defence mechanisms in oncohematologic patients.","['Milosevic, D B']",['Milosevic DB'],"['Institute for Oncology and Radiology of Serbia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology']",,2002/03/06 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/03/06 10:00'],"['2002/03/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Dec;20(4):517-22.,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study in an intensive care unit of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: 78 patients with severe haematological malignancy were admitted 97 times between 1990-97 to the medical ICU for septic shock (18), respiratory failure (30), postoperative monitoring (19), cardiovascular (10) and central nervous complications (8) or for other reasons (12). Median age was 43 (4-73) years, average duration of ICU stay was 4 (1-43) days. Forty-two patients required mechanical ventilation, 46 vasopressors and 8 haemodialysis. RESULTS: Rates of ICU admission differed by treatment of the underlying disease. There were 18, 10 and 27 ICU admissions per 100 treatments in patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (p <0.005) respectively. Thirty-two of 78 patients died within 60 days of ICU admission. Organ failure, i.e. cardiovascular failure requiring vasopressors, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and renal failure, requiring haemodialysis, was most significantly associated with outcome. Mortality by day 60 after admission was 16%, 36%, 64%, and 83% (p <0.0002) for patients without organ failure, and for patients with 1, 2 or 3 failing organs. In a multivariate logistical regression model, only the organ failure score (p <0.0005) and evidence of liver damage, defined as ASAT or ALAT >100 IU/ L (p <0.007), but not age, sex, primary disease and treatment of the underlying disease predicted outcome. CONCLUSION: Multi-organ failure and evidence of liver damage but no other patient, disease, or treatment related factor predict outcome in patients with haematological disease admitted to the ICU.","['Evison, J', 'Rickenbacher, P', 'Ritz, R', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Haberthur, C', 'Elsasser, S', 'Passweg, J R']","['Evison J', 'Rickenbacher P', 'Ritz R', 'Gratwohl A', 'Haberthur C', 'Elsasser S', 'Passweg JR']","['Dept. of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Basel, Petersgraben 4, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multiple Organ Failure/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/03/05 10:00,2002/05/10 10:01,['2002/03/05 10:00'],"['2002/03/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/10 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2001 Dec 22;131(47-48):681-6. doi: 2001/47/smw-09801.,,,"['2001/47/smw-09801 [doi]', 'smw-09801 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic viral superantigen 7 reactive Vbeta6+ T cells are able to transfer graft-vs-leukaemia reactivity and to kill specifically viral superantigen 7+ ESb-MP tumour cells in vitro. Here we elucidate the mechanism of this superantigen specific cell lysis. Already 10 min after co-incubation with in vitro stimulated Vbeta6+ T cells, viral superantigen 7+ ESb-MP tumour cells show an apoptotic phenotype (Annexin V-positivity, DNA-fragmentation). This extremely rapid type of cell death is not mediated by the death inducing ligands CD95L, TRAIL and TNF but by perforin and granzyme B. Surprisingly, neither mitochondria nor any of the known caspases appear to be involved in this type of tumour cell killing. In contrast, nitric oxide, released by activated macrophages and endothelial cells, induces in the same tumour cells another type of apoptosis which is much slower and involves mitochondria and caspase activation. A synergistic effect between the two different effector mechanisms of superantigen reactive donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes and nitric oxide releasing host macrophages and endothelial cells might explain the effective immune rejection of even advanced metastasised cancer in this graft-vs-leukaemia animal model.","['Muerkoster, S', 'Weigand, M A', 'Choi, C', 'Walczak, H', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Umansky, V']","['Muerkoster S', 'Weigand MA', 'Choi C', 'Walczak H', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Umansky V']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, G0100, Tumorimmunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Superantigens)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Gzmb protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Granzymes', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Superantigens/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2375320,2002/03/05 10:00,2002/04/03 10:01,['2002/03/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2001/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2001/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Mar 4;86(5):828-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600104.,,,['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600104 [doi]'],['Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial selection of 7669 controls, taken from lists of those registered with a General Practitioner, was representative of the British population in respect to an areal-based index of material deprivation. However, parents of controls agreeing to participate were living in more affluent areas than initially selected controls and their matched 3838 cases. The three components of the deprivation index, persons unemployed, households not owning a car or their home were similarly associated with participation. Other census characteristics, such as proportion of flat dwellers and centrally heated households were also associated with control participation. Population density of the local area was not different between participating controls and their matched cases. However, initially selected controls lived in more urban areas than their cases. Such differences are not unique to this study, as they are an inevitable consequence of incomplete participation.

Stimulation of cell growth and stimulation of the redox system of plasma membranes are correlated. When cell growth is inhibited by antitumor agents such as doxorubicin, capsaicin, and antitumor sulfonylureas, redox activities of the plasma membrane also are inhibited. A doxorubicin-inhibited NADH-quinone reductase was characterized and purified from plasma membranes of rat liver. First, an NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase, which was doxorubicin-insensitive, was removed from the plasma membranes by the lysosomal protease, cathepsin D. After removal of the NADH-cytochrome b(5) reductase, the plasma membranes retained a doxorubicin-inhibited NADH-quinone reductase activity. The enzyme, with an apparent molecular mass of 57 kDa, was purified 200-fold over the cathepsin D-treated plasma membranes. The purified enzyme had also an NADH-coenzyme Q(0) reductase (NADH: external acceptor (quinone) reductase; EC 1.6.5.) activity. Partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme showed that it was unique with no sequence homology to any known protein. Antibody against the enzyme (peptide sequence) was produced and affinity-purified. The purified antibody immunoprecipitated both the NADH-ferricyanide reductase activity and NADH-coenzyme Q(0) reductase activity of plasma membranes and cross-reacted with human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells and doxorubicin-resistant human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562R cells. Localization by fluorescence microscopy showed that the reaction was with the external surface of the plasma membranes.

However, this distinction is clinically important because sporadic adenomas are usually managed by polypectomy alone, whereas IBD-related high-grade dysplasias mandate subtotal colectomy. The current study evaluated the ability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) based on complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray data to discriminate between these 2 types of colorectal lesions. METHODS: We hybridized cDNA microarrays, each containing 8064 cDNA clones, to RNAs derived from 39 colorectal neoplastic specimens. Hierarchical clustering was performed, and an ANN was constructed and trained on a set of 5 IBD-related dysplasia or cancer (IBDNs) and 22 SACs. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering based on all 8064 clones failed to correctly categorize the SACs and IBDNs. However, the ANN correctly diagnosed 12 of 12 blinded samples in a test set (3 IBDNs and 9 SACs). Furthermore, using an iterative process based on the computer programs GeneFinder, Cluster, and MATLAB, we reduced the number of clones used for diagnosis from 8064 to 97. Even with this reduced clone set, the ANN retained its capacity for correct diagnosis. Moreover, cluster analysis performed with these 97 clones now separated the 2 types of lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ANNs have the potential to discriminate among subtly different clinical entities, such as IBDNs and SACs, as well as to identify gene subsets having the power to make these diagnostic distinctions.","['Selaru, Florin M', 'Xu, Yan', 'Yin, Jing', 'Zou, Tong', 'Liu, Thomas C', 'Mori, Yuriko', 'Abraham, John M', 'Sato, Fumiaki', 'Wang, Suna', 'Twigg, Charlie', 'Olaru, Andreea', 'Shustova, Valentina', 'Leytin, Anatoly', 'Hytiroglou, Prodromos', 'Shibata, David', 'Harpaz, Noam', 'Meltzer, Stephen J']","['Selaru FM', 'Xu Y', 'Yin J', 'Zou T', 'Liu TC', 'Mori Y', 'Abraham JM', 'Sato F', 'Wang S', 'Twigg C', 'Olaru A', 'Shustova V', 'Leytin A', 'Hytiroglou P', 'Shibata D', 'Harpaz N', 'Meltzer SJ']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Gastroenterology and Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 77057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 85069/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 47717/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adenoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Adenomatous Polyps/diagnosis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Expert Systems', 'Female', 'HT29 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Stomach Neoplasms/diagnosis']",,2002/03/05 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2002/03/05 10:00'],"['2002/03/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2002 Mar;122(3):606-13. doi: 10.1053/gast.2002.31904.,,,"['S0016-5085(02)35127-8 [pii]', '10.1053/gast.2002.31904 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes and their subsets show variations with race. The aim of this study was to establish reference ranges for lymphocytes and their subsets in an Saudi adult population by using flow cytometry. Blood samples obtained from 209 healthy Saudi men were used for this study. All blood donors were between 18 and 44 years old. Lymphocytes and their subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the absolute and percentage values were calculated. We investigated the expression of T-cell markers (CD3, CD4, and CD8), B cells (CD19), and natural killer cells (CD16 and CD56). The absolute and percent values of each cell subset were compared with published data from different populations by using the Student t test. Reference ranges, each expressed as the mean +/- the standard deviation, were as follows: leukocytes (6,335 +/- 1759), total lymphocytes (2,224 +/- 717), CD3 cells (1,618 +/- 547), CD4 cells (869 +/- 310), CD8 cells (615 +/- 278), CD19 cells (230 +/- 130), and CD3-CD16(+)/CD56+ cells (262 +/- 178). The CD4/CD8 ratio was 1.6 +/- 0.7. Our results for B cells, CD4 cells, and CD8 cells and for the CD4/CD8 ratio fell in between the reported results for Ethiopian and Dutch subjects. Our results were also different from previously reported findings in an Saudi adult population that showed no increase in CD8 T cells. We thus establish here the reference ranges for lymphocytes and their subsets in a large cohort of Saudi men. The CD8 cell count was not abnormally high, as previously reported, and fell in between previous results obtained for African and European populations.","['Al Qouzi, Abdulla', 'Al Salamah, Abdulla', 'Al Rasheed, Reem', 'Al Musalam, Abdulla', 'Al Khairy, Khalid', 'Kheir, Osman', 'Al Ajaji, Sulieman', 'Hajeer, Ali H']","['Al Qouzi A', 'Al Salamah A', 'Al Rasheed R', 'Al Musalam A', 'Al Khairy K', 'Kheir O', 'Al Ajaji S', 'Hajeer AH']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Fahad National Guard Hospital, Riyadh 11426, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol,Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,9421292,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Arabs', 'Flow Cytometry/*standards', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*standards', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Male', 'Reference Values', 'Saudi Arabia']",PMC119953,2002/03/05 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/03/05 10:00'],"['2002/03/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 2002 Mar;9(2):279-81. doi: 10.1128/cdli.9.2.279-281.2002.,,,['10.1128/cdli.9.2.279-281.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we devised a gene therapy approach intended to deliver VEGF-toxin directly to tumor. Antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) served as vehicles to deliver a retroviral VEGF-toxin fusion protein to its specific leukemia cell target in vivo. A retroviral vector was constructed for gene therapy with VEGF positioned downstream of its 27-amino acid leader sequence, which promoted secretion of a catalytic immunotoxin containing either truncated diphtheria toxin or Pseudomonas exotoxin A. VEGF was chosen on the basis of the expression of VEGF receptor on endothelial cells in the tumor neovasculature. The VEGF FP was first expressed and secreted by mammalian NIH 3T3 cells. Intracellular expression of both VEGF and toxin was verified by immunofluorescence. In vitro, supernatants collected from transfected cells specifically inhibited the growth of VEGF receptor-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), but not a control cell line. In vivo findings correlated with in vitro findings. A retroviral vector containing the target gene and a nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) reporter gene was used to transiently transduce T15, a CD8(+) CTL line that specifically recognizes C1498, a lethal C57BL/6 myeloid tumor. Transduced T15 cells injected intravenously significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumor, whereas nontransduced controls did not. Together, these data indicate that gene therapy of T cells with retrovirus containing a VEGF-immunotoxin target gene may be a valid means of inhibiting a broad range of solid tumors dependent on angiogenesis.","['Jin, Ni', 'Chen, Wei', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Ramakrishnan, S', 'Vallera, Daniel A']","['Jin N', 'Chen W', 'Blazar BR', 'Ramakrishnan S', 'Vallera DA']","['Section on Experimental Cancer Immunology, Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01CA71803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA82154/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA85922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*therapeutic use', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphokines/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood supply/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics/therapy', '*Retroviridae', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2002/03/05 10:00,2002/06/06 10:01,['2002/03/05 10:00'],"['2002/03/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2002 Mar 1;13(4):497-508. doi: 10.1089/10430340252809793.,,,['10.1089/10430340252809793 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both B and T lymphocytes are derived from bone marrow stem cells. Lymphocytes are found in normal marrow as single cells and in lymphoid aggregates or follicles. Lymphocytes and precursors are particularly prominent in bone marrow from children in which they may account for up to 40% of the bone marrow cells. The development of hematopoetic cells within the bone marrow (BM) occurs in intimate association with cells of the bone marrow microenvironment. This phenotypically diverse population of connective tissue-type cells includes fibroblasts, macrophages, adipocytes and endothelial cells and, collectively, represents the stromal tissue of the bone marrow. The presence of myoid cells in human bone marrow has been observed during hemopoiesis in embryonic life, whereas during adult life, it is strictly related to different pathologic conditions such as metastatic carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelo-proliferative diseases. Under normal circumstances, lymphoid cells may constitute up to 20% of the population of nucleated cells in the bone marrow. However, there may be an absolute or a relative increase, the latter due to a reduction in hematopoietic tissue, as in some skeletal areas in advancing age, or in hypoplastic conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the presence, distribution and quantitation of cells expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin in the stroma of the BM of patients with nodular type b-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), patients with autoimmune disorders and embryos (gestational age 15 to 25 weeks). For this reason, we investigated the presence of myoid cells (MCs) in a series of 20 trephine bone marrow biopsies from adult patients and ten fetal specimens of the spine and femur, using a monoclonal antibody recognizing alpha-smooth muscle actin, a contractile microfilament expressed exclusively by smooth muscle cells, myofibroblasts and related cells. The results of our study showed that: 1. BM stromal myoid cells represent a distinct subpopulation of reticular cells in the bone marrow, undergoing cytoskeletal remodeling in response to various stimuli (fetuses). 2. The appearance of BM stromal myoid cells is not only seen as a characteristic feature in B-CLL, but is also seen, to a lesser degree, in the stroma of bone marrow in patients with autoimmune disorders. 3. Stromal cells with phenotypic smooth muscle features appear in bone marrow during pathological situations in a manner reminiscent of what occurs during normal development.","['Papadopoulos, N', 'Simopoulos, C', 'Kotini, A', 'Lambropoulou, M', 'Tolparidou, I', 'Tamiolakis, D']","['Papadopoulos N', 'Simopoulos C', 'Kotini A', 'Lambropoulou M', 'Tolparidou I', 'Tamiolakis D']","['Department of Histology-Embryology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Singapore,Eur J Gynaecol Oncol,European journal of gynaecological oncology,8100357,['0 (Actins)'],IM,"['Actins/*analysis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry/physiology', 'Female', 'Fetus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth/*chemistry', 'Pregnancy', 'Stromal Cells/chemistry/physiology']",,2002/03/05 10:00,2002/08/16 10:01,['2002/03/05 10:00'],"['2002/03/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Gynaecol Oncol. 2001;22(6):447-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has not previously been attempted. METHODS: A mortality study within the Whitehaven registration district was set up and death records were abstracted for 1906-1970. They were categorized as death from leukaemias, lymphomas, other cancers and all other causes in persons aged 0-14, 0-24 and 25-84. The number of deaths, death rates and standardized mortality ratios were calculated. RESULTS: The mortality of persons aged 25-84 in Seascale civil parish, Gosforth civil parish and the rest of the Whitehaven district was unremarkable compared with national data 1906-1970. There were no cancer deaths aged 0-24 in Gosforth civil parish during 1906-1970. In Seascale civil parish a hitherto unrecorded childhood cancer case was revealed, dying in 1954. No cancer deaths aged 0-24 were found before that date. In the period 1946-1955 three cancer deaths gave a statistically significant excess owing to non-leukaemia cases, whereas in the period 1956-1965 a statistical excess of all types of leukaemia occurred as a result of two deaths. There was no case excess (based on one leukaemia death) in the period 1966-1970.

This dysregulation results in specific molecular and genetic alterations, including gene amplification, mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements. These aberrations can be measured to provide a novel means to assess carcinogenic risk or as targets for chemointervention. Recent human and in vivo studies have demonstrated that genetic alterations, such as oncogenes and oncoproteins, were observed in preneoplastic tissues or serum following exposure to chemical carcinogens or low-level radiation (LLR). Identification of preneoplastic changes following radiation exposure may provide information that will allow development of LLR chemopreventive strategies. Radiation carcinogenesis studies in vivo with a lung tumor model showed that a low-dose cobalt-60 radiation exposure induced persistent time-dependent genetic alterations, such as elevated ras expression. This radiation exposure also resulted in lung tumor formation in 26% of the irradiated animals at 232 days after irradiation. A significant and progressive increase in ras oncogene expression was measured using Northern blot analysis in 80% of the irradiated animals over the duration of the experiment. Pharmacological intervention strategies are being tested using buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine (BSO). BSO has been previously shown to down-regulate ras expression. Administration of BSO prevented radiation-induced changes in ras mRNA levels in this lung tumor model. Further studies are being conducted with an LLR-induced leukemia model in which detection of circulating levels of oncoproteins will be more feasible. Based on these preliminary results and on its clinical efficacy and low clinical toxicity, BSO warrants further study as an LLR chemopreventive agent. Furthermore, this strategy to target LLR-induced preneoplastic alterations may be an effective means of developing modulators of LLR-induced cancers.","['Miller, Alexandra C', 'Ainsworth, E John', 'Lui, Lei', 'Wang, Thomas J', 'Seed, Thomas M']","['Miller AC', 'Ainsworth EJ', 'Lui L', 'Wang TJ', 'Seed TM']","['Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, 8901 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, MD 20889-5603, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Mil Med,Military medicine,2984771R,['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*prevention & control', 'Oncogenes']",,2002/03/05 10:00,2002/03/21 10:01,['2002/03/05 10:00'],"['2002/03/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mil Med. 2002 Feb;167(2 Suppl):54-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mean lung dose of 101 TBI-conditioned patients was assessed by a thorough (1 SD around 2%) in vivo transit dosimetry technique. Fractionated TBI (10 Gy, 3.33 Gy/fraction, 1 fraction/d, 0.055 Gy/min) was delivered using a lateral-opposed beam technique with shielding of the lung by the arms. The median lung dose was 9.4 Gy (1 SD 0.8 Gy, range 7.8--11.4). The LPCs included idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP) and non-idiopathic IP (non-IIP). RESULTS: Nine LPCs were observed. LPCs were observed in 2 (3.8%) of 52 patients in the group with a lung dose < or = 9.4 Gy and in 7 (14.3%) of 49 patients in the >9.4 Gy group. The 6-month LPC risk was 3.8% and 19.2% (p = 0.05), respectively. A multivariate analysis adjusted by the following variables: type of malignancy (acute leukemia, chronic leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma), type of BMT (allogeneic, autologous), cytomegalovirus infection, graft vs. host disease, and previously administered drugs (bleomycin, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, nitrosoureas), revealed a significant and independent association between lung dose and LPC risk (p = 0.02; relative risk = 6.7). Of the variables analyzed, BMT type (p = 0.04; relative risk = 6.6) had a risk predictive role. CONCLUSION: The mean lung dose is an independent predictor of LPC risk in patients treated with the 3 x 3.33-Gy low-dose-rate TBI technique. Allogeneic BMT is associated with a higher risk of LPCs.","['Della Volpe, Aldo', 'Ferreri, Andres Jose Maria', 'Annaloro, Claudio', 'Mangili, Paola', 'Rosso, Alberto', 'Calandrino, Riccardo', 'Villa, Eugenio', 'Lambertenghi-Deliliers, Giorgio', 'Fiorino, Claudio']","['Della Volpe A', 'Ferreri AJ', 'Annaloro C', 'Mangili P', 'Rosso A', 'Calandrino R', 'Villa E', 'Lambertenghi-Deliliers G', 'Fiorino C']","['Centro Trapianti di Midollo, Ospedale Maggiore di Milano IRCCS, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Injuries/*complications', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects/methods/mortality']",,2002/03/02 10:00,2002/03/12 10:01,['2002/03/02 10:00'],"['2002/03/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2002 Feb 1;52(2):483-8. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(01)02589-5.,,,"['S0360301601025895 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(01)02589-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following the reports that two members of the superfamily of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes, ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A2, were capable of catalyzing the oxidation of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinoic acid with submicromolar Km values, we initiated an investigation of the ability of 4-(N,N-dipropylamino)benzaldehyde (DPAB) to inhibit the oxidation of retinal by purified mouse and human ALDH1A1. RESULTS: Our results show that DPAB potently inhibits retinal oxidation, with IC50 values of 0.11 and 0.13 microM for purified mouse and human ALDH1A1, respectively. Since the HL-60 human myeloid leukemic cell line has been used extensively to study the retinoic acid induced differentiation of HL-60 cells to granulocytes, and ALDH1A1 activity had previously been reported in HL-60 cells, we investigated the ability of DPAB to block differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells exposed to retinal in culture. In HL-60 cells coincubated with 1 microM retinal and 50 microM DPAB for 144 hours, cell differentiation was inhibited only 30%. Furthermore, the NAD-dependent oxidation of propanal or retinal was less than 0.05 nmoles NADH formed/min-10(7) cells in spectrophotometric assays using HL-60 cell extracts. CONCLUSION: Although ALDH1A1 may be the major catalytic activity for retinal oxidation in some retinoid-dependent mouse and Xenopus embryonic tissues and in adult human and mouse hematopoietic stem cells, another catalytic activity appears to synthesize the retinoic acid ligand necessary to stimulate the differentiation of HL-60 cells to end stage granulocytes.","['Russo, James', 'Barnes, Annette', 'Berger, Katie', 'Desgrosellier, Jay', 'Henderson, Jennifer', 'Kanters, Ana', 'Merkov, Lubo']","['Russo J', 'Barnes A', 'Berger K', 'Desgrosellier J', 'Henderson J', 'Kanters A', 'Merkov L']","['Department of Chemistry, Whitman College, Walla Walla, WA 99362, USA. russo@whitman.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Pharmacol,BMC pharmacology,100967806,"['0 (Benzaldehydes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '613-28-5 (4-(N,N-dipropylamino)benzaldehyde)', 'EC 1.2.1 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (ALDH1A1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.2.1.36 (Retinal Dehydrogenase)', 'RR725D715M (Retinaldehyde)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family', 'Animals', 'Benzaldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Retinal Dehydrogenase', 'Retinaldehyde/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",PMC65698,2002/03/02 10:00,2003/12/13 05:00,['2002/03/02 10:00'],"['2001/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/03/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/13 05:00 [medline]', '2002/03/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BMC Pharmacol. 2002;2:4. doi: 10.1186/1471-2210-2-4.

RS usually presents as diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) or its immunoblastic variant, and it can be recognized simultaneously with CLL or even 23 yr after its diagnosis. We describe an unusual case of CLL treated with cladribine (2-CdA) in whom DLCL of the plasmablastic type (PBL) developed 4 yr after CLL (Rai IV) diagnosis and 1.5 yr after the 10th course of 2-CdA treatment. Immmunologic, cytogenetic, and molecular studies performed at the time of CLL and PBL coappearance indicated that both tumors originated from different B-cell progenitors. Both malignancies were refractory to VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone)-based chemotherapy, and only partial response was achieved with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) salvage treatment. However, the patient died 6 months after the occurrence of RS due to rapid progression of PBL. This is the first description of a CLL patient who developed an unusual plasmablastic variant of RS. Recently, the PBL entity has been identified among DLCL associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We suggest that in our CLL patient heavily pretreated with 2-CdA, PBL arose as a second clone due to the prolonged and severe state of the host's immunosuppression. Overall survival with current strategies is poor, and further insight into the natural history, biology, and treatment of PBL are needed.","['Robak, T', 'Urbanska-Rys, H', 'Strzelecka, B', 'Krykowski, E', 'Bartkowiak, J', 'Blonski, J Z', 'Kordek, R', 'Warzocha, K']","['Robak T', 'Urbanska-Rys H', 'Strzelecka B', 'Krykowski E', 'Bartkowiak J', 'Blonski JZ', 'Kordek R', 'Warzocha K']","['Department of Hematology and Department of Oncology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*chemically induced/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Plasma Cells/pathology', 'Syndrome', 'Time Factors']",,2002/03/02 10:00,2002/03/09 10:01,['2002/03/02 10:00'],"['2002/03/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Nov-Dec;67(5-6):322-7. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00592.x.,,,"['592 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00592.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the effect of STI571 at the molecular level we have employed quantitative real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) to measure the amount of BCR-ABL fusion transcript in a series of 19 patients treated with STI571, either in CP(11) or in (AP)(8) of the disease for 3--9 months (median 6 months). Employing this method, which is able to detect at least one BCR-ABL+ cell in 500,000, in serial blood and bone marrow specimens we found decreases in transcript levels in 10/11 CP patients, but only in 1/8 of the AP patients. When present such decreases were gradual and became evident only after 3 months of STI571 treatment, and their kinetics in blood closely mirrored those seen in parallel marrow samples. Moreover, decreases were between 10- and 100-fold in 11/13 patients, with only two patients reaching residual disease levels below 10(-2) (a 900-fold decrease). Thus, no patient reached PCR negativity. We conclude that the RQ-PCR method is a highly suitable tool for following the effect of STI571 in CML and that further validation of the method, performed in a prospective manner, will contribute significantly to the elucidation of the proper role of STI571 in CML.","['Stentoft, J', 'Pallisgaard, N', 'Kjeldsen, E', 'Holm, M S', 'Nielsen, J L', 'Hokland, P']","['Stentoft J', 'Pallisgaard N', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Holm MS', 'Nielsen JL', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Hematology, Arhus University Hospital, Arhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2002/03/02 10:00,2002/03/09 10:01,['2002/03/02 10:00'],"['2002/03/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Nov-Dec;67(5-6):302-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00556.x.,,,"['556 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00556.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, hypo-nutritive conditions are known to promote multi-drug resistance in solid tumours. To understand the importance of nutritive conditions in the development of drug resistance in non-solid tumours and to know whether a transient malnutrition could induce a permanent reduction in drug sensitivity, leukaemic cells were transiently cultured under growth factor-starved conditions. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent human leukaemic MO7e cells were cultured in the absence of granulocyte-macrophage colon-stimulating factor for 2 weeks, during which the majority of the cells died, and the minor viable cells were expanded in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colon-stimulating factor for following 1 week. This procedure was repeated three times, and the surviving cells were cloned by limiting dilution. These clones underwent G1 arrest in the absence of granulocyte-macrophage colon-stimulating factor, while parental cells underwent apoptosis. Interestingly, activities of the downstream targets of granulocyte-macrophage colon-stimulating factor receptor were regulated in a granulocyte-macrophage colon-stimulating factor-independent manner, indicating that the ligand-independent activation of granulocyte-macrophage colon-stimulating factor receptor had not taken place. Moreover, the 4--7-fold increases in IC(50) for etoposide and the 2--6-fold increase in IC(90) for doxorubicin was observed.

Imatinib mesylate, formerly STI571, is a selective inhibitor of this kinase. METHODS: A total of 532 patients with late--chronic-phase CML in whom previous therapy with interferon alfa had failed were treated with 400 mg of oral imatinib daily. Patients were evaluated for cytogenetic and hematologic responses. Time to progression, survival, and toxic effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: Imatinib induced major cytogenetic responses in 60 percent of the 454 patients with confirmed chronic-phase CML and complete hematologic responses in 95 percent. After a median follow-up of 18 months, CML had not progressed to the accelerated or blast phases in an estimated 89 percent of patients, and 95 percent of the patients were alive. Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxic effects were infrequent, and hematologic toxic effects were manageable. Only 2 percent of patients discontinued treatment because of drug-related adverse events, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib induced high rates of cytogenetic and hematologic responses in patients with chronic-phase CML in whom previous interferon therapy had failed.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Sawyers, Charles', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Guilhot, Francois', 'Schiffer, Charles', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Resta, Debra', 'Capdeville, Renaud', 'Zoellner, Ulrike', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Druker, Brian', 'Goldman, John', ""O'Brien, Stephen G"", 'Russell, Nigel', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Facon, Thierry', 'Stone, Richard', 'Miller, Carole', 'Tallman, Martin', 'Brown, Randy', 'Schuster, Michael', 'Loughran, Thomas', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Lazzarino, Mario', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Morra, Enrica']","['Kantarjian H', 'Sawyers C', 'Hochhaus A', 'Guilhot F', 'Schiffer C', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Niederwieser D', 'Resta D', 'Capdeville R', 'Zoellner U', 'Talpaz M', 'Druker B', 'Goldman J', ""O'Brien SG"", 'Russell N', 'Fischer T', 'Ottmann O', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Facon T', 'Stone R', 'Miller C', 'Tallman M', 'Brown R', 'Schuster M', 'Loughran T', 'Gratwohl A', 'Mandelli F', 'Saglio G', 'Lazzarino M', 'Russo D', 'Baccarani M', 'Morra E']","['M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. hkantarj@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Regression Analysis']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2002 Feb 28;346(9):645-52. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa011573.,,,"['10.1056/NEJMoa011573 [doi]', '346/9/645 [pii]']",,,,['N Engl J Med. 2002 Aug 8;347(6):446.

To assess whether HLA-G and HLA-E influence the cytokine production of their putative target cells [large granular lymphocytes (LGL)], we analysed the concentrations of tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-13 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in supernatants of isolated first trimester LGL co-cultured with HLA-G or HLA-E transfected K-562 leukaemia cells lacking the classical HLA class I and II molecules. In comparison with that observed with untransfected K-562 cells, co-culture of LGL with HLA-G-expressing cells significantly reduced the concentration of all cytokines investigated (TNF-alpha, IL-10 and GM-CSF, P < 0.01; IFN-gamma and IL-13, P < 0.05). In contrast, co-culture of LGL with HLA-E-expressing cells significantly (P < 0.01) decreased only IL-10 production, although a strong tendency towards reduced IL-13 levels was also observed. In the co-culture system presented, membrane-bound HLA-G and, to a lesser extent, HLA-E expression affected cytokine release by decidual LGL in a manner not consistent with the Th1/Th2 paradigm. In conclusion, our data are indicative of a general immune-suppressive effect of HLA-G on LGL activity.","['Rieger, L', 'Hofmeister, V', 'Probe, C', 'Dietl, J', 'Weiss, E H', 'Steck, T', 'Kammerer, U']","['Rieger L', 'Hofmeister V', 'Probe C', 'Dietl J', 'Weiss EH', 'Steck T', 'Kammerer U']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Julius-Maximilians-University, Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-E antigen)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Decidua/cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-G Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-13/biosynthesis', 'K562 Cells', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimester, First', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/07/13 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2002 Mar;8(3):255-61. doi: 10.1093/molehr/8.3.255.,,,['10.1093/molehr/8.3.255 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As expected, we observed a rapid dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) within 2 hours of forskolin treatment concomitant with reduced activity of the pRB-specific kinases. Interestingly, however, the dephosphorylation of pRB, as well as the inhibition of the kinase activities, was only transient, despite the permanent arrest of cells in G1. Importantly, although the pRB-specific kinases were fully active after 48 hours, pRB became only partially rephosphorylated. The transient dephosphorylation of pRB could be explained by the transient decrease in the activities of the pRB-specific kinases, but to understand why pRB became only partially rephosphorylated, despite fully activated kinases, we postulated that cAMP could activate a pRB-directed phosphatase. It was therefore interesting to find that the phosphatase inhibitor, tautomycin, was able to abolish the forskolin-mediated dephosphorylation of pRB, without increasing the activities of the pRB-specific kinases. To understand how Reh cells expressing hyperphosphorylated forms of pRB can remain arrested in G1, we used three different methods to test for the ability of pRB to form functional complexes with the family of E2F transcription factors. As expected, we observed an increased complex formation between E2F-1, E2F-4 and pRB after 2 hours when pRB was in its most dephosphorylated state. Surprisingly, however, prolonged treatment with forskolin, which induced partial rephosphorylation of pRB, in fact further increased the complex formation between the E2Fs and pRB, and this also resulted in reduced E2F-promoter activity in vivo. These data imply that in Reh cells, partially phosphorylated forms of pRB retain the ability to inhibit E2F-promoter activity, and thereby prevent cells from entering into S-phase.","['Gutzkow, Kristine Bjerve', 'Naderi, Soheil', 'Blomhoff, Heidi K']","['Gutzkow KB', 'Naderi S', 'Blomhoff HK']","['Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Oslo, PO Box 1112, Blindern, N-0317, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (E2F4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F4 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrans)', '0 (RBL2 protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107)', '0 (Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '109946-35-2 (tautomycin)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Colforsin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclins/drug effects/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'E2F4 Transcription Factor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', '*Proteins', '*Pyrans', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p107', 'Retinoblastoma-Like Protein p130', '*Spiro Compounds', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/07/06 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2002 Mar 1;115(Pt 5):1073-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients being treated for leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 228) completed the Brief Fatigue Inventory to rate fatigue severity and functional interference caused by fatigue. Data on patient demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, other physical symptoms, current treatments, and laboratory values were also collected. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation, and logistic regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the sample reported severe fatigue, which was defined as a ""fatigue worst"" rating of 7 or greater. More patients with acute leukemia (61%) reported severe fatigue compared with those with chronic leukemia (47%) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (46%). Increased fatigue severity significantly compromised patients' general activity, work, enjoyment of life, mood, walking, and relationships with others. Fatigue severity was strongly associated with performance status, use of opioids, blood transfusions, gastrointestinal symptoms, and sleep disturbance items, as well as with low serum hemoglobin and albumin levels. Regression analysis indicated that nausea was the significant clinical predictor of severe fatigue (odds ratio, 13), and low serum albumin was the significant laboratory value predictor (odds ratio, 3.8). CONCLUSION: Disabling fatigue occurs with high frequency in hematologic malignancy, supporting a need to develop better methods of fatigue management. Better control of gastrointestinal and other symptoms may be of benefit. The mechanism and relationship between low albumin and severe fatigue needs to be investigated further, and longitudinal studies of the effects of treatment, host factors, and other symptoms are needed.","['Wang, Xin Shelley', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Mendoza, Tito R', 'Engstrom, Martha C', 'Johnson, Beth A', 'Peterson, Neomi', 'Broemeling, Lyle D', 'Cleeland, Charles S']","['Wang XS', 'Giralt SA', 'Mendoza TR', 'Engstrom MC', 'Johnson BA', 'Peterson N', 'Broemeling LD', 'Cleeland CS']","['Department of Symptom Research, Division of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. swong@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['R01 CA026582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26582/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Serum Albumin)'],IM,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Fatigue/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/04/06 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Mar 1;20(5):1319-28. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.5.1319.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.5.1319 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Total mRNA was isolated from pools of blastocysts and reverse transcription was performed. Triplicate reactions from each sample were displayed, and only consistent banding variations were recorded. Using AFLP-differential display assay, we found that cDNA banding patterns are highly conserved between the 4 groups of blastocysts studied; however, there was a difference of 7% in bands either missing or expressed across the groups. Fifty bands were reamplified, and a sequence comparison search revealed similarity of 14 isolated fragments to ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, 16 matched to described cDNA, and 20 corresponded to unknown sequences that may represent novel genes. The study of 7 differentially expressed mRNAs known to be involved in developmental process in the embryo suggests roles for apoptosis, oxidative stress, gap junctions, and differentiation in the determination of embryo quality.

We studied the toxicity and efficacy of reduced intensity conditioning followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 50 patients over 50 years old or with relative contraindications against myeloablative regimens. Diagnoses were chronic myeloid leukemia (n=15), acute myeloid leukemia (n=9), myelodysplastic syndromes (n=9), lymphoma (n=11) and refractory solid tumors (n=6). Design and Methods. Donors were identical siblings (n=25), non-identical family members (n=6) and unrelated volunteers (n=19). Peripheral blood stem cells (n=36) or bone marrow (n=14) were transplanted. The conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine 180 mg/m(2), busulphan 8 mg/kg and rabbit antithymocyte globulin 40 mg/kg (Fresenius). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was carried out with cyclosporin A (CSA) alone (n=17) or in combination with methotrexate (n=18) or mycophenolate mofetil (n=15). Results. Neutrophil counts >0.5/nL and platelet counts > 20/nL were reached after 17 (range 0-66) and 19 days (range 0-111), respectively. Three graft failures occurred. Fever lasted for a median of 2 days (range 0-15). Six patients developed veno-occlusive disease of the liver. Acute GVHD grade II-IV occurred in 47% of the patients and chronic GVHD in 46%. The 1-year overall survival probability was 44% (95% CI: 30-58%). GVHD-related complications were a major cause of the probability of 1-year non-relapse mortality of 31% (95% CI: 16-46%). Interpretation and Conclusions. In conclusion, the regimen itself can be carried out safely in patients with relative contraindications against myeloablative conditioning. However, GVHD causes significant non-relapse mortality in high risk patients.","['Schetelig, Johannes', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Held, Thomas K', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Krusch, Andreas', 'Zabelina, Tatjana', 'Dubiel, Marc', 'Rick, Oliver', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Zander, Axel R', 'Siegert, Wolfgang']","['Schetelig J', 'Kroger N', 'Held TK', 'Thiede C', 'Krusch A', 'Zabelina T', 'Dubiel M', 'Rick O', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ehninger G', 'Zander AR', 'Siegert W']","['Kliniken fur Innere Medizin m.

The principal aim was to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IDR, which is reported to be a less MDR1-sensitive anthracycline. The short CsA infusion was patterned after the results of a previous in vitro study. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a phase I trial, in which eligible patients received high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) 3 g/m(2)/bd on days 1, 2 and 8, 9, and IDR 12.5-20 mg/m(2)/d on days 3 and 10, with increments of 2.5 mg/m(2)/d from the baseline per treatment group. Intravenous CsA infusion started 4 hours before IDR and lasted 12 hours. Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was added from day 11. IDR MTD was evaluated through analysis of regimen-related toxicity (RRT). RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated (16 AML, 2 ALL; MDR1+: 8/8 studied). Overall response rate was 61%. Toxicity was severe but manageable up to an IDR dose of 17.5 mg/m(2)/d, while grade 4 RRT developed with IDR 20 mg/m(2)/d. High-grade toxicity, not strictly regimen-related, was sometimes observed at lower IDR concentrations in patients with unresolved complications from prior extensive treatments. In keeping, the complete response (CR) rate was 92% (11/12) for patients with an ECOG performance score <2 compared to 0% (0/6) in the others (p=0.000). Apart from that, induction of markedly hypocellular, leukemia-free bone marrow on day 11 was associated with achievement of CR (13 evaluable: CR 8/10 vs 0/3, p=0.035). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: IDR at 17.5 mg/m(2)/d (x2) can be associated with short-course CsA and HDAC for the management of refractory acute leukemias. While this regimen could deserve testing in a larger phase II trial, to document activity in MDR1+ disease, it remains important to select the most suitable patients in order to avoid the occurrence of life-threatening cumulative toxicity.","['Bassan, Renato', 'Lerede, Teresa', 'Borleri, Gianmaria', 'Chiodini, Barbara', 'Rossi, Andrea', 'Buelli, Maurizio', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Viero, Piera', 'Barbui, Tiziano']","['Bassan R', 'Lerede T', 'Borleri G', 'Chiodini B', 'Rossi A', 'Buelli M', 'Rambaldi A', 'Viero P', 'Barbui T']","['Department of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti, largo Barozzi 1, 24100 Bergamo, Italy. basbas@virgilio.it']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Mar;87(3):257-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sample of fresh bone marrow cells taken at diagnosis was recorded as positive when at least 20% of the cells double-stained with specific monoclonal antibodies against CD56 and CD33 antigens. RESULTS: CD56 positivity was demonstrated in 37 cases (21.6%). Its frequency was lower in M4 (6%) and higher in M5 (37%). The median percentage for CD56+ blasts was 56% (range 21-99%). CD56 positivity did not correlate with age, sex, blast count, favorable or unfavorable cytogenetics at diagnosis, nor did it influence the outcome in terms of complete remission (CR) duration (606 vs. 417 days, p=n.s.) or overall survival (OS) (210 vs. 277 days, p= n.s.). In the APL subgroup a significant difference in relapse rate was found at 3 years (71.4% in the CD56 positive group vs. 12% in the CD56 negative group, p=0.005). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that CD56 positivity in APL patients at diagnosis is associated with a worse prognosis, suggesting that close molecular monitoring is necessary in CD56 positive APL patients. In contrast, the prognostic role of CD56 remains uncertain in the other AML subtypes.","['Di Bona, Eros', 'Sartori, Roberto', 'Zambello, Renato', 'Guercini, Nicola', 'Madeo, Domenico', 'Rodeghiero, Francesco']","['Di Bona E', 'Sartori R', 'Zambello R', 'Guercini N', 'Madeo D', 'Rodeghiero F']","['Department of Cellular Therapy and Hematology, Division of Hematology, San Bartolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy. dibona@hemato.ven.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'CD56 Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Mar;87(3):250-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5'-flanking region of the human CD5 gene includes an evolutionarily conserved (TC)n(CA)n microsatellite (MS) of potential utility as a marker for genome instability. The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of the CD5 MS as a marker for instability in different tumor types, particularly in B-cell leukemia and lymphoma. DESIGN AND METHODS: The CD5 MS and a panel of 10 MS markers were analyzed by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method and polyacrylamide sequencing gels. This was done in several hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines, as well as in 28 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 19 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) and 45 head and neck carcinomas (HNC). RESULTS: The frequency of CD5 MS abnormalities found among HNC was similar to that reported for other well known MS markers at loci near known and suspected cancer genes. However, instability at the CD5 MS was the most frequent MS abnormality among B-CLL and MCL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of MS markers at chromosome 11q may be especially informative for genome instability analyses of certain B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.","['Lopez-de la Iglesia, Agusti', 'Calvo, Javier', 'Sanz-Vaque, Llucia', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Places, Lourdes', 'Garcia-Foncillas, Jesus', 'Campo, Elias', 'Vives, Jordi', 'Lozano, Francisco']","['Lopez-de la Iglesia A', 'Calvo J', 'Sanz-Vaque L', 'Colomer D', 'Places L', 'Garcia-Foncillas J', 'Campo E', 'Vives J', 'Lozano F']","[""Institut Clinic d'Infeccions i Immunologia, Institut D'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['CD5 Antigens/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Mar;87(3):235-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consistent with its function during invertebrate development, Notch signaling is proposed to have a central role in lymphoid cell-fate specification. Recent studies show that Notch signaling is a proximal event in T-cell commitment from a common lymphoid progenitor. The role of Notch at later stages of lymphoid development is controversial, but recent data suggest models that may help clarify observations. Current studies suggest that Notch activity is cell-context dependent and interactions between Notch and other environmental receptors are integrated during cell-fate decisions. Furthermore, the requirement for precise regulation of Notch activity is evident from human and murine neoplasms in which dysregulated Notch signaling leads to T-cell leukemia. Future studies that identify the stages of lymphoid development where Notch signaling is physiologically active and the exact targets of Notch signaling that are relevant to lymphopoiesis should significantly improve our understanding of Notch function in T- and B-cell development.","['Izon, David J', 'Punt, Jennifer A', 'Pear, Warren S']","['Izon DJ', 'Punt JA', 'Pear WS']","['TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Subiaco, WA 6008, Australia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Immunol,Current opinion in immunology,8900118,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukopoiesis/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/06/06 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Immunol. 2002 Apr;14(2):192-9. doi: 10.1016/s0952-7915(02)00321-7.,,62,"['S0952791502003217 [pii]', '10.1016/s0952-7915(02)00321-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The loss of the wild-type p53 allele and microsatellite markers of chromosome 11 in thymic lymphomas that developed in the p53 heterozygous (+/-) mouse after irradiation, and the stage at which prelymphoma cells appeared were analysed. RESULTS: The p53 heterozygous mouse developed thymic lymphomas in a dose-dependent manner. The loss of the wild-type p53 allele (loss of heterozygosity; LOH) occurred in almost all thymic lymphomas induced in the irradiated p53 heterozygous mouse. Cytogenetic analysis for the mechanism of LOH strongly suggested that the loss of the wild-type p53 gene in the lymphomas was caused by duplication of the disrupted allele through either homologous recombination or non-disjunctional chromosome duplication. The assay for prelymphoma cells suggested that a critical event in the development of prelymphoma cells occurred at least 3 weeks after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of the wild-type p53 gene in thymocytes of the p53 heterozygous mouse may precede the development of prelymphoma cells after irradiation and be a valuable marker of radiation-induced leukemogenesis.","['Tanaka, K', 'Watanabe, K', 'Mori, M', 'Kamisaku, H', 'Tsuji, H', 'Hirabayashi, Y', 'Inoue, T', 'Yoshida, K', 'Aizawa, S']","['Tanaka K', 'Watanabe K', 'Mori M', 'Kamisaku H', 'Tsuji H', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Inoue T', 'Yoshida K', 'Aizawa S']","['Radiation Hazards Research Group, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, 4-9-1, Anagawa, Inage, Chiba 263-8555, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytogenetics', '*Genes, p53', 'Heterozygote', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*etiology/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/*genetics/prevention & control', 'Precancerous Conditions/etiology/genetics/prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*etiology/*genetics/prevention & control']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/04/04 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/04 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2002 Mar;78(3):165-72. doi: 10.1080/09553000110097965.,,,['10.1080/09553000110097965 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We intended to establish prerequisites for such studies in animal models and to show the feasibility of this approach in rabbits. Isolated articular chondrocytes were retrovirally marked using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a cell-specific marker in order to allow an in vivo follow-up of these cells. METHODS: Chondrocytes from rabbits, sheep, cattle and humans were isolated and infected with murine leukemia virus-derived retroviruses carrying the GFP gene. The influence of the host range of three packaging cell lines (PA317, PT67, PG13), start cell concentrations, number of cell passages and number of infection cycles on the efficiency of infection was investigated. Stability of GFP expression was followed by FACS analysis, confocal imaging and fluorescence microscopy. For in vivo follow-up of GFP expression we used marked allogeneic chondrocyte populations grown on scaffold material and implanted them into full-thickness defects in knee joints of rabbits. RESULTS: Retroviruses from all three packaging cell lines were able to infect rabbit and human chondrocytes, whereas only retroviruses released from PG13 cells were able to infect sheep and bovine chondrocytes efficiently. Optimization of the infection with these viruses resulted in efficiencies of 60-90% GFP-expressing chondrocytes. Populations of 100% marked chondrocytes were obtained by cell sorting. GFP expression stability of such marked chondrocyte populations was followed in monolayer culture and in 3-D culture on different scaffold materials. The expression of GFP was stable on all tested materials for at least 4 weeks. In monolayer culture GFP expression was stable for more than 8 months. In vivo, we observed stable GFP expression in the transplants during a four-week time course. CONCLUSION: Retroviral GFP gene transfer led to long-term expression in chondrocytes from rabbits, sheep, cattle and humans. Transgene expression and the number of implanted chondrocytes remain stable for at least 4 weeks in vivo. This method permits a rapid monitoring of chondrocytes and provides a basis for following the fate of these cells in vivo.","['Hirschmann, F', 'Verhoeyen, E', 'Wirth, D', 'Bauwens, S', 'Hauser, H', 'Rudert, M']","['Hirschmann F', 'Verhoeyen E', 'Wirth D', 'Bauwens S', 'Hauser H', 'Rudert M']","['Orthopedic Department, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, FRG.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,9305697,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage, Articular/*cytology', 'Cattle', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrocytes/*physiology/transplantation', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Markers', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Rabbits', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sheep']",,2002/03/01 10:00,2002/03/12 10:01,['2002/03/01 10:00'],"['2002/03/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/03/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002 Feb;10(2):109-18. doi: 10.1053/joca.2001.0486.,,,"['10.1053/joca.2001.0486 [doi]', 'S1063458401904868 [pii]']",['Copyright 2002 OsteoArthritis Research Society International.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CT findings of 11 leukemic patients with leukemic pulmonary infiltration were compared with those of 22 leukemic patients with other diseases as a control group. Evaluated pulmonary parenchymal CT findings included thickening of bronchovascular bundles and interlobular septa, prominence of peripheral pulmonary arteries, ground-glass opacities, air-space consolidation, and nodules. The CT-pathologic correlations for leukemic infiltration were evaluated in 7 patients. Frequent parenchymal CT findings were thickening of bronchovascular bundles (81.8%), prominence of peripheral pulmonary arteries (81.8%), and non-lobular and non-segmental ground-glass opacities (90.9%). The first two findings were significantly more frequently observed in leukemic infiltration than in the control group, had good interobserver agreement, and corresponded pathologically to leukemic cell infiltration around the pulmonary arteries, bronchi, or bronchioles. Non-lobular and non-segmental ground-glass opacity corresponded to leukemic cell infiltration within alveolar spaces and septa adjacent to the pulmonary arteries or bronchi and also corresponded to hemorrhage, edema, or diffuse alveolar damage. Thickening of bronchovascular bundles and prominence of peripheral pulmonary arteries are CT findings suggestive for leukemic infiltration and correspond to peribronchovascular tumor extension.","['Tanaka, Nobuyuki', 'Matsumoto, Tsuneo', 'Miura, Gouji', 'Emoto, Takuya', 'Matsunaga, Naofumi', 'Satoh, Yutaka', 'Oka, Yoshitomo']","['Tanaka N', 'Matsumoto T', 'Miura G', 'Emoto T', 'Matsunaga N', 'Satoh Y', 'Oka Y']","['Department of Radiology, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, 1-1-1 Minamikogushi, Ube, Yamaguchi 755-8505, Japan. ntanaka@po.cc.yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur Radiol,European radiology,9114774,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lung/*diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2001/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur Radiol. 2002 Jan;12(1):166-74. doi: 10.1007/s003300101013.

Although DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO (at 8q22) cluster in a few introns, the mechanisms of DNA recombination resulting in t(8;21) are unknown. The correlation of specific chromatin structural elements, i.e., topoisomerase II (topo II) DNA cleavage sites, DNase I hypersensitive sites, and scaffold-associated regions, which have been implicated in chromosome recombination with genomic DNA breakpoints in AML1 and ETO in t(8;21) is unknown. The breakpoints in AML1 and ETO were clustered in the Kasumi 1 cell line and in 31 leukemia patients with t(8;21); all except one had de novo AML. Sequencing of the breakpoint junctions revealed no common DNA motif; however, deletions, duplications, microhomologies, and nontemplate DNA were found. Ten in vivo topo II DNA cleavage sites were mapped in AML1, including three in intron 5 and seven in intron 7a, and two were in intron 1b of ETO. All strong topo II sites colocalized with DNase I hypersensitive sites and thus represent open chromatin regions. These sites correlated with genomic DNA breakpoints in both AML1 and ETO, thus implicating them in the de novo 8;21 translocation.","['Zhang, Yanming', 'Strissel, Pamela', 'Strick, Reiner', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Rowley, Janet D']","['Zhang Y', 'Strissel P', 'Strick R', 'Chen J', 'Nucifora G', 'Le Beau MM', 'Larson RA', 'Rowley JD']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA084405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA84405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Binding Sites', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC122474,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/04/27 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/27 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Mar 5;99(5):3070-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.042702899.

We have now studied whether alpha4beta1/H89 interaction affected the response of B-CLL cells to the therapeutic drug fludarabine. B-CLL cells cultured on H89 during treatment with fludarabine showed significantly higher mean viability (P<0.05) than cells cultured on the control polylysine for all doses of drug tested. Similar results were obtained with the EHEB cell line. Analysis of the expression of Bcl-2-family proteins after 48 h of fludarabine treatment revealed that Bcl-xL levels were significantly higher (P<0.05) for cells cultured on H89 than on polylysine and correlated (r=0.56, P<0.05) with the increased cell viability observed on H89 cultures.

In the leukemic cells studied here, stroma-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) led to a significant eightfold increase in transmigration (BCR-ABL-positive BV173 leukemia cell line; P<0.05) and podia formation in all BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cell lines studied (BV173, K562, 32Dp210) and in two of three BCR-ABL-negative lines (HL60, 32D, not KG1a). We could show that SDF-1alpha exposure led to a down-regulation of the gene expression of the chemokine receptors CCR4, CXCR4, and CXCR5, which are associated with cell motility and podia formation, indicating a negative feedback control. In BCR-ABL-positive leukemic cells, the effects of SDF-1alpha on podia formation and cell migration were independent of BCR-ABL-tyrosine kinase activity.

The Children's Cancer Group conducted a case-control study including interviews with parents of 1842 ALL cases diagnosed under the age of 15 years and 1986 individually matched controls. Associations of self-reported parental preconception, in utero, and postnatal X-ray exposure with risk of childhood ALL were examined using odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained from logistic regression models among the overall group of ALL cases as well as immunophenotypic and age-specific subgroups. Overall, in utero pelvimetric diagnostic X-rays were not associated with the risk of pediatric ALL (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7). Childhood ALL, all types combined (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.2) and specific types were also not linked with postnatal diagnostic X-ray exposures. Neither maternal (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.8-1.2) nor paternal (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4) lower abdominal preconception diagnostic X-rays were associated with risk of childhood ALL. Among the multiple comparisons for age-, sex-, and subtype-specific subgroups, we observed an elevated risk of total ALL among children ages 11-14 at diagnosis (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.0) in relation to in utero pelvimetric diagnostic X-ray exposures and a small increase in pre-B ALL for all ages combined (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7) in relation to postnatal diagnostic X-rays. In utero diagnostic ultrasound tests were not linked with risk of childhood ALL. We found little consistent evidence that in utero diagnostic ultrasound tests or X-rays were linked with an increased risk of childhood ALL. Small increases in total or pre-B ALL risks for children in selected age groups to very low ionizing radiation exposures from postnatal or preconception diagnostic X-ray exposures may represent chance findings or biases. Future studies of diagnostic X-rays and childhood leukemia in the United States will require extensive additional efforts and resources to quantify risk because of declining in utero exposures in the general population (thus necessitating large numbers of subjects, particularly cases) and the difficulty in validating reported exposures.","['Shu, Xiao Ou', 'Potter, John D', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Severson, Richard K', 'Han, Dehui', 'Kersey, John H', 'Neglia, Joseph P', 'Trigg, Michael E', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Shu XO', 'Potter JD', 'Linet MS', 'Severson RK', 'Han D', 'Kersey JH', 'Neglia JP', 'Trigg ME', 'Robison LL']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. xiao.ou.shu@vanderbilt.edu']",['eng'],['CA 48051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Pelvimetry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology/immunology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Ultrasonography, Prenatal/*adverse effects', 'X-Rays/*adverse effects']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2002 Feb;11(2):177-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To establish a system to study the activity of cis-acting cellular regulatory sequences, we deleted the viral enhancer in EGFP-carrying retroviral vectors and replaced it with cell type-specific elements. In this study, we use this system to demonstrate the activity of the human CD2 lymphoid-specific and the Tie2 endothelial cell type-specific enhancers in cell lines and in primary cells transduced by retroviral vectors. Furthermore, we compare findings obtained with EGFP as the reporter gene to those obtained replacing EGFP with d2EGFP, an unstable variant of EGFP characterized by a much shorter half-life compared to EGFP, and by reduced accumulation in the cells. d2EGFP-carrying vectors were generated at titers which were not different from those generated by the corresponding vectors carrying EGFP. Moreover, the activity of a Moloney murine leukemia virus enhancer could be readily detected following transduction of target cells with either EGFP- or d2EGFP-carrying vectors. However, the activity of the relatively weak CD2 and Tie2 enhancers was exclusively detected using EGFP as the reporter gene. These findings indicate that enhancer replacement is a feasible and promising approach to address the function of cell type-specific regulatory elements in retroviral vectors carrying the EGFP gene.","['Indraccolo, Stefano', 'Roni, Valeria', 'Zamarchi, Rita', 'Roccaforte, Francesca', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Stievano, Laura', 'Habeler, Walter', 'Marcato, Novella', 'Tisato, Veronica', 'Tosello, Valeria', 'Chieco-Bianchi, Luigi', 'Amadori, Alberto']","['Indraccolo S', 'Roni V', 'Zamarchi R', 'Roccaforte F', 'Minuzzo S', 'Stievano L', 'Habeler W', 'Marcato N', 'Tisato V', 'Tosello V', 'Chieco-Bianchi L', 'Amadori A']","['IST-Viral and Molecular Oncology Section, Via Gattamelata, 64 - 35128, Padua, Italy. stefano.indraccolo@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['A.126/Telethon/Italy', 'A.128/Telethon/Italy']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/15 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 2002 Jan 23;283(1-2):199-208. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00857-5.,,,"['S0378111901008575 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(01)00857-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interaction of these repetitive DNA with genes in normal individuals and in patients with Y-chromosome-related genetic anomalies is still an unresolved issue and is actively being pursued. The fast changing scenario of the human genome project is likely to effect our overall understanding of the Y chromosome and Y-linked genetic anomalies in a big way. We provide a brief overview of the organization of Y chromosome with respect to several important loci encompassing both the arms and their likely involvement/modulation in genetic anomalies.

The maintenance of telomeres is essential for chromosomal stability. Telomerase is regulated by human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). c-Myc oncoprotein is also implicated in the positive regulation of hTERT expression. We show here that two clones of hTERT-transfected K562 erythroleukemia cells have elongated telomeres (22.5 and 24.0 kb), whereas telomere length of both c-Myc-transfected K562 cells and parental K562 cells is 6.5 kb. Telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA expression increased in hTERT-transfected K562 cells, while the expression levels of telomerase activity and hTERT in c-Myc-transfected K562 cells were similar to that in parental K562 cells, despite an overexpression of c-Myc. Importantly, we found that hTERT-transfected K562 cells are protected against apoptosis induced by serum deprivation and double-stranded DNA break inducing agents (ionizing irradiation, and etoposide (VP-16)), but not against DNA synthesis inhibitors (1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and hydroxyurea).

Idarubicin (4-demethoxydaunorubicin; Ida), a semisynthetic derivative of daunorubicin (Dnr) is more potent than the parent compound in vitro and in vivo. The equitoxic dose of Ida in patients is about one-fourth of that of Dnr. We compared these drugs regarding cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and resistance mechanisms in human leukaemic cell lines. Cytotoxicity was studied by means of the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and drug-induced apoptosis by means of the Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate method at similar intracellular concentrations (extracellular concentrations of 0.35 microM for Ida and 1 microM for Dnr). Ida was at least twice as potent as Dnr in MOLT-4, HL60, CEM, and K562 cell lines. It took 8 h for Ida to induce approximately 20% apoptosis, but at least 22 h for Dnr to reach 20% apoptosis at identical intracellular concentration. Ida induces a faster and higher apoptosis rate compared with Dnr. The human chronic myelogenous leukaemia cell line (K562) was selected for resistance to Dnr and Ida with and without verapamil (Ver). Continuous incubation with Dnr, but not with Ida, led to an increased mdr1 gene expression as assessed by real-time PCR. The development of mdr1 gene expression in Dnr-resistant cells could be reversed by the presence of Ver. Ver also reversed the cytotoxicity to Dnr, but not to Ida, in K562/Dnr cells. The results show that Ida is more effective than Dnr in inducing apoptosis and that there are differences in resistance mechanisms between the drugs.","['Lotfi, Kourosh', 'Zackrisson, Anna Lena', 'Peterson, Curt']","['Lotfi K', 'Zackrisson AL', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Medicine and Care, Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, 581 85 Linkoping, Sweden. kuolo@imv.liu.se']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/09 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2002 Apr 25;178(2):141-9. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00824-2.,,,"['S0304383501008242 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00824-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data of this type are usually employed to create a prediction mechanism for the response based on gene expression, and to identify a subset of relevant genes. This defines a regression setting characterized by a dramatic under-resolution with respect to the predictors (genes), whose number exceeds by orders of magnitude the number of available observations (samples). We present a dimension reduction strategy that, under appropriate assumptions, allows us to restrict attention to a few linear combinations of the original expression profiles, and thus to overcome under-resolution. These linear combinations can then be used to build and validate a regression model with standard techniques. Moreover, they can be used to rank original predictors, and ultimately to select a subset of them through comparison with a background 'chance scenario' based on a number of independent randomizations.

A simultaneous clustering parameter is defined as a function theta=Phi(P) of the true data generating distribution P, and an estimate is obtained by applying this function to the empirical distribution P(n). We illustrate that a wide range of clustering procedures, including generalized hierarchical methods, can be defined as parameters which are compositions of individual mappings for clustering patients and genes. This framework allows one to assess classical properties of clustering methods, such as consistency, and to formally study statistical inference regarding the clustering parameter. We present results of simulations designed to assess the asymptotic validity of different bootstrap methods for estimating the distribution of Phi(P(n)).

METHODS: Three normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 4 human myelomonocytic leukemic cell lines including J6-1, J6-2, K562 and HL-60 were studied using ABC immunoperoxidase assay, indirect immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, Western blot and reverse enzyme-linked DNA-protein interaction assay (reverse ELDIA). RESULTS: M-CSF was noticed to be localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus and at the cell membrane in 4 human leukemic cell lines; expression of M-CSF was not detected in normal human PBMCs without PHA stimulation. Human PBMCs stimulated by PHA expressed a low level of M-CSF. Frequencies of membrane bound M-CSF expression in J6-1, J6-2, K562 and HL-60 were 71.6%, 69.7%, 42.7% and 57.4% respectively. Frequencies of cytoplasm and nucleus associated M-CSF were 65.7%, 45.4%, 36.5% and 72.5% respectively. The cytosolic bound M-CSF was expressed in J6-1 cell as four isoforms with a molecular weight of 14,000, 16,000, 20,000 and 44,000. While nucleus associated M-CSF expressed as two isoforms with a molecular weight of 16,000 and 20,000. Anti-M-CSF monoclonal antibody could dramatically inhibit proliferation of leukemic cells and its inhibitory effect was related to the levels of membrane bound M-CSF expression in leukemic cells. Reverse ELDIA showed that M-CSF could bind with DNA in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of M-CSF isoforms is heterogeneous and polymorphous in leukemic cells. Membrane bound M-CSF is crucial for the proliferation of leukemic cells, which might be a DNA-bound protein and could be involved in the transformation and tumorigenesis of hematopoietic cells.","['Tang, S', 'Du, X', 'Chen, G', 'Rao, Q', 'Geng, Y', 'Wu, K']","['Tang S', 'Du X', 'Chen G', 'Rao Q', 'Geng Y', 'Wu K']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,0005331,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis/immunology', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2004/09/25 05:00,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi. 2000 Apr;29(2):111-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of resistant strains during ciprofloxacin prophylaxis may be a predisposing factor for S. mucilaginosus septicemia. There was no evidence of a nosocomial spread of S. mucilaginosus strains.","['Granlund, Margareta', 'Linderholm, Mats', 'Norgren, Mari', 'Olofsson, Carin', 'Wahlin, Anders', 'Holm, Stig E.']","['Granlund M', 'Linderholm M', 'Norgren M', 'Olofsson C', 'Wahlin A', 'Holm SE']",['Department of Clinical Bacteriology.'],['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,,,,,1996/02/01 00:00,2002/02/28 10:00,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 1996 Feb;2(3):179-185. doi: 10.1016/s1198-743x(14)65140-5.,,,"['S1198-743X(14)65140-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s1198-743x(14)65140-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, breast-feeding is the major route for mother-to-child transmission of Human T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Virus type I (HTLV-I). HTLV-I transmission by breast milk is associated with ingestion of infected cells and can be prevented by formula-feeding. Breast-feeding transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) has only been recently recognized as responsible for one to two thirds of mother-to-child transmission in breast-fed populations. A primary HIV-1 infection acquired in mothers after the baby has begun breast-feeding is associated with a particularly high risk of transmission. Breast milk transmission appears to result from the coexistence of HIV-1 and an inadequate humoral response in milk. Due to the dramatic impact of formula-feeding on child morbidity and mortality, it is suggested that present recommendation continue to promote breast-feeding in women living in settings where infectious diseases and malnutrition are the primary causes of infant deaths, as in many developing countries. On the other hand, in settings where infectious diseases and malnutrition are not the primary causes of infant deaths, as in most of the developed world, mothers with a proven HIV-1 infection should be advised not to breast-feed their babies.","['van De Perre, Philippe', 'Cartoux, Michel']","['van De Perre P', 'Cartoux M']","['Laboratory of Retrovirology and Epidemiology and Operational Research Unit, Centre Muraz, Organisation de Coordination et de Cooperation pour la Lutte Contre les Grandes Endemies (OCCGE), Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,,,,,1995/09/01 00:00,2002/02/28 10:00,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 1995 Sep;1(1):6-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.1995.tb00017.x.,,,"['S1198-743X(14)65206-X [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-0691.1995.tb00017.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY: A brief survey questionnaire was mailed to a random sample of 2000 physicians, nurses, and social workers who were active members of their respective oncology associations. RESULTS: A total of 1241 questionnaires were returned (62% reply rate), resulting in a final sample of 1180 HCPs (61% response rate). Among HCPs who referred patients to cancer organizations, the American Cancer Society (ACS; 83%), the National Cancer Institute (NCI; 55%), and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society ([formerly Leukemia Society of America] 42%) ranked at the top. More than 70% of HCPs indicated that they had heard about specific ACS programs and services or the NCI information hotline. Less than 60% of HCPs recommended or thought these same services were helpful to patients. Awareness, referrals, and attitudes toward cancer support services among HCPs were significantly related (P <.001). Qualitative comments qualified quantitative results. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Although a surprising number of HCPs were aware of support services, fewer recommended or reported satisfaction with these services. HCPs' referrals and attitudes toward cancer psychosocial support services may be improved by assembling a concise directory of locally available resources, directing this information to HCPs who refer directly to cancer organizations, improving collaboration between agencies, increasing staff support, and targeting particular services in specific areas of the country for program monitoring and development.","['Matthews, B Alex', 'Baker, Frank', 'Spillers, Rachel L']","['Matthews BA', 'Baker F', 'Spillers RL']","['Behavioral Research Center, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia 30329-4251, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Pract,Cancer practice,9312355,,,"['*Awareness', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Health Services Research', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms', '*Oncology Service, Hospital', '*Self-Help Groups', 'Workforce']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/07/19 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Pract. 2002 Jan-Feb;10(1):36-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-5394.2002.101010.x.,,,"['cpa101010 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-5394.2002.101010.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glucocorticoids are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents in asthma therapy and induce cell apoptosis. Since T-lymphocytes are critically involved in airway inflammation in asthma, the effects of fluticasone propionate (FP) on apoptosis in unstimulated and in interleukin (IL)-2 stimulated peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (PBTs) isolated from 14 normal and 19 mild-to-moderate asthmatic subjects were evaluated. Apoptosis was evaluated by: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation electrophoresis, DNA content, annexin V binding, apoptosis related markers (Fas, B-cell lymphona leukaemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bax, and CD25), and by electron microscopy. FP induced apoptosis in unstimulated PBTs of normal and asthmatic subjects in a time-dependent fashion. In asthma, this effect was associated with a significant decrease of Bcl-2 expression, and with an increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. In PBTs of asthmatics, FP also reduced Fas and CD25 expression. Moreover, in IL-2-stimulated PBTs from both asthmatics and normal subjects, FP was able to induce apoptosis and to reduce Bcl-2, Fas and CD25 expression, whereas negligible effects were detected on Bax expression. This study shows that the glucocorticosteroid, fluticasone, increases apoptosis and modulates expression of apoptosis-related markers in unstimulated and in interleukin-2 stimulated T-lymphocytes. This points towards a potential mechanism by which fluticasone exerts its anti-inflammatory effects.","['Melis, M', 'Siena, L', 'Pace, E', 'Gjomarkaj, M', 'Profita, M', 'Pirazzoli, A', 'Todaro, M', 'Stassi, G', 'Bonsignore, G', 'Vignola, A M']","['Melis M', 'Siena L', 'Pace E', 'Gjomarkaj M', 'Profita M', 'Pirazzoli A', 'Todaro M', 'Stassi G', 'Bonsignore G', 'Vignola AM']","['Istituto di Fisiopatologia Respiratoria, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur Respir J,The European respiratory journal,8803460,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Anti-Asthmatic Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CUT2W21N7U (Fluticasone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Androstadienes/*pharmacology', 'Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Asthma/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis', 'Fluticasone', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur Respir J. 2002 Feb;19(2):257-66. doi: 10.1183/09031936.02.00239202.,,,['10.1183/09031936.02.00239202 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all vertebrates, a common set of APPs is increased and exerts essential protective functions. Haptoglobin (HP), one of the major APPs, acts as a high-affinity hemoglobin-binding protein and antioxidant. Liver is the major site of HP synthesis; however, regulated, low level expression is also detected in other organs. Induction of the Hp gene is mediated by interleukin-6-type cytokines and is synergistically enhanced by glucocorticoids. Growth stimulation of hepatic cells in vivo or in vitro suppresses the Hp gene-inducing effects of inflammatory cytokines. Receptors for IL-6 cytokines mediate induction of the Hp gene by the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) and CAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta), but attenuate the stimulation through co-activated STAT5 and mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK-1 and ERK-2. The specificity by which the related cytokines, IL-6, oncostatin M, and leukemia inhibitory factor, regulate Hp gene transcription is determined by the profile of the cytokine receptor subunits expressed on the target cells and the relative extents by which these receptors activate the intracellular signaling pathways. The current hypothesis is that HP exerts an anti-inflammatory activity and that by the degree with which HP attenuates the inflammatory process, including the production of IL-6 cytokines, it determines the level and duration of acute phase expression of the Hp gene.","['Wang, Y', 'Kinzie, E', 'Berger, F G', 'Lim, S K', 'Baumann, H']","['Wang Y', 'Kinzie E', 'Berger FG', 'Lim SK', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],['DK33886/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Redox Rep,Redox report : communications in free radical research,9511366,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Haptoglobins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/08/21 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/21 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Redox Rep. 2001;6(6):379-85. doi: 10.1179/135100001101536580.,,,['10.1179/135100001101536580 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite intense efforts to characterize the gene at the molecular level, little is known about the genetic events that switch on gene expression in P-glycoprotein-negative cells. Recent studies have shown that the transcriptional competence of MDR1 is often closely associated with DNA methylation. Chromatin remodeling and modification targeted by the recognition of methylated DNA provide a dominant mechanism for transcriptional repression. Consistent with this epigenetic model, interference with DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase activity alone or in combination can reactivate silent genes. In the present study, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation to monitor the molecular events involved in the activation and repression of MDR1. Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (5-azacytidine [5aC]) and histone deacetylase (trichostatin A [TSA]) were used to examine gene transcription, promoter methylation status, and the chromatin determinants associated with the MDR1 promoter. We have established that methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is involved in methylation-dependent silencing of human MDR1 in cells that lack the known transcriptional repressors MBD2 and MBD3. In the repressed state the MDR1 promoter is methylated and assembled into chromatin enriched with MeCP2 and deacetylated histone. TSA induced significant acetylation of histones H3 and H4 but did not activate transcription. 5aC induced DNA demethylation, leading to the release of MeCP2, promoter acetylation, and partial relief of repression. MDR1 expression was significantly increased following combined 5aC and TSA treatments. Inhibition of histone deacetylase is not an overriding mechanism in the reactivation of methylated MDR1. Our results provide us with a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanism necessary for repression of MDR1.","['El-Osta, Assam', 'Kantharidis, Phillip', 'Zalcberg, John R', 'Wolffe, Alan P']","['El-Osta A', 'Kantharidis P', 'Zalcberg JR', 'Wolffe AP']","['Sir Donald & Lady Trescowthick Research Laboratories, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, St. Andrews Place, East Melbourne, Victoria 3002, Australia. s.el-osta@pmci.unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (MBD2 protein)', '0 (MBD2 protein, human)', '0 (MBD3 protein, human)', '0 (MECP2 protein, human)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (MBD4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'CpG Islands/drug effects', '*DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing/physiology', 'Genes, MDR/*physiology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology', 'Xenopus laevis']",PMC135609,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Mar;22(6):1844-57. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.6.1844-1857.2002.,,,['10.1128/MCB.22.6.1844-1857.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The highly conserved N-terminal BTB (bric a brac, tramtrack, broad complex)/POZ domain of PLZF plays a critical role in this disease, since it is required for transcriptional repression by the PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein. The crystal structure of the PLZF BTB domain revealed an obligate homodimer with a highly conserved charged pocket formed by apposition of the two monomers. An extensive structure-function analysis showed that the charged pocket motif plays a major role in transcriptional repression by PLZF. We found that mutations of the BTB domain that neutralize key charged pocket residues did not disrupt dimerization, yet abrogated the ability of PLZF to repress transcription and led to the loss of interaction with N-CoR, SMRT, and histone deacetylases (HDACs). We extended these studies to the Bcl-6 protein, which is linked to the pathogenesis of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. In this case, neutralizing the charged pocket also resulted in loss of repression and corepressor binding. Experiments with purified protein showed that corepressor-BTB interactions were direct. A comparison of the PLZF, Bcl-6, and the FAZF (Fanconi anemia zinc finger)/ROG protein shows that variations in the BTB pocket result in differential affinity for corepressors, which predicts the potency of transcriptional repression. Thus, the BTB pocket represents a molecular structure involved in recruitment of transcriptional repression complexes to target promoters.","['Melnick, Ari', 'Carlile, Graeme', 'Ahmad, K Farid', 'Kiang, Chih-Li', 'Corcoran, Connie', 'Bardwell, Vivian', 'Prive, Gilbert G', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Melnick A', 'Carlile G', 'Ahmad KF', 'Kiang CL', 'Corcoran C', 'Bardwell V', 'Prive GG', 'Licht JD']","['Division of Hematology, The Derald H.

This association with histone deacetylase activity provides an important component of the mechanism that allows DNA-binding proteins interacting with N-CoR or SMRT to repress transcription of specific target genes. Both N-CoR and SMRT are important targets for cell signaling pathways, which influence their expression levels, subcellular localization and association with other proteins.

Since BZ is associated with leukemia in humans, it suggests that oxidative DNA base damage rather than SB may be important in the development of leukemia.","['Vestergaard, Sys', 'Loft, Steffen', 'Moller, Peter']","['Vestergaard S', 'Loft S', 'Moller P']","['Institute of Public Health, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Nitrates)', '0 (Nitrites)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.25.1 (Deoxyribonuclease (Pyrimidine Dimer))', 'EC 3.1.25.1 (NTH protein, E coli)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.23 (DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA-Formamidopyrimidine Glycosylase', '*Deoxyribonuclease (Pyrimidine Dimer)', 'Drug Interactions', 'Endodeoxyribonucleases/metabolism', '*Escherichia coli Proteins', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Nitrates/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Nitrites/metabolism']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2003/02/25 04:00,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/02/25 04:00 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2002 Mar 1;32(5):481-4. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(02)00742-6.,,,"['S0891584902007426 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(02)00742-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously described such a recombinant envelope, which is able to extend the tropism of an ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (MLV) envelope to MHC I-expressing human cells. Although, this envelope was very efficient in binding human cells, it yielded very low infection titers. Our attempts to improve these yields by the additional cloning of a variety of spacers in the proximity of the single-chain variable fragment (ScFv) moiety did not significantly influenced human titers, although some alterations on murine titers were observed. To examine whether these low yields represent a decreased fusion capacity of the recombinant envelopes, we performed an assay which allowed the direct comparison between the fusiogenicity of the wild-type (w/t) and the chimeric envelopes. No fusiogenicity of the chimeric envelopes was observed when chimera-expressing cells were co-cultured with human cells. The inability of the chimeras to induce fusion after binding of the ScFv moiety to its ligand may explain, in part, the low infection titers on human cells. However, the several-fold differences observed between the titers of the w/t envelope and the various chimeras on murine cells were not reflected on their fusiogenic potentials, which were all in the same order of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that the binding of the ScFv moiety to its ligand induces no fusion, albeit its insertion into the envelope does not alter the intrinsic fusiogenic ability of the latter. Induction of fusion results from the binding of the envelope to the ecotropic receptor, without being directly proportional to its binding affinity. Chimeras with different infection titers on murine cells yielded similar syncytia counts after their binding to the ecotropic receptor.","['Karavanas, Georgios', 'Marin, Mariana', 'Bachrach, Estanislao', 'Papavassiliou, Athanasios G', 'Piechaczyk, Marc']","['Karavanas G', 'Marin M', 'Bachrach E', 'Papavassiliou AG', 'Piechaczyk M']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, UMR 5535 IFR 24, CNRS, 1919 route de Mende, 34293 Montpellier Cedex 05, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Membrane Fusion/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/30 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2002 Feb 26;83(1-2):57-69. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00419-1.,,,"['S0168170201004191 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00419-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now report that also the median plasma levels of the Factor Xa (FXa)-TFPI complex were significantly higher in patients with solid tumours, compared to patients with haematological malignancy and healthy controls. There were significant positive correlations between the FXa-TFPI complex and total TFPI antigen (r=.47, P=.001) and TFPI activity (r=.33, P<.023). In plasma samples from patients with solid tumours, the ratio between the FXa-TFPI complex and free TFPI was 3.4 times higher than in patients with haematological malignancies. Increased levels of the FXa-TFPI complex in solid tumour disease may reflect both increased FXa generation and the increased TFPI concentration in the patients.

The experiments reported here constitute the first successful demonstration that cell-specific entry can be obtained by screening a random library of retroviral envelope proteins produced from a mammalian cell system. The library consisted of 10(6) different subgroup A feline leukemia virus envelope protein variants with 10 randomly substituted amino acids in the receptor-determining region. Selecting the library for fully functional envelope proteins able to mediate stable gene transfer resulted in the identification of a single envelope protein variant (EF). Subsequent examination of the host range of EF revealed that it was highly specific for D17 canine osteosarcoma cells. This was in contrast to the host ranges of the parental subgroup A and closely related subgroup C envelope proteins. Interference assays on D17 cells further indicated that receptor usage by EF was also altered compared with the A and C envelope proteins. The EF envelope protein thus isolated should be useful for studying gene therapy treatments of osteosarcoma in a large-animal model.,"['Bupp, Keith', 'Roth, Monica J']","['Bupp K', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],['R01CA49932/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Dogs', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', '*Peptide Library', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2002 Mar;5(3):329-35. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2002.0546.,,,"['10.1006/mthe.2002.0546 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(02)90546-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that up to 3% of cells within an HMWMAA-positive tumor xenograft were infected following a single injection of targeted vector into the tumor and up to 10% of tumor cells became infected when they were co-injected with viral producer cells. No infected cells were detected after delivery of targeted vectors to HMWMAA-negative tumor xenografts. Intraperitoneal injection of amphotropic vectors or producer cells resulted in transduction in spleen and liver, which was not detected when targeted vectors or producer cells were used.

Based upon in vitro synergy of gemcitabine/cisplatin and 5-FU/cisplatin, we hypothesized that the addition of cisplatin could improve the objective response rate of gemcitabine and 5-FU with manageable toxicity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and a Cancer and Leukemia Group B performance status of 0 to 2 were enrolled. Ten had received prior systemic therapy. Treatment consisted of gemcitabine 600 mg/m2 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Continuous infusion 5-FU was given from day 1 to day 21. RESULTS: No complete responses and one partial response were observed for an objective response rate of 5% (95% confidence interval 0% to 24%). Two minor responses (25% to 50% regression) were also observed. The median overall survival was 10 months with 35% of patients surviving at 1 year. Grade 3-4 myelosuppression (mostly thrombocytopenia) occurred in nine (43%) patients. Nausea/vomiting and neuropathy were dose-limiting in an additional five patients. Only 51% of treatment cycles were delivered on time and without dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of cisplatin to gemcitabine and 5-FU did not improve the objective response rate of gemcitabine and 5-FU alone and added to the toxicity. Due to the cumulative toxicity, further trials with this cisplatin-containing regimen in RCC are not indicated.","['George, C M', 'Vogelzang, N J', 'Rini, B I', 'Geoffroy, F J', 'Kollipara, P', 'Stadler, W M']","['George CM', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Rini BI', 'Geoffroy FJ', 'Kollipara P', 'Stadler WM']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637-1470, USA. cgeorge@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM07003/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/09/17 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2002 Jan;13(1):116-20. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdf008.,,,"['10.1093/annonc/mdf008 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)62758-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results indicate that the negative impact of this drug is particularly severe during the reconsolidation stage, when families are exhausted with coping with the intensity of treatment. Thus, the administration of dexamethasone is a critical point in the pathway of care for children with ALL. The emotional consequences of the drug are profoundly disturbing, not only for the child, but for the whole family. The findings indicate that the period when dexamethasone is being administered is an important time for providing families with emotional support and information about likely sequelae of treatment.

METHODS: Because one-third of patients had insufficient serum asparaginase activity time courses after a single dose of 1000 U/m(2) PEG-asparaginase during reinduction treatment, a dose of 2500 U/m(2) PEG-asparaginase, which is the approved dosage in Germany, was used in 39 reinduction and 20 relapse patients to determine whether prolongation of the activity time course may be possible with this higher dose, and to look for significant differences between reinduction and relapse patients. RESULTS: After 1, 2 and 3 weeks, the mean activities were 1113 +/- 699 U/l, 231 +/- 259 U/l, and 13 +/- 35 U/l in the reinduction patients, and 1078 +/- 649 U/l, 165 +/- 195 U/l and 19 +/- 28 U/l in the relapse patients, respectively. There were a considerable number of patients with a substantially shortened activity time course in both groups. In 10 of 39 reinduction patients and in 7 of 24 doses during relapse treatment, only activities <100 U/l were found after 1 week with a further fast decline. No statistically significant differences between the two patient groups could be shown at any time-point. CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of these data with activities after 1000 U/m(2) PEG-asparaginase showed no prolongation of the time with activity in the therapeutic range with the higher dose. Therefore, for a longer duration of therapeutic activity, administration of further doses is mandatory.","['Muller, Hans-Joachim', 'Beier, Rita', 'da Palma, Joao Casimiro', 'Lanvers, Claudia', 'Ahlke, Elvira', 'von Schutz, Volker', 'Gunkel, Martin', 'Horn, Alexander', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Henze, Gunter', 'Kranz, Karen', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Muller HJ', 'Beier R', 'da Palma JC', 'Lanvers C', 'Ahlke E', 'von Schutz V', 'Gunkel M', 'Horn A', 'Schrappe M', 'Henze G', 'Kranz K', 'Boos J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University of Munster, Germany. muellerb@mailer.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/04/03 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Feb;49(2):149-54. doi: 10.1007/s00280-001-0391-5.

As there are only limited data in the literature about the distribution of doxorubicin in children, we assessed the peak plasma concentrations of doxorubicin in pediatric patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected 87 plasma samples at the end of infusion from 27 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with 30 mg/m(2) doxorubicin as a 1- or 2-h infusion once weekly for four weeks in the ALL-BFM 95 or NHL-BFM 95 protocol. Plasma concentrations of doxorubicin were quantified by capillary electrophoresis, and the peak plasma levels for a uniform 2-h infusion were calculated. RESULTS: The geometric mean of all samples was 273 microg/l with a geometric coefficient of variation of 46.0%. This is in accordance with the peak plasma concentrations expected from simulations based on literature data from adults. High inter-individual as well as substantial intra-individual variability was observed. Girls had slightly higher peak plasma levels than boys. Age, weight, and body mass index as well as laboratory parameters had no influence on the peak plasma concentrations. No cumulation of doxorubicin during therapy was observed. CONCLUSION: The peak plasma concentrations are similar in adults and children for both the absolute values as well as the variability; this indicates that there are no major differences in the distribution of doxorubicin in children and adults.","['Hempel, Georg', 'Flege, Silke', 'Wurthwein, Gudrun', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Hempel G', 'Flege S', 'Wurthwein G', 'Boos J']","['Institut fur Pharmazeutische Chemie, Westfalische Wilhems-Universitat, Munster, Germany. hempege@uni-muenster.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sex Factors']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/04/03 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2001/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2002 Feb;49(2):133-41. doi: 10.1007/s00280-001-0392-4.

The level of deoxycytidine kinase mRNA showed a fourfold increase (88.3 plus minus 4.33 amol &mgr;g of total RNA) at 3 days after treatment with IL-3 compared to control (20.3 plus minus 4.33 amol &mgr;g).

Myxoma virus, a member of the Poxviridae family responsible for rabbit myxomatosis, can down-modulate the expression of MHC-I molecules, but the viral factor(s) has not been described. We cloned and characterized a gene coding for an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein containing an atypical zinc finger and two transmembrane domains, which we called myxoma virus leukemia-associated protein (MV-LAP). MV-LAP down-regulated surface MHC-I and Fas-CD95 molecules upon transfection; the mechanism probably involves an exacerbation of endocytosis and was lost when the ER retention signal was removed. In addition, the lytic activity of MHC-I-restricted antigen-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) against myxoma virus-infected antigen-presenting target cells was significantly reduced, revealing a strong correlation between MHC-I down-regulation by MV-LAP and CTL killing in vitro. In vivo experiments with a knockout virus showed that MV-LAP is a virulence factor, potentially involved in the immunosuppression characteristic of myxomatosis. Data bank analysis revealed that MV-LAP has homologs in herpesviruses and other poxviruses. We propose the name ""scrapins"" to define a new group of ER-resident surface cellular receptor abductor proteins.

When mice were immunized by DNA-based immunization with Tax expression plasmids, solid tumor formation upon subcutaneous inoculation of EL4 cells expressing green fluorescent protein-fused Tax (Gax) under the control of the HTLV-1 enhancer was strongly inhibited, and in vitro analysis showed that DNA immunization elicited cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses but not production of antibodies to Tax protein. Since EL4/Gax cells inoculated into DNA-immunized mice were not completely eradicated but were maintained as small solid tumors for a long period, there appeared to be a certain equilibrium between CTL activity and the growth of Gax-expressing cells. With such a balance, expression of the Gax gene in EL4/Gax cells was strongly suppressed. These results suggested that gene expression under the control of the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat and Tax is silenced in vivo, resulting in an equilibrium between viral expression and the host immune system.

Whereas HTLV-1 is the causative agent of an aggressive T-cell leukemia, HTLV-2 has been associated with only a few cases of lymphoproliferative disorders. Tax1 and Tax2 are the transcriptional activators of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively. Here we show that Tax2 transformed a Rat-1 fibroblast cell line to form colonies in soft agar, but the size and number of the colonies were lower than those of Tax1. Use of a chimeric Tax protein showed that the C-terminal amino acids 300 to 353 were responsible for the high transforming activity of Tax1. Activation of cellular genes by Tax1 through transcription factor NF-kappa B is reportedly essential for the transformation of Rat-1 cells. Tax2 also activated the transcription through NF-kappa B in Rat-1 cells, and such activity was equivalent to that induced by Tax1. Thus, the high transforming activity of Tax1 is mediated by mechanisms other than NF-kappa B activation. Our results showed that Tax2 has a lower transforming activity than Tax1 and suggest that the high transforming activity of Tax1 is involved in the leukemogenic property of HTLV-1.","['Endo, Keiichi', 'Hirata, Akira', 'Iwai, Kousuke', 'Sakurai, Mamoru', 'Fukushi, Masaya', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Hall, William W', 'Gejyo, Fumitake', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Endo K', 'Hirata A', 'Iwai K', 'Sakurai M', 'Fukushi M', 'Oie M', 'Higuchi M', 'Hall WW', 'Gejyo F', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Transfection']",PMC135979,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/30 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Mar;76(6):2648-53. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.6.2648-2653.2002.,,,['10.1128/jvi.76.6.2648-2653.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we tested whether the chemoprotection conferred by expression of the tyrosine-22 variant DHFR could be used for more effective therapy of the 32Dp210 murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). 32Dp210 tumor cells were found to be sensitive to methotrexate (MTX) in vitro, whereas cells expressing the tyrosine-22 DHFR gene were protected from MTX at up to micromolar concentrations. MTX administered at low dose (2 mg/kg/day) did not protect normal C3H-He/J mice from 32Dp210 tumor infused intravenously, with drug toxicity limiting the administration of higher doses. Animals engrafted with transgenic tyrosine-22 DHFR marrow were protected from greater MTX doses (up to 6 mg/kg/day). However, the increased doses of MTX afforded by drug-resistance gene expression surprisingly resulted in decreased survival of the transplanted tumor-bearing animals, with increased levels of tumor detected in peripheral blood. This apparent exacerbation of tumor progression by MTX was not observed in DHFR transgenic mice in which all cells and tissues contain the drug-resistance gene. This suggests that increased tumor progression in MTX-administered animals resulted from MTX sensitivity of a nonhematopoietic host component, thus allowing tumor expansion. We conclude that MTX exacerbates tumor progression in the 32Dp210 model of CML, and that based on this model alternate DHFR inhibitors combined with drug-resistant DHFR or other chemotherapeutic agent/drug-resistance gene combinations may be required for the application of drug-resistance gene expression to the treatment of CML.","['Sweeney, Colin L', 'Diers, Miechaleen D', 'Frandsen, Joel L', 'Gunther, Roland', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M', 'McIvor, R Scott']","['Sweeney CL', 'Diers MD', 'Frandsen JL', 'Gunther R', 'Verfaillie CM', 'McIvor RS']","['Gene Therapy Program, Institute of Human Genetics, Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA60803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA77598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*toxicity', 'Hematocrit', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Organ Size/drug effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2002 Mar;300(3):1075-84. doi: 10.1124/jpet.300.3.1075.,,,['10.1124/jpet.300.3.1075 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the possible effects of gonadotropins and cAMP on the expression of GATA-binding protein genes in testicular cells. Unexpectedly, FSH negatively regulated GATA-1 (but not GATA-4) mRNA in a dose-dependent manner in primary cultures of rat Sertoli cells isolated from 21-d-old animals. GATA-1 mRNA was also negatively regulated by cAMP in a dose- and time-dependent manner in MA-10, a mouse Leydig tumor cell line. When 0.3 mM cAMP was administered to MA-10 cell cultures for 4 h, more than 95% of the GATA-1 mRNA and protein was abolished. The reduction of GATA-1 mRNA by cAMP can be mimicked by treatment with forskolin, which elevates intracellular cAMP levels. The inhibitory effect of cAMP was specific to the GATA-1 gene, given that GATA-4 and alpha-tubulin mRNA levels were not changed by any of the cAMP treatments. Inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA, on the other hand, was evidently increased by cAMP treatment in both MA-10 and Sertoli cells. However, inhibin alpha-subunit mRNA levels were elevated at 60-90 min before the suppression of GATA-1 mRNA detected. The inhibitory effect of cAMP on GATA-1 mRNA and protein was shown to be specific to testicular cells. The GATA-1 mRNA expressed in MEL, a mouse erythroid leukemia cell line, was not affected by cAMP. The reduction of GATA-1 mRNA by cAMP can be prevented when a translational inhibitor, cycloheximide, is added. In summary, we demonstrated that gonadotropins via cAMP negatively regulate the mRNA and protein levels of GATA-1, but not GATA-4, in testicular cells. The inhibitory effect on GATA-1 gene expression was specific to testicular cells and was not observed in erythroid cells.","['Zhang, Zhifang', 'Wu, Ai Zhen', 'Feng, Zong-Ming', 'Mruk, Dolores', 'Cheng, C Yan', 'Chen, Ching-Ling C']","['Zhang Z', 'Wu AZ', 'Feng ZM', 'Mruk D', 'Cheng CY', 'Chen CL']","['Population Council, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['DK-34449/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 HD-13541/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gonadotropins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gonadotropins/*physiology', 'Leydig Cell Tumor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sertoli Cells/metabolism', 'Testicular Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/*genetics']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2002 Mar;143(3):829-36. doi: 10.1210/endo.143.3.8688.,,,['10.1210/endo.143.3.8688 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Osteopontin (OPN), a component of extracellular matrix, is elevated during neointimal formation in the vessel wall and is synthesized by macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms regulating OPN gene expression by PPARgamma in THP-1 cells, a cell line derived from human monocytic leukemia cells. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that exposure of THP-1 cells to PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) increases OPN mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner. PMA-induced OPN expression was significantly decreased by troglitazone (Tro) and other PPARgamma ligands. Transient transfection assays of the human OPN promoter/luciferase construct showed that PPARgamma represses OPN promoter activity, and the PPARgamma-responsive region within the OPN promoter lies between -1000 and -970 relative to the transcription start site. Site-specific mutation analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that a homeobox-like A/T-rich sequence between -990 and -981, which functions as a binding site for PMA-induced nuclear factors other than PPARgamma, mediates the repression of OPN expression by Tro. Furthermore, concatenated A/T-rich sequences conferred the PPARgamma responsiveness on the heterologous promoter. Taken together, these data suggest that PPARgamma ligand inhibits OPN gene expression through the interference with the binding of nuclear factors to A/T-rich sequence in THP-1 cells.","['Oyama, Yuko', 'Akuzawa, Nobuhiro', 'Nagai, Ryozo', 'Kurabayashi, Masahiko']","['Oyama Y', 'Akuzawa N', 'Nagai R', 'Kurabayashi M']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Chromans)', '0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (SPP1 protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['AT Rich Sequence/*physiology', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Ligands', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Osteopontin', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Troglitazone']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/02/28 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2002 Feb 22;90(3):348-55. doi: 10.1161/hh0302.105098.,,,['10.1161/hh0302.105098 [doi]'],,,,['Circ Res. 2002 Feb 22;90(3):241-3.

However, when combined with the current clinically approved drug humanized anti-Tac, therapy with PS-341 was associated with a complete remission in a proportion of treated animals, whereas only a partial response was observed in animals treated with humanized anti-Tac alone.","['Tan, Chalet', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Tan C', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nfkbia protein, mouse)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'CUJ2MVI71Y (Daclizumab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Daclizumab', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology/metabolism']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Feb 15;62(4):1083-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WK175, a member of this class, was chosen as a model compound that showed strong in vitro efficacy. WK175 interferes with the intracellular steady-state level of NAD(+), resulting in a decreased cellular NAD(+) concentration. We found that WK175 induces apoptotic cell death without any DNA-damaging effect. The apoptotic death signaling pathway initiated by WK175 was examined in detail: mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, caspase 3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and the appearance of a sub-G(1) cell cycle population were determined in time course studies in THP-1 (a human monocytic leukemia cell line) cells. We found activation of this cascade after 24 h of treatment with 10 nM WK175. Induction of apoptosis was prevented by bongkrekic acid, Z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone, and Z-Leu-Glu-His-Asp-fluoromethylketone, inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition and of caspase 3 and 9, respectively, but not by Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CHO, a specific caspase 1 inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of the permeability transition pore, caspase 3, and caspase 9 in the WK175-induced apoptotic cascade. These results imply that decreased NAD(+) concentration initiates the apoptotic cascade, resulting in the antitumor effect of WK175.","['Wosikowski, Katja', 'Mattern, Karin', 'Schemainda, Isabel', 'Hasmann, Max', 'Rattel, Benno', 'Loser, Roland']","['Wosikowski K', 'Mattern K', 'Schemainda I', 'Hasmann M', 'Rattel B', 'Loser R']","['Pharmacology Department, Klinge Pharma, 81673 Munich, Germany. katja.wosikowski@wilex.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (WK175)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '11076-19-0 (Bongkrekic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bongkrekic Acid/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'NAD/*metabolism', '*Organic Chemicals', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Feb 15;62(4):1057-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, more than 40 distinct translocations have been cytogenetically described, of which 13 have now also been characterized at the molecular level. These studies revealed the generation of in-frame fusion genes between different domains of ETV6 and partner genes encoding either kinases or transcription factors. However, in a number of cases-including a t(6;12)(q23;p13), the recurrent t(5;12)(q31;p13), and some cases of the t(4;12)(q11-q12;p13) described in this work-functionally significant fusions could not be identified, raising the question as to what leukemogenic mechanism is implicated in these cases. To investigate this, we have evaluated the genomic regions at 4q11-q12 and 5q31, telomeric to the breakpoints of the t(4;12)(q11-q12;p13) and t(5;12)(q31;p13). The homeobox gene GSH2 at 4q11-q12 and the IL-3/CSF2 locus at 5q31 were found to be located close to the respective breakpoints. In addition, GSH2 and IL-3 were found to be ectopically expressed in the leukemic cells, suggesting that expression of GSH2 and IL-3 was deregulated by the translocation. Our results indicate that, besides the generation of fusion transcripts, deregulation of the expression of oncogenes could be a variant leukemogenic mechanism for translocations involving the 5' end of ETV6, especially for those translocations lacking functionally significant fusion transcripts.","['Cools, Jan', 'Mentens, Nicole', 'Odero, Maria D', 'Peeters, Pieter', 'Wlodarska, Iwona', 'Delforge, Michel', 'Hagemeijer, Anne', 'Marynen, Peter']","['Cools J', 'Mentens N', 'Odero MD', 'Peeters P', 'Wlodarska I', 'Delforge M', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Marynen P']","['Human Genome Laboratory, Center for Human Genetics-Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Gsh2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gsx2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics/physiology']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 1;99(5):1776-84. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.5.1776.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.5.1776 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38174-X [pii]']",,,"['GENBANK/AF306343', 'GENBANK/AF306344']",,,,,,,,,,,

STI571 inhibits this activity and modulates the transcription of several genes. It was shown by differential display that the suppressor of cytokine signaling-2 (SOCS-2) gene was down-regulated by STI571 treatment in 14 of 16 BCR-ABL-positive cell lines and in 2 BCR-ABL-transfected murine lines, but not in BCR-ABL-negative counterparts. The effect was maximal at 2 hours and persisted for at least 24 hours after exposure to 1 microM STI571, whereas SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 expression were unaffected. Baseline levels of SOCS-2 were significantly higher in BCR-ABL-positive as compared with BCR-ABL-negative cell lines. It was similar in leukocytes and CD34(+) cells from healthy persons (n = 44) and patients with CML in chronic phase (CP; n = 60) but significantly increased in patients with CML in blast crisis (BC; n = 20) (P <.0001). Mononuclear cells (MNCs) from 3 of 4 patients with CML in BC showed a 2-fold to 12-fold down-regulation of SOCS-2 levels on in vitro exposure to STI571; moreover, a 2-fold to 11-fold decrease in SOCS-2 was observed in MNCs from 7 of 8 patients with CML in BC who responded to treatment with STI571. Refractoriness to STI571 or relapse after initial response was accompanied by augmentation of SOCS-2 expression. Ectopic overexpression of SOCS-2 in 32Dp210 cells slowed growth, inhibited clonogenicity, and increased their motility and sensitivity to STI571. Overall, the results suggest that SOCS-2 is a component of a negative feedback mechanism; it is induced by Bcr-Abl but cannot reverse its overall growth-promoting effects in blastic transformation.","['Schultheis, Beate', 'Carapeti-Marootian, Melina', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Weisser, Andreas', 'Goldman, John M', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Schultheis B', 'Carapeti-Marootian M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Weisser A', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['Department of Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS2 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Feedback, Physiological/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proteins/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Trans-Activators', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 1;99(5):1766-75. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.5.1766.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.5.1766 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38173-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEL/PDGF beta R transforms interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent Ba/F3 and 32D cells to IL-3 independence and induces a murine myeloproliferative disease in a bone marrow transplantation model of leukemogenesis. The fusion protein encodes a constitutively activated, cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that activates multiple signal transduction pathways. To identify the signaling pathways that are necessary for transformation by TEL/PDGF beta R, transformed Ba/F3 and 32D cells were studied. TEL/PDGF beta R activates the kinase activity of phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase and stimulates phosphorylation of its downstream substrates, including Akt and p70S6 kinase. Activation of this pathway requires the kinase activity of TEL/PDGF beta R and is inhibited by the PDGF beta R inhibitor, STI571. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3 kinase with the pharmacologic inhibitor, LY294002, inhibits growth of the transformed cells. Treated cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle within 16 hours but do not undergo apoptosis. To study the mechanism of cell cycle arrest by LY294002, the activity of the cdk4 complex, which regulates the transit of cells from the G1 to S phase in hematopoietic cells, was examined. Both STI571 and LY294002 lead to a decrease in the activity of cdk4 kinase activity and a decrease in expression of both Cyclin D2 and Cyclin E within several hours. These studies demonstrate the presence of a signaling pathway from TEL/PDGF beta R to PI3 kinase and subsequently to regulation of the cdk4 kinase complex.

Other immunophenotypic characteristics included both negative (CD16, CD57, CD116, and CD117) and positive (CD36, CD38, CD45 at low levels, CD45RA, CD68, CD123, and HLA DR) markers. The prognosis was rapidly fatal in the absence of chemotherapy. Complete remission was obtained in 18 of 23 (78%) patients after polychemotherapy. Most patients had a relapse in less than 2 years, mainly in the bone marrow, skin, or central nervous system. Considering these clinical and biologic features, the conclusion is made that CD4(+)CD56(+) malignancies constitute a genuine homogeneous entity. Furthermore, some therapeutic options were clearly identified. Finally, relationships between the pure cutaneous indolent form of the disease and acute leukemia as well as with the lymphoid/myeloid origin of the CD4(+)CD56(+) malignant cell are discussed.","['Feuillard, Jean', 'Jacob, Marie-Christine', 'Valensi, Francoise', 'Maynadie, Marc', 'Gressin, Remy', 'Chaperot, Laurence', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Brignole-Baudouin, Francoise', 'Drenou, Bernard', 'Duchayne, Eliane', 'Falkenrodt, Annie', 'Garand, Richard', 'Homolle, Emanuelle', 'Husson, Bernard', 'Kuhlein, Emilienne', 'Le Calvez, Genevieve', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Sotto, Marie-France', 'Trimoreau, Franck', 'Bene, Marie-Christine']","['Feuillard J', 'Jacob MC', 'Valensi F', 'Maynadie M', 'Gressin R', 'Chaperot L', 'Arnoulet C', 'Brignole-Baudouin F', 'Drenou B', 'Duchayne E', 'Falkenrodt A', 'Garand R', 'Homolle E', 'Husson B', 'Kuhlein E', 'Le Calvez G', 'Sainty D', 'Sotto MF', 'Trimoreau F', 'Bene MC']","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Hopital Avicenne, Universite Paris 13 Bobigny, France. jean.feuillard@avc.ap-hop-paris.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/analysis/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/immunology', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/immunology/pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 1;99(5):1556-63. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.5.1556.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.5.1556 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38147-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this prospective study, samples from 478 patients with CD10(+) B-cell precursor ALL (c-ALL and pre-B ALL) underwent BCR-ABL reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis with double testing of positive samples. Patients were stratified according to the PCR result and treated in 2 German Multicenter Trials of Adult ALL. The outcome was followed and the prognostic impact of BCR-ABL was compared to clinical risk features. Of the 478 samples, 432 had an evaluable BCR-ABL result. Thirty-seven percent of the c-ALL and pre-B ALL patients were BCR-ABL(+) (p190, 77%; p210, 20%; simultaneous p190/p210, 3%). BCR-ABL positivity was associated with the high-risk features of older age (45 years versus 30 years median age; P =.0001) and higher white blood cell counts (23 500/microL versus 11 550/microL; P =.0001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed BCR-ABL as the leading factor for a poor prognosis (P =.0001) in comparison to clinical risk criteria. Irrespective of the breakpoint, presence of any BCR-ABL transcript predicted a lower chance of initial treatment response (68.4% versus 84.6%; P =.001) and a lower probability of disease-free survival at 3 years (0.13 versus 0.47; P =.0001). This bad outcome was not influenced by postinduction high-dose treatment stratifications. The results show a high prevalence of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts with predominance of p190. BCR-ABL RT-PCR is confirmed as a sensitive, rapid method to diagnose t(9;22), and p190 and p210 are unequivocally demonstrated as the most important predictors of poor long-term survival despite intensified chemotherapy.","['Gleissner, Beate', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Janssen, Bart', 'Rieder, Harald', 'Janssen, Johannes W G', 'Fonatsch, Christa', 'Heyll, Axel', 'Voliotis, Dimitris', 'Beck, Joachim', 'Lipp, Thomas', 'Munzert, Gerd', 'Maurer, Jurgen', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Thiel, Eckhard']","['Gleissner B', 'Gokbuget N', 'Bartram CR', 'Janssen B', 'Rieder H', 'Janssen JW', 'Fonatsch C', 'Heyll A', 'Voliotis D', 'Beck J', 'Lipp T', 'Munzert G', 'Maurer J', 'Hoelzer D', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Benjamin Franklin, Free University of Berlin, Germany. gleisner@zedat.fu-berlin.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 1;99(5):1536-43. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.5.1536.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.5.1536 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38144-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,['German Multicenter Trials of Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Group'],,,,

To improve the results, IFN-alpha has been combined with other treatments, but so far only the association with low-dose arabinosyl cytosine (LDAC) has been shown to increase the response rate and to prolong survival. Here are reported the results of a study of 538 Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML patients who were assigned at random to treatment with IFN-alpha 2a alone or in combination with LDAC. The scheduled dose of IFN-alpha 2a was 5(6) IU/m(2)/d. The scheduled dose of AC was 40 mg/d for the first 10 days of each month of treatment. The efficacy endpoints were a complete hematologic response rate at 6 months (62% in the IFN-alpha-plus-LDAC arm versus 55% in the IFN-alpha arm; P =.11), major cytogenetic response (MCgR) rate at 24 months (28% versus 18%; P =.003), and overall survival (5-year survival, 68% versus 65%; P =.77). Treatment did not affect overall survival within different prognostic risk groups: low, intermediate, or high. Also the duration of MCgR was identical. The results of this study confirm the results of a similar French study only for the response rate, not for survival, suggesting that the relationship between cytogenetic response and survival may be extremely variable and that a meta-analysis of these and other studies of IFN-alpha versus IFN-alpha plus LDAC is required to settle the issue of the role of LDAC in the treatment of CML.","['Baccarani, Michele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'de Vivo, Antonio', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Fiacchini, Mauro', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Tura, Sante']","['Baccarani M', 'Rosti G', 'de Vivo A', 'Bonifazi F', 'Russo D', 'Martinelli G', 'Testoni N', 'Amabile M', 'Fiacchini M', 'Montefusco E', 'Saglio G', 'Tura S']","['L. and A.

Here, we report the highly frequent expression of CCR4 in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-immortalized T cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that ATL and HTLV-1-immortalized T-cell lines consistently expressed CCR4. Inducible expression of HTLV-1 transcriptional activator tax in a human T-cell line Jurkat did not, however, up-regulate CCR4 mRNA. In vitro immortalization of peripheral blood T cells led to preferential outgrowth of CD4(+) T cells expressing CCR4. We further demonstrated highly frequent expression of CCR4 in fresh ATL cells by (1) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of CCR4 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ATL and healthy controls; (2) flow cytometric analysis of CCR4-expressing cells in PBMCs from patients with ATL and healthy controls; (3) CCR4 staining of routine blood smears from patients with ATL; and (4) an efficient migration of fresh ATL cells to the CCR4 ligands, TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22, in chemotaxis assays. Furthermore, we detected strong signals for CCR4, TARC, and MDC in ATL skin lesions by RT-PCR. Collectively, most ATL cases have apparently derived from CD4(+) T cells expressing CCR4. It is now known that circulating CCR4(+) T cells are mostly polarized to Th2 and also contain essentially all skin-seeking memory T cells. Thus, HTLV-1-infected CCR4(+) T cells may have growth advantages by deviating host immune responses to Th2. CCR4 expression may also account for frequent infiltration of ATL into tissues such as skin and lymph nodes.","['Yoshie, Osamu', 'Fujisawa, Ryuichi', 'Nakayama, Takashi', 'Harasawa, Hitomi', 'Tago, Hideaki', 'Izawa, Dai', 'Hieshima, Kunio', 'Tatsumi, Youichi', 'Matsushima, Kouji', 'Hasegawa, Hitoshi', 'Kanamaru, Akihisa', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Yamada, Yasuaki']","['Yoshie O', 'Fujisawa R', 'Nakayama T', 'Harasawa H', 'Tago H', 'Izawa D', 'Hieshima K', 'Tatsumi Y', 'Matsushima K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Kanamaru A', 'Kamihira S', 'Yamada Y']","['Department of Microbiology, Kinki University School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. o.yoshie@med.kindai.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chemokines, CC/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/pharmacology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Receptors, CCR4', 'Receptors, Chemokine/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Skin/metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/physiology/virology']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Mar 1;99(5):1505-11. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.5.1505.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.5.1505 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38138-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infected primary epithelial cells have been isolated from sweat gland and oral mucosae of HTLV-1-infected human patients. In the present study, epithelial neoplasms developed in two rabbits experimentally infected with a molecular clone of HTLV-1 (strain K30p). Serologic detection of anti-HTLV-1 and isolation of virus from blood lymphocytes at multiple time points postinjection established a course of chronic asymptomatic infection in both. One rabbit, infected for 5.5 years after intramuscular injection of HTLV-1 DNA, developed a thymoma having features of medullary differentiation. HTLV-1 provirus was detected in both thymocytes and neoplastic epithelium isolated discretely from the thymoma by laser capture microdissection. These findings provide the first experimental evidence of HTLV-1 disease after infection by HTLV-1 DNA injection. Endometrial adenocarcinoma occurred in a second rabbit 2.5 years after its inoculation with cell-associated virus. In this second case, an epithelial cell line derived ex vivo from a metastatic lesion produced virus in culture. In tumors from each of the two rabbits, the neoplastic epithelium was infected and harbored monoclonally integrated HTLV-1 provirus. Although monoclonal provirus integration alone does not establish retroviral cause of carcinogenesis unequivocally, these and other accumulating data indicate that there may be a role for HTLV-1 in diseases associated with infection of epithelia, including some epithelial cancers.","['Zhao, Tong Mao', 'Bryant, Mark A', 'Kindt, Thomas J', 'Simpson, R Mark']","['Zhao TM', 'Bryant MA', 'Kindt TJ', 'Simpson RM']","['Molecular and Cellular Immunogenetics Research Section, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,,IM,"['Animals', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/ultrastructure/*virology', 'Rabbits', '*Virus Integration']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/04/19 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2002 Mar 1;18(4):253-8. doi: 10.1089/088922202753472829.,,,['10.1089/088922202753472829 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML blast expression of the PDGF-receptor alpha-chain was detected for a subset of patients (45%), whereas PDGF-receptor beta-chain expression was detected for most patients (90%). Constitutive AML blast release of the PDGF-AB isoform (the major form also derived from normal platelets) was detected for 43% of patients, whereas PDGF-BB release was not detected for any patient. The PDGF isoforms AA, AB and BB had dose-dependent and divergent effects on spontaneous and cytokine-dependent AML blast proliferation, whereas for constitutive cytokine secretion (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) inhibitory effects were rare and all three isoforms usually had no effect or enhanced the constitutive secretion. The PDGF effects were caused by a direct effect on the AML blasts and were not dependent on the presence of serum. The PDGF effects could also be detected after in vitro culture of AML cells in the presence of IL-4+ granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. PF-4 had divergent effects on proliferation and cytokine secretion by native AML blasts. Our results suggest that exogenous (e.g. platelet-secreted) PDGF and PF-4 can function as regulators of leukemic hematopoiesis and possibly also modulate the function of residual AML cells in peripheral blood stem cell grafts. On the other hand, endogenous release of PDGF-AB by native blasts may modulate the function of normal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment (e.g. bone marrow stromal cells).","['Foss, B', 'Ulvestad, E', 'Bruserud, O']","['Foss B', 'Ulvestad E', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Corrected and Republished Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (platelet-derived growth factor A)', '0 (platelet-derived growth factor AB)', '1B56C968OA (Becaplermin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Becaplermin', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Platelet Factor 4/pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor beta/*biosynthesis/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/23 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Oct;67(4):267-78. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.0430a.x.,,,"['430a [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.0430a.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,['Eur J Haematol. 2001 Jun;66(6):365-76.

We demonstrate that high CD14 expression is highly significantly associated with high cellular Ara-C and Dau resistance in univariate as well as multivariate analyses. FAB subtypes with highest and lowest cellular Ara-C resistance were M4 and M5, respectively (P < 0.01, one-way anova), whereas FAB subtypes with highest and lowest cellular Dau resistance were M4 and M1, respectively (P < 0.01, one-way anova). By contrast, no significant differences in cellular drug resistance towards Acla could be demonstrated among FAB subtypes. Furthermore, in two cohorts of AML patients treated by two different regimens for remission induction over a period of 15 yr (1985-94, n = 159 and 1995-99, n = 76, respectively) we demonstrate in univariate analyses a significance of CD14 expression with respect to clinical outcome. With the exception of significance to probability of obtaining complete remission in the first cohort (P = 0.03, logistic regression), this significance was, however, lost in multivariate analyses. It was demonstrated that FAB-M4 patients were older than M5 patients and that high CD14 expression was associated with the presence of secondary AML and older age. We conclude that although cases with high blast cell CD14 expression (and FAB-M4 cases) were more resistant to Ara-C as well as Dau in vitro, the clinical and biological significance of this may be debatable because of interactions with major prognostic factors in AML.","['Norgaard, J M', 'Olesen, L H', 'Olesen, G', 'Meyer, K', 'Kristensen, J S', 'Bendix, K', 'Pedersen, B', 'Kjeldsen, E', 'Hokland, P']","['Norgaard JM', 'Olesen LH', 'Olesen G', 'Meyer K', 'Kristensen JS', 'Bendix K', 'Pedersen B', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. janmaxgaard@dadlnet.dk']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/23 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Oct;67(4):221-9. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00553.x.,,,"['553 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00553.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Clonal rearrangements in the gene sequences of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha, major breakpoint cluster region (M-bcr), immunoglobulin (Ig)-JH, T-cell receptor (TcR) beta, myeloid lymphoid leukemia or cytokines (GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3) detected in bone marrow samples from 37 patients with primary AML (pAML) or secondary AML (sAML) were investigated. A relative increase or decrease of clonal DNA in the course of AML was evaluated by comparing the optical densities of DNA bands of the rearranged genes and the total amount of DNA. RESULTS: High amounts of clonal DNA were detectable at diagnosis, during persisting disease and at relapse (O 39%, 35%, or 38% of total DNA, respectively), compared to 20% in complete remission (CR). Amounts of clonal DNA (except for Ig-JH gene rearrangements) were of prognostic significance at diagnosis, patients with less than 33% clonal DNA were characterized by significantly longer relapse-free survival times (all cases: p = 0.01; pAML: p = 0.002). Patients in CR exhibiting less than 5% (all cases) or 15% (pAML) clonal DNA showed longer relapse-free survival times (p = 0.08 or p = 0.03, respectively). Vice versa, significantly higher amounts of clonal DNA (all cases 51% vs. pAML 54%) could be detected in cases studied at diagnosis who relapsed in the following 5 months (all cases p = 0.01) or 14 months (pAML p = 0.007). Significantly higher amounts of clonal DNA (33%) could be detected in cases studied in CR who relapsed in the following 4 months (all cases p = 0.002 or pAML p = 0.006, respectively). Moreover, we could prove disease progression on a cellular level months before the clinical onset of sAML after a period of MDS. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal, gene-rearranged DNA is regularly detectable at diagnosis and during persisting AML, in CR and at relapse. However, the presence, rather than the amount of clonal DNA detectable in CR is predictive for relapse. These data might indicate the significance of gene rearrangement analyses in the course of AML to identify cases with a high risk of relapse, independently from the karyotype.","['Reif, S W', 'Wiesner, D', 'Duell, T', 'Mittermueller, J', 'Schmetzer, H M']","['Reif SW', 'Wiesner D', 'Duell T', 'Mittermueller J', 'Schmetzer HM']","['Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Experimental Surgery, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Clone Cells/*chemistry', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Survival Analysis']",,2002/02/28 10:00,2002/03/23 10:01,['2002/02/28 10:00'],"['2002/02/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/28 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Oct;67(4):207-20. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00470.x.,,,"['470 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.00470.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we show that a recently identified transmembrane protein, Csk-binding protein (Cbp), also known as phospoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (PAG), negatively regulates FcepsilonRI signaling. In rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells, the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbp/PAG and its association with Csk, a negative regulator for Lyn, significantly elevate immediately after aggregation of FcepsilonRI. An overexpression of Cbp/PAG in RBL-2H3 cells inhibits FcepsilonRI-mediated cell activation. This is accompanied with decreased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of FcepsilonRI, association of FcepsilonRI with Lyn, and FcepsilonRI-associated tyrosine kinase activity. These findings combined with the fact that Cbp/PAG, Lyn, and aggregated FcepsilonRI are localized to lipid rafts, suggest that upon FcepsilonRI aggregation Cbp/PAG down-regulates the receptor-associated Lyn activity through relocating Csk to rafts, thereby efficiently mediating feedback inhibition of FcepsilonRI signaling.","['Ohtake, Hidenori', 'Ichikawa, Naoki', 'Okada, Masato', 'Yamashita, Toshiyuki']","['Ohtake H', 'Ichikawa N', 'Okada M', 'Yamashita T']","['Division of Hygienic Chemistry, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Pag1 protein, rat)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Glycosphingolipids/analysis', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*immunology/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases']",,2002/02/23 10:00,2002/03/16 10:01,['2002/02/23 10:00'],"['2002/02/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Mar 1;168(5):2087-90. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.5.2087.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.168.5.2087 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the contrary, LIF, which alone had little effect on IL-6 release, significantly enhanced the bFGF-stimulated IL-6 release. The amplifying effect of LIF on the IL-6 release was dose dependent in the range between 0.01 and 10 ng/ml. AG490, an inhibitor of JAK2, suppressed the amplifying effect of LIF.

Taken together, our results strongly suggest that LIF enhances bFGF-stimulated IL-6 synthesis via JAK2/STAT3 pathway in osteoblasts.","['Kozawa, Osamu', 'Otsuka, Takanobu', 'Uematsu, Toshihiko']","['Kozawa O', 'Otsuka T', 'Uematsu T']","['Department of Pharmacology, Gifu University School of Medicine, 500-8705, Gifu, Japan. okozawa@cc.gifu-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2002/02/23 10:00,2002/04/11 10:01,['2002/02/23 10:00'],"['2002/02/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2002 Apr;14(4):311-5. doi: 10.1016/s0898-6568(01)00248-0.,,,"['S0898656801002480 [pii]', '10.1016/s0898-6568(01)00248-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All children who had no infection were given HDMP as a single daily oral dose of 30 mg/kg for the first four days of induction therapy. The number of CD34+ progenitor cells were determined by flow cytometry before and after four days of HDMP treatment. While the number of PB blast cells significantly decreased after only a four-day course of HDMP treatment, the number of PB CD34+ progenitor cells increased in all patients. In addition, after four days of HDMP treatment polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and mononuclear cells (MNC) increased significantly (p < 0.05).

We have reviewed the responses of 79 hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients uniformly treated from 1990-1998 with equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for steroid-resistant acute GVHD, defined as progression of acute GVHD after 4 days of treatment with prednisone or no improvement of acute GVHD after 7 days of treatment with prednisone. Patients received HSCT from 34 related (32 matched sibling/2 partially matched) and 45 unrelated (14 HLA-A, -B, -DRB1 matched/31 partially matched) donors. Prior to ATG therapy, severe (grade III-IV) GVHD was observed in 34 patients (43%). Organs involved included skin in 81% of patients, lower GI tract in 52%, upper GI tract in 28%, and liver in 11%. Treatment consisted of 1-5 courses (median, 2 courses) of ATG (15 mg/kg per dose bid x 5 days) given for a median of 16 days (range, 5 to 44 days) after the onset of GVHD. All patients continued to receive prednisone, 60 mg/m2 per day (or methylprednisolone IV equivalent), plus CSA (75%) or tacrolimus (4%). At day 28 of treatment, overall improvement was observed in 54% of patients; durable (> or = 28 days) complete response was observed in 20% of patients, and partial response was observed in 34% of patients. In multivariate analysis, patients with CML or a malignant disease other than acute leukemia had a greater likelihood of overall response than did those with nonmalignant diseases. Patients with acute skin GVHD (with or without other organ involvement) responded most frequently. Chronic GVHD developed in 51% of patients by 1 year after HSCT. One patient developed EBV lymphoproliferative disease. For the entire cohort, the probability of survival at 1 year was 32% (95% CI, 22%-42%). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with better survival included earlier onset of acute GVHD, shorter time from initial treatment for GVHD to treatment with ATG, and the use of non-T-cell-depleted stem cell grafts. These data suggest that treatment with ATG can be an active therapy, especially in patients with skin GVHD and early signs of steroid resistance.","['MacMillan, Margaret L', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J', 'Davies, Stella M', 'DeFor, Todd E', 'Burns, Linda J', 'Ramsay, Norma K C', 'Wagner, John E', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['MacMillan ML', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Davies SM', 'DeFor TE', 'Burns LJ', 'Ramsay NK', 'Wagner JE', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA. macmi002@umn.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Steroids)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Data Collection', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infections/microbiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2002/02/23 10:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/02/23 10:00'],"['2002/02/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/02/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(1):40-6. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11858189.,,,"['S1083879102500641 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11858189 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the diagnostic utility of coexistent antigenic expression patterns with simultaneous two-color staining and flow cytometric analysis has not been studied extensively. METHODS: Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we evaluated the expression pattern of FMC7 and CD23 in 218 cases of B-cell lymphoma from blood and bone marrow specimens. RESULTS: The CD23(+)/FMC7(-) pattern was the most common pattern in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and related variants. The widest variation of patterns was found in patients with follicular cell lymphoma, large cell lymphoma, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a lymphoplasmacytoid disorder, although most cases expressed the CD23-/FMC7(+) pattern. The CD23 and FMC7 antigen, along with the CD5 coexpression pattern, provides critical adjunctive data. These data allow accurate classification of the majority of cases, thereby providing a key aspect of a reliable diagnostic algorithm. The CD23 and FMC7 antigen expression pattern, along with selected other antigens, was predictive of subtypes in >95% of lymphoproliferative cases and narrowed the differential diagnosis in the remaining cases. CONCLUSION: The flow cytometric CD23/FMC7 expression pattern achieved by multicolor immunophenotyping facilitates accurate and reproducible classification of B-cell lymphomas and has diagnostic utility.","['Ahmad, Ejaz', 'Garcia, Diana', 'Davis, Bruce H']","['Ahmad E', 'Garcia D', 'Davis BH']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (MS4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2002 Feb 15;50(1):1-7.,,,['10.1002/cyto.10045 [pii]'],"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five patients were studied: 4 patients had A-T (2 of whom had non-leukemic clonal proliferations [ATCP]), 1 had B cell lymphoma and 1 had T-ALL; a fifth patient with T-PLL did not have A-T. We measured the levels of expression for TCL-1, MTCP-1 and TML-1. TCL-1, not expressed in unstimulated mature T cells, was upregulated in the peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) of the 2 A-T patients with ATCP. It was also expressed in the malignant cells of the A-T patient with B cell lymphoma and the T-PLL cells of the patient without A-T. In the same cells, MTCP-1 type A was expressed equally in all 5 patients, as well as in the controls; MTCP-1 type B transcripts were not observed. TML-1, also not expressed in unstimulated T cells, was expressed in the PBL of one A-T patient with ATCP and in the leukemic cells of the non-A-T T-PLL patient. These expression patterns were compared to cellular immunophenotypes. The non-leukemic clonal T cell populations had the characteristics of immature T cells. We conclude that TCL-1 and TML-1 play a role in cell proliferation and survival but are not pivotal genes in the progression to malignancy, even when the ATM gene is mutated.

Few reports have analyzed this issue. The objective of this study was to analyze the experience with CNS recurrence in adult patients with ALL. METHODS: Between December 1982 and April 2000, the records of 527 consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with ALL who were treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were reviewed. Patients were treated with one of two published regimens: vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD; n = 237 patients) or hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide plus VAD (hyper-CVAD) (n = 290 patients). Among 439 patients (83%) who achieved complete remission (CR), 32 patients (7%) had a CNS recurrence. All patients had received CNS prophylaxis tailored to the risk of CNS recurrence with systemic chemotherapy with or without intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy; none received cranial radiotherapy for prophylaxis. The records of these patients were reviewed. RESULTS: The median age at the time of diagnosis was 33 years. The median CR duration prior to CNS recurrence was 36 weeks (range, 2-185 weeks). Three groups were identified: 1) patients with an isolated CNS recurrence (n = 17 patients), 2) patients with CNS recurrences after bone marrow (BM) recurrence (n = 8 patients), and 3) patients with simultaneous CNS and BM recurrences (n = 7 patients). IT chemotherapy was effective in achieving a CNS CR in 30 patients (94%), but 10 patients (31%) had a second CNS recurrence. The median survival from CNS recurrence was 6 months; 28% of patients were alive at 1 year, and 6% of patients were alive at 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with ALL and CNS recurrences have a poor prognosis despite effective IT chemotherapy. Future studies should investigate better approaches in the treatment of these patients to improve their long-term survival. Effective CNS prophylaxis remains the single best approach for treating patients with CNS leukemia.","['Surapaneni, Usha R', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Thomas, Deborah', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Giles, Francis J', 'Koller, Charles', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Surapaneni UR', 'Cortes JE', 'Thomas D', ""O'Brien S"", 'Giles FJ', 'Koller C', 'Faderl S', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Therefore, the authors sought to determine the safety and activity of higher doses of mitoxantrone in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and a glucocorticoid in preparation for a possible Phase III trial comparing standard to dose-escalated mitoxantrone. METHODS: This Phase II trial enrolled 45 patients from October 1996 to March 1998. Twenty-one patients without pelvic irradiation (Arm I) received 21 mg/m(2) of mitoxantrone every 3 weeks, and 24 patients who had received pelvic irradiation (Arm II) were given 17 mg/m(2) on the same schedule. All patients received 40 mg of hydrocortisone in divided doses daily and GM-CSF at 500 microg/daily for a minimum of 10 days per cycle beginning on the third day of the cycle. RESULTS: In Arm I, 33% of assessable patients achieved a partial response, 50% had a > or = 50% decline in their PSA, and 35% had a > or = 75% decline in PSA values. The comparable numbers in Arm II were 24%, 48%, and 35%, respectively. The median survival times were 12 months in Arm I and 14 months in Arm II. Treatment had to be discontinued in 13% of patients because of thrombocytopenia. No other significant toxicities were encountered. CONCLUSIONS: Higher doses of mitoxantrone (17 and 21 mg/m(2)) were associated with activity comparable to many estramustine combinations and generally were well tolerated. However, because the degree and frequency of thrombocytopenia were greater than that observed with standard dose mitoxantrone (12-14 mg/m(2)), and because the median survival is apparently comparable to standard dose mitoxantrone, this approach to HRPC cannot be recommended for Phase III testing.","['Levine, Ellis G', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Roberts, John D', 'Kaplan, Ellen B', 'Rago, Randall', 'Atkins, James N', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J']","['Levine EG', 'Halabi S', 'Roberts JD', 'Kaplan EB', 'Rago R', 'Atkins JN', 'Vogelzang NJ']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263-0001, USA. ellis.levine@roswellpark.org']",['eng'],"['CA-03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-52784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2002 Feb 1;94(3):665-72. doi: 10.1002/cncr.10217.,,,"['10.1002/cncr.10217 [pii]', '10.1002/cncr.10217 [doi]']",['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.

The direct targets in the p53-independent pathway remain enigmatic; however, the induction of this pathway does not require the transactivation domain of E2F1. Using cells that are defective in p53 activation, we show that E2F1 potently represses the expression of Mcl-1--an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member whose depletion results in apoptosis. We also show that this transcriptional repression is direct and dependent upon E2F1's DNA-binding domain, but does not require the transactivation domain of E2F1. Consistent with this DNA binding requirement of E2F1 to repress Mcl-1, we show that E2F1 binds to the Mcl-1 promoter both in vitro and in vivo, and have identified the DNA element (-143/-117) within this promoter that is required for E2F1 binding and repression. Additionally, cell lines constitutively expressing Mcl-1 are resistant to E2F1-mediated apoptosis--suggesting that Mcl-1 downregulation is a necessary event in the p53-independent apoptotic process. Thus, we identify a p53 family-independent mechanism of E2F1-induced apoptosis in which E2F1 directly represses Mcl-1 expression.","['Croxton, Rhonda', 'Ma, Yihong', 'Song, Lanxi', 'Haura, Eric B', 'Cress, W Douglas']","['Croxton R', 'Ma Y', 'Song L', 'Haura EB', 'Cress WD']","['Molecular Oncology Program, H.

This study aimed to define its molecular mechanisms of cell killing in both parental sensitive and vinflunine-resistant P388 leukaemia cells. Vinflunine treatment of these cells resulted in apoptosis characterized by DNA fragmentation and proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Apoptosis-inducing concentrations of vinflunine caused c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 stimulation, as well as caspases-3/7 activation. This activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis could be inhibited by the caspase inhibitor acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde. Interestingly, the apoptosis signal triggered by vinflunine in these P388 cells was not mediated through Bcl-2 phosphorylation. In addition, when vinflunine resistance was developed in P388 cells, it was associated with resistance to vinflunine-induced apoptosis, as reflected by a loss of capacity to induce DNA fragmentation and PARP degradation, and characterized by increased levels of Bcl-2 and Bfl-1/A1. Therefore, these data indirectly implicate Bcl-2 and Bfl-1/A1 in vinflunine-induced cell death mechanisms.","['Kruczynski, A', 'Etievant, C', 'Perrin, D', 'Chansard, N', 'Duflos, A', 'Hill, B T']","['Kruczynski A', 'Etievant C', 'Perrin D', 'Chansard N', 'Duflos A', 'Hill BT']","['Division of Experimental Cancer Research, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, 17 avenue Jean Moulin, 81106 Castres, Cedex 06, France. anna.kruczynski@pierre-fabre.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/metabolism', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",PMC2746541,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/10 00:00 [revised]', '2001/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Jan 7;86(1):143-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600025.,,,['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600025 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects comprised 2431 case children diagnosed with cancer before 15 years of age and 6338 control children. The retrospective assessment of whether or not an individual baby received vitamin K is not straightforward. In many cases no record was found in stored medical notes and two types of analysis were therefore conducted; in the first it was assumed that where no written record of vitamin K was found it had not been given, and in the second, where no written record of administration was found, information on hospital policy and perinatal morbidity was used to 'impute' whether or not vitamin K had been given. In the first analysis, no association was found between neonatal administration of intramuscular. vitamin K and childhood cancer: odds ratios adjusted for mode of delivery, admission to special care baby unit and low birth weight were 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.92-1.28) for leukaemia and 1.05 (0.92-1.20) for other cancers. In the second analysis, the adjusted odds ratios increased to 1.21 (1.02-1.44) for leukaemia and 1.10 (0.95-1.26) for other cancers. This shift did not occur in all studies, and when data from the hypothesis generating Bristol study were excluded, the adjusted odds ratios for leukaemia became 1.06 (0.89-1.25) in the first analysis and 1.16 (0.97-1.39) when data on prophylaxis imputed from hospital policy and perinatal morbidity were used. We conclude that whilst the broad nature of the diagnostic groups and the poor quality of some of the vitamin K data mean that small effects cannot be entirely ruled out, our analysis provides no convincing evidence that intramuscular vitamin K is associated with childhood leukaemia.","['Roman, E', 'Fear, N T', 'Ansell, P', 'Bull, D', 'Draper, G', 'McKinney, P', 'Michaelis, J', 'Passmore, S J', 'von Kries, R']","['Roman E', 'Fear NT', 'Ansell P', 'Bull D', 'Draper G', 'McKinney P', 'Michaelis J', 'Passmore SJ', 'von Kries R']","['Leukaemia Research Fund, Institute of Epidemiology, University of Leeds, 30 Hyde Terrace, Leeds LS2 9LN, UK.

Serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor positively correlated with Rai sub-stages (P=0.03), peripheral blood lymphocytosis (P=0.03), bone marrow histology (P=0.04) and beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m) (P=0.006). When dealing with basic fibroblast growth factor only a correlation with Rai sub-stages (P=0.02) could be found. Different cut-offs set on the basis of a stratification in quartiles, failed to demonstrate any correlation between serum levels of basic fibroblast growth factor and disease progression. In contrast, patients with increased serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (above median value, 203 pg ml(-1)) had a three times increased risk of disease progression, although, in multivariate analysis only Rai sub-stages (P=0.0001) and lymphocyte doubling time (P=0.002) retained their prognostic significance. Low levels of vascular endothelial growth factor were indicative of good clinical outcome in the subgroup of patients with either low (P=0.02) or high (P=0.03) beta2-m concentration. Finally, the highest prognostic power was obtained when serum vascular endothelial growth factor and beta2-m were examined in combination. Median of progression-free survival of patients who had both serum vascular endothelial growth factor and beta2-m higher than median value was only 13 months, in contrast median progression-free survival of patients with one marker increased (i.e. above the 50th percentile) was 40 months. Patients with both markers below the median experienced the best clinical outcome (median progression-free survival not reached at 40 months). In conclusion, serum levels of either vascular endothelial growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor are high in patients with early chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, however, only vascular endothelial growth factor predicts behaviour of disease and helps to refine the prognosis of stage A patients.","['Molica, S', 'Vitelli, G', 'Levato, D', 'Ricciotti, A', 'Digiesi, G']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Levato D', 'Ricciotti A', 'Digiesi G']","['Department of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*blood', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Lymphokines/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",PMC2746542,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2001/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/08 00:00 [revised]', '2001/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2002 Jan 7;86(1):31-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6600022.,,,['10.1038/sj.bjc.6600022 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reliable predictors of progression have not been identified, and information on prognosis is limited. METHODS: We identified 1384 patients residing in southeastern Minnesota in whom MGUS was diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic from 1960 through 1994. The primary end point was progression to multiple myeloma or another plasma-cell cancer. RESULTS: During 11,009 person-years of follow-up, MGUS progressed in 115 of the 1384 patients to multiple myeloma, IgM lymphoma, primary amyloidosis, macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or plasmacytoma (relative risk of progression, 25.0, 2.4, 8.4, 46.0, 0.9, and 8.5, respectively). The overall relative risk of progression was 7.3 in these patients as compared with the white population of the Iowa Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. In 32 additional patients, the monoclonal protein concentration increased to more than 3 g per deciliter or the percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow increased to more than 10 percent (smoldering multiple myeloma) but without progression to overt myeloma or related disorders. The cumulative probability of progression was 12 percent at 10 years, 25 percent at 20 years, and 30 percent at 25 years. The initial concentration of serum monoclonal protein was a significant predictor of progression at 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of progression of MGUS to multiple myeloma or related disorders is about 1 percent per year.","['Kyle, Robert A', 'Therneau, Terry M', 'Rajkumar, S Vincent', 'Offord, Janice R', 'Larson, Dirk R', 'Plevak, Matthew F', 'Melton, L Joseph 3rd']","['Kyle RA', 'Therneau TM', 'Rajkumar SV', 'Offord JR', 'Larson DR', 'Plevak MF', 'Melton LJ 3rd']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. kyle.robert@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amyloidosis/etiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology', '*Paraproteinemias/complications/diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/etiology']",,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 2002 Feb 21;346(8):564-9. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa01133202.,,,"['10.1056/NEJMoa01133202 [doi]', '346/8/564 [pii]']",,,,"['N Engl J Med. 2002 Jun 27;346(26):2087-8; author reply 2087-8.

A novel series of pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepines have been shown to potently induce apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, which are resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents. In this study we have delineated part of the mechanism by which a representative compound known as PBOX-6 induces apoptosis. We have investigated whether PBOX-6 induces activation of MAP kinase signaling pathways in CML cells. Treatment of K562 cells with PBOX-6 resulted in the transient activation of two JNK isoforms, JNK1 and JNK2. In contrast, PBOX-6 did not activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or p38. Apoptosis was found to occur independently of the small GTPases Ras, Rac, and Cdc42 but involved phosphorylation of the JNK substrates, c-Jun and ATF-2. Pretreatment of K562 cells with the JNK inhibitor, dicoumarol, abolished PBOX-6-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 and inhibited the induced apoptosis, suggesting that JNK activation is an essential component of the apoptotic pathway induced by PBOX-6. Consistent with this finding, transfection of K562 cells with the JNK scaffold protein, JIP-1, inhibited JNK activity and apoptosis induced by PBOX-6. JIP-1 specifically scaffolds JNK, MKK7, and members of the mixed-lineage kinase (MLK) family, implicating these kinases upstream of JNK in the apoptotic pathway induced by PBOX-6 in K562 cells.","['Mc Gee, Margaret M', 'Campiani, Giuseppe', 'Ramunno, Anna', 'Nacci, Vito', 'Lawler, Mark', 'Williams, D Clive', 'Zisterer, Daniela M']","['Mc Gee MM', 'Campiani G', 'Ramunno A', 'Nacci V', 'Lawler M', 'Williams DC', 'Zisterer DM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATF2 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 2)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAPK8IP1 protein, human)', '0 (Oxazepines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'IN93MQ497D (PBOX-6)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 2', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oxazepines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/06/25 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 May 24;277(21):18383-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112058200.

Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells may be less contaminated with tumor cells than bone marrow harvests are, but they are still frequently infiltrated. Gene-marking studies using retroviral vectors provide evidence that tumor cells contained in autografts contribute to relapse in myeloid leukemia and neuroblastoma patients. Also clinical studies have shown that tumor cell contamination of autografts is associated with shortened disease-free survival; on the other hand, successful ex vivo purging of tumor cells is associated with superior clinical outcome. However, the presence of tumor cells in autografts or insufficient purging may correlate with the extent of systemic residual disease and/or tumor chemosensitivity; therefore, there is no direct evidence that reinfused tumor cells alone cause relapse. Particularly in patients having highly chemosensitive disease and no detected systemic residual disease following high-dose transplant chemotherapy, the relative number of tumor cells contained in autografts and eventually reinfused, may become a determining factor for clinical outcome. There are no randomized trials showing improved (disease-free) survival with purging. In the absence of such trials, the contribution of tumor cells in the stem cell autografts to subsequent relapse remains controversial.","['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Korbling, Martin']","['Shimoni A', 'Korbling M']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Purging/methods', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology']",,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/09/11 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2002 Feb;41(2):241-50. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00160-3.,,83,"['S1040842801001603 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(01)00160-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the signaling beta and gamma chains are shared by other cytokines (e.g. IL-7, IL-9, IL-15). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for recruiting/sorting the alpha chains to the signaling chains at the cell surface are not clear. Here we show, in four cell lines of human adult T cell lymphoma/leukemia origin, that the three IL-2R subunits are compartmented together with HLA glycoproteins and CD48 molecules in the plasma membrane, by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), confocal microscopy and immuno-biochemical techniques. In addition to the beta and gamma(c) chains constitutively expressed in detergent-resistant membrane fractions (DRMs) of T cells, IL-2Ralpha (CD25) was also found in DRMs, independently of its ligand-occupation. Association of CD25 with rafts was also confirmed by its colocalization with GM-1 ganglioside. Depletion of membrane cholesterol using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin substantially reduced co-clustering of CD25 with CD48 and HLA-DR, as well as the IL-2 stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducer and activator of transcription). These data indicate a GPI-microdomain (raft)-assisted recruitment of CD25 to the vicinity of the signaling beta and gamma(c) chains. Rafts may promote rapid formation of a high affinity IL-2R complex, even at low levels of IL-2 stimulus, and may also form a platform for the regulation of IL-2 induced signals by GPI-proteins (e.g. CD48).

Initially, treatment was in the form of non-absorbable antibiotics, but this has been partially superseded by quinolone-containing regimens, in particular in the centers participating in EORTC trials. In the last two EORTC trials comparing different regimens for the treatment of febrile neutropenia, 57-73% of the patients were receiving GD. A French epidemiologic study, performed prospectively and consecutively in 36 oncohematology centers, has recently shown that 45% of febrile neutropenic patients receive digestive decontamination (DD) at the onset of their first febrile episode. The value of GD has been the subject of much controversy. Numerous trials, some of which were controlled, were performed in neutropenic patients in the 1980s, prior to trials of GD in intensive care units, but did not lead to a consensus in the medical community of the value of GD. Moreover, GD is not, or is infrequently, used in the USA. Apart from trials involving the quinolones, very few studies have been published during the last 10 years. Despite this, policies have not changed greatly in the various centers. The CLIOH group has gathered the opinions of experts invited to a multidisciplinary meeting that took place in Paris in October 1996. The text that follows summarizes the reflections arising from this forum. It should be noted that this meeting was not designed to be a consensus conference, but rather to re-examine the correlation between the data in the literature and actual clinical practice and to highlight the main problems posed by DD in current oncohematology. The experts were separated into three working groups, each of which has drafted a report which appears in the text below.","['Buzyn, A.', 'Tancrede, C.', 'Nitenberg, G.', 'Cordonnier, C.']","['Buzyn A', 'Tancrede C', 'Nitenberg G', 'Cordonnier C']","[""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Hopital Necker, Paris.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Clin Microbiol Infect,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,9516420,,,,,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Microbiol Infect. 1999 Aug;5(8):449-456. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-0691.1999.tb00174.x.,,,"['S1198-743X(14)64418-9 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1469-0691.1999.tb00174.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,['The CLIOH group'],,,,

CFU-BL derived from bone marrow of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients have been proved to adhere poorly to bone marrow derived stromal layers suggesting that the appearance of progenitors and precursors in the circulation is due to a defective adhesion of these cells to the bone marrow microenvironment. In the present experiments the effect of short-term incubation of preformed normal bone marrow stroma on the adherence of CML derived CFU-BL was studied. For stroma cultures bone marrow cells were cultured in microplates in the presence of hydrocortisone. Cultures were used when stromal layers became confluent and no sign of haemopoiesis could be observed. CFU-BL were studied by panning plastic non-adherent mononuclear (PNAMNC) bone marrow or blood cells. 8.9 +/- 2.4 colonies/103 PNAMNC (six experiments) were formed from normal bone marrow on stromal layers and 4.8 +/- 2.1 colonies/103 PNAMNC (five experiments) from CML bone marrow. Colony formation from normal bone marrow was not increased if stromal layers were incubated with 100 ng/mL granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or stem cell factor (SCF). Incubation of stroma with G-CSF or SCF, however, increased the colony formation of PNAMNC from CML bone marrow or blood significantly. These findings suggest that local concentration of haemopoietic growth factors at the time of panning may influence the attachment of CML progenitors to the stroma.","['Gidali, J', 'Laszlo, E', 'Halm, G', 'Feher, I']","['Gidali J', 'Laszlo E', 'Halm G', 'Feher I']","['National Institute of Haematology and Immunology, Budapest, Hungary. j.gidali@ohvi.hu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/pathology']",PMC6496143,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/03/02 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2002 Feb;35(1):1-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2184.2002.00217.x.,,,"['217 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2184.2002.00217.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mouse ES cells can be cultured and kept undifferentiated in the absence of embryonal feeder-cell layers when exogenous LIF concentrations are maintained above a threshold concentration. An important downstream target of LIF signal transduction in mouse ES cells is the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In contrast to mouse ES cells, human ES cells are unresponsive to LIF and depend on feeder cells for undifferentiated growth. Here, we investigated the activation patterns of LIF-downstream effectors in mouse and human embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells. We report that LIF induces both ERK-1 as well as STAT3 activation in mouse P19 EC cells. LIF enhances the proliferation rate of P19 EC cells, which depends on ERK activity but does not require activation of STAT3. In contrast, LIF does not activate STAT3, ERK, or the gp130 receptor in human N tera-2/D1 EC cells, although all receptor components are expressed. The negative feedback protein suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS-1) is constitutively expressed in N tera-2/D1 EC cells, suggesting that LIF signal transduction is inhibited by elevated levels of SOCS-1 expression.","['Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'van der Schaaf, Saskia', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Eggen, Bart J L', 'Kruijer, Wiebe']","['Schuringa JJ', 'van der Schaaf S', 'Vellenga E', 'Eggen BJ', 'Kruijer W']","['Department of Developmental Genetics, Biological Center, Kerklaan 30, Haren, 9751 NN, The Netherlands']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Socs1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Teratocarcinoma/pathology', 'Trans-Activators/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/22 10:00,2002/04/19 10:01,['2002/02/22 10:00'],"['2002/02/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2002 Mar 10;274(1):119-29. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5454.,,,"['10.1006/excr.2001.5454 [doi]', 'S0014482701954540 [pii]']",['Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The finding that advance directives were more common among Caucasians than other ethnic groups signifies the importance of considering cultural differences when addressing end-of-life issues with patients. The documents also were found more often in older patients with serious diseases. The relationship between hospital mortality and advance directives is complex. The most seriously ill patients and patients with leukemia had the highest mortality and the highest rate of advance directives. Further research on the interactions among mortality, advance directives, and severity of illness is needed.

The proteasome, a multicatalytic protease present in all eukaryotic cells, is the primary component of the protein degradation pathway of the cell. By degrading regulatory proteins (or their inhibitors), the proteasome serves as a central conduit for many cellular regulatory signals and, thus, is a novel target for therapeutic drugs. PS-341 is a small molecule that is a potent and selective inhibitor of the proteasome. In vitro and mouse xenograft studies of PS-341 have shown antitumor activity in a variety of tumor types, including myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colon cancer, among others. Although PS-341 rapidly leaves the vascular compartment, a novel pharmacodynamic assay has shown that inhibition of proteasome-the biologic target-is dose dependent and reversible. These studies provided the rationale for a twice-weekly dosing schedule employed in ongoing clinical studies. Phase I trials in a variety of tumor types have shown PS-341 to be well tolerated, and phase II trials in several hematologic malignancies and solid tumor types are now in progress.

A candidate protein for the activation of B cells by either mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) or murine leukemia virus is the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a component of the innate immune system. MMTV caused B cell activation in C3H/HeN mice but not in C3H/HeJ or BALB/c (C.C3H Tlr4(lps-d)) congenic mice, both of which have a mutant TLR4 gene. This activation was independent of viral gene expression, because it occurred after treatment of MMTV with ultraviolet light or 2,2'-dithiodipyridine and in azidothymidine-treated mice. Nuclear extracts prepared from the lymphocytes of MMTV-injected C3H/HeN but not C3H/HeJ mice showed increased nuclear factor kappaB activity. Additionally, the MMTV- and Moloney murine leukemia virus envelope proteins coimmunoprecipitated with TLR4 when expressed in 293T cells. The MMTV receptor failed to coimmunoprecipitate with TLR4, suggesting that MMTV/TLR4 interaction is independent of virus attachment and fusion. These results identify retroviral proteins that interact with a mammalian toll receptor and show that direct activation by such viruses may initiate in vivo infection pathways.","['Rassa, John C', 'Meyers, Jennifer L', 'Zhang, Yuanming', 'Kudaravalli, Rama', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Rassa JC', 'Meyers JL', 'Zhang Y', 'Kudaravalli R', 'Ross SR']","['Department of Microbiology/Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6142, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 AI007324/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA045954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA45954/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA73746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI 7324/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (TLR4 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4', 'Toll-Like Receptors']",PMC122356,2002/02/21 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/21 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Feb 19;99(4):2281-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.042355399.,,,"['10.1073/pnas.042355399 [doi]', '99/4/2281 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether this difference is due to innate characteristics of the disease in the two ethnicities or to disparities in health care is not known. We investigated whether the disparity in survival would persist when patients were treated with similar systemic therapies (i.e., in phase II and phase III Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] trials). METHODS: We assessed 504 consecutive patients (458 non-African-American and 46 African-American) receiving systemic chemotherapy in CALGB studies for advanced NSCLC during the period from 1989 through 1998. Clinical and demographic characteristics, treatment received, and survival data were obtained from the CALGB database. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of race/ethnicity on survival after adjustment for other known prognostic factors. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The unadjusted 1-year survival rate was 22% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 13% to 38%) for African-American patients and 30% (95% CI = 26% to 35%) for non-African-American patients, a statistically significant difference (8%; 95% CI on the difference = 5% to 12%; P =.03). Multivariable adjustment for the effect of treatment arm, histology, and metastatic site at presentation did not alter the worse outcome for African-American patients. However, the effect of race/ethnicity disappeared after adjustment for performance status and weight loss. African-American patients were more likely than non-African-Americans to present with a poor performance status (83% versus 60%) and substantial weight loss (41% versus 27%) and to be unmarried (59% versus 28%), disabled (31% versus 15%), unemployed (17% versus 7%), and Medicaid recipients (30% versus 8%). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship that we observed between poor performance, weight loss, and socioeconomic status suggests that social circumstances lead to African-Americans presenting with poorer prognostic features.","['Blackstock, A William', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Paskett, Electra D', 'Perry, Michael C', 'Graziano, Stephen L', 'Muscato, Joseph J', 'Kosty, Michael P', 'Akerley, Wallace L', 'Holland, Jimmie', 'Fleishman, Stewart', 'Green, Mark R']","['Blackstock AW', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Paskett ED', 'Perry MC', 'Graziano SL', 'Muscato JJ', 'Kosty MP', 'Akerley WL', 'Holland J', 'Fleishman S', 'Green MR']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA. ablackst@wfubmc.edu']",['eng'],['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blacks', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy/*ethnology/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*ethnology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Whites']",,2002/02/21 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2002/02/21 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2002 Feb 20;94(4):284-90. doi: 10.1093/jnci/94.4.284.,,,['10.1093/jnci/94.4.284 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, adriamycin-conjugated PEG linkers through different amino acid compositions, alanyl-valine (Ala-Val), alanyl-proline (Ala-Pro), and glycyl-proline (Gly-Pro) sequences, were prepared to confirm selective digestion with model enzymes. Adriamycin was released by particular model endoproteases, thermolysin and proline endopeptidase, from the linkers with different efficiency. When conjugates were prepared using these adriamycin-bound linkers, conjugates had no loss of binding affinity and specificity for common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) expressed on the Daudi cell surfaces as the target of NL-1 antibody. In addition, adriamycin release from the conjugates was also confirmed by incubating them with specific proteases. Tumor cell growth was inhibited dose-dependently for the conjugates carrying Ala-Val and Gly-Pro linkers, whereas significant inhibitory effect was abolished for the conjugate carrying Ala-Pro linker, indicating that cytotoxic effect can be controlled by specificity of antibody and composition of linker peptide. IC(50) for Ala-Val linked conjugate was approximately 3.5 microg/ml and that for Gly-Pro linked conjugate was 5.2 microg/ml. PEG-dipeptidyl linker demonstrated here will be an effective tool for the preparation of immunoconjugate, especially specific activation of anti-tumor agents at desired tumor tissues.","['Suzawa, T', 'Nagamura, S', 'Saito, H', 'Ohta, S', 'Hanai, N', 'Kanazawa, J', 'Okabe, M', 'Yamasaki, M']","['Suzawa T', 'Nagamura S', 'Saito H', 'Ohta S', 'Hanai N', 'Kanazawa J', 'Okabe M', 'Yamasaki M']","['Tokyo Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., 3-6-6, Asahi-machi, Machida-shi, 194-8533, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Solvents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Binding Sites', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*chemistry/isolation & purification/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Solvents', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology']",,2002/02/21 10:00,2002/05/17 10:01,['2002/02/21 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/17 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2002 Feb 19;79(1-3):229-42. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(01)00554-5.,,,"['S0168365901005545 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(01)00554-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STI571, a competitive inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of BCR-ABL, has been shown to have high activity in this type of leukaemia. However, most patients with advanced disease relapse despite continued treatment with STI571. We aimed to find out whether point mutations in BCR-ABL cause resistance to STI571. METHODS: We analysed clinical samples from eight patients resistant to STI571-who had advanced-stage Ph+ leukaemia-for mutations within the ATP-binding site and activation loop of BCR-ABL. Analysis was done before treatment with STI571 and at time of relapse. FINDINGS: We identified five distinct point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain in seven patients. All point mutations arose at positions that have proved to be important for drug binding and have conferred resistance to STI571 in vitro. All patients with mutations had lymphoid leukaemia. INTERPRETATION: Different mutations within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL can be responsible for refractoriness of Ph+ leukaemia to STI571.

However, resistance to this drug develops within a few months in most patients. We aimed to predict resistance to STI571. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from 25 bone-marrow samples from 19 patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who were enrolled into a phase II study. 17 samples were obtained before STI571 treatment was started: ten from individuals who were classified as good responders to STI571 (sensitive), and seven from individuals who did not to respond to STI571 (primary resistance). Eight samples were obtained from patients during treatment with STI571. We analysed six matched samples, which were obtained before and during treatment with STI571. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of samples was done with high-density microarrays. FINDINGS: We identified 95 genes whose expression could be used to predict sensitivity of leukaemic cells to STI571. On this basis, all the STI571-sensitive samples could clearly be distinguished from the resistant cases. 56 highly differentially expressed genes were identified in leukaemic cells that were secondarily resistant to STI571. Resistant leukaemic cells expressed high levels of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and two ATP synthetases (ATP5A1 and ATP5C1), and showed significantly reduced expression of the proapoptotic gene BAK1 and the cell-cycle control gene p15 INK4b. INTERPRETATION: We have shown the clinical relevance of gene expression data for the pretreatment assessment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

Spectrum composite resin and Dyract AP compomer. METHODOLOGY: Cultured human endothelial cells (ECV-304) were exposed to each of the restorative materials through a 70-microm dentine barrier to simulate the in vivo clinical situation. Cell viability was measured by the MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay and lactate dehydrogenase release assay. The effects of different extents of light-curing were also examined by microscopic examination of stained human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). Caspase-3 activation was determined as a measure of apoptotic cell death. RESULTS: Assessment of cellular viability indicated that both materials cause cell death, with Spectrum being the more toxic. The cytotoxicity was considerably increased in the absence of the dentine barrier. Direct exposure to Spectrum for 12 h resulted in the death of 69% of the cells after full light-curing (78% of total death was by apoptosis) and 96% after partial light-curing (73% of total death was by necrosis). Assessment of caspase activation, in the absence of the dentine barrier, showed that longer curing-times resulted in an increase in the proportion of the cells dying through apoptosis, rather than necrosis, for both materials tested. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the restorative materials to be potentially toxic, particularly if the degree of light-cure is inadequate.","['Quinlan, C A', 'Zisterer, D M', 'Tipton, K F', ""O'Sullivan, M I""]","['Quinlan CA', 'Zisterer DM', 'Tipton KF', ""O'Sullivan MI""]","['Dublin Dental Hospital, Ireland. quinlanc@dental.tcd.ie']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Endod J,International endodontic journal,8004996,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Compomers)', '0 (Composite Resins)', '0 (Dental Materials)', '0 (Dyract)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Methacrylates)', '0 (Silicates)', '0 (Spectrum composite resin)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/analysis', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coloring Agents', 'Compomers/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Composite Resins/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Dental Materials/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Dentin', 'Endothelium/cytology/drug effects', 'Enzyme Precursors/analysis', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Light', 'Materials Testing', 'Methacrylates/chemistry/toxicity', 'Necrosis', 'Pilot Projects', 'Silicates/chemistry/toxicity', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",,2002/02/21 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/02/21 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Endod J. 2002 Jan;35(1):47-55. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2591.2002.00456.x.,,,"['_456 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2591.2002.00456.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings suggest that of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, HBP blocks the progression of cell cycle at least at G0/G1 and S phases and GBP does at least at G0/G1 phase, resulting in apoptosis induction in tumor cells.","['Mutsuga, Motoh', 'Kojima, Keisuke', 'Yamashita, Miwako', 'Ohno, Takamasa', 'Ogihara, Yukio', 'Inoue, Makoto']","['Mutsuga M', 'Kojima K', 'Yamashita M', 'Ohno T', 'Ogihara Y', 'Inoue M']","['Laboratory of Pharmacognosy, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (1-O-(3-O-glucopyranosylbutyryl)pancratistatin)', '0 (1-O-(3-hydroxybutyryl)pancratistatin)', '0 (7-isopentenyloxycoumarin)', '0 (Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '96281-31-1 (pancratistatin)']",IM,"['*Amaryllidaceae Alkaloids', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",,2002/02/21 10:00,2002/08/03 10:01,['2002/02/21 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2002 Feb;25(2):223-8. doi: 10.1248/bpb.25.223.,,,['10.1248/bpb.25.223 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High level of mRNA WT1 was only observed in ALL cases with leukemic cells characterized by P53- and MDM2-positive staining in cytometric analysis. The overexpression of P53 protein has not been induced by P53 gene abnormalities and MDM2 protein synthesis was independent from respective gene amplification. The data suggest that WT1 may play a distinct role in the pathophysiology of acute leukemias. It can regulate the function of the main oncoprotein network factors--P53 and MDM2 proteins. There was concluded that the most important mechanism of tissue P53-immunopositivity was connected with the P53 interactions with other oncoproteins, especially with MDM2 and WT1. They have caused different effects in particular cases and several phenotypes of leukemic cells were described. However, the negative tissue staining with anti-P53 monoclonal antibodies can not be evidence of the proper P53 protein function. The immunohistochemical estimations of the P53 level in the cells are insufficient for diagnostic and clinical evaluations. Molecular analyses of P53 and MDM2 genes, as well the WT1 gene transcription, are necessary for the proper characterisation of functional and structural status of P53.","['Bartkowiak, J', 'Wojcik, I', 'Stankiewicz, W']","['Bartkowiak J', 'Wojcik I', 'Stankiewicz W']",['Zaklad Biologii Molekularnej Katedry Onkologii Akademii Medycznej w Lodzi.'],['pol'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2002/02/21 10:00,2002/03/15 10:01,['2002/02/21 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2001 Nov;11(65):402-5.,Rola ekspresji genu WT1 w regulacji funkcji bialek P53 i MDM2 w ostrej bialaczce limfoblastycznej.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It took further 100 years to the time of the discovery of the first cytotoxic drugs. Ph1 chromosome, the cytogenetic hallmark of CML, has been described in 1960, however, the majority of important discoveries on the molecular level has been done in the 1980s' and later. The chromosomal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) is absolutely crucial for CML and leads to the chimeric gene and protein BCR-ABL. The ABL protein possesses the tyrosine kinase activity, which is deregulated in the BCR-ABL protein, leading to the cascade of further pathological processes in the leukemic cells and causing eventually their malignant transformation. In the 1990s, the drug STI 571 has been synthesized, which is a potent inhibitor of the ABL tyrosine kinase activity. The data so far published concerning clinical effects of STI 571 are remarkable and very encouraging. The drug seems to be very safe and has only limited toxicity. It must be emphasized, however, that STI 571 has been clinically tested only since 1998. Moreover, from the mechanisms of action it is clear, that STI 571 influences the secondary, not the primary cause of the CML. Nevertheless, it is without any doubts that the development of new anti-cancer drugs will be done on this non-cytotoxic principle.","['Mayer, J']",['Mayer J'],"['Interni hematoonkologicka klinika Fakultni nemocnice Brno, pracoviste Bohunice.']",['cze'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",,2002/02/21 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/21 10:00'],"['2002/02/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/21 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2002 Jan;48(1):45-9.,Chronicka myeloidni leukemie jako model moderni necytostaticke lecby malignich chorob.

The stem cell graft contained 2.85 x 10(6) CD34+ cells kg(-1) and we speculate there was B cell hyperactivity following the withdrawal of methotrexate in the donor and this went unchecked by the omission of methotrexate in the GVHD prophylaxis of the recipient. We have also considered the phenomenon of bystander haemolysis, previously unreported in this situation, as haemolysis of transfused group O blood must have also occurred.

When the reporting is performed with an online analytical processing (OLAP) tool, real time reporting can be provided to blood subscribers. When this data is combined with a common patient classification system, Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG), it is possible to produce statistical results, that are similar in different institutions and may provide a means for international transfusion bench-marking and cost comparison. We use a DRG classification to describe the transfusion practice in Helsinki University Central Hospital. The key indicators include the percentage of transfused patients, the number of transfused units and costs in different DRG groups, as well as transfusion rates per DRG weighted treatment episodes. Ninety-three per cent of all transfusions could be classified into different DRGs. The largest blood-using DRG group was acute adult leukaemia (DRG 473), which accounted for 10.4% of all transfusion costs. The 13 largest blood consuming DRGs accounted for half the total costs in 1998. Currently, there is a lack of an internationally accepted standardized way to report institutional or national transfusion practices. DRG-based transfusion reporting might serve as a means for transfusion benchmarking and thus aid studies of variations in transfusion practice.","['Syrjala, M T', 'Kytoniemi, I', 'Mikkolainen, K', 'Ranimo, J', 'Lauharanta, J']","['Syrjala MT', 'Kytoniemi I', 'Mikkolainen K', 'Ranimo J', 'Lauharanta J']","['Department of Laboratory Administration, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Haarmaninkatu 4, PO Box 340, 00029 HUS, Helsinki, Finland. martti.syrjala@hus.fi']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Transfus Med,"Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)",9301182,,IM,"['Blood Transfusion/economics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual', 'Diagnosis-Related Groups/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Electronic Data Processing', 'Finland', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans']",,2002/02/20 10:00,2002/05/23 10:01,['2002/02/20 10:00'],"['2002/02/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/20 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfus Med. 2001 Dec;11(6):423-31. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3148.2001.00338.x.,,,"['338 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-3148.2001.00338.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: Recently, a new industrial technology, wherein a dust-free and aseptic environment is created by circulating air containing nanometre order ultra fine water droplets with abundant negative air ions, has been developed in Japan. METHODS: The air cleanliness of SBCR was examined by measuring airborne particles and microorganisms. Bacteriological samples for environment culture were taken by means of exposed settle-plates. In addition, the frequency of pneumonia and fever higher than 38 degrees C were examined in 34 patients with acute leukaemia who received intensive chemotherapy in SBCR or LAFR. RESULTS: The number of airborne particles (> or = 0.5 microm) was 70 particles/ft3, and that of airborne microorganisms was 0.0 colony forming unit/ft3 in SBCR, and neither bacteria nor fungi were detected. The numbers of colonies of bacteria and fungi on air settle-plates were fewer in the SBCR than in the LAFR regardless of the presence of patients or the nurse entering. The frequency of pneumonia during chemotherapy for acute leukaemia was lower in the SBCR group (0%, 0/19 cases) than in the LAFR group (27%, 4/15 cases) (P=0.0294) and the frequency of fever higher than 38 degrees C also tended to be lower in the SBCR group (53%, 10/19 cases) than in the LAFR group (80%, 12/15 cases) (P=0.0973). CONCLUSION: The SBCR is equal or superior to LAFR in preventing infection during neutropenia. Other advantages for SBCR are a low level of noise (40 dB), easy control of temperature and humidity, and efficient removal of odour. In addition to the quiet and comfortable atmosphere, expected favourable effects of negative air ions may give higher quality of life for patients in SBCR than those in LAFR. Further studies will be needed to examine the safety, benefits and effects of the negative ion exposure.","['Shinjo, Kaori', 'Takeshita, Akihiro', 'Yanagi, Mitsuaki', 'Yokota, Kazuko', 'Hirano, Kazumi', 'Suzuki, Mieko', 'Ohnishi, Kazunori', 'Ohno, Ryuzo']","['Shinjo K', 'Takeshita A', 'Yanagi M', 'Yokota K', 'Hirano K', 'Suzuki M', 'Ohnishi K', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan. kaoris@hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Adv Nurs,Journal of advanced nursing,7609811,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['*Air Microbiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Cross Infection/*prevention & control', '*Environment, Controlled', 'Humans', 'Infection Control/*methods', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', '*Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control', 'Patient Isolators']",,2002/02/20 10:00,2002/07/19 10:01,['2002/02/20 10:00'],"['2002/02/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/20 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Adv Nurs. 2002 Feb;37(3):227-33. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02095.x.,,,"['2095 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02095.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether oncogenic mutations cooperate with one another to transform cells and how is not well understood. The Friend murine retroviral erythroleukemia model involves mitogenic activation of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) by the virus env gene (F-gp55), aberrant over-expression of the transcription factor PU.1, and inactivating mutations in p53. In this report we demonstrate that concurrent expression of F-gp55 and PU.1 in erythroid target cells, in vivo, cooperate to accelerate erythroleukemia induction. Early in the disease, prior to the detection of clonal leukemic cells, activation of the EpoR by F-gp55, but not erythropoietin, resulted in transcriptional upregulation of PU.1 through a trans regulatory mechanism. This could occur in the absence of an integrated provirus within the PU.1 gene locus. The regulation of PU.1 transcription in established erythroleukemia cell lines differed depending upon the level of PU.1 protein present. Our results suggest that the action of F-gp55 contributes to both early and late stages of Friend erythroleukemia and that persistence of F-gp55 expression may be required not only to initiate erythroleukemia but to also maintain erythroleukemia following Friend virus infection.","['Afrikanova, Iva', 'Yeh, Ellen', 'Bartos, David', 'Watowich, Stephanie S', 'Longmore, Gregory D']","['Afrikanova I', 'Yeh E', 'Bartos D', 'Watowich SS', 'Longmore GD']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 South Euclid Ave., St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA077447-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077447-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 75315/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 77447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology/virology', 'Erythropoietin/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Virus Integration']",PMC2388250,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/03/09 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2001/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/30 00:00 [revised]', '2001/11/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Feb 14;21(8):1272-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205183.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1205183 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS48574'],

Gradual telomere loss with aging and rapid cycling of hematopoietic stem cells might contribute to immunosenescence, exhausted hematopoiesis, and increased likelihood of malignant transformation. In leukemias and lymphomas, telomere length may reflect the cellular proliferative history, prior to immortalization. The level of telomerase activity is generally influenced by the fraction of cells in the proliferative pool. Shortened telomeres and high telomerase activity almost always correlates with disease severity in hematologic neoplasias such as relapsed leukemia and high-grade lymphomas, indicating that measurement of telomere length and telomerase activity might be useful to monitor disease condition. Since the mode of action of telomerase inhibitors may require telomeric shortening before induction of apoptosis, anti-telomerase therapy might be helpful for adjuvant therapy following conventional chemotherapy, in vitro purging of neoplastic cells in stem cell transplantation, and treating minimal residual disease.

The AIEOP conducted a prospective study in order to assess incidence and relationships of early toxicity and transplant-related mortality (TRM) in a pediatric population. Between 1990 and 1997 toxicities reported in eight organs (central nervous system, heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys, bladder, mucosa) were classified into three grades (mild, moderate, severe) and prospectively registered for 636 consecutive children who underwent autologous (216) or allogeneic (420) transplantation, either from an HLA compatible related (294), or alternative (126) donor in 13 AIEOP transplant centers. Overall, 47% of the patients are alive in CR (3-year EFS: 45.2%, s.e.: 2.1), 19% died in CR at a median of 60 days (90-day TRM: 14.3%, s.e.: 1.4), 34% relapsed. Toxicity of any organ, but mucosa and gut, was positively correlated with early death; moderate and severe toxicity to heart, lungs, liver and kidneys significantly increased early TRM, with estimated relative risks of 9.1, 5.5, 2.7 and 2.8, respectively, as compared to absent or mild toxicity.

Residual tumour cells probably have survived therapy and account for subsequent disease relapse. The sensitivity of conventioned ways of detecting residual tumour cells, such as morphological studies, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetics, is only about 1% to 5% and may be inadequate. Polymerase chain reaction technology has provided a simple and highly sensitive means for the detection of minimal residual disease. The technology has been successfully applied to study biopsy samples obtained from patients with leukaemia and lymphpma. Its clinical usefulness, however, requires further evaluation by prospective clinical studies.","['Liang, R', 'Chan, D', 'Kwong, Y L', 'Chan, V']","['Liang R', 'Chan D', 'Kwong YL', 'Chan V']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Hong Kong Med J,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,9512509,,,,,1997/06/01 00:00,2002/02/19 10:00,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hong Kong Med J. 1997 Jun;3(2):195-200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cell types, store-operated influx gives rise to a Ca2+-selective current called I(CRAC) (Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current). Using both the whole-cell patch clamp technique to measure I(CRAC) directly and fluorescent Ca2+ imaging, we have examined the role of the lipo-oxygenase pathway in the activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry in the RBL-1 rat basophilic leukaemia cell-line. Pretreatment with a variety of structurally distinct lipo-oxygenase inhibitors all reduced the extent of I(CRAC), whereas inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes was without effect. The inhibition was still seen in the presence of the broad protein kinase blocker staurosporine, or when Na+ was used as the charge carrier through CRAC channels. The lipo-oxygenase blockers released Ca2+ from intracellular stores but this was not associated with subsequent Ca2+ entry. Lipo-oxygenase blockers also reduced both the amount of Ca2+ that could subsequently be released by the combination of thapsigargin and ionomycin in Ca2+-free solution and the Ca2+ influx component that occurred when external Ca2+ was re-admitted. The inhibitors were much less effective if applied after I(CRAC) had been activated. This inhibition of I(CRAC) could not be rescued by dialysis with 5(S)-hydroxyperoxyeicosa-6E,8Z,11Z,14Z,tetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), the first product of the 5-lipo-oxygenase pathway. Our findings indicate that exposure to pharmacological tools that inhibit the lipo-oxygenase enzymes all decrease the extent of activation of the current. Our results raise the possibility that a lipo-oxygenase might be involved in the activation of I(CRAC). Alternative explanations are also discussed.","['Glitsch, Maike D', 'Bakowski, Daniel', 'Parekh, Anant B']","['Glitsch MD', 'Bakowski D', 'Parekh AB']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Signalling, Department of Physiology, University Of Oxford, Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PT, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Caffeic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxycyanocinnamate)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '74581-83-2 (arachidonic acid 5-hydroperoxide)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/physiology', 'Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Caffeic Acids/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukotrienes/pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Masoprocol/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Permeability', 'Rats', 'Sodium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2290129,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/05/07 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 2002 Feb 15;539(Pt 1):93-106. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012826.,,,"['PHY_12826 [pii]', '10.1113/jphysiol.2001.012826 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detected this gene silencing as a reduction in the ratio of cells expressing the exogenous gene rather than a reduction in the average expression levels, indicating that down-regulation occurs in an all-or-none manner. Retroviral gene expression was protected from silencing and maintained in Brm-deficient host cells by exogenous expression of Brm but not BRG1, an alternative ATPase subunit in the SWI/SNF complex. Introduction of exogenous Brm to these cells suppressed recruitment of protein complexes containing YY1 and histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2 to the 5'-long terminal repeat region of the integrated provirus, leading to the enhancement of acetylation of specific lysine residues in histone H4 located in this region. Consistent with these observations, treatment of Brm-deficient cells with HDAC inhibitors but not DNA methylation inhibitors suppressed retroviral gene silencing. These results suggest that the Brm-containing SWI/SNF complex subfamily (trithorax-G) and a complex including YY1 and HDACs (Polycomb-G) counteract each other to maintain transcription of exogenously introduced genes.","['Mizutani, Taketoshi', 'Ito, Taiji', 'Nishina, Mitsue', 'Yamamichi, Nobutake', 'Watanabe, Akiko', 'Iba, Hideo']","['Mizutani T', 'Ito T', 'Nishina M', 'Yamamichi N', 'Watanabe A', 'Iba H']","['Division of Host-Parasite Interaction, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, 4-6-1 Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SMARCA2 protein, human)', '0 (Smarca2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (snf protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Neoplasms', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Chromatin/metabolism', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Library', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Mice', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Protein Subunits', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclear/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/genetics']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/07/03 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 May 3;277(18):15859-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M112421200.

The senescence-resistant strains have normal patterns of aging and do not show the specific aging-related changes seen in SAMP strains. The fact that AKR mice have high levels of endogenous, ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) prompted an examination of the expression levels of MuLV in SAM strains.

The results showed a linear increase in the solubility of CPT with increasing concentration of CDs. The apparent stability constants (K(c)) for the CPT complexes with alpha-CD, beta-CD, gamma-CD, HP-beta-CD, RDM-beta-CD, and RDM-gamma-CD were 188, 266, 73, 160, 910, and 40.6 M(-1), respectively, suggesting that RDM-beta-CD afforded the most stable complex. At a 25% w/v concentration of RDM-beta-CD, the solubility of CPT was 228.45 +/- 8.45 microg/ml, about 171 times higher than that in 0.02 N HCl. The stability of CPT in pH 7.4 buffer at 25 degrees C also increased linearly with an increase in the concentration of RDM-beta-CD. The observed pseudo-first-order hydrolysis rate constants (k(obs)) for the free and complexed CPT were 11.8 x 10(-3) and 1.18 x 10(-3) min(-1), corresponding to an increase in half-life of CPT from 58.7 to 587.3 min, respectively. The preliminary cytotoxicity study against the human-derived myeloid THP-1 leukemia cell line showed RDM-beta-CD/CPT and HP-beta-CD/CPT complexes to be about two-fold more active than free CPT. In conclusion, the results showed that CDs, in general, and RDM-beta-CD, in particular, are effective complexing agents and can be used to improve the solubility and stability of CPT. The increase in cytotoxicity of CPT in the presence of CD is likely due to an increase in its stability.","['Kang, Jichao', 'Kumar, Vijay', 'Yang, Dong', 'Chowdhury, Priyanka Roy', 'Hohl, Raymond J']","['Kang J', 'Kumar V', 'Yang D', 'Chowdhury PR', 'Hohl RJ']","['Pharmaceutics Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharm Sci,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,9317982,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cyclodextrins)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Biological Assay', 'Camptothecin/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Cyclodextrins/*chemistry', 'Drug Compounding', '*Drug Stability', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/06/11 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharm Sci. 2002 Mar;15(2):163-70. doi: 10.1016/s0928-0987(01)00214-7.,,,"['S0928098701002147 [pii]', '10.1016/s0928-0987(01)00214-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major limitation on success of sibling donor bone marrow transplantation for JMML has been reported to be relapse. A total of 46 children with a diagnosis of JMML underwent unrelated donor marrow (URD) transplantation facilitated by the National Marrow Donor Program. Forty-three of 46 patients had neutrophil engraftment at a median of 20 d post transplant, with platelet recovery in 28 of 40 evaluable patients at a median of 34.5 d. Thirty-two of 44 evaluable patients developed acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) (Grades 2-4) and chronic GVHD developed in 14 of 35 evaluable patients. At a median follow-up of 2.0 years, probabilities of survival and disease-free survival were 42% and 24% respectively. The probability of relapse was 58% at 2 years and represents the major cause of treatment failure. Multivariate analysis revealed that chronic GVHD was associated with reduced relapse [risk ratio 0.20 (95% CI 0.04-1.02, P=0.05)] improved survival [risk ratio 0.13 (95% CI 0.03-0.68, P=0.02)] and event-free survival [risk ratio 0.23 (95% CI 0.06-0.94, P=0.04)]. This study demonstrates that relapse is the major cause of treatment failure in patients with JMML undergoing URD transplantation. With lower relapse observed in patients with chronic GVHD, new treatment strategies that focus on enhancing the graft-versus-leukaemia effect may improve survival.","['Smith, Franklin O', 'King, Roberta', 'Nelson, Gene', 'Wagner, John E', 'Robertson, Kent A', 'Sanders, Jean E', 'Bunin, Nancy', 'Emaunel, Peter D', 'Davies, Stella M']","['Smith FO', 'King R', 'Nelson G', 'Wagner JE', 'Robertson KA', 'Sanders JE', 'Bunin N', 'Emaunel PD', 'Davies SM']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH 45229, USA. frank.smith@chmcc.org""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*therapy', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Mar;116(3):716-24. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03333.x.,,,"['3333 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03333.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,['National Marrow Donor Program'],,,,

Samples were prospectively taken from 24 patients before starting the conditioning regimen, at days +30, +60 and +90 and subsequently every 2-3 months. Samples from 16 patients in complete remission (CR) after allo-SCT were taken at least twice. Six of 24 patients harboured MRD (0.2-10% of mononuclear cells) at transplant and 18 were negative. Estimated disease-free survival for the MRD+ and MRD- groups at transplant was 33.3% and 73.5% respectively (P = 0.03). During follow-up, increasing MRD levels were detected in nine patients, a finding that preceded marrow relapse by 1-6 months. Two patients with stable low MRD levels remained in CR. When we used flow cytometry to test the effect of donor leucocyte infusions (DLI) in six patients, we observed that the only sustained remission was achieved when DLI was applied prior to overt relapse. We conclude that MRD by flow cytometry can rapidly assess tumoral burden before transplant to predict outcome, and can be clinically useful for the timing of DLI for increasing levels of leukaemia after transplant.","['Sanchez, Joaquin', 'Serrano, Josefina', 'Gomez, Pedro', 'Martinez, Francisco', 'Martin, Carmen', 'Madero, Luis', 'Herrera, Concepcion', 'Garcia, J Manuel', 'Casano, Javier', 'Torres, Antonio']","['Sanchez J', 'Serrano J', 'Gomez P', 'Martinez F', 'Martin C', 'Madero L', 'Herrera C', 'Garcia JM', 'Casano J', 'Torres A']","['Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, University Hospital Reina Sofia, Cordoba, Spain. joaquin.sanchez@cheerful.com']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Mar;116(3):686-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2002.3311a.x.,,,"['3311 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2002.3311a.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Low (1 micromol/l As2O3) concentrations induced apoptosis in NB-4, HL-60, U-937, CEM, HL-60, KG-1a, PBL-985, ML-2 and MV-4-11, but not in HEL, K-562, KG-1 and Jurkat up to 35 d of incubation. However, the non-apoptotic population of 1 micromol/l As2O3-treated HEL, K-562, K-562 (0.02), K-562(0.1) and Jurkat showed reduced proliferation. CEM as well as its' multidrug-resistant derivatives were sensitive to 1 micromol/l As2O3. In summary, these data demonstrate that As2O3-induced apoptosis is not restricted to cell lines with t(15;17). Apoptosis was induced in vitro by As2O3 concentrations that are achievable in vivo after infusion of well-tolerated As2O3 doses. Thus, As2O3 might be a suitable therapeutic agent for malignancies other than APL provided the adequate dose and duration of As2O3 treatment are used.","['Rojewski, M T', 'Baldus, C', 'Knauf, W', 'Thiel, E', 'Schrezenmeier, H']","['Rojewski MT', 'Baldus C', 'Knauf W', 'Thiel E', 'Schrezenmeier H']","['Freie Universitat Berlin, Universitatsklinikum Benjamin Franklin, Medizinische Klinik III (Hamatologie, Onkologie und Transfusionsmedizin), Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Mar;116(3):555-63. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03298.x.,,,"['3298 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03298.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleoside cytotoxicity depends on the conversion of these agents to 5'-phosphate derivatives, following drug entry into cells via nucleoside transport (NT) processes. This study compared es nucleoside transporter content, determined using a flow cytometric assay with SAENTA [5'-S-(2-aminoethyl)-N6-(4-nitrobenzyl)-5'-thioadenosine] fluorescein, and cytotoxicities of 2-CdA and araC in fresh lymphoblasts from previously untreated paediatric ALL patients and the human T-lymphoblast cell line, CCRF-CEM. Lymphoblast samples from individual patients ranged widely in sensitivity to both 2-CdA (IC50, 6 nmol/l to > 5 micromol/l; mean = 418 nmol/l; n = 8) and araC (IC50, 59 nmol/l to > 5 micromol/l; mean = 1050 nmol/l; n = 7), although IC50 values for the two drugs were correlated (r = 0.78, P = 0.032, n = 7). Cellular es nucleoside transporter content varied more than 35-fold among samples from 10 patients. The correlation between es nucleoside transporter content and drug sensitivity was statistically significant for araC (r = -0.93, P = 0.023, n = 5), but not for 2-CdA (r = -0.57, P = 0.23, n = 6). Exposure of CCRF-CEM cells to araC resulted in a substantial araC concentration-dependent increase in the relative survival of es transporter-deficient cells, whereas the increase was slight following exposure to 2-CdA. We conclude that, in ALL lymphoblasts, es nucleoside transporter content is a determinant of araC sensitivity and that a deficiency in NT may impart resistance to araC.","['Wright, Adrienne M P', 'Paterson, Alan R P', 'Sowa, Bernard', 'Akabutu, John J', 'Grundy, Paul E', 'Gati, Wendy P']","['Wright AM', 'Paterson AR', 'Sowa B', 'Akabutu JJ', 'Grundy PE', 'Gati WP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cladribine/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Mar;116(3):528-37. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03300.x.,,,"['3300 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03300.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-one out of 24 (87%) cases overexpressing at least one MDR-related protein had a defect in accumulating daunorubicin into their blast cells, while only 4/24 (16%) cases who did not overexpress any protein had similar features. The complete remission rates were similar in MDR-positive and -negative (-) patients but relapses within 6 months were more frequent in P-gp+ cases, and therefore the disease-free survival duration was shorter in P-gp+ than in P-gp- patients (P = 0.01). The number of MRP+ and/or LRP+ cases was too small to be able to draw any conclusion on their role in affecting or predicting therapy outcome. In conclusion, P-gp overexpression associated with a defect in daunorubicin accumulation is a frequent feature in adult ALL at onset and seems to be related to poorer therapy outcome and, consequently, a shorter disease-free survival. LRP and MRP overexpression seems to be a rare event and no conclusion can be drawn on its prognostic role.","['Damiani, Daniela', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Michieli, Mariagrazia', 'Masolini, Paola', 'Stocchi, Raffaella', 'Geromin, Antonella', 'Ermacora, Anna', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Baccarani, Michele']","['Damiani D', 'Michelutti A', 'Michieli M', 'Masolini P', 'Stocchi R', 'Geromin A', 'Ermacora A', 'Russo D', 'Fanin R', 'Baccarani M']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medical and Morphological Research, University Hospital, Udine, Italy.

This percentage reflects an improved survival for certain subsets of patients with low-risk cytogenetic abnormalities after treatment with high-dose cytarabine, whereas lower long-term survival is seen for other patients and especially for the large group of elderly patients. New treatment strategies are therefore considered in AML and one approach is to target the regulation of apoptosis in AML cells with new pharmacological agents. Regulation of apoptosis seems to be clinically important in AML as intracellular levels of apoptosis-regulating mediators can be used as predictors of prognosis in AML. It is also well documented that cytotoxic drugs exert important antileukaemic effects through induction of apoptosis. Marine toxins represent new pharmacological agents with proapoptotic effects and should be considered for combination therapy with cytotoxic drugs. These agents are already useful laboratory tools for in vitro studies of AML cells but it is still too early to conclude whether they will become useful in clinical therapy. One of the major problems to be investigated is the toxicity of combination therapy, although this may be solved by the coupling of toxins to antibodies or growth factors with a preferential binding to AML cells. Other problems that have to be addressed are the possible effect of the toxins' tumour promoting effects on chemosensitivity in relapsed AML and the possibility of cross-resistance between cytotoxic drugs and toxins.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Glenjen, Nils', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Herfindal, Lars', 'Doskeland, Stein Ove']","['Bruserud O', 'Glenjen N', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Herfindal L', 'Doskeland SO']","['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Marine Toxins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Marine Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2003/01/28 04:00,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/01/28 04:00 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2002 Feb;2(2):197-210. doi: 10.1517/14712598.2.2.197.,,134,['10.1517/14712598.2.2.197 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several garlic compounds, including allicin and its corresponding sulfide, inhibit the proliferation of several human malignant cells. Ajoene is a garlic-derived compound produced most efficiently from pure allicin and has the advantage of a greater chemical stability than allicin. Recently, ajoene was shown to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of human leukaemia CD34-negative cells including HL-60, U937, HEL and OCIM-I. More significantly, ajoene was shown to induce 30% apoptosis in myeloblasts from a chronic myeloid leukaemia patient in blastic crisis. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignant disease in which disease progression at the level of CD34-positive cells has a major impact on resistance to chemotherapy and relapse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of ajoene on changes in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins: bcl-2 and caspase-3, induced by two principal drugs used in treatment of AML, cytarabine and fludarabine, in KGI human myeloid leukaemia CD34-positive-resistant cells. Both quantitative ELISA measurement of bcl-2 and colourimetric measurement of active caspase-3 were used. RESULTS: Quantitative ELISA measurement of bcl-2 (units per million cells) showed treatment of KG1-resistant leukaemia cells with 40 microM ajoene alone to significantly reduce the bcl-2-expression from 239.5 +/- 1.5 in control cultures to only 22.0 +/- 4.0 in ajoene-treated cultures. Fludarabine had significantly more inhibitory effect on bcl-2-expression than cytarabine in KGI-resistant myeloid leukaemia cells. Ajoene significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of the two chemotherapeutic drugs, cytarabine and fludarabine, on bcl-2-expression in KGI cells. Bcl-2-expression could not be detected in fludarabine + ajoene-treated cultures. The Western blot of bcl-2-expression in KGI control and treated cells confirmed the quantitative ELISA measurements. Quantitative measurement of activated caspase-3 (pg per million cells) showed the two drugs, cytarabine and fludarabine, significantly increased the activated caspase-3 level in KGI myeloid leukaemia cells. CONCLUSION: The addition of ajoene enhanced the activation of caspase-3 in both cytarabine- and fludarabine-treated KGI cells. In conclusion, the present results suggest a potential role for the combination of ajoene with fludarabine-based chemotherapy in the treatment of refractory and/or relapsed AML patients. Further studies are warranted to evaluate a similar enhancing effect for ajoene in blast cells from AML patients in primary cultures.","['Ahmed, N', 'Laverick, L', 'Sammons, J', 'Zhang, H', 'Maslin, D J', 'Hassan, H T']","['Ahmed N', 'Laverick L', 'Sammons J', 'Zhang H', 'Maslin DJ', 'Hassan HT']","['Division of Biomedical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, University of Wolverhampton, England, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '99A0041VG8 (ajoene)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Garlic/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Sulfoxides', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 Sep-Oct;21(5):3519-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonspecific macrophage reaction precedes the development of specific immune response and is important for further tumor growth and stroma formation. We investigated two lymphoma cell lines of the same origin, differing in immunogenicity: non-immunogenic parental strain P388 and its highly immunogenic subline P388/adria. Early systemic inflammatory response resulted in the enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide production by peritoneal macrophages which was at a maximum on the first day after s.c. tumor inoculation and was observed in mice bearing either of these tumors independently of immunogenicity. It was followed by a transient elevation of the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNF-alpha IL-6. In order to evaluate the role of inflammatory response, vaccinations with lethally irradiated lymphoma cells were performed. After two weekly injections, the mice were challenged s.c. with live tumor cells of the same subline. Effective vaccination with P388/adria lymphoma cells induced retardation of tumor growth in parallel with down-regulation of peritoneal macrophage activity and abrogation of serum cytokine release. Non-effective immunization with P388 cells influenced neither tumor growth nor macrophage functions and cytokine level. Thus, a positive correlation was found between down-regulation of the inflammatory response and inhibition of tumor growth. We suppose that, in efficiently immunized mice, special mechanisms exist which are responsible for down-regulation of the inflammatory reaction. Macrophage products may facilitate tumor cell survival by preventing apoptosis or participate in the activation of tumor neoangiogenesis. Suppression of these activities may serve as an important tool for the inhibition of tumor growth at the early stages of malignant transformation.","['Kisseleva, E', 'Becker, M', 'Lemm, M', 'Fichtner, I']","['Kisseleva E', 'Becker M', 'Lemm M', 'Fichtner I']","['Institute for Experimental Medicine, St Petersburg, Russia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*immunology', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 Sep-Oct;21(5):3477-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The liposome entrapment efficiency of mitoxantrone was 93.4 +/- 2.8%. In vitro cytotoxicity studies in HL60 cells comparing LEM with conventional mitoxantrone (MTO) showed IC50 values of 0.31 +/- 0.05 ng/ml and 0.48 +/- 0.06 ng/ml for LEM and MTO, respectively. In CD2F1 mice, LEM was significantly less toxic as compared with MTO. A single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 15 mg/kg MTO produced 100% mortality in CD2F1 mice by Day 10, whereas a single i.v. dose as high as 35 mg/kg LEM caused no mortality for at least up to Day 60 post-treatment. Multiple doses of MTO (i.v., 5.0 mg/kg, 1x daily, x5) caused 100% mortality by Day 10, whereas a similar dose regimen of LEM caused no mortality in CD2F1 mice. Clinical and histopathology evaluations indicated long-term normal tissue protection in mice treated with relatively high single dose (i.v., 35 mg/kg) or multiple doses of LEM (i.v., 5.0 mg/kg, 1x daily, x5). LEM also demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic profiles. CD2F1 mice injected with 5 mg/kg i.v. dose of LEM showed plasma levels 51-fold higher than with an equivalent dose of MTO. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve was 200-fold greater with LEM as compared to MTO. The plasma half-lives were 0.96 hours and 0.11 hours for LEM and MTO, respectively. An altered tissue distribution was observed with LEM; cardiac tissue demonstrating at least 2.6-fold lower levels of mitoxantrone with LEM vs. MTO. LEM exhibited significant anti-tumor activity against murine ascitic L1210 leukemia in CD2F1 mice. Treatment with a single dose of 20.0 mg/kg LEM resulted in 100% long-term survivors. LEM 2.5 mg/kg (i.v., x4) had antitumor activity against a human hormone-independent prostate carcinoma (PC-3) grown in athymic mice, while a comparable dose of MTO was too toxic. A significant decrease in toxicity, altered pharmacokinetics, and enhanced efficacy of LEM suggest that LEM may provide a viable alternative to the clinical use of conventional mitoxantrone.","['Gokhale, P C', 'Pei, J', 'Zhang, C', 'Ahmad, I', 'Rahman, A', 'Kasid, U']","['Gokhale PC', 'Pei J', 'Zhang C', 'Ahmad I', 'Rahman A', 'Kasid U']","['Department of Radiation Medicine, Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Tissue Distribution']",,2002/02/19 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/19 10:00'],"['2002/02/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/19 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 Sep-Oct;21(5):3313-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major improvement in vinblastine retention in buffer as well as in culture medium was achieved by employing DPPG. The DSC data showed that vinblastine exerted a more perturbing effect in DPPC-cholesterol bilayers than in DPPG-cholesterol bilayers and this may explain their lower retention time.

It is a tight-binding inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme essential in cellular metabolism of purines. Children with congenital absence of ADA suffer from atrophy of lymphoid tissues and severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) syndrome. It was speculated that pentostatin would be lymphocytotoxic, and this proved to be the case, promoting its investigation in lymphoid neoplasms. It was anticipated that pentostatin would be most active in neoplasms with high intracellular concentrations of ADA---e.g., acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), particularly its T cell variety. Although pentostatin proved to be active in ALL, large doses were required and toxic effects outweighted therapeutic benefits. By contrast, pentostatin proved to be exceptionally active in hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a B cell neoplasm with low intracellular concentrations of ADA. Pentostatin has since been shown to possess activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prolymphocytic leukemia, cutaneous T cell lymphomas, adult T cell lymphoma-leukemia, and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. It potentiates the activity of vidarabine against viruses and against the cells of acute myeloid leukemia. Pentostatin is inactive in melanoma and renal carcinoma, but has not been adequately evaluated in other solid tumors. The toxic effects of pentostatin include renal failure, central nervous system (CNS) depression, immunosuppression, keratoconjunctivitis, and opportunistic infections. In the absence of pre-existing bone marrow compromise, pentostatin produces only mild myelosuppression. Aside from its use as an antineoplastic agent, pentostatin has potential applications as an immunosuppresive drug, as an antiviral agent, as an antimalarial compound, and in the protection of cells of the CNS from damage induced by ischemia and anoxia.","['Spiers, Alexander S.D.']",['Spiers AS'],"['H.

Their instability at multiple genetic loci may result from mismatch repair errors and it occurs in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. This instability is also found in many sporadic cancers. In order to evaluate the importance of this process in myeloid leukemias, we studied five loci in different chromosomes of 43 patients, 22 with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase, 7 with CML in blast crisis, and 14 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), by comparing leukemic DNA extracted from bone marrow and constitutional DNA obtained from buccal epithelial cells. Only one of the 43 patients (2.1%), with relapsed AML, showed an alteration in the allele length at a single locus. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in order to improve the characterization of leukemic subtypes and to determine if specific chromosome aberrations were associated with the presence of microsatellite instability. Several chromosome aberrations were observed, most of them detected at diagnosis and during follow-up of the patients, according to current literature. These findings suggest that microsatellite instability is an infrequent genetic event in myeloid leukemias, adding support to the current view that the mechanisms of genomic instability in solid tumors differ from those observed in leukemias, where specific chromosome aberrations seem to play a major role.","['Ribeiro, E M S F', 'Rodriguez, J M', 'Coser, V M', 'Sotero, M G', 'Fonseca Neto, J M', 'Pasquini, R', 'Cavalli, I J']","['Ribeiro EM', 'Rodriguez JM', 'Coser VM', 'Sotero MG', 'Fonseca Neto JM', 'Pasquini R', 'Cavalli IJ']","['Departamento de Genetica, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, PR, Brasil. eribeiro@bio.ufpr.br']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Pair Mismatch/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Repeats/*genetics', 'Middle Aged']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/05/22 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2002 Feb;35(2):153-9. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2002000200003.,,,"['S0100-879X2002000200003 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2002000200003 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phenomenal progress in deciphering the human genome has given significant impetus to the application of engineered antibodies in proteomics. Thus, advances in phage display antibody libraries can now help to define novel gene function and the measurement of abnormal protein expression in pathological states. Furthermore, intrabody and antibody engineering provide vehicles for the development of molecular medicines of the future. In addition to these new directions, antibody engineering has begun to show concrete success in its long-term efforts to develop targeted immunotherapies for cancer and other diseases. The cornerstones of clinical development are the detailed academic clinical trials that continue to push the boundaries of engineered antibodies into the real world. The field displays a healthy impatience for practical results, as research accelerates with concerted efforts to transfer preclinical insights into clinical trials. Growing private and governmental expenditures will lead to the rapid expansion of life-saving immunotherapeutic agents. The present review developed from our effort to report on the 11th Annual International Conference on Antibody Engineering (3-6 December 2000). This annual meeting is a forum for discussions on the latest advances in antibody engineering groups from around the world, and now includes the broader agenda of engineering in molecular immunology. In bringing scientists together to exchange ideas at this open forum, new collaborations and the threads of new discoveries are woven. For example, Professors Gerhard Wagner (Harvard Medical School), Dennis Burton (Scripps Research Institute), and Peter Hudson (CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia) gave exciting insights on structural immunobiology that had implications across many disciplines. The growth in antibody engineering was highlighted by the attendance of some 600 participants at the meeting, doubling that of the 1999 meeting. Dramatic clinical acceptance of monoclonal antibodies during the past two years has fostered this growth, with sales in 2000 of 1.8 billion dollars and projections for 2001 of 3 billion dollars. However, economic measures cannot begin to convey the medical revolution that is being effected by these first humanized and chimerized monoclonal antibodies. At this juncture, the 10 monoclonal antibody therapeutics in clinical use are of murine origin, of which 3 are entirely murine (OKT3, Mylotarg, 90Y-labeled Bexxar), 4 have been chimerized (human constant domains replacing murine) (ReoPro, Rituxan and its 131I-labeled analogue (Zevalin), Simulect, Remicade) and 3 were chimerized and humanized (human residues being substituted for at least some mouse-specific framework residues in VH and VL) (Zenapax, Herceptin, Synagis). Fully humanized anti-CD52 (CAMPATH-1H) has also been approved by the FDA for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and should become available in late 2001. Humanization was initially developed by Dr. Greg Winter at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK), who presented the meeting's keynote address, ""Antibodies as a Paradigm for Molecular Evolution"". His pioneering work in antibody phage display libraries has been reformulated into a daring approach to develop truly novel proteins with genetically paired structural elements. He described studies in combinatorial protein engineering with enormous implications for both industrial and therapeutic applications of macromolecules.","['Huston, J S', 'George, A J']","['Huston JS', 'George AJ']","['Lexigen Pharmaceuticals Corp, 125 Hartwell Avenue, Lexington, MA 02421-3125, USA. jhuston@lexigenpharm.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Hum Antibodies,Human antibodies,9711270,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Proteome)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques', 'Humans', 'Peptide Library', '*Protein Engineering', 'Proteome', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*immunology']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/04/19 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/19 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Antibodies. 2001;10(3-4):127-42.,,174,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When overexpressed in primary erythroblasts, FLI-1 blocks erythropoeitin (Epo)-induced terminal differentiation and inhibits apoptosis normally induced in response to Epo withdrawal. We show here that the survival-inducing property of FLI-1 is associated with increased transcription of BCL-2. We further show that FLI-1 binds BCL-2 promoter sequences in transformed erythroblasts, and in vitro studies identify specific FLI-1-binding sites essential for the transactivation of the BCL-2 promoter by FLI-1. Analysis of FLI-1 mutants showed a correlation between the ability of FLI-1 to transactivate BCL-2 promoter sequences and their ability to inhibit apoptosis in the absence of Epo. Moreover, inhibitor studies confirmed the essential role of BCL-2 for FLI-1-transformed erythroblast survival. Finally, enforced expression of BCL-2 was sufficient to promote survival and terminal differentiation of erythroblasts in the absence of Epo. These results show that BCL-2 is an in vivo target of FLI-1 in FLI-1-transformed erythroblasts and that its deregulated expression is instrumental in the survival of these cells.","['Lesault, Isabelle', 'Quang, Christine Tran', 'Frampton, Jon', 'Ghysdael, Jacques']","['Lesault I', 'Quang CT', 'Frampton J', 'Ghysdael J']","['CNRS UMR146, Institut Curie-Section de Recherche, Centre Universitaire, Bat. 110, 91405 Orsay, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Chickens', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Erythroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Quail', 'Up-Regulation/*physiology']",PMC125347,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/04/20 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2002 Feb 15;21(4):694-703. doi: 10.1093/emboj/21.4.694.,,,['10.1093/emboj/21.4.694 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fat hyperintensity on T1-weighted MR images facilitates the evaluation of marrow abnormalities. Our purpose was to compare cranial marrow signal intensity patterns in adults with systemic disorders and in healthy subjects. METHODS: MR images in 25 adults with underlying systemic disorders (chronic anemia, lymphoma, leukemia, or other infiltrative processes) and 44 healthy aged-matched individuals were retrospectively reviewed. Calvarial and clival marrow signal intensity on sagittal T1-weighted images was graded relative to that of orbital fat, white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM). Marrow was classified as homogeneous (uniformly isointense), diffusely heterogeneous (mottled), or focally heterogeneous (generally isointense with a focal lesion). RESULTS: In 84% of the control subjects, bone marrow was iso- or hyperintense relative to WM. Patients had abnormal diploic (n = 22) or clival (n = 17) marrow; 22 had calvarial marrow that was hypointense relative to WM compared with that in seven healthy subjects (P <.001). Marrow hypointensity relative to WM was a sensitive (93%) and specific (86%) marker of pathologic abnormality. Although marrow hypointensity relative to GM was specific (96%), it was not sensitive (67%). Calvarial and clival marrow patterns, respectively, were homogeneous in 81% and 64% of control subjects and 76% and 60% of patients. Clival marrow intensity varied more than did calvarial intensity; therefore, clival criteria were less sensitive and accurate in systemic disease detection. CONCLUSION: Homogeneous diploic marrow hypointense relative to WM on non-contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images suggests an underlying systemic or hematologic disorder and requires appropriate clinical correlation and evaluation.","['Loevner, Laurie A', 'Tobey, Jennifer D', 'Yousem, David M', 'Sonners, Adina I', 'Hsu, Wendy C']","['Loevner LA', 'Tobey JD', 'Yousem DM', 'Sonners AI', 'Hsu WC']","['Department of Radiology, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, 3400 Spruce Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

ICSBP(-/-) mice are immunodeficient and susceptible to various pathogens. They have defects in the macrophage function, including the ability to induce interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40 and some IFN-gamma-responsible genes. In addition, ICSBP(-/-) mice develop a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-like syndrome, where a systemic expansion of granulocytes is followed by a fatal blast crisis. ICSBP(-/-) mice harbor an increased number of myeloid progenitor cells, and the -/- progenitors preferentially give rise to granulocytes, although they cannot efficiently generate another descendant of the myeloid lineage, macrophages. Studies with myeloid progenitor cells have shown that ICSBP drives their differentiation toward macrophage, whereas it inhibits granulocyte differentiation. Furthermore, myeloid cells from ICSBP(-/-) mice are resistant to apoptosis. These results illustrate the mechanism by which the loss of ICSBP leads to immunodeficiency and CML-like syndrome and suggest ICSBP's critical role in the development of myeloid cells.","['Tamura, Tomohiko', 'Ozato, Keiko']","['Tamura T', 'Ozato K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. tamurat@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/06/18 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002 Jan;22(1):145-52. doi: 10.1089/107999002753452755.,,65,['10.1089/107999002753452755 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, IRF-4 is only transiently induced in T lymphocytes activated by signals that mimic stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR). In vivo and in vitro analyses have identified several regulatory regions within the human IRF-4 promoter that interact with the transcriptional regulators NF-kappaB, NF-AT, and Sp-1 to drive IRF-4 production in HTLV-I-infected, ATL-derived cells. cDNA array analysis of an IRF-4-expressing T cell line has also provided valuable insight into potential IRF-4 target genes.

We describe the long-term follow-up period of a series of patients treated with intrathecal colloidal gold and emphasize the high incidence of delayed cerebrovascular complications and their management. METHODS: Between 1967 and 1970, 14 children with posterior fossa medulloblastoma underwent treatment at the University of Minnesota. Treatment consisted of surgical resection, external beam radiotherapy, and intrathecal colloidal gold. All patients underwent long-term follow-up periods. RESULTS: Of the 14 original patients, 6 died within 2 years of treatment; all experienced persistent or recurrent disease. The eight surviving patients developed significant neurovascular complications 5 to 20 years after treatment. Three patients died as a result of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and five developed ischemic symptoms from severe vasculopathy that resembled moyamoya disease. CONCLUSION: Although therapy with colloidal gold resulted in long-term survival in a number of cases of childhood medulloblastoma, our experience suggests that the severe cerebrovascular side effects fail to justify its use. The unique complications associated with colloidal gold therapy, as well as the management of these complications, are presented. We recommend routine screening of any long-term survivors to exclude the presence of an intracranial aneurysm and to document the possibility of moyamoya syndrome.","['Nussbaum, E S', 'Sebring, L A', 'Neglia, J P', 'Chu, R', 'Mattsen, N D', 'Erickson, D L']","['Nussbaum ES', 'Sebring LA', 'Neglia JP', 'Chu R', 'Mattsen ND', 'Erickson DL']","['Department of Neurological Surgery, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA. nussb002@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,['0 (Gold Colloid)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aneurysm, Ruptured/chemically induced/pathology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cerebral Arteries/drug effects/pathology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gold Colloid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intracranial Aneurysm/chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Moyamoya Disease/chemically induced/pathology', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/chemically induced/pathology']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2001/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neurosurgery. 2001 Dec;49(6):1308-11; discussion 1311-2. doi: 10.1097/00006123-200112000-00004.,,,['10.1097/00006123-200112000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These properties were compared with those of the well-studied RTs of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukaemia virus (MLV). Both the elongation of the DNA template and the processivity of DNA synthesis exhibited by BLV RT are impaired relative to the other two RTs studied. Two parameters of fidelity were studied, the capacity to incorporate incorrect nucleotides at the 3' end of the nascent DNA strand and the ability to extend these 3' end mispairs. BLV RT shows a fidelity of misinsertion higher than that of HIV-1 RT and lower than that of MLV RT. The pattern of mispair elongation by BLV RT suggests that the in vitro error proneness of BLV RT is closer to that of HIV-1 RT. These fidelity properties are discussed in the context of the various retroviral RTs studied so far.","['Avidan, Orna', 'Meer, Michal Entin', 'Oz, Iris', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Avidan O', 'Meer ME', 'Oz I', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/03/20 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 2002 Feb;269(3):859-67. doi: 10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02719.x.,,,"['2719 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0014-2956.2001.02719.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulatory agencies require a demonstration that mAbs intended for human use are free of retrovirus with an adequate margin of safety. This is usually achieved by evaluation studies, performed at small scale, to demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of removing or inactivating several different model viruses, including a murine retrovirus. In a previous report, we demonstrated the utility of TaqMan fluorogenic 5'-nuclease product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (TM-PERT) assays for measuring reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in laboratory-scale cell-culture samples and RT removal by laboratory-scale models of processing steps. In this report, we evaluate the specificity, accuracy, range, precision and robustness of TM-PERT for this purpose. We find that this assay detects RT activity contained in xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MuLV) and CHO cell type C particles and quantifies particle numbers comparably to other assays (e.g. transmission electron microscopy, viral sequence specific TaqMan). Cell derived DNA polymerases appear to contribute only modestly to the assay background and RT activity in clarified cell culture harvests is contained largely in Type C particles. TM-PERT is linear and precise between 10(7)and 10(13) pU/ml, establishing the assay range. The assay is robust in that test article storage condition and DNA/protein content had little impact on assay performance. Thus, TM-PERT appears to be an acceptable assay to measure type C particles in rodent cell culture samples.","['Brorson, Kurt', 'Xu, Yuan', 'Swann, Patrick G', 'Hamilton, Elizabeth', 'Mustafa, Mehnaz', 'de Wit, Christina', 'Norling, Lenore A', 'Stein, Kathryn E']","['Brorson K', 'Xu Y', 'Swann PG', 'Hamilton E', 'Mustafa M', 'de Wit C', 'Norling LA', 'Stein KE']","['Division of Monoclonal Antibodies, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 8800 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. brorson@cber.fda.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Biologicals,Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization,9004494,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '57-50-1 (Sucrose)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Drosophila', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Quality Control', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Subcellular Fractions', 'Sucrose/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/05/15 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biologicals. 2002 Mar;30(1):15-26. doi: 10.1006/biol.2001.0290.,,,"['10.1006/biol.2001.0290 [doi]', 'S1045105601902908 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we established the mutant DAP12-M1 transfectants (Y76F-M1) that have mutation at their ITAM motifs. We observed that Y76F-M1 cells could not differentiate to macrophages by stimulation via DAP12, whereas wild type DAP12 transfectants (FDAP-M1) could. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the apoptosis signal mediated by LPS was inhibited in Y76F-M1 cells, but was augmented in FDAP-M1 cells.

This complication likely results from previous exposure of the autologous stem cells to chemotherapy as well as to the high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy that are used as part of the conditioning regimen. A number of centers are reporting that, second to disease relapse, therapy-related MDS and AML are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality after ASCT. There is abundant evidence that therapy-related MDS and AML are clonal hemopathies that are consequence of an acquired somatic mutation that confers a proliferative and/or survival advantage to hematopoietic progenitors. However, no single mutation or gene rearrangement is sufficient for the development of therapy-related AML, and the identification of a singlegene rearrangement or point mutation may not necessarily be predictive of the development of therapy-related AML in the post-ASCT setting, a caveat that must be kept in mind when risk is assessed. There are at least 5 methods for assessing risk based on the presence of clonal abnormalities in hematopoietic cells, including standard cytogenetics, interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization, analysis for loss of heterozygosity, polymerase chain reaction for point mutations, and X-inactivation-based clonality assays. Each of these approaches has strengths and weaknesses that are discussed here in detail.","['Gilliland, D Gary', 'Gribben, John G']","['Gilliland DG', 'Gribben JG']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects/methods']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(1):9-16. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11846355.,,39,"['S1083879102500604 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11846355 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized PBSCs were apheresed from 57 HLA-matched siblings aged 9 months to 24 years (median, 8 years) without any serious adverse, effects. No abnormalities were found in these donors for a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 6-56 months). Patients were conditioned with a TBI-containing regimen (n = 17) or a non-TBI regimen (n = 40). GVHD prophylaxis consisted of methotrexate (MTX) plus cyclosporine A (CSP) for 23 patients, CSP plus methylprednisolone (mPDN) for 22 patients, MTX only for 7 patients, CSP only for 4 patients, and MTX plus CSP plus mPDN for 1 patient. Engraftment was prompt, with a median number of days to reach an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) above 0.5 x 10(9)/L of 13 days (range, 8-23 days), with 1 graft failure. Acute GVHD (grades II-IV) occurred in 8 (16%) of 49 evaluable patients, and chronic GVHD developed in 23 (64%) of 36 evaluable patients. Notably, two thirds of chronic GVHD was extensive. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of 3-year disease-free survival was 0% for refractory disease (n = 6), 37.2% +/- 11.8% for high-risk malignancies (n = 25), 81.4% +/- 9.7% for standard-risk malignancies (n = 18), and 100% for nonmalignant disease (n = 8). The estimated 100-day nonrelapse mortality rate was 9.9% +/- 4.2%. In conclusion, allogeneic PBSCT is feasible in a pediatric population. Although the grade of acute GVHD was set low, as in Japanese BMT studies, the incidence and severity of chronic GVHD appears to be relatively high. For nonmalignant disease, the question arises of whether the higher incidence and severity of chronic GVHD is a drawback of this procedure. For high-risk malignancies, whether or not a graft-versus-leukemia effect prevents relapse needs to be clarified in future comparative studies with BMT.","['Watanabe, Tsutomu', 'Takaue, Yoichi', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Kikuta, Atsushi', 'Imaizumi, Masue', 'Watanabe, Arata', 'Eguchi, Haruhiko', 'Ohta, Shigeru', 'Horikoshi, Yasuo', 'Iwai, Asayuki', 'Makimoto, Atsushi', 'Kuroda, Yasuhiro']","['Watanabe T', 'Takaue Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Koike K', 'Kikuta A', 'Imaizumi M', 'Watanabe A', 'Eguchi H', 'Ohta S', 'Horikoshi Y', 'Iwai A', 'Makimoto A', 'Kuroda Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Tokushima School of Medicine, Japan. twatanab@clin.med.tokushima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Cells/transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/mortality/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Siblings', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(1):26-31. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11846353.,,,"['S1083879102500628 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11846353 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,['Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Study Group of Japan'],,,,

The incidence of tumor relapse is particularly high after autologous BMT. Natural killer (NK) cells comprise various subsets that can express inhibitory receptors for MHC class I determinants. We have recently demonstrated that blockade of NK-cell inhibitory receptors can augment antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. However, breakdown of tolerance and autoreactivity may occur as a result of the inhibition of NK-cell inactivation to self MHC determinants. We have utilized F(ab')2 fragments of monoclonal antibody, 5E6, against Ly49C/I inhibitory receptors, which are expressed on 35% to 60% of NK cells in H2b strains of mice and are specific for H2Kb, to investigate the effect of inhibitory-receptor blockade on syngeneic bone marrow cell (BMC) and tumor cell growth. We show that treatment of interleukin 2-activated C57BL/6 (B6, H2b) SCID-mouse NK cells with 5E6 F(ab')2 fragments during 48-hour coculture resulted in autoreactivity against syngeneic BMCs as demonstrated by suppression of myeloid reconstitution on day 14 post-BMT. However, this suppressive effect was transient and normalized by day 21 post-BMT. In contrast, blockade of inhibitory receptors during 24-hour coculture had no adverse effects on myeloid reconstitution after BMT. Furthermore, under the same coculture conditions, NK cell-mediated purging of C1498 leukemia cells contaminating syngeneic BMCs was more effective with inhibitory-receptor blockade, leading to a significantly higher proportion of animals with long-term survival compared to the control recipients. These results demonstrate that short-term in vitro blockade of inhibitory receptors can augment antitumor activity without long-term inhibitory effects on BMCs and thus may be of potential use in the purging of contaminating tumor cells prior to autologous BMT.","['Koh, Crystal Y', 'Raziuddin, Arati', 'Welniak, Lisbeth A', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Bennett, Michael', 'Murphy, William J']","['Koh CY', 'Raziuddin A', 'Welniak LA', 'Blazar BR', 'Bennett M', 'Murphy WJ']","['Transplantation Biology Laboratory, Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 70134/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-56000/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Klra3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Coculture Techniques/methods', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Congenic', 'Mice, SCID', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily A', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Receptors, NK Cell Lectin-Like', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/methods']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2002;8(1):17-25. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11846352.,,,"['S1083879102500616 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2002.v8.pm11846352 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In several recent studies increased levels of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes were correlated with a heightened risk of cancer, especially hematological malignancies. Thus, chromosomal aberrations may be a predictor of future leukemia risk. Previous studies exploring whether benzene exposure induces chromosomal aberrations have yielded mostly positive results. However, it remains unclear whether the chromosomal aberrations induced by benzene occur in a distinct pattern. Here, we thoroughly review the major chromosome studies published to date in benzene-exposed workers, benzene-poisoned and preleukemia patients, and leukemia cases associated with benzene expose. Although three cytogenetic markers (chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, and micronuclei) are commonly examined, our primary focus is on studies of chromosomal aberrations, because only this marker has so far been correlated with increased cancer risk. This review surveys the published literature, analyzes the study results, and discusses the characteristics of effects reported. In most studies of currently exposed workers, increases in chromosomal aberrations were observed. However, due to the relatively small number of affected individuals and variability in the reported aberrations, firm conclusions cannot be made about the involvement of specific chromosomes or chromosome regions. Further, in leukemia cases associated with benzene exposure, there is no evidence of a unique pattern of benzene-induced chromosomal aberrations in humans. Leukemia cases associated with benzene exposure are, however, more likely to contain clonal chromosome aberrations then those arising de novo in the general population.","['Zhang, Luoping', 'Eastmond, David A', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['Zhang L', 'Eastmond DA', 'Smith MT']","['School of Public Health, Division of Environmental Health Sciences, University of California, Berkeley 94720-7360, USA. luoping@uclink.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES06721/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Crit Rev Toxicol,Critical reviews in toxicology,8914275,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Carcinogens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/08/16 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Toxicol. 2002 Jan;32(1):1-42. doi: 10.1080/20024091064165.,,103,['10.1080/20024091064165 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a retrospective, non-randomized study to analyze the onset of identified invasive gingival aspergillosis among 536 patients with acute leukemia at risk due to the presence of neutropenia from 1991 to 1998. Patients received itraconazole capsules 100 mg/day prophylactically between April 1994 and December 1996, and 200 mg/day between January 1997 and December 1998. Itraconazole serum levels at day 10 were measured in some patients. RESULTS: In the 39 months prior to April 1994 without itraconazole prophylaxis, 15 cases of invasive gingival aspergillosis were detected in 192 high risk patients with 469 episodes of neutropenia (7.8% of the high risk patients). Between April 1994 and December 1996, using itraconazole prophylaxis at 100 mg/day, there was a dramatic decrease in the infections resulting in 3 of 198 high risk patients with 511 episodes of neutropenia (1.5% of the high risk patients). Furthermore, between January 1997 and December 1998, using itraconazole prophylaxis at 200 mg/day, no cases of the infection were observed in the 146 high risk patients with 380 episodes of neutropenia. The incidence of invasive gingival aspergillosis was significantly lower among patients administered itraconazole than among those without itraconazole (100 mg/day; P = 0.006 and 200 mg/day; P = 0.001). The mean itraconazole serum level in 20 patients receiving 100 mg/day was 71.78 ng/mL and in 16 patients receiving 200 mg/day was 202.67 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that oral itraconazole could be effective for preventing invasive gingival aspergillosis in neutropenic patients with acute leukemia and warrants further randomized investigation.","['Myoken, Yoshinari', 'Sugata, Tatsumi', 'Kyo, Tai-ichi', 'Fujihara, Megumu', 'Mikami, Yuzuru']","['Myoken Y', 'Sugata T', 'Kyo T', 'Fujihara M', 'Mikami Y']","['Department of Oral Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, Japan. myoken@do5.enjoy.ne.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Periodontol,Journal of periodontology,8000345,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Capsules)', '304NUG5GF4 (Itraconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Candidiasis, Oral/prevention & control', 'Capsules', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cohort Studies', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Flucytosine/therapeutic use', 'Gingival Diseases/drug therapy/*microbiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Itraconazole/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/05/22 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Periodontol. 2002 Jan;73(1):33-8. doi: 10.1902/jop.2002.73.1.33.,,,['10.1902/jop.2002.73.1.33 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pesticide usage in Gaza Governorates was recorded in detail. It ranged from 216.9 to 393.3 t from 1990 to 1999, respectively. Banned and extremely hazardous pesticides are identified according to their carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Hospital cases of cancers in men and women were recorded. Each tumor type was grouped according to sex and age group from 0 to > 65 years. Total cases recorded in males were 2277, with average annual incidence and age-adjusted rate/100,000 was 53.2 and 96.8 respectively, whereas the total for females was 2458 cases, average annual incidence and age-adjusted rate/100,000 was 59.7 and 105.3, respectively, over the same 10 years. Lung cancer, lymphomas, leukemia, cancers of the urinary bladder, prostate, brain, colon, stomach and liver were the most abundant among males, while breast cancer, leukemia, lymphomas, cancers of the brain, uterus, lung, thyroid gland and liver were the most abundant in females. Statistical analysis using correlation coefficients and P values showed highly significant positive correlations between the type of pesticide and cancer incidence for male, female and both sexes. Correlation coefficients and P values, respectively, for both sexes were: 0.992 and 0.000 for insecticides; 0.952 and 0.000 for fungicides; 0.812 and 0.004 for herbicides; 0.925 and 0.000 for nematicides; 0.992 and 0.000 for others; and 0.994 and 0.000 for all types of pesticides. In the densely populated agricultural areas, it is not possible to separate or differentiate between occupational and general public exposure. Consequently, the introduction of and heavy use and misuse of pesticides and other toxic substances in the Gaza environment is suspected to correlate with the growing incidence of cancer. Precise determination of the effects of chronic exposure is, therefore, urgently needed. Future legislation to stop and regulate the use of extremely hazardous compounds will be essential. Continuous records for chronic diseases and cancers are also required for future follow-ups and periodical risk-assessment evaluations. Hence, further epidemiological studies are needed with detailed exposure assessment for individual pesticides, taking measures to reduce risk into consideration.","['Safi, Jamal M']",['Safi JM'],"['Faculty of Agriculture, Al-Azhar University, Gaza, Palestinian National Authority. eprigaza@palnet.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Middle East/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 2002 Feb 4;284(1-3):75-84. doi: 10.1016/s0048-9697(01)00868-3.,,,"['S0048-9697(01)00868-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0048-9697(01)00868-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their cytotoxic activities and effects on RNA synthesis in vitro were assayed. The drug concentrations inhibiting mouse leukaemia L1210 cell growth to 50% were about two- and three fold higher for the derivatives compared to doxorubicin and daunorubicin respectively. Inhibition of phage T7 RNA polymerase by the non-covalently interacting derivatives was also slightly lower than that by the parent compounds. As doxorubicin and daunorubicin, their amidine derivatives in the presence of dithiothreitol and Fe(III) ions are activated and covalently bind to DNA. The adducts formed affect RNA polymerase activity. Several bands corresponding to prematurely terminated RNA chains are observed by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The patterns of bands are virtually identical for all the anthracyclines studied here and are similar to the terminations induced by actinomycin D. This observation is consistent with a notion that the adducts are formed at guanine in GpC sequences which are also binding sites of actinomycin D. A substantial difference between daunorubicin and its amidine derivative is shown by means of high performance liquid chromatography. The derivative undergoes rapid rearrangements in the presence of dithiothreitol and Fe(III) ions, while daunorubicin is stable for several hours under these conditions. The results presented here indicate that the amidine derivatives despite bulky morpholine substitution exhibit biological activity in the systems used here.","['Studzian, K', 'Wasowska, M', 'Piestrzeniewicz, M K', 'Wilmanska, D', 'Szmigiero, L', 'Oszczapowicz, I', 'Gniazdowski, M']","['Studzian K', 'Wasowska M', 'Piestrzeniewicz MK', 'Wilmanska D', 'Szmigiero L', 'Oszczapowicz I', 'Gniazdowski M']","['Department of General Chemistry, Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Poland. magn@csk.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Adducts', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'RNA/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/03/02 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2001;48(5):412-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the expression of P-gp in 31 patients using the monoclonal antibody UIC2. Direct immunofluorescent labeling was performed and samples were analyzed by flow cytomery. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (D-value) was used to estimate UIC2 staining. A D > or = 0.3 for labeling of gated leukaemic blasts as compared to that of the isotypic control was defined positive (+) and compared to clinical data.

Other markers, not followed regularly, were occasionally expressed, such as CD34, CD38, CD71, CD15, CD10 and kappa/lambda light chains. Furthermore, in one patient with suspect but not proved HCL in PB or BM, neither morphologically nor immunologically, we confirmed the diagnosis of HCL. Only the immunophenotyping of splenic cells after splenectomy confirmed HCL diagnosis. Flow cytometry was repeated at 3-5 month intervals, after treatment with 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA) or less frequently alpha-interferon (IFN). We investigated serially lymphocyte subsets after treatment and we found profound and persistent CD4+ lymphopenia in majority of studied patients after CdA treatment. Simultaneously we investigated the value of FC to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) and to establish, whether MRD+ could predict relapse. Detection of MRD in our series predicted hematological relapse only in one case with persistent MRD+, in majority of cases with occasionally found MRD+ phenotype, did not. Using quantitative immunophenotyping we observed significantly higher values of molecule numbers of hairy cell B-cell markers, comparing to B-cells in nonleukemic gate of the same sample.

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. SAMPLE: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. METHODS: Samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. Smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. Aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). RESULTS: Genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. Group B streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. Vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. Also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. CONCLUSION: Aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group B streptococci and E. coli. Its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. The most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. In theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.","['Donders, Gilbert G G', 'Vereecken, Annie', 'Bosmans, Eugene', 'Dekeersmaecker, Alfons', 'Salembier, Geert', 'Spitz, Bernard']","['Donders GG', 'Vereecken A', 'Bosmans E', 'Dekeersmaecker A', 'Salembier G', 'Spitz B']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,BJOG,BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,100935741,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Escherichia coli Infections/*microbiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Gardnerella vaginalis/isolation & purification', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/analysis', 'Interleukin-6/analysis', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis', 'Staphylococcal Infections/*microbiology/pathology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/isolation & purification', 'Streptococcal Infections/*microbiology/pathology', 'Streptococcus agalactiae/isolation & purification', 'Vagina/chemistry/microbiology', 'Vaginal Smears', 'Vaginosis, Bacterial/*microbiology/pathology']",,2002/02/16 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/16 10:00'],"['2002/02/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/16 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,BJOG. 2002 Jan;109(1):34-43. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2002.00432.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1471-0528.2002.00432.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant interactions between nuclear receptors and co-repressors contribute towards acute promyelocytic leukaemia and thyroid hormone resistance syndrome. The binding of co-repressors to nuclear receptors occurs in the unliganded state, and can be stabilized by antagonists. Here we report the crystal structure of a ternary complex containing the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ligand-binding domain bound to the antagonist GW6471 and a SMRT co-repressor motif. In this structure, the co-repressor motif adopts a three-turn alpha-helix that prevents the carboxy-terminal activation helix (AF-2) of the receptor from assuming the active conformation. Binding of the co-repressor motif is further reinforced by the antagonist, which blocks the AF-2 helix from adopting the active position.

The aim of our study was to determine whether MRD investigation is valuable in predicting outcome in Philadelphia-negative adult patients with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MRD was assessed in 85 adult patients with B-lineage ALL by semiquantitative immunoglobulin H gene analysis on bone marrow samples collected during four time bands in the first 24 months of treatment. Fifty patients received chemotherapy only and 35 patients received allogeneic (n = 19) or autologous (n = 16) bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in first clinical remission. The relationship between MRD status and clinical outcome was investigated and compared with age, sex, immunophenotype, and presenting WBC count. RESULTS: Fisher's exact test established a statistically significant concordance between MRD results and clinical outcome at all times. Disease-free survival (DFS) rates for MRD-positive and -negative patients and log-rank testing established that MRD positivity was associated with increased relapse rates at all times (P <.05) but was most significant at 3 to 5 months after induction and beyond. MRD status after allogeneic BMT rather than before was found to be an important predictor of outcome in 19 adult patients with ALL tested. In patients receiving autologous BMT (n = 16), the MRD status before BMT was more significant (P =.005). CONCLUSION: The association of MRD test results and DFS was independent of and greater than other standard predictors of outcome and is therefore important in determining treatment for individual patients.","['Mortuza, Forida Y', 'Papaioannou, Mary', 'Moreira, Ilidia M', 'Coyle, Luke A', 'Gameiro, Paula', 'Gandini, Domenica', 'Prentice, H Grant', 'Goldstone, Anthony', 'Hoffbrand, A Victor', 'Foroni, Letizia']","['Mortuza FY', 'Papaioannou M', 'Moreira IM', 'Coyle LA', 'Gameiro P', 'Gandini D', 'Prentice HG', 'Goldstone A', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Foroni L']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free and University College School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/20 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/20 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 15;20(4):1094-104. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.4.1094.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.4.1094 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used CD45-PECy5 (Clone J33) since 1998 and have noticed that malignant lymphoid cells such as hairy cells can form distinct populations. Previous studies indicate that hairy cells reside where normal monocytes are usually found in CD45/SS scatter plots (Wells et al., 1998). We studied six patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and found that hairy cells have a higher CD45 mean cell fluorescence than normal lymphocytes and monocytes. Two of the six patients presented with mild unexplained cytopenias, without the usual clinical, morphological and cytochemical findings. In both cases, CD45/SS gating of bone marrow cells showed a small population with strong expression of CD45. The presence of hairy cells was confirmed using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. In one patient with HCL variant, CD45 expression was indistinguishable from that of normal lymphocytes.

T-cell microclones can be detected by sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods in all three disorders. Recently, larger clonal populations of T-cell large granular lymphocytes (T-LGLs) have been observed in some patients with AA and MDS. Here, we report the development of a large clonal T-LGL population in a patient with bona fide PNH. In this patient, we defined part of the sequence of the T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain gene, and we have shown that the large T-LGL population emerged from a background of multiple smaller T-cell clones. Thus, T-LGL clones in AA, MDS and PNH probably expand as a result of antigenic stimulation. It is postulated that the antigen driving clonal T-cell proliferations in these disorders exists on haemopoietic stem cells.","['Karadimitris, A', 'Li, K', 'Notaro, R', 'Araten, D J', 'Nafa, K', 'Thertulien, R', 'Ladanyi, M', 'Stevens, A E', 'Rosenfeld, C S', 'Roberts, I A', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Karadimitris A', 'Li K', 'Notaro R', 'Araten DJ', 'Nafa K', 'Thertulien R', 'Ladanyi M', 'Stevens AE', 'Rosenfeld CS', 'Roberts IA', 'Luzzatto L']","['Department of Human Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 HL 56778-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*complications/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):1010-4. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03172.x.,,,"['3172 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03172.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erwinia asparaginase (ASNase) has a shorter half-life than the Escherichia coli preparations, and it has been reported to be less immunogenic than the E. coli preparations and to induce fewer coagulation disorders. Children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were included in this study. Twenty-seven patients were treated with Erwinia ASNase (induction therapy 30.000 IU/m2/d i.m. for 10 d, and re-induction therapy 30.000 IU/m2 twice a week for 2 weeks) and 15 were treated with ASNase Medac (induction therapy 1.000 IU/m2/d i.m. for 10 d, and re-induction therapy 5.000 IU/m2 i.m. twice a week for 2 weeks). Blood samples were drawn to determine enzyme activity, l-asparagine, anti-asparaginase antibodies, and coagulation parameters. After i.m. administration, Erwinia ASNase displayed a protracted absorption phase compared to ASNase Medac. The mean bioavailability after i.m. administration was 27% for Erwinia ASNase and 45% for ASNase Medac respectively. Mean trough enzyme activities during induction therapy were Erwinia ASNase 1748 IU/l and ASNase Medac 272 IU/l, and during re-induction therapy Erwinia ASNase 83 IU/l and ASNase Medac 147 IU/l. We conclude that in this setting, therapy with ASNase Medac resulted in sufficient treatment during both phases of therapy, whereas treatment with Erwinia ASNase resulted in unnecessarily intense therapy during the induction phase and insufficient treatment during the re-induction phase. There was no significant difference in the incidence of antibody formation, and therapy with Erwinia ASNase resulted in a more pronounced influence on the coagulation parameters than therapy with ASNase Medac.","['Albertsen, B K', 'Schroder, H', 'Ingerslev, J', 'Jakobsen, P', 'Avramis, V I', 'Muller, H J', 'Carlsen, N T', 'Schmiegelow, K']","['Albertsen BK', 'Schroder H', 'Ingerslev J', 'Jakobsen P', 'Avramis VI', 'Muller HJ', 'Carlsen NT', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Pharmacology, The Bartholin Building, University of Aarhus, 8000 Aarhus C, Denmark. bka@farm.au.dk']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Absorption', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Asparaginase/blood/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/blood', 'Bacterial Proteins/blood/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood Coagulation', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erwinia/*enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Liver/physiopathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):983-90. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03148.x.,,,"['3148 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03148.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-one patients received SCT from human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings and nine from matched unrelated donors. Median patient age was 53 (28-77) years. Four non-myeloablative protocols were used, including fludarabine (30 mg/m2 x 3-6), busulphan (4 mg/kg x 2), cyclophosphamide (Cy) (30 mg/kg/day x 2) or total body irradiation (2 Gy), and anti-thymocyte globulin. The patients were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of minisatellites on days 14, 21 and 28, then every other week up to 3 months and monthly thereafter. All samples were cell separated for T, B and myeloid cells using immunomagnetic beads. Eighteen patients were alive at a median follow-up of 11 (6-20) months. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 22 patients. Eighteen of the 22 patients with acute GVHD showed mixed chimaerism (MC) in the T-cell fraction at the time of acute GVHD. However, all patients with acute GVHD showed donor chimaerism (DC) in the T-cell fraction median 76 (7-414) days after onset versus three out of eight patients without acute GVHD, P < 0.001]. Disease response was diagnosed in 15 patients, median 100 (37-531) days after SCT. At the time of disease response, six out of 15 patients showed MC in the T-cell fraction.

As high-resolution ultrasonography (HRU) and colour Doppler imaging (CDI) are used in inflammatory and ischaemic bowel diseases, we introduced these techniques to evaluate acute intestinal GvHD. In this study, 12 patients with suspected intestinal and/or severe cutaneous aGvHD were investigated by HRU and CDI. The structure and thickness of the bowel wall and the blood flow pattern in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as well as in the bowel wall were evaluated. All patients showed thickened bowel wall segments, especially in the ileocaecal region. Even in patients without any clinical signs of intestinal involvement (3/12), sonographic changes were observed. In six patients with severe diarrhoea, sonographic signs of secretory diarrhoea were observed. In 4/12 patients, an increased arterial blood flow in the bowel wall was demonstrated as a typical characteristic of an inflammatory bowel process. In contrast, in 4/12 patients, ischaemic bowel wall lesions with high-resistance flow pattern in the SMA were found. These patients did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy and died. In conclusion, HRU is a useful tool for detecting acute bowel GvHD even before clinical symptoms. Moreover, HRU and CDI can be applied to define the severity of aGvHD and to identify patients with a poor prognosis.","['Klein, S A', 'Martin, H', 'Schreiber-Dietrich, D', 'Hermann, S', 'Caspary, W F', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Dietrich, C F']","['Klein SA', 'Martin H', 'Schreiber-Dietrich D', 'Hermann S', 'Caspary WF', 'Hoelzer D', 'Dietrich CF']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, D-60590 Frankfurt, Germany. sal.klein@t-online.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/*diagnostic imaging', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnostic imaging', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intestines/blood supply/*diagnostic imaging', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Male', 'Mesenteric Artery, Superior/diagnostic imaging', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Regional Blood Flow', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Ultrasonography, Doppler, Color']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):929-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03221.x.,,,"['3221 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03221.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of normal peripheral blood (n = 20) and normal bone marrow (n = 5) samples and on 20 samples from de novo M1, M2, M4 and M5 AML patients demonstrated that PSGL-1 is differentially expressed on various mature and immature leucocyte subsets. It was found by QFC that neutrophils expressed 26500 +/- 4500 and monocytes 47200 +/- 9900 copies of PSGL-1 on their surface, whereas AML blasts from M1 and M2 AML patients expressed significantly less PSGL-1 (12 000 +/- 5300) than mature neutrophils (P < 0.001). In M4 and M5 leukaemias, however, the amount of PSGL-1 on monocytic precursors is displayed in a fairly broad range that is not significantly different from that of mature monocytes (P = 0.084). Using three-colour immunophenotyping PSGL-1-dim staining was co-expressed with CD7 and C34 positivity and PSGL-1 staining intensity on immature myeloid cells paralleled with CD45 expression. This would imply a differential expression of PSGL-1 during myeloid haematopoietic development and suggests that quantification of surface PSGL-1 may aid in differentiating myeloblasts from monoblasts by immunophenotyping in different AML subsets.","['Kappelmayer, J', 'Kiss, A', 'Karaszi, E', 'Veszpremi, A', 'Jako, J', 'Kiss, C']","['Kappelmayer J', 'Kiss A', 'Karaszi E', 'Veszpremi A', 'Jako J', 'Kiss C']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Medical and Health Sciences Centre, University of Debrecen, PO Box:40, Debrecen, Hungary H-4012. kappelmayer@jaguar.dote.hu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (P-selectin ligand protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*chemistry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*chemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):903-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03179.x.,,,"['3179 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03179.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The roles played by adhesive receptor interactions in the survival of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) cells on BM stromal cells are not well understood. Recently, we have developed an assay that partially recapitulates the BM microenvironment using HS-5 BM stromal cells. In this assay, the magnitude of ex vivo T-ALL lymphoblast survival predicts patient outcome. We examined the molecular basis for cell-cell adhesive events leading to T-ALL lymphoblast survival on HS-5 and on donor-derived BM stroma. Lympho cyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on T-ALL cell lines bound intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on HS-5 monolayers, and survival was inhibited 85-98% with monoclonal antibodies directed against LFA-1 or ICAM-1. We compared these results with patient-derived T-ALL lymphoblasts co-cultured on either HS-5 BM or normal BM monolayers and found that LFA-1 and ICAM-1 were required, but not alone sufficient for ex vivo leukaemic cell survival. On normal BM stroma, but not HS-5 monolayers, two additional adhesion molecules, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin, were highly expressed and contributed to T-ALL cell survival. This is the first report to demonstrate the importance of LFA-1/ICAM-1-mediated adhesion as a critical event in a cascade of cell surface receptor-ligand interactions that regulate T-ALL survival in the BM microenvironment.","['Winter, S S', 'Sweatman, J J', 'Lawrence, M B', 'Rhoades, T H', 'Hart, A L', 'Larson, R S']","['Winter SS', 'Sweatman JJ', 'Lawrence MB', 'Rhoades TH', 'Hart AL', 'Larson RS']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA. swinter@salud.unm.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Stromal Cells/*physiology']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):862-71. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03182.x.,,,"['3182 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03182.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, however, the usefulness of this surrogate marker is controversial. Therefore, our goal was to study the ability of CD38 to act as a surrogate marker for Ig VH somatic mutation (SM), and to identify differences in overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and response in B-CLL patients based on these two markers. We first assessed the relationship between CD38 expression and Ig VH status on 131 B-CLL patients, including 66 patients enrolled in three North Central Cancer Treatment Group Trials. Although the mean percentages of CD38+ clonal B cells were significantly higher for patients classified as GL versus SM, CD38 was not a reliable marker for clonal B-cell SM. Overall, GL patients exhibited significantly shorter OS and PFS times than SM patients. Despite the inability of clonal B-cell CD38 expression to predict Ig VH mutation status, patients with < or =30% CD38+ cells did have shorter PFS and OS times than did CLL patients with < 30% CD38+ cells. Thus, the relationship between CD38 expression and Ig VH mutation status in B-CLL is not straightforward. Nevertheless, analysis in a co-operative group clinical trial setting suggests that both B-cell markers alone or in combination may have clinical usefulness. These data strongly encourage the study of these biological markers as they relate to disease heterogeneity in B-CLL.","['Jelinek, D F', 'Tschumper, R C', 'Geyer, S M', 'Bone, N D', 'Dewald, G W', 'Hanson, C A', 'Stenson, M J', 'Witzig, T E', 'Tefferi, A', 'Kay, N E']","['Jelinek DF', 'Tschumper RC', 'Geyer SM', 'Bone ND', 'Dewald GW', 'Hanson CA', 'Stenson MJ', 'Witzig TE', 'Tefferi A', 'Kay NE']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Graduate and Medical Schools, Mayo Clinic, 200 1st Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. jelinek.diane@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['CA 25224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*analysis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):854-61. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03149.x.,,,"['3149 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03149.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth factor (GF) and beta1-integrin interactions play an important role in regulation of progenitor trafficking to and from the marrow space. CML progenitors demonstrate abnormal beta1-integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin (FN). In the present study we investigated whether GF modulation of beta1-integrin-mediated adhesion and migration was altered in CML progenitors. Culture with low concentrations of GF enhanced normal progenitor adhesion to FN compared with no GF, but failed to enhance CML progenitor adhesion to FN. Similarly, high concentrations of selected GF rapidly enhanced beta1-integrin-mediated adhesion of normal progenitors to FN through a phosphotidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase-dependent mechanism, but failed to increase CML progenitor adhesion. Exposure to a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor restored GF modulation of CML progenitor adhesion. CML colony-forming cells (CFC) demonstrated increased migration across FN-coated transwells compared with normal CFC in the absence of GF. The addition of stem cell factor resulted in enhanced migration of CML and normal CFC on FN. In conclusion, GF stimulation failed to enhance integrin-mediated adhesion but enhanced migration in CML progenitors on FN. BCR-ABL induced abnormalities in GF-integrin interactions could contribute to abnormal circulation and microenvironmental localization of CML progenitors.","['Bhatia, R', 'Munthe, H A', 'Forman, S J']","['Bhatia R', 'Munthe HA', 'Forman SJ']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E.

Although modern available treatments are able to induce disease regression, relapse almost inexorably occurs. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing the disease relapse rate are very much needed. Among these, the induction of tumour-associated antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), through either DNA vaccines or injection of idiotype pulsed dendritic cells (DCs), has been actively investigated with encouraging preliminary results in B-cell malignancies. As the CLL B lymphocyte characteristically expresses low amounts of surface immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cells from these patients have been reported to display impaired functional activity, there are concerns related to the possibility of generating specific cytotoxic antitumoral T cells in this disease. In addition, no information is presently available regarding the functional ability of CLL-derived DCs. In the present work, freshly purified monocytes from CLL patients and normal donors were induced to differentiate in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4 serum-free medium and compared for their morphological, phenotypic and functional characteristics. Our results demonstrate that: (1) functional DCs can be generated from CLL patients with similar phenotype and function to those observed from normal donors; (2) in contrast to normal control subjects, monocyte-derived DCs from CLL patients spontaneously secrete endogenous IL-10; and (3) interferon (IFN)-gamma in combination with CD40L plays a major role in priming DCs from CLL patients for IL-12 and IL-15 production. Overall, these results indicate that it is possible to derive functionally competent DCs from circulating monocytes in CLL patients.","['Vuillier, F', 'Maloum, K', 'Thomas, E K', 'Jouanne, C', 'Dighiero, G', 'Scott-Algara, D']","['Vuillier F', 'Maloum K', 'Thomas EK', 'Jouanne C', 'Dighiero G', 'Scott-Algara D']","[""Unite d'Immuno-Hematologie et d'Immunopathologie, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr Roux, F-75724 Paris Cedex 15, France. vuillier@pasteur.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Active', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/metabolism', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):831-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03223.x.,,,"['3223 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03223.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The only other cell line with detectable E2A-PBX1 was CEM, but the level of expression was < 1 transcript per cell.","['Curry, J D', 'Glaser, M C', 'Smith, M T']","['Curry JD', 'Glaser MC', 'Smith MT']","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7360, USA.']",['eng'],['P42 ES 04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Computer Systems', 'Gene Expression', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):826-30. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03190.x.,,,"['3190 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03190.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is unclear whether the generation of ROS is associated with the apoptotic process. Using the T-lymphoblastic leukaemic CEM cell line, we found that IDA-induced DNA breaks were correlated with final cell death. The reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and the generation of ROS occurred simultaneously with IDA-induced activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Inhibition of caspases by a pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) completely blocked IDA-induced reduction of Deltapsim, apoptosis and final cell death. Interestingly, ROS generation was significantly enhanced by Z-VAD-fmk. ROS generation was neither caspase dependent nor part of the apoptotic process. IDA-mediated reduction in Deltapsim is caspase dependent and is not a consequence of the generation of ROS. These results indicate that IDA-induced generation of ROS and apoptosis are separate events. Inhibition of caspases facilitates IDA-mediated generation of ROS.","['Liu, F T', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Newland, A C', 'Jia, L']","['Liu FT', 'Kelsey SM', 'Newland AC', 'Jia L']","[""Department of Haematology/Oncology, St Bartholomew's and The Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London E1 2AD, UK.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):817-25. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03216.x.,,,"['3216 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03216.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the t(6;9) leukaemia is commonly associated with bone marrow basophilia, the cytological characteristics of leukaemic cells are unclear. In the current study, we examined the in vitro effects of several cytokines on growth and differentiation of t(6;9) leukaemic cells. Isolated bone marrow mononuclear cells from four patients with t(6;9) (two MDS and two AML) were cultured for 14 d in the presence or absence of each cytokine. At the end of culture, viable cells were counted, and their histology was examined. Bone marrow cells obtained from 22 patients (10 AML, six AML from MDS, six MDS) lacking t(6;9) were used as controls. Compared with control cultures, significantly higher numbers of blasts appeared in the culture of bone marrow cells from t(6;9)-positive patients in response to stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) or interleukin 3 (IL-3). Stem cell factor (SCF) had little effect. Neutrophil counts were also significantly increased in the presence of G-CSF or IL-3. SCF and IL-3 were potent in increasing basophil counts from t(6;9)-positive cultures. These findings suggest that bone marrow cells obtained from t(6;9) patients are highly sensitive to growth- and/or differentiation-promoting cytokines. Special attention should be paid to the use of ""therapeutic"" cytokines in these patients.","['Matsushima, T', 'Saitoh, T', 'Karasawa, M', 'Takizawa, M', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Nojima, Y', 'Murakami, H']","['Matsushima T', 'Saitoh T', 'Karasawa M', 'Takizawa M', 'Miyawaki S', 'Nojima Y', 'Murakami H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Gunma University School of Medicine, Shouwa-machi 3-39-15, Maebashi, Gunma 371-0034, Japan. tmatsu@showa.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/immunology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):812-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03224.x.,,,"['3224 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03224.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 29-year-old asymptomatic female presented in 1989 with lymphocytosis, neutropenia and mild bone marrow infiltration. The circulating cells were LGL with a CD2+, CD3+, CD8+, CD4-, CD16+, CD56+, CD57- phenotype. In August 2000, she developed fever, a large submandibular mass and hepatosplenomegaly. Biochemistry showed abnormal liver function tests and raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. A serological screen for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus-I, human herpes virus (HHV)-6 and HHV-7 was negative. Histology of the mass was consistent with the diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma composed of large cells, and immunohistochemistry showed that the lymphoma cells had a phenotype identical to the mature LGL. Molecular analysis with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma-chain gene with a band of identical size in both bone marrow mature LGL and lymph node cells. The patient was treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisolone), resulting in the disappearance of the mass and improvement of the hepatosplenomegaly, LDH and liver abnormalities. She underwent splenectomy, and spleen histology showed involvement by T-cell LGL leukaemia with no evidence of transformation. This case illustrates that transformation or Richter syndrome may occur in a minority of patients with T-cell LGL leukaemia, a disease that has a benign clinical course in most cases. This is the first case documented by molecular methods of the transformation of the pre-existing clone.","['Matutes, E', 'Wotherspoon, A C', 'Parker, N E', 'Osuji, N', 'Isaacson, P G', 'Catovsky, D']","['Matutes E', 'Wotherspoon AC', 'Parker NE', 'Osuji N', 'Isaacson PG', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, NHS Trust, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK. estella@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Time Factors']",,2002/02/15 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/15 10:00'],"['2002/02/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Dec;115(4):801-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03220.x.,,,"['3220 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.03220.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that Stat1 and Stat3 are constitutively activated in freshly isolated erythroleukemia cells. In addition, EPO promoted cell growth of these cells, accompanied by enhanced activities of Stat1 and Stat3. Furthermore, mutation in the Statl/Stat3-binding sites of the c-myc gene promoter clearly blocked its promoter activity in EPO-stimulated primary erythroleukemia cells.

B-cell neoplastic diseases may be classified more accurately according to the differentiation stages of presumed normal B-cell counterparts. These advances have challenged the notion that chronic lymphocytic leukemia represents a malignancy of naive CD5 B cells. Analyses of immunoglobulin genes and gene expression patterns through microarray have defined at least two types of chronic lymphocytic leukemia that differ in their tendency toward disease progression. Nevertheless, these types still share more in common than they do with other lymphoid malignancies, and both may be derived from memory-type B cells. Advances in immune therapy are revolutionizing the approach to therapy. B-cell surface differentiation antigens constitute tissue-specific targets for passive immune therapy. Since the US Food and Drug Administration approval of rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) for use in the treatment of follicular lymphoma, monoclonal antibody therapy is being considered for all types of B-cell malignancies. The ability to transform leukemia and lymphoma B cells into effective antigen-presenting cells through CD40 ligation allows for autologous immune recognition of neoplastic cells. Together, active and passive immune approaches have potential for effective treatment of patients with these diseases.","['Kipps, Thomas J']",['Kipps TJ'],"['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD20', 'CD40 Antigens', 'CD40 Ligand', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*classification/*therapy']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2002 Feb;29(1 Suppl 2):98-104.,,55,['S0093-7754(02)50084-1 [pii]'],['Copyright 2002 by W.B.

The safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibodies make these compounds attractive and easy to administer, even in elderly, heavily pretreated patients. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is an incurable disease with few therapeutic options once patients fail purine analogue-based therapy. Two monoclonal antibodies have shown activity in this disease. The first is rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA), a chimeric human-mouse anti-CD20 antibody. The second is Campath-1H, a humanized form of a rat antibody active against CD52. We hypothesize that combining both antibodies in patients who have failed conventional therapies and express both CD20 and CD52 might have enhanced efficacy and therapeutic benefit. This concept is being explored at our institution in the context of a phase I/II clinical trial. The outcome and feasibility of this combination opens the way for future combination therapies using novel biologic agents.","['Nabhan, Chadi', 'Rosen, Steven T']","['Nabhan C', 'Rosen ST']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Robert H.

While rituximab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of recurrent B-cell lymphoma, initial studies suggested that it had less activity in small lymphocytic lymphoma, the nodal counterpart of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Two studies have now investigated the activity of higher-dose and more intensive therapy with rituximab in CLL. They have shown a dose-response relationship and a higher response rate than previously seen in the lower-dose studies. This is presumably caused by the overcoming of lower antigen density on CLL cells compared with lymphoma cells, and the shorter half-life of rituximab in small lymphocytic lymphoma. There is now evidence that CD20 is shed into the plasma in patients with CLL, which may explain the shorter half-life of the antibody in small lymphocytic lymphoma/CLL. The higher dose may then be effective in overcoming this so-called ""antigen sink."" Toxicity was uncommon except in previously untreated patients and those with atypical forms of CLL such as mantle cell lymphoma and prolymphocytic leukemia. There is now evidence in vitro of additive or synergistic activity of rituximab with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Combinations of fludarabine with rituximab or these two drugs combined with cyclophosphamide have given very high complete response rates in series of patients with both previously untreated and treated CLL. It is apparent that rituximab is playing a significant role in the management of patients with CLL as salvage therapy and is a potential potentiating agent for combined chemoimmunotherapy strategies for front-line or relapsed patients with CLL.","['Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Albitar, Maher']","['Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Albitar M']","['Leukemia Department, The University of Texas M.

Sixty-two patients with stages II to IV indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular or small lymphocytic) who had received no previous systemic therapy entered this multicenter, community-based trial. All patients received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) weekly for 4 consecutive weeks, and were evaluated for response at week 6. Patients who had an objective response or stable disease continued treatment every 6 months with repeat 4-week courses of rituximab for a total of four treatment courses. Interim results of this ongoing trial are available. When evaluated at week 6, 28 of 60 evaluable patients (47%) had objective response and 27 patients (45%) had minor response or stable disease. With further follow-up and repeat courses of rituximab, the major response rate increased from 47% to 65% and the complete response rate increased from 7% to 27%. Response rates were similar in patients with follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma (63% and 66%, respectively). Median progression-free survival has not been reached, but will be greater than 24 months. There has been no cumulative toxicity observed with repeat courses of rituximab. Rituximab is highly effective as a first-line single agent for the treatment of indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The initial response rate can be improved by using scheduled maintenance courses of rituximab administered every 6 months.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and FL represent quintessential examples of human malignancies that are caused primarily by defects in programmed cell death (apoptosis). During the early stages of disease, the mature B lymphocytes that comprise most CLLs and FLs are largely quiescent G(0) phase cells, which accumulate not because they are dividing more rapidly than normal but because they survive longer than their normal counterparts because of defects in the normal pathways for apoptosis. Defects in apoptosis pathways contribute to chemoresistance, rendering tumor cells less sensitive to the cytotoxic actions of currently available anticancer drugs, and can also promote resistance to cellular immune responses. Several biological agents or their synthetic derivatives show promise as apoptosis modulators, having the potential to place neoplastic cells into a more susceptible state or activating latent programs for cell suicide. These biological response modifiers include monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA, and IDEC Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA) that alter signal transduction pathways, cytokines such as TRAIL (Apo2 ligand), ligands for retinoid/steroid family nuclear receptors, and small-molecule compounds that bind and inhibit protein kinases. Knowledge about the mechanisms by which these agents influence apoptosis pathways in neoplastic diseases may suggest strategies for more effective and less toxic therapies for patients suffering from CLL, FL, and other malignancies.","['Reed, John C', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Kim, Youngsoo', 'Byrd, John']","['Reed JC', 'Kitada S', 'Kim Y', 'Byrd J']","['Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Serine Endopeptidases/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2002 Feb;29(1 Suppl 2):10-24.,,171,['S0093-7754(02)50072-5 [pii]'],['Copyright 2002 by W.B.

This technique is based on the fusion of the self-associating coiled-coil (CC) domain of the nuclear factor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) to target proteins that are able to self-associate naturally. Oligomerization through the CC region of promyelocytic leukemia, and through the natural self-associating domain, triggers the oligomerization chain reaction, leading to formation of large molecular weight complexes and functional inactivation of the target. As a test case, we have chosen the oncosuppressor p53, naturally occurring as a tetramer. Fusion of the CC to p53 leads to formation of stable high molecular weight complexes-as shown by size exclusion chromatography-to which wild-type p53 is recruited with high efficiency. CC-p53 chimeras delocalize wild-type p53 to the cytoplasm and inhibit its transcriptional regulatory properties, resulting in a loss of p53 function. We propose that this strategy may be of general application to self-associating factors and represent a complementary approach to currently used functional inactivation-based strategies.","['Contegno, Francesco', 'Cioce, Mario', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Contegno F', 'Cioce M', 'Pelicci PG', 'Minucci S']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Via Ripamonti 435, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*chemistry', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",PMC122285,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Feb 19;99(4):1865-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.042460299.

The activation of MLL is achieved either by an internal tandem duplication of 5' MLL exons or by chromosomal translocations that create chimeric proteins with the N-terminus of MLL fused to a variety of different partner proteins. A domain of MLL with significant homology to the eukaryotic DNA methyltransferases (MT domain) has been found to be essential for the transforming potential of the oncogenic MLL derivatives. Here we demonstrate that this domain specifically recognizes DNA with unmethylated CpG sequences. In gel mobility shifts, the presence of CpG was sufficient for binding of recombinant GST-MT protein to DNA. The introduction of 5-methylCpG on one or both DNA strands precluded an efficient interaction. In surface plasmon resonance a KD of approximately 3.3 x 10(-8) M was determined for the GST-MT/DNA complex formation.

Two proteins with capacity to bind Ubc9 and conjugated to SUMO1.",19783-91,"In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the carboxyl-cytoplasmic domain (residues 464-509) of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 (C-GLUT4). Using as bait C-GLUT4, we have isolated the carboxyl domain of Daxx (C-Daxx), the adaptor protein associated with the Fas and the type II TGF-beta (TbetaRII) receptors (1,2 ). The two-hybrid interaction between C-GLUT4 and C-Daxx is validated by the ability of in vitro translated C-GLUT4 to interact with in vitro translated full-length Daxx and C-Daxx. C-Daxx does not interact with the C-cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1, the ubiquitous glucose transporter homologous to GLUT4. Replacement of alanine and serine for the dileucine pair (Leu(489)-Leu(490)) critical for targeting GLUT4 from the trans-Golgi network to the perinuclear intracellular store as well as for its surface internalization by endocytosis inhibits 2-fold the interaction of C-GLUT4 with Daxx. Daxx is pulled down with GLUT4 immunoprecipitated from lysates of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably transfected with GLUT4 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing physiological levels of the two proteins. Similarly, GLUT4 is recovered with anti-Daxx immunoprecipitates. Using an established cell fractionation procedure we present evidence for the existence of two distinct intracellular Daxx pools in the nucleus and low density microsomes. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy studies localize Daxx to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and punctate cytoplasmic structures, often organized in strings and underneath the plasma membrane. Daxx and GLUT4 are SUMOlated as shown by their reaction with an anti-SUMO1 antibody and by the ability of this antibody to pull down Daxx and GLUT4.","['Lalioti, Vassiliki S', 'Vergarajauregui, Silvia', 'Pulido, Diego', 'Sandoval, Ignacio V']","['Lalioti VS', 'Vergarajauregui S', 'Pulido D', 'Sandoval IV']","['Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid 28049, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 4)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Slc2a4 protein, mouse)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', '9036-19-5 (Nonidet P-40)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Detergents/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Ligases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/*metabolism', '*Muscle Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Octoxynol', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', '*Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/07/03 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 May 31;277(22):19783-91. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M110294200.

Ferric iron enters cells utilizing an integrin-mobilferrin-paraferritin pathway, whereas ferrous iron uptake is facilitated by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT-1). Immunoprecipitation studies using antimobilferrin antibody precipitated the previously described large-molecular-weight protein complex named paraferritin. It was previously shown that paraferritin functions as an intracellular ferrireductase, reducing ferric iron to ferrous iron utilizing NADPH as the energy source. It functions in the pathway for the cellular uptake of ferric iron. This multipeptide protein contains a number of active peptides, including the ferric iron binding protein mobilferrin and a flavin monooxygenase. The immunoprecipitates and purified preparations of paraferritin also contained DMT-1. This identifies DMT-1 as one of the peptides constituting the paraferritin complex. Since paraferritin functions to reduce newly transported ferric iron to ferrous iron and DMT-1 can transport ferrous iron, these findings suggest a role for DMT-1 in conveyance of iron from paraferritin to ferrochelatase, the enzyme utilizing ferrous iron for the synthesis of heme in the mitochondrion.","['Umbreit, Jay N', 'Conrad, Marcel E', 'Hainsworth, Lucille N', 'Simovich, Marcia']","['Umbreit JN', 'Conrad ME', 'Hainsworth LN', 'Simovich M']","['University of South Alabama Cancer Center, Mobile, Alabama 36688, USA. jumbreit@usamail.usouthal.edu']",['eng'],['2-R37-DK-36112/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol,American journal of physiology.

KE-298 (10-100 microg/ml) and KE-758 (10-100 microg/ml) as well as a high concentration of NAC (10mM) dose-dependently inhibited the secretion of TRX by THP-1 and Jurkat cells. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the suppressive effects of KE-298 and KE-758 on TRX secretion could be partly explained by the inhibition of TRX mRNA expression. On the other hand, KE-758 as well as a high concentration of NAC significantly increased the level of intracellular GSH. Thus, KE-298 is a novel sulphydryl drug which regulates the redox state of cellular circumstances. The potential of KE-298 to suppress the secretion of TRX and to increase the level of intracellular GSH may partly explain the efficacy in cases of RA.","['Sugimoto, Masanori', 'Inoue, Tomoyuki', 'Takeshita, Kimiyo', 'Nakamura, Hajime', 'Yodoi, Junji']","['Sugimoto M', 'Inoue T', 'Takeshita K', 'Nakamura H', 'Yodoi J']","['Department of Pharmacology, Taisho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., 1-403 Yoshino-cho, 330-8530, Saitama, Japan. s17710@ccm.taisho.co.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (KE 758)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (Phenylpropionates)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PF4079THQO (esonarimod)']",IM,"['Antirheumatic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Phenylbutyrates/*pharmacology', 'Phenylpropionates/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/*metabolism']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/04/18 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/18 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2002 Feb;38(10):793-9. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(01)00116-x.,,,"['S016158900100116X [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(01)00116-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flavonoids including baicalin have been reported to not only function as anti-oxidants but also cause cytotoxic effect. We investigated the mechanism of baicalin-induced cytotoxicity in leukemia-derived T cell line, Jurkat cells. When cells were cultured with 50-200 microg/ml baicalin for 6h, caspase-3 was activated and then cells fell into apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by baicalin was accompanied with the marginal generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), the increase of the cytosolic fractions of cytochrome c, and the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) prior to the activation of caspase-3. The pre-culture with 5 mM of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, facilitated baicalin-induced disruption of DeltaPsi(m) and induction of apoptosis. The pre-culture with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), a pan-caspase inhibitor, partially suppressed the induction of apoptosis. On the other hand, baicalin showed little toxic effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy volunteers.

At measurements of DNA ligase activity with specific substrates, to distinguish between different DNA ligases, a reduced DNA ligase activity was observed in the resistant substrains. In contrast, the initial step of the ligation process, formation of DNA ligase--AMP complex, did not decrease in the resistant cell strains, suggesting an alteration in a later reaction leading to a deteriorated DNA ligation.

In conclusion, our experiments indicate that a decrease in intracellular peroxide level was involved in wogonin- and fisetin-induced apoptosis; activation of caspase 3 and endonuclease, induction of bax protein and suppression of Mcl-1 protein were detected in the process.","['Lee, Woan Rouh', 'Shen, Shing Chuan', 'Lin, Hui Yi', 'Hou, Wen Chi', 'Yang, Ling Ling', 'Chen, Yen Chou']","['Lee WR', 'Shen SC', 'Lin HY', 'Hou WC', 'Yang LL', 'Chen YC']","['Institute of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, 250 Wu-Hsing Street, ROC, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Flavonols)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'OO2ABO9578 (fisetin)', 'POK93PO28W (wogonin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase 1/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', '*Flavanones', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flavonols', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Jan 15;63(2):225-36. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00876-0.,,,"['S0006295201008760 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00876-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore analyzed the migrating and invasive potential of human HL-60 and NB4 cell lines, representative of acute myelogenous leukemia, their ability to express matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in response to differentiating agents. Granulocytic differentiation by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and aclacinomycin (ACLA) strongly increased HL-60 and NB4 cell migration and invasion. At mRNA and protein levels, these cell lines produced significant amounts of MMP-9 (HL-60<NB4). Granulocytic differentiation by ACLA increased both pro and active forms of MMP-9 whereas ATRA decreased them and stimulated uPA mRNAs. TIMP-1, the physiological MMP inhibitor, increased during granulocytic differentiation whereas TIMP-2 did not significantly vary. Use of Batimastat and aprotinin suggests that ATRA was active by modulating the uPA system while ACLA interfered with MMP expression. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that HL-60 and NB4 cells express MMPs and uPA which are differentially regulated by the differentiating agents ATRA and ACLA and suggest the clinical usefulness of MMPs and serine protease inhibitors in the prophylaxis and treatment of the ATRA syndrome.","['Devy, Laetitia', 'Hollender, Patrick', 'Munaut, Carine', 'Colige, Alain', 'Garnotel, Roselyne', 'Foidart, Jean Michel', 'Noel, Agnes', 'Jeannesson, Pierre']","['Devy L', 'Hollender P', 'Munaut C', 'Colige A', 'Garnotel R', 'Foidart JM', 'Noel A', 'Jeannesson P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie des Tumeurs et du Developpement, Universite de Liege, Sart-Tilman, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'BK349F52C9 (batimastat)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Phenylalanine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/biosynthesis', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Jan 15;63(2):179-89. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00848-6.,,,"['S0006295201008486 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00848-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CEM cells were made resistant to these drugs by clinically relevant intermittent 24 hr exposures to 5-10 microM of MTX, ZD1694, GW1843U89, MTA and DDATHF, by intermittent 72 hr exposures to 5 microM of ZD9331 and by continuous exposure to stepwise increasing concentrations of ZD9331, GW1843U89 and PT523. Development of resistance required only 3 cycles of intermittent drug exposure to ZD1694 and MTA, but 5 cycles for MTX, DDATHF and GW1843U89 and 8 cycles for ZD9331. The predominant mechanism of resistance to ZD1694, MTA, MTX and DDATHF was impaired polyglutamylation due to approximately 10-fold decreased folylpolyglutamate synthetase activity. Resistance to intermittent exposures to GW1843U89 and ZD9331 was associated with a 2-fold decreased transport via the reduced folate carrier (RFC). The CEM cell lines resistant to intermittent exposures to MTX, ZD1694, MTA, DDATHF, GW1843U89 and ZD9331 displayed a depletion (up to 4-fold) of total intracellular reduced folate pools. Resistance to continuous exposure to ZD9331 was caused by a 14-fold increase in TS activity. CEM/GW70, selected by continuous exposure to GW1843U89 was 50-fold resistant to GW1843U89, whereas continuous exposure to PT523 generated CEM/PT523 cells that were highly resistant (1550-fold) to PT523. Both CEM/GW70 and CEM/PT523 displayed cross-resistance to several antifolates that depend on the RFC for cellular uptake, including MTX (95- and 530-fold). CEM/GW70 cells were characterized by a 12-fold decreased transport of [3H]MTX. Interestingly, however, CEM/GW70 cells displayed an enhanced transport of folic acid, consistent with the expression of a structurally altered RFC resulting in a 2.6-fold increase of intracellular folate pools. CEM/PT523 cells displayed a markedly impaired (100-fold) transport of [3H]MTX along with 12-fold decreased total folate pools. In conclusion, multifunctional mechanisms of resistance in CEM cells have a differential impact on cellular folate homeostasis: decreased polyglutamylation and transport defects lead to folate depletion, whereas a structurally altered RFC protein can provoke expanded intracellular folate pools.","['Mauritz, Robert', 'Peters, Godefridus J', 'Priest, David G', 'Assaraf, Yehuda G', 'Drori, Stavit', 'Kathmann, Ietje', 'Noordhuis, Paul', 'Bunni, Marlene A', 'Rosowsky, Andre', 'Schornagel, Jan H', 'Pinedo, Herbert M', 'Jansen, Gerrit']","['Mauritz R', 'Peters GJ', 'Priest DG', 'Assaraf YG', 'Drori S', 'Kathmann I', 'Noordhuis P', 'Bunni MA', 'Rosowsky A', 'Schornagel JH', 'Pinedo HM', 'Jansen G']","['Department of Medical Oncology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Pterins)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (ZD 9331)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '113857-87-7', '(N(alpha)-(4-amino-4-deoxypteroyl)-N(delta)-hemiphthaloyl-L-ornithine)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Glutamates/pharmacology', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Pemetrexed', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Pterins/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolates/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/metabolism']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2002 Jan 15;63(2):105-15. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00824-3.,,,"['S0006295201008243 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00824-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we monitored telomere length in white blood cells (WBC), granulocytes, and naive and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes in recipients of allo-BMT at long-term follow-up. Peripheral blood was collected from 10 allo-BMT recipients and donors at a median interval of 18 years after allo-BMT. Telomere length was determined using Southern blot analysis. Similar to results previously reported at short-term follow-up, a small difference in telomere length (0.1-0.3 kb) between recipients and donors was detected in WBC, granulocytes and naive CD4+ T cells. Our data therefore provide no evidence for sustained telomere shortening in leucocytes, and render the possibility of long-term haematopoietic graft failure unlikely. In addition, we observed two phenomena that may be related to involution of the thymus. First, the number of naive CD4+ T cells in the blood was significantly lower in recipients (0.4 x 10(9)/l) than in donors (0.7 x 10(9)/l) (P < 0.05). Second, telomeres in memory CD4+ T cells from recipients were on average 0.6 kb shorter than those from donors (P = 0.01). The latter may be related to the reported rapid peripheral expansion of memory T cells immediately after transplantation.","['de Pauw, Elmar S D', 'Otto, Sigrid A', 'Wijnen, Juul T', 'Vossen, Jaak M', 'van Weel, Margreet H', 'Tanke, Hans J', 'Miedema, Frank', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Roelofs, Helene', 'Fibbe, Willem E']","['de Pauw ES', 'Otto SA', 'Wijnen JT', 'Vossen JM', 'van Weel MH', 'Tanke HJ', 'Miedema F', 'Willemze R', 'Roelofs H', 'Fibbe WE']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/therapy', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocytes/ultrastructure', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Leukocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Feb;116(2):491-6. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03283.x.,,,"['3283 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-1048.2001.03283.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these children, BMT from a matched unrelated donor (MUD) represents a therapeutic option. We reviewed the course of 62 children with ALL who received fully matched marrow allografts at our institution between 1990 and 1998: 36 with MRDs and 26 with MUDs. Clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups. The interval from attainment of pre-BMT complete remission to transplant was significantly longer in the MUD group. Conditioning (etoposide/total body irradiation) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis regimens were the same for all patients, and all received T cell-replete bone marrow. There was no significant difference in probability of engraftment, or time to engraftment, in the two groups. MUD BMT recipients had a significantly greater incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD (58% versus 24% in the MRD group; P = 0.02), and demonstrated a trend towards more chronic GVHD (39% versus 15%; P = 0.06). Three years post BMT, the probabilities of transplant-related mortality were 33 +/- 11% and 20 +/- 8% in MUD and MRD groups respectively (P = 0.38); the probabilities of relapse were 28 +/- 12% and 41 +/- 9% respectively (P = 0.19). Lansky or Karnofsky performance scores in event-free survivors were 90-100 in 87% of the MUD group and 83% of the MRD group. With a median follow up of 38 months (range, 3-97), 3-year event-free survival was 49 +/- 11% and 47 +/- 9% in the MUD and MRD BMT groups respectively (P = 0.71). These results suggest that MUD BMT is a valuable therapy for children with ALL in whom BMT is indicated, and underscore the importance of efforts aimed at expediting unrelated donor searches for patients lacking a MRD.","['Al-Kasim, F A', 'Thornley, I', 'Rolland, M', 'Lau, W', 'Tsang, R', 'Freedman, M H', 'Saunders, E F', 'Calderwood, S', 'Doyle, J J']","['Al-Kasim FA', 'Thornley I', 'Rolland M', 'Lau W', 'Tsang R', 'Freedman MH', 'Saunders EF', 'Calderwood S', 'Doyle JJ']","['Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Probability', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Feb;116(2):483-90.,,,['3282 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFI (n = 50) occurred in 46 patients, giving an overall probability of 14%. There were 12 cases of invasive candidiasis (3%), with only one death. Non-Candida IFI occurred in 37 patients (12% probability), mostly invasive aspergillosis (n = 32). In multivariate analysis the only two significant variables associated with a higher risk of developing a non-Candida IFI were the development of moderate-to-severe graft-versus-host disease (GvHD, P < 0.0001; OR 4.6) and having received steroid prophylaxis for GvHD (P = 0.04; OR 2.1). In multivariate analysis the variables associated with a lower overall survival after PBSCT were development of a non-Candida IFI (P < 0.0001; OR 5.6), non-early disease phase (P = 0.0001; OR 1.9), steroid prophylaxis (P = 0.02; OR 1.4), moderate-to-severe GvHD (P = 0.01; OR 1.6) and cytomegalovirus infection post transplant (P = 0.001; OR 1.8). Our results show that non-Candida IFI (in particular aspergillosis) was an important cause of infectious morbidity and mortality after an HLA-identical sibling PBSCT, while invasive candidiasis was rare. Use of steroid prophylaxis and, in particular, the development of moderate-to-severe GvHD post transplant were risk factors for non-Candida IFI. Prophylactic strategies for these infections should thus take into account these risk factors.","['Martino, Rodrigo', 'Subira, Maricel', 'Rovira, Montserrat', 'Solano, Carlos', 'Vazquez, Lourdes', 'Sanz, Guillermo F', 'Urbano-Ispizua, Alvaro', 'Brunet, Salut', 'De la Camara, Rafael']","['Martino R', 'Subira M', 'Rovira M', 'Solano C', 'Vazquez L', 'Sanz GF', 'Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Brunet S', 'De la Camara R']","['Division of Clinical Hematology, Hospital de la Sant Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain. rmartino@hsp.santpau.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aspergillosis/*complications/mortality', 'Candidiasis/*complications/mortality', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/microbiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/microbiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morbidity', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/microbiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Feb;116(2):475-82. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03259.x.,,,"['3259 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03259.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,"['alloPBSCT Infectious/Non-infectious Complications Subcommittees of the Grupo', 'Espanol de Trasplante Hematopoyetico (GETH)']",,,,

Our results showed that plasma cells expressed a restricted set of TFs compared with CD19+ B lymphocytes, with continued expression of Spi-B and oct-2, increased Blimp-1 expression, and downregulation of BSAP and PU.1. Cells from PCL lost Spi-B and PU.1 expression completely and expressed only oct-2 and Blimp-1, and thus resembled plasma cell lines. Human plasma cell differentiation therefore seems to be positively regulated by Blimp-1; whether this TF has any oncogenic potential will have to be analysed in future studies.","['Nagy, Monika', 'Chapuis, Bernard', 'Matthes, Thomas']","['Nagy M', 'Chapuis B', 'Matthes T']","['Division of Hematology, University Hospital Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-2)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (POU2F2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '138415-26-6 (PRDM1 protein, human)', '148350-00-9 (SPIB protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-2', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', 'Plasma Cells/*metabolism', 'Positive Regulatory Domain I-Binding Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Feb;116(2):429-35. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03271.x.,,,"['3271 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03271.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WT1 is also expressed in human normal CD34+ bone marrow (BM) cells at about 100 times lower levels than in leukaemia cells. To identify and characterize WT1-expressing cells in CD34+ BM cells, they were sorted into single cells and analysed for WT1 expression using two kinds of single-cell reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. Using the semiquantitative single-cell polyA-PCR + sequence-specific (SS)-PCR method, WT1 expression was detected in four (1.3%) out of 319 CD34+ BM single cells. To confirm the above results, a single-cell nested sequence-specific (NSS)-RT-PCR method that was less quantitative but more sensitive than the polyA-PCR + SS-PCR method was also performed, and WT1 expression was detected in 15 (1.1%) out of 1315 CD34+ BM single cells. In total, WT1 expression was found in 19 (1.2%) out of 1634 CD34+ BM single cells. No significant differences in the frequencies of WT1-expressing cells were found between CD34+CD38- and CD34+CD38+ BM single cells. Furthermore, WT1-expressing CD34+ BM single cells expressed WT1 at levels similar to those in K562 leukaemia single cells. Analysis of lineage-specific and cell cycle gene expression in WT1-expressing CD34+ BM single cells showed that the WT1 gene could be expressed in both uncommitted, dormant CD34+CD38- and lineage-committed, proliferating CD34+CD38+ BM cells.

Intriguingly, CLL cells also appear to have a specific susceptibility to oxidative stress - a potent inducer of apoptosis. Here, we show that serum albumin can function as a cytoprotective antioxidant of potential relevance to circulating CLL cells, and that autocrine catalase - a hydrogen peroxide-inactivating enzyme that may be released extracellularly - can perform a similar role under the crowded conditions that prevail at sites of tissue involvement. Albumin lowered oxidative stress in cultured CLL cells and inhibited spontaneous and reactive oxidant-induced apoptosis. Maximal effects were observed at a concentration of 10 mg/ml - fourfold lower than that in plasma and twofold higher than that in standard culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Oxidative stress and spontaneous apoptosis were also decreased by cell crowding and by conditioned medium (CM) from crowded CLL cells, indicating that these processes were subject to autocrine regulation. CLL cells were found to express catalase and release enzyme activity into the culture medium. Exogenous catalase decreased oxidative stress and spontaneous apoptosis, and the anti-apoptotic effect of CM from crowded CLL cells was abrogated by the specific catalase inhibitor, 3'-amino-1,2,4-triazole. Together, these data strongly implicate autocrine catalase as a cytoprotective antioxidant. Oxidative stress in CLL cells was greatly diminished by ruthenium red - an inhibitor of mitochondrial reactive oxidant production - and by the glutathione (GSH) precursor N-acetylcysteine, suggesting that the GSH peroxidase antioxidant system may be compromised by lack of available substrate. Our findings highlight the importance of endogenous reactive oxidants in regulating CLL-cell apoptosis, and help to explain why CLL cells survive for prolonged periods in vivo despite their vulnerability to oxidative stress and spontaneous apoptosis when cultured in vitro.","['Moran, Elizabeth C', 'Kamiguti, Aura S', 'Cawley, John C', 'Pettitt, Andrew R']","['Moran EC', 'Kamiguti AS', 'Cawley JC', 'Pettitt AR']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cryoprotective Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '11103-72-3 (Ruthenium Red)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Catalase/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cryoprotective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Ruthenium Red/pharmacology', 'Serum Albumin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Feb;116(2):316-28.,,,['3280 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using flow cytometry, we investigated whether the unique ETV6-AML1 phenotype extended to molecules associated with antigen presentation by analysing 50 diagnostic bone marrow samples from paediatric pre-B ALL patients. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the ETV6-AML1 fusion transcript was positive in 14 patients. ETV6-AML1-positive samples were characterized by a significantly higher expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD40 (P < 0.0001), as well as a significantly higher class II HLA-DR mean channel fluorescence (P = 0.001). In contrast, CD86 expression was significantly lower on fusion-positive samples (P = 0.010) while there was no difference in expression of CD80 or major histocompatibility complex class I between ETV6-AML1-positive and -negative samples. This is the first observation in acute leukaemia that the distinct immunophenotype associated with specific translocations includes the expression of molecules associated with antigen presentation. In the case of ETV6-AML1 pre-B ALL, this characteristic immunophenotype may have implications for the immunogenicity of the leukaemic cells.","['Alessandri, Angela J', 'Reid, Gregor S D', 'Bader, Sharon A', 'Massing, Bonnie G', 'Sorensen, Poul H B', 'Schultz, Kirk R']","['Alessandri AJ', 'Reid GS', 'Bader SA', 'Massing BG', 'Sorensen PH', 'Schultz KR']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of British Columbia and British Columbia's Children's Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Feb;116(2):266-72.,,,['3291 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether this reactivity represents a phenomenon unique to ALK-positive lymphoma by screening plasma from patients with follicular lymphoma for antibodies to BCL-2 protein. Eight out of 10 samples showed such reactivity (and in six cases gave specific staining of BCL-2-transfected cells). As these findings suggest a new biochemical approach to the identification of oncogenic proteins in lymphoma, we investigated whether antibodies present in patients with ALK-positive lymphoma can precipitate NPM-ALK in quantities which should be sufficient for further analysis. We found that plasma samples from all10 patients studied immunoprecipitated NPM-ALK asaprotein visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulphatepolyacrylamide gels. Finally we demonstrated that NPM-ALK could be visualized more clearly if it were immunoprecipitated from extracts of cells in which newly synthesized proteins had been labelled with 35S and then identified by autoradiography. These results suggest a strategy for using patients' autoantibodies to screen for antibodies to other tumour-associated proteins.","['Pulford, Karen', 'Roberton, Helen', 'Banham, Alison H', 'Hatton, Christian S R', 'Mason, David Y']","['Pulford K', 'Roberton H', 'Banham AH', 'Hatton CS', 'Mason DY']","['Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. karen.pulford@ndcls.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (p80(NPM-ALK) protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*blood', 'Autoradiography', 'Blotting, Western', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*immunology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*immunology', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jan;116(1):135-41. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03252.x.,,,"['3252 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03252.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From October 1993 to September 1996, 270 patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukaemia were randomized to G-CSF or control groups after remission induction therapy. The G-CSF group received G-CSF (Filgrastim) from 48 h after the completing chemotherapy until the absolute neutrophil count exceeded 1.5 x 10(9)/l. The control group did not receive G-CSF unless severe infection occurred. There were 245 evaluable patients (120 and 125 in the G-CSF and control groups respectively). The complete remission rate was similar in the G-CSF and control groups (80.8% versus 76.8%), as was the 5-year probability of disease-free survival (34.5% versus 33.6%) and overall survival (42.7% versus 35.6%). Neutrophil recovery was significantly faster in the G-CSF group than in the control group (12 d versus 18 d, P = 0.0001). The median duration of febrile neutropenia was significantly shorter in the G-CSF group than in the control group (3 d versus 4 d, P = 0.0001). In conclusion, prophylactic administration of G-CSF after remission induction therapy for acute myelogenous leukaemia is safe and useful even in patients without infection on completing chemotherapy.","['Usuki, Kensuke', 'Urabe, Akio', 'Masaoka, Toru', 'Ohno, Ryuzo', 'Mizoguchi, Hideaki', 'Hamajima, Nobuyuki', 'Miyazaki, Tamotsu', 'Niitsu, Yousirou', 'Yoshida, Yutaka', 'Miura, Akira', 'Shibata, Akira', 'Abe, Tsukasa', 'Miura, Yasusada', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Nomura, Takeo', 'Nagao, Tadami', 'Saitou, Hidehiko', 'Shirakawa, Shigeru', 'Ohkuma, Minoru', 'Matsuda, Tamotsu', 'Nakamura, Toru', 'Horiuchi, Atsushi', 'Kuramoto, Atsushi', 'Kimura, Ikurou', 'Irino, Syozo', 'Niho, Yoshiyuki', 'Takatsuki, Kiyoshi', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Uchino, Haruto', 'Takaku, Fumimaro']","['Usuki K', 'Urabe A', 'Masaoka T', 'Ohno R', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Hamajima N', 'Miyazaki T', 'Niitsu Y', 'Yoshida Y', 'Miura A', 'Shibata A', 'Abe T', 'Miura Y', 'Ikeda Y', 'Nomura T', 'Nagao T', 'Saitou H', 'Shirakawa S', 'Ohkuma M', 'Matsuda T', 'Nakamura T', 'Horiuchi A', 'Kuramoto A', 'Kimura I', 'Irino S', 'Niho Y', 'Takatsuki K', 'Tomonaga M', 'Uchino H', 'Takaku F']","['Division of Hematology, NTT Kanto Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/drug therapy', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/drug therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction/methods']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jan;116(1):103-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03251.x.,,,"['3251 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03251.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,['Gran AML Study Group'],,,,

A significant elevation of plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was observed in some ATL patients, particularly in the patients with malignant cell infiltration. MMP-9 was found to be secreted into the conditioned medium from all ATL cell lines examined. Moreover, the corresponding mRNA was detectable both in all ATL cell lines examined and in the majority of primary acute ATL cells, indicating that ATL cells are capable of synthesizing and secreting MMP-9. We previously demonstrated that a high incidence of ATL cell infiltration was closely related to a high plasma level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) produced by ATL cells themselves. This present study showed that the presence of increased plasma MMP-9 was closely associated with elevated plasma VEGF in ATL patients. Furthermore, we showed that both increased plasma MMP-9 and VEGF were significantly related to high ATL cell infiltration.

The disadvantage of this approach is that for each patient preferably two different targets have to be identified. The t(12;21)(p13;q22) with the TEL-AML1 fusion gene is present in approximately 25% of children with B-precursor ALL. In these patients, sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis of the TEL-AML1 fusion transcript might be a more simple and less laborious alternative approach. However, it is unknown how stable the mRNA is and whether the number of transcripts per leukaemic cell remains constant during follow-up. We investigated whether the MRD results obtained using RT-PCR of TEL-AML1 transcripts correlated with the clinically validated genomic PCR for Ig and TCR gene rearrangements. Therefore, we used real-time quantitative (RQ)-PCR analysis for both types of targets and assessed the MRD levels in 36 follow-up bone marrow samples (obtained during the first 1.5 years after diagnosis) from 13 patients with B-precursor ALL. In 34/36 bone marrow samples the Ig/TCR RQ-PCR and TEL-AML1 RQ-PCR revealed equal levels of MRD and these results had a strong correlation (P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.84). Therefore, we conclude that the TEL-AML1 RQ-PCR can, in principle, replace Ig/TCR RQ-PCR in B-precursor ALL with t(12;21).","['de Haas, V', 'Breunis, W B', 'Dee, R', 'Verhagen, O J H M', 'Kroes, W', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J M', 'van den Berg, H', 'van der Schoot, C E']","['de Haas V', 'Breunis WB', 'Dee R', 'Verhagen OJ', 'Kroes W', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ', 'van den Berg H', 'van der Schoot CE']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Blood Transfusion Service and Laboratory of Experimental and Clinical Immunology, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Computer Systems', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2002 Jan;116(1):87-93. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03228.x.,,,"['3228 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2002.03228.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma genes were in germline, and with the exception of CD4 all T-cell antigens were negative, including CD3, TCR-beta, TCR-delta, TIA-1, granzyme B and perforin. Epstein-Barr virus was negative, and no expression was seen of myeloid cell-associated markers. Molecular analysis showed no abnormalities of the CDKN2A (p16), CDKN2B (p15) or TNFRSF6 (Fas) genes. By contrast, a 34-bp deletion in exon 7 of the TP53 (p53) gene was detected. It is suggested that lymphoblastoid NK-cell lymphoma, which is a rare but distinctive disease, originates from NK cell precursors and may be associated with and possibly caused by alterations in the TP53 gene. Experience is too limited to warrant therapeutic suggestions. However, stem cell transplantation may be a useful option in younger patients.","['Knudsen, H', 'Gronbaek, K', 'thor Straten, P', 'Gisselo, C', 'Johansen, P', 'Timshel, S', 'Bergmann, O J', 'Hansen, N E', 'Ralfkiaer, E']","['Knudsen H', 'Gronbaek K', 'thor Straten P', 'Gisselo C', 'Johansen P', 'Timshel S', 'Bergmann OJ', 'Hansen NE', 'Ralfkiaer E']","['Department of Pathology, Herlev University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', '*Killer Cells, Natural', '*Lectins, C-Type', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2002/02/14 10:00,2002/03/15 10:01,['2002/02/14 10:00'],"['2002/02/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/14 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2002 Jan;146(1):148-53. doi: 10.1046/j.0007-0963.2001.04571.x.,,,"['4571 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0007-0963.2001.04571.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: For the CIA model, DBA/1J-background IL-1alpha-/-, IL-1beta-/-, IL-1alpha/beta-/-, and wild-type littermate mice were immunized with CII. For the HTLV-I Tg model, BALB/c IL-1beta-/- or IL-1alpha/beta-/- mice were crossed with HTLV-I Tg mice. The effects of IL-1 deficiency were assessed as follows: Development of arthritis was assessed both macroscopically and microscopically. Serum antibody titer was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Proliferative response of lymph node cells was assayed by measurement of (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Expression of T cell surface molecule CD40 ligand (CD40L) and OX40 was determined by multicolor flow cytometric analysis. RESULTS: The development of arthritis was markedly suppressed in IL-1alpha/beta-/- mice in both models, although the effect was less prominent in HTLV-I Tg mice. Deficiency of only IL-1alpha or only IL-1beta was also associated with disease suppression. Antibody production after immunization with CII was normal in IL-1alpha/beta-/- mice, while autoantibody production was suppressed in IL-1alpha/beta-/- HTLV-I Tg mice. In IL-1alpha/beta-/- mice, the T cell proliferative response against CII was greatly reduced in both the CIA and the HTLV-I Tg models, suggesting inefficiency of T cell activation. Furthermore, expression of CD40L and OX40 on T cells was greatly reduced in IL-1alpha/beta-/- mice. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that T cell activation by IL-1 is important for the development of autoimmunity and arthritis in these mice.","['Saijo, Shinobu', 'Asano, Masahide', 'Horai, Reiko', 'Yamamoto, Hiroaki', 'Iwakura, Yoichiro']","['Saijo S', 'Asano M', 'Horai R', 'Yamamoto H', 'Iwakura Y']","['Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Tokyo 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (OX40Ig)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis/*genetics', 'Arthritis, Experimental/*immunology/pathology', 'Autoantibodies/blood', 'Autoimmunity/immunology', 'CD40 Ligand/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tarsus, Animal/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/22 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 2002 Feb;46(2):533-44. doi: 10.1002/art.10172.,,,"['10.1002/art.10172 [pii]', '10.1002/art.10172 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One family of bHLH transcriptional repressors is related to the Drosophila hairy and Enhancer-of-split proteins. These repressors contain a tandem arrangement of the bHLH domain and an adjacent sequence known as the Orange domain, so we refer to these proteins as bHLH-Orange or bHLH-O proteins. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the existence of four bHLH-O subfamilies, with distinct, evolutionarily conserved features. A principal function of bHLH-O proteins is to bind to specific DNA sequences and recruit transcriptional corepressors to inhibit target gene expression. However, it is likely that bHLH-O proteins repress transcription by additional mechanisms as well. Many vertebrate bHLH-O proteins are effectors of the Notch signaling pathway, and bHLH-O proteins are involved in regulating neurogenesis, vasculogenesis, mesoderm segmentation, myogenesis, and T lymphocyte development. In this review, we discuss mechanisms of action and biological roles for the vertebrate bHLH-O proteins, as well as some of the unresolved questions about the functions and regulation of these proteins during development and in human disease.","['Davis, R L', 'Turner, D L']","['Davis RL', 'Turner DL']","['Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (ESR-5 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (N protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (hes7.2 protein, Xenopus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Blood Vessels/cytology/embryology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Drosophila Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Drosophila melanogaster/embryology/genetics/physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics/*physiology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Mesoderm/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis/genetics/physiology', '*Multigene Family', 'Muscles/cytology/embryology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/genetics/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Nervous System/embryology', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Terminology as Topic', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Vertebrates/embryology/genetics/*physiology', '*Xenopus Proteins']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Dec 20;20(58):8342-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205094.,,140,['10.1038/sj.onc.1205094 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have sought to develop and validate a method for mycoplasma detection which is sensitive and accurate, but also practical in the sense of time spent, costs, and applicability in the standard laboratory; finally, the method should be suitable for screening large numbers of test specimens. To that end, we adapted a previously developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for daily routine application. This single-step PCR uses a mixture of primers annealing to gene sequences coding for evolutionarily conserved 16S rRNA of different mycoplasma species, including the ones most commonly found in cell cultures. An internal control was introduced to exclude any false-negative tests resulting from technical PCR problems. This mycoplasma detection by PCR has been validated prospectively on 201 consecutive leukemia-lymphoma cell lines received at the institute over a 3-year period and on 118 initially positive cell lines after anti-mycoplasma treatment with antibiotics. The sensitivity (detection of true positives) of this PCR detection assay was 96% and the specificity (detection of true negatives) was also 96%, with positive and negative predictive values (probability of correct result) of 86% and 99%, respectively. PCR defined the mycoplasma status with 96% accuracy (detection of true positives and true negatives). Besides the high sensitivity and specificity, further attractive features of the PCR approach are the ease and speed with which large numbers of specimens can be tested. PCR mycoplasma analysis provides a readily available, quick and reliable test system with which to manage the important issue of mycoplasma contamination of cell lines.","['Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Bacterial/*analysis', 'DNA, Ribosomal/analysis', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Mycoplasma/drug effects/*isolation & purification', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*microbiology']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):289-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402365.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402365 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work suggested that certain antibiotics have strong anti-mycoplasma properties and raised the prospect that the technically rather simple antibiotic treatment may be an appropriate means for mycoplasma eradication. We have developed and validated an effective strategy to eliminate mycoplasma from chronically infected cell cultures using antibiotics which have shown strong activity against these contaminants. Here, we describe our experience with the treatment of 123 consecutive mycoplasma-positive leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, comparing five different antibiotic regimens (in total 433 treatments). We optimized the antibiotic dose schedules and the duration of treatments. The various antibiotic treatments which were employed in parallel had a high efficacy, as 71% to 86% of the infected cultures were cleansed. Treatment failure may result from the resistance of the mycoplasmas to antibiotic therapy and the inability of the eukaryotic cells to survive the cytotoxic effects of the antibiotics. Resistance to mycoplasma eradication was observed in 3% to 20% of the cultures. Loss of the cell culture caused by cytotoxicity was seen in 3% to 11% of the treatments. With regard to the overall outcome, 96% of the cell lines were rendered mycoplasma-free with at least one of the antibiotic treatments and were permanently cured. In conclusion, antibiotic treatment represents the most practical and efficient option to cleanse mycoplasma-positive cell lines.","['Uphoff, C C', 'Meyer, C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Uphoff CC', 'Meyer C', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Suspensions)', '118277-12-6 (BM-cyclin)', '141513-63-5 (mycoplasma removal agent)', '3DX3XEK1BN (Enrofloxacin)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', 'FYY3R43WGO (Minocycline)', 'Q90AGA787L (sparfloxacin)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Infective Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Ciprofloxacin/pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial', 'Enrofloxacin', '*Fluoroquinolones', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Minocycline/pharmacology', 'Mycoplasma/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Quinolones/pharmacology', 'Suspensions', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*microbiology']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):284-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402364.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402364 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis confirmed P-gp expression. Cytogenetically, the Tat-1 cell line showed identical chromosomal alterations to that of the initial biopsy specimen, among which the most notable were the t(14;18) typical of FL and additional abnormalities involving chromosomes 1, 8 and 13. Multicolor FISH analysis delineated all abnormalities, including a t(1p;8q), a der(8)(8q24::14q32::18q21) and a der(13)(13q32::8q24::14q32::18q21).

The unusual molecular features of the Tat-1 cell line render it a unique tool for studies focused on cytogenetic alterations, expression of multidrug resistance phenotype and expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in FL.","['Denyssevych, T', 'Lestou, V S', 'Knesevich, S', 'Robichaud, M', 'Salski, C', 'Tan, R', 'Gascoyne, R D', 'Horsman, D E', 'Mayer, L D']","['Denyssevych T', 'Lestou VS', 'Knesevich S', 'Robichaud M', 'Salski C', 'Tan R', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Horsman DE', 'Mayer LD']","['Department of Advanced Therapeutics, Vancouver Cancer Centre, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):276-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402372.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402372 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, BCL-6 mutations were examined by DNA direct sequencing in 103 patients with B-DLCL. BCL-6 mutations were found in 53/103 patients, including 38/76 treated with standard chemotherapy and 15/27 treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) up front. The presence of BCL-6 mutations was correlated with clinical features at diagnosis and outcome. Mutated patients had a significantly higher LDH level (66% vs 38%, P < 0.05), and bulky disease (51% vs 32%, P = 0.05). In the whole series of patients BCL-6 mutations did not affect CR and OS. Patients with BCL-6 mutations tended to have a prolonged 5-years DFS and FFS compared to those without mutations (DFS 82% vs 63%, FFS 63% vs 49%). Among B-DLCL treated with standard chemotherapy, mutated patients showed a significantly improved 5-year DFS (85% vs 61%, P < 0.05) and, notably, the only four relapses observed among mutated patients occurred in less than 8 months. The multivariate regression analysis (P < 0.01) with DFS as endpoint confirmed the independent prognostic value of BCL-6 mutations. There was a trend for 5-year failure-free survival to be better for patients with BCL-6 mutations (63% vs 43%, P = 0.09). In the 27 patients treated with ASCT, BCL-6 mutations did not correlate with outcome. These results suggest that BCL-6 mutations may predict a higher chance of being free of disease in B-DLCL treated with standard chemotherapy. Larger series of patients need to be analyzed to evaluate the clinical relevance of BCL-6 mutations properly.","['Vitolo, U', 'Botto, B', 'Capello, D', 'Vivenza, D', 'Zagonel, V', 'Gloghini, A', 'Novero, D', 'Parvis, G', 'Calvi, R', 'Ariatti, C', 'Milan, I', 'Bertini, M', 'Boccomini, C', 'Freilone, R', 'Pregno, P', 'Orsucci, L', 'Palestro, G', 'Saglio, G', 'Carbone, A', 'Gallo, E', 'Gaidano, G']","['Vitolo U', 'Botto B', 'Capello D', 'Vivenza D', 'Zagonel V', 'Gloghini A', 'Novero D', 'Parvis G', 'Calvi R', 'Ariatti C', 'Milan I', 'Bertini M', 'Boccomini C', 'Freilone R', 'Pregno P', 'Orsucci L', 'Palestro G', 'Saglio G', 'Carbone A', 'Gallo E', 'Gaidano G']","['UOA Ematologia, Dipartimento di Oncologia, Azienda Ospedaliera S Giovanni Battista, Torino, Italy. uvitolo@molinette.piemonte.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'BEAM regimen', 'CHOP protocol', 'MACOP-B regimen', 'VACOP-B protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Point Mutation', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/02/09 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):268-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402349.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402349 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inclusion criteria were the presence of an FDG-PET scan after chemotherapy (ChT) within 8 weeks prior to HDT/SCT and available follow-up data. Sixteen patients (10 NHL and six HD) were observed during a follow-up period of 4 to 28 months (median 13 months). Before SCT, five patients had a negative PET, three were weakly positive, two moderately positive, and six strongly positive. None of the five patients with a negative PET before HDT/SCT relapsed and two of three patients with a weakly positive scan are still in remission after HDT/SCT. Of eight patients with a moderate or high positive PET before HDT/SCT, seven relapsed and one died of early HDT/SCT related complications (P< 0.01). Three of eight relapsing patients died of lymphoma 5 to 10 months after SCT and in one additional patient not responding to HDT/SCT, the main cause of death was chronic toxicity 4 months after transplantation. After 12 months, in PET-negative patients the overall and relapse-free survival was 100%, in PET-positive patients 55% and 18%, respectively. In NHL, two patients with negative PET, but with an age-adjusted international prognostic index (AaIPI) of 2 and one with AaIPI = 1 are still in remission. In the seven PET-positive subjects, one patient with AaIPI = 0, three with AaIPI = 1, and two with AaIPI = 2 relapsed. We conclude that FDG-PET is accurate in the prediction of relapse prior to HDT/SCT in patients with lymphoma. It provides additional information when compared with the AaIPI.","['Becherer, A', 'Mitterbauer, M', 'Jaeger, U', 'Kalhs, P', 'Greinix, H T', 'Karanikas, G', 'Potzi, C', 'Raderer, M', 'Dudczak, R', 'Kletter, K']","['Becherer A', 'Mitterbauer M', 'Jaeger U', 'Kalhs P', 'Greinix HT', 'Karanikas G', 'Potzi C', 'Raderer M', 'Dudczak R', 'Kletter K']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Medical School, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'BEAM protocol', 'CBV protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/pharmacokinetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Podophyllotoxin/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', '*Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', '*Tomography, Emission-Computed', 'Transplantation Conditioning/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):260-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402342.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402342 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HERV-K is the most biologically active form, since members of this family have intact open reading frames for the gag, pol or env genes. Antibody response against HERV-K peptides has been reported in leukemia patients, suggesting a possible overexpression of this sequence in leukemic cells. Using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan), we found that in six of the eight leukemia samples we collected, transcriptional activity of HERV-K10-like gag gene was 5- to 10-fold higher than in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or mononuclear cells from cord blood. The overexpression was marked enough to be detected by Northern blot. In addition, there was no significant variation of HERV-K expression in normal PBMCs after exposure to different factors (PHA, gamma irradiation, 5-azacytidine) that potentially modulate HERV expression. This suggests that HERV-K relative overexpression in leukemia samples might be specifically associated with tumor development. The origin of these transcriptional variations is therefore worth being investigated further.","['Depil, S', 'Roche, C', 'Dussart, P', 'Prin, L']","['Depil S', 'Roche C', 'Dussart P', 'Prin L']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Computer Systems', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Genes, gag', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects/*virology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/radiation effects']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2000/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):254-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402355.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402355 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulation of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways and gene transcription, induced by these cytokines were examined using the OCI-AML5 cell line. For this purpose, FL and G-CSF were used either alone, or in combination as the co-addition of FL and G-CSF (FL+G-CSF), or a chimeric molecule, progenipoietin-1 (ProGP-1). Both G-CSF and FL induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) while p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase was phosphorylated only in response to G-CSF but not FL. Studies using specific kinase inhibitors suggested that both ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways were required for the optimal cell proliferation in response to both G-CSF and FL. The magnitude of activation of the ERK pathway and induction of genes involved in cell cycle progression by G-CSF and FL exhibited a strong correlation with the degree of cell proliferation. These data suggest that OCI-AML5 cells proliferate at least in part, due to the activation of both ERK and p38 MAP kinase pathways in response to G-CSF and FL.

Spontaneous apoptosis was accelerated in c-jun expressing MEL cells before and after DMSO treatment. Moreover, c-Jun sensitized apoptosis induced by various drugs. Drug-induced apoptosis was associated with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation and c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation (JNP). In contrast, overexpression of c-jun delayed apoptosis in serum-starved cells, indicating that c-Jun may reduce or accelerate apoptosis in MEL cells depending on the nature of the apoptotic stimulus.

The expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins p53, p21, MDM-2, BCL-2, BCL-X(L), BCL-X(S), and BAX, and caspase-3 activity was determined in circulating blasts collected from the peripheral blood of children with leukemia prior to, and at serial time points following chemotherapy. Culturing blasts ex vivo for 12 h assessed spontaneous apoptosis and the increment induced by chemotherapy. Baseline apoptosis varied between 3% and 29%. Twenty-four hours following chemotherapy the increase in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis ranged from <1% to 38%. Eleven of 20 patients who received initial treatment with a p53-dependent drug showed an increase in p53 expression. In these patients, the levels of p53 target genes were also increased. A uniform pattern of BCL-2 family protein expression was not observed and only a minority of samples showed a change that would favor apoptosis.

We recently reported that the monocyclic monoterpene, perillyl alcohol (POH) selectively induces in Bcr/Abl transformed cells, G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, POH activates anti-proliferative and apoptotic pathways against which the Bcr/Abl kinase does not protect. In this report, we show that in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells, POH induces cytoplasmic acidification, redistribution of phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane along with DNA fragmentation, all of which can be prevented by the phorbol ester, TPA. The ability of TPA to protect against POH-induced cytotoxicity was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) and the Na(+)/H(+) antiport. In contrast, TPA does not protect the cells from POH-mediated G0/G1 arrest. While POH inhibits a distal step in the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway, lovastatin, also a potential anticancer agent, inhibits the initial step in this pathway. Not surprisingly, lovastatin also induces G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells, however, TPA protects cells from both apoptosis and G0/G1 arrest caused by lovastatin. Thus, in Bcr/Abl-transformed cells, POH and lovastatin cause growth arrest by different mechanisms. Together, these observations demonstrate that POH-mediated cell cycle arrest precedes apoptosis and raises the possibility that that the primary effect of POH is to induce G0/G1 arrest with apoptosis being a consequence of the growth arrest.","['Clark, S S', 'Perman, S M', 'Sahin, M B', 'Jenkins, G J', 'Elegbede, J A']","['Clark SS', 'Perman SM', 'Sahin MB', 'Jenkins GJ', 'Elegbede JA']","['Department of Human Oncology, Oncology and the UW Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA09471/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Monoterpenes)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (calphostin complex)', '319R5C7293 (perillyl alcohol)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amiloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'G1 Phase/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Lovastatin/pharmacology', 'Membrane Lipids/analysis', 'Mice', '*Monoterpenes', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylserines/analysis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Terpenes/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):213-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402369.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402369 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, MLL duplication was analyzed, in 81 AML patients without chromosomal abnormalities at 11q23, using Southern blotting, genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse-transcription PCR and complementary DNA sequencing. Nine patients showed partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene, including eight (12%) of the 68 with normal karyotype. Seven patients showed fusion of exon 6/exon 2 (e6/e2), one, combination of differentially spliced transcripts e7/e2 and e6/e2, and the remaining one, combination of e8/e2 and e7/e2. Among the patients with normal karyotype, children aged 1 to 15 showed a trend to higher frequency of MLL duplication than other patients (2/5 or 40% vs 6/62 or 10%, P = 0.102). The patients with tandem duplication of the MLL gene had a significantly higher incidence of CD11b expression on leukemic cells than did those without in the subgroup of patients with normal karyotype (75% vs 28%, P = 0.017). There were no significant differences in the expression of lymphoid antigens or other myeloid antigens between the two groups of patients. In adults, the patients with MLL duplication had a shorter median survival time than those without (4.5 months vs 12 months, P = 0.036). In conclusion, partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene is associated with increased expression of CD11b on leukemic blasts and implicates poor prognosis in adult AML patients. The higher frequency of MLL duplication in children older than 1 year, than in other age groups, needs to be confirmed by further studies.","['Shiah, H-S', 'Kuo, Y-Y', 'Tang, J-L', 'Huang, S-Y', 'Yao, M', 'Tsay, W', 'Chen, Y-C', 'Wang, C-H', 'Shen, M-C', 'Lin, D-T', 'Lin, K-H', 'Tien, H-F']","['Shiah HS', 'Kuo YY', 'Tang JL', 'Huang SY', 'Yao M', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Wang CH', 'Shen MC', 'Lin DT', 'Lin KH', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transcription Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):196-202. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402352.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402352 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characteristically, multiple HOXA family members including HOXA3-HOXA10 were jointly overexpressed in conjunction with HOXB3, HOXB6, MEIS1 and PBX3. Higher levels of expression were also observed in the FAB subtype, AML-M1. Spearmann correlation coefficients indicated that the expression levels for many of these genes were highly inter-related. While we did not detect any significant correlations between HOX expression and complete response rates or age in this limited set of patients, there was a significant correlation between event-free survival and HOXA7 with a trend toward significance for HoxA9, HoxA4 and HoxA5. While patients with elevated HOX expression did worse, there were notable exceptions.

The regularity of surface membrane antigen expression patterns, their interrelationships as well as the effects of the three frequent chromosomal aberrations, ie 11q deletion, 13q deletion and trisomy 12, were investigated in 35 classic CLL cases by flow cytometry. The two-way cluster analysis of 31 individual antigens revealed three expression patterns: (1) most cells in most cases positive (CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD27, CD40, CD45, CD45RA); (2) most cells in most cases negative (CD10, CD14, CD34, CD122, CD154, mIgG); and (3) a mixed pattern with a variable number of positive cases and a variable percentage of positive cells in individual cases (CD11c, CD21, CD22, CD25, CD38, CD45RO, CD79b, CD80, CD95, CD124, CD126, CD130, FMC7, mIgD, mIgkappa, mIglambda, mIgM).

In contrast, the expression of some antigens was mutually exclusive, the best examples being CD45RA/CD45RO, CD38/CD80 and CD45RA/CD80. Deletion of chromosome arm 11q attenuated expression of splicing variant CD45RA, but enhanced CD45RO expression. In contrast, cases of trisomy 12 were associated with enhanced CD45RA and attenuated CD45RO expression. Similarly, trisomy 12 was associated with enhanced CD27 and mIgkappa expression. The variable levels of signaling surface membrane antigens, their interactions and interference by genetic aberrations are likely to affect the clinical progression and drug response of CLL.","['Hulkkonen, J', 'Vilpo, L', 'Hurme, M', 'Vilpo, J']","['Hulkkonen J', 'Vilpo L', 'Hurme M', 'Vilpo J']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Tampere Medical School and Laboratory Center of Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/ultrastructure', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trisomy']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):178-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402363.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402363 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the biological properties of KIT in CML leukemogenesis, we performed analysis of alterations of the c-kit gene and functional analysis of altered KIT proteins. Gene alterations in the c-kit juxtamembrane domain of 80 CML cases were analyzed by reverse transcriptase and polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (RT-PCR-SSCP). One case had an abnormality at codon 564 (AAT --> AAG, Asn --> Lys), and six cases had the same base abnormality at codon 541 (ATG --> CTG, Met --> Leu) in the juxtamembrane domain. Because the change from Met to Leu at codon 541 was a conservative one which was also observed in the normal population and normal tissues of CML patients, it probably represents a polymorphic variation. Although samples of hair roots and leukemic cells from the chronic phase of one CML patient showed no abnormality, an abnormality at codon 541 (ATG --> CTG, Met --> Leu) was found only at blastic crisis (BC) of this case. In the case with the abnormality at codon 564, the mutation was detected only in a sample of leukemic cells collected at BC. To examine the biological consequence and biological significance of these abnormalities, murine KIT(L540) and KIT(K563) expression vectors were introduced into interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine Ba/F3 cells to study their state of tyrosine phosphorylation and their growth rate. Ba/F3 cells expressing KIT(WT), KIT(L540) and KIT(K563) showed dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation after treatment with increasing concentrations of recombinant mouse stem cell factor (rmSCF). The cells expressing KIT(L540) and KIT(K563) were found to have greater tyrosine phosphorylation than cells expressing KIT(WT) at 0.1 and 1.0 ng/ml of rmSCF. The Ba/F3 cells expressing KIT(K563) proliferated in response to 0.1 and 1.0 ng/ml of rmSCF as well as IL-3. The Ba/F3 cells expressing KIT(L540)showed a relatively higher proliferative response to 0.1 ng/ml of rmSCF than the response of cells expressing KIT(WT). These mutations and in vitro functional analyses raise the possibility that the KIT abnormalities influence the white blood cell counts (P < 0.05) and survival (P < 0.04) of CML patients.","['Inokuchi, K', 'Yamaguchi, H', 'Tarusawa, M', 'Futaki, M', 'Hanawa, H', 'Tanosaki, S', 'Dan, K']","['Inokuchi K', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Tarusawa M', 'Futaki M', 'Hanawa H', 'Tanosaki S', 'Dan K']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2000/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Feb;16(2):170-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402341.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402341 [doi]'],,,,['Leukemia. 2006 Feb;20(2):354-5; discussion 356-7.

Typically, the presence of such translocations is revealed by RT-PCR technique, followed by Southern blot hybridization to ensure specificity of the PCR product. Though widely employed, post-PCR analysis of this type is relatively laborious and time-intensive. As a departure from standard analytic approaches, we have developed a robust novel method combining both high specificity and sensitivity, based on polystyrene bead capture of fluorescently labeled PCR products, with subsequent analysis by flow cytometry. Results from cell line and patient sample evaluations indicate that this method may be easily incorporated into the diagnostic molecular laboratory as a rapid and cost-effective alternative to currently employed techniques.","['Zhang, Q-Y', 'Garner, K', 'Viswanatha, D S']","['Zhang QY', 'Garner K', 'Viswanatha DS']","['Department of Pathology, Experimental Pathology Laboratory, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biotinylation', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry/economics/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/chemistry', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Microspheres', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/economics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):144-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402322.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402322 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the presence of CD44v on B cell lines from different stages of development was analyzed by flow cytometry and a role in adhesion to stromal cells from different tissues was evaluated in in vitro binding assays. CD44v3, v6 and v9 isoforms were exclusively expressed on plasma cell lines and CD44v9 expression correlated with IL-6-dependent plasma cell growth. Binding studies using CD44 isoform- specific reagents showed that CD44v6 and CD44v9 were involved in binding to bone marrow stromal cells, but not to in vitro synthesized ECM or hyaluronic acid. CD44v9-mediated plasma cell binding resulted in a significant induction of IL-6 secretion by bone marrow stromal cells. Large differences in quantitative plasma cell binding to stromal cells from different tissues were observed. These, however, could not be related to a differential use of CD44v in these binding processes. The role of CD44v9 in adhesion induced IL-6 secretion and its preferential expression on IL-6-dependent plasma cell lines may explain the previously observed correlation between CD44v9 expression and adverse prognosis in multiple myeloma.","['Van Driel, M', 'Gunthert, U', 'van Kessel, A C', 'Joling, P', 'Stauder, R', 'Lokhorst, H M', 'Bloem, A C']","['Van Driel M', 'Gunthert U', 'van Kessel AC', 'Joling P', 'Stauder R', 'Lokhorst HM', 'Bloem AC']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD44v6 antigen)', '0 (CD44v9 antigen)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Child', 'Exons/genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Plasma Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):135-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402336.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402336 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p15 (CDKN2B), p16 (CDKN2A) and p18 (CDKN2C) deletions in cyclin D1-expressing and non-expressing MM cell lines. p18 was found to be frequently deleted (38%); in some cases p18 deletions coexisted with hemizygous p16 deletion. To examine the function of p18 as a putative tumor suppressor in myeloma cells, a zinc-inducible p18 construct was stably transfected into KMS12, a MM cell line with biallelic p18 and monoallelic p16 deletions as well as cyclin D1 overexpression. Ectopic expression of p18 caused 40-45% growth suppression as determined by trypan blue exclusion and MTS assays. p18 induction also resulted in apoptosis, suggesting that inhibition of the cyclin D1/CDK/pRb pathway in these tumor cells could be a crucial step toward the induction of tumor regression via apoptotic cell death.

Analysis of the breakpoint junctions suggests that translocation derives from the fusion between normal V(D)J recombination intermediates at the IGH locus and non-V(D)J-mediated broken-ends at the BCL2 locus. So far, BCL2 broken-ends have only been observed fused to coding-ends, raising questions concerning the molecular constraints of the illegitimate joining process. Using a combination of genome walking and long-range PCR assays, we describe in this report that in 4.5% (2/44) of the t(14;18), one of the BCL2 broken-ends is fused to a signal-end. The formation of these J(H)RSS/BCL2 junctions provides direct evidence that BCL2 broken-ends are capable of joining to both products of V(D)J recombination, suggesting their presence in the RAG-mediated post-cleavage complex. In addition, junctions generated by this alternative end-joining do not involve deletion of the chromosome 14 intervening sequences generally lost in the standard translocation, providing a unique opportunity to investigate the rearrangement status of this region in the translocated IGH allele. In both cases, a DJ(H) rearrangement could be detected 5' of the J(H)-RSS/BCL2 junction. These findings, together with the previously reported bias towards the most external D(H) and J(H) segments in standard breakpoints, strongly suggest that t(14;18) preferentially occurs during an attempted secondary D(H) to J(H) rearrangement. This unusual and restricted window of differentiation opens intriguing questions concerning the etiology of the translocation.","['Marculescu, R', 'Le, T', 'Bocskor, S', 'Mitterbauer, G', 'Chott, A', 'Mannhalter, C', 'Jaeger, U', 'Nadel, B']","['Marculescu R', 'Le T', 'Bocskor S', 'Mitterbauer G', 'Chott A', 'Mannhalter C', 'Jaeger U', 'Nadel B']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Walking', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'VDJ Recombinases']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):120-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402324.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402324 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the relationship between AML cells and endothelial cells by analyzing the expression profile of angiogenic factors, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Ang-2, Tie-2 (a receptor for angiopoietins) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our results demonstrated that CD7(+)AML expressed Ang-2 mRNA frequently and integrin-family adhesion molecules (CD11c and CD18) intensively, suggesting the close correlation with endothelial cells. On the other hand, in t(8;21) AML cells, expression of Ang-2 was infrequent and expression of integrin-family adhesion molecules (CD11b, CD11c and CD18) was weak, suggesting the sparse association with endothelial cells. As for CD7(+)AML cells, despite the frequent and intense expression of endothelial cell-associated molecules (such as Ang-2, CD11c and CD18), intensity of Tie-2 expression was quite low (P < 0.05). Ang-2 expressed in CD7(+)AML cells is not considered to act in an autocrine fashion, but to work on endothelial cells to ""feed"" leukemic cells. Although Ang-2 is recognized as a natural antagonist for Tie-2, our data presented here suggested the alternative role of Ang-2 in the relationship between endothelial cells and leukemia cells, at least in a subset of leukemia such as CD7(+)AML. These results were supported by the study using AML cell lines, KG-1 (CD7 negative) and its subline KG-1a (CD7 positive); KG-1 had mRNA expression profile of Ang-1(+)Ang-2(-)Tie-2(+), while KG-1a showed Ang-1(+)Ang-2(+)Tie-2(-). These difference in the expression profile of angiogenic factors between CD7(+)AML and t(8;21)AML may explain the characteristic morphological features of these leukemias (CD7(+)AML as blastic type and t(8;21)AML as differentiative type).","['Watarai, M', 'Miwa, H', 'Shikami, M', 'Sugamura, K', 'Wakabayashi, M', 'Satoh, A', 'Tsuboi, K', 'Imamura, A', 'Mihara, H', 'Katoh, Y', 'Kita, K', 'Nitta, M']","['Watarai M', 'Miwa H', 'Shikami M', 'Sugamura K', 'Wakabayashi M', 'Satoh A', 'Tsuboi K', 'Imamura A', 'Mihara H', 'Katoh Y', 'Kita K', 'Nitta M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Aichi, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Angiopoietin-1)', '0 (Angiopoietin-2)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, TIE-2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Angiopoietin-1', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Antigens, CD7/analysis', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'CD18 Antigens/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*genetics', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptor, TIE-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):112-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402326.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402326 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these is transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), which regulates cell cycle and differentiation of hematopoietic cells, but has pleiotropic activities depending on the state of responsiveness of the target cells. It has been previously shown by us and other authors that TGF-beta1 maintains human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors in an undifferentiated state, independently of any cell cycle effects, and that depletion of TGF-beta1 triggers differentiation accompanied by a decrease in CD34 antigen expression. In the present work, we show that exogenous TGF-beta1 upregulates the human CD34 antigen in the CD34(+) cell lines TF-1 and KG-1a, but not in the more differentiated CD34(-) cell lines HL-60 and K-562. We further studied this effect in the pluripotent erythroleukemia cell line TF-1. Here, TGF-beta1 did not effect cell growth, but induced transcriptional activation of full-length CD34 and prevented differentiation induced by differentiating agents. This effect was associated with nuclear translocation of Smad-2, activation of TAK-1, and with a dramatic decrease in p38 phosphorylation. In other systems TGF-beta1 has been shown to activate a TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which in turn, activates p38. The specific inhibitor of p38 phosphorylation, SB202190, also increased CD34 RNA expression, indicating the existence of a link between p-38 inhibition by TGF-beta1 and CD34 overexpression. Our data demonstrate that TGF-beta1 transcriptionally activates CD34 and prevents differentiation of TF-1 cells by acting independently through the Smad, TAK1 and p38 pathways, and thus provide important clues for the understanding of hematopoietic development and a potential tool to modify response of hematopoietic cells to mitogens or differentiating agents.","['Marone, M', 'Scambia, G', 'Bonanno, G', 'Rutella, S', 'de Ritis, D', 'Guidi, F', 'Leone, G', 'Pierelli, L']","['Marone M', 'Scambia G', 'Bonanno G', 'Rutella S', 'de Ritis D', 'Guidi F', 'Leone G', 'Pierelli L']","['Dept of Gynecology, Catholic University, Rome Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (SMAD2 protein, human)', '0 (Smad2 Protein)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP kinase kinase kinase 7)', 'PVX798P8GI (4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)imidazole)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Smad2 Protein', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):94-105. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402334.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402334 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DLLC offer potential for use as autologous vaccines based on their ability to present putative leukaemia-specific antigens to T cells. It has been reported, however, that in around 30-50% of AML cases the leukaemia cells are not capable of undergoing DLLC differentiation. The purpose of this study was to identify the features that represent successful DLLC differentiation and, for those cases shown to be resistant to cytokine-induced differentiation, to use differentiating agents in an attempt to overcome the differentiation block. Leukaemia cells derived from 42 patients with AML were cultured in vitro with cytokines GM-CSF, IL-4 and TNFalpha/CD40L. In 22 cases the leukaemic cells underwent DLLC differentiation based on characteristic morphological changes and expression of costimulatory and dendritic cell-associated molecules. Four cases were not evaluable because of poor viability over the culture period. The remaining 16 cases failed to show evidence of DLLC differentiation. Many of these differentiation resistant cases were associated with poor risk karyotypic features. Nine of the resistant cases were selected for further study. Differentiating agents trichostatin (TSA), azacytidine (AZA) and bryostatin (BRYO) were used in combination with cytokines for the first 96 h of the culture period. Bryostatin (BRYO) alone was shown to be capable of overcoming differentiation resistance and allowing DLLC differentiation to proceed.","['Roddie, P H', 'Horton, Y', 'Turner, M L']","['Roddie PH', 'Horton Y', 'Turner ML']","['Cell Therapeutics Group, University of Edinburgh-Leukaemia Research Fund, John Hughes Bennett Laboratory, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'CD40 Ligand/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HLA-D Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-12/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Macrolides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):84-93. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402335.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402335 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of action of ajoene, however, are unknown. The present study aims to characterize the molecular events leading to ajoene-triggered apoptosis. We show here that ajoene (20 microM) leads to a time-dependent activation of caspase-3-like activity as well as to the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 and -8. Activation of caspases was necessary for ajoene-induced apoptosis since the broad-range caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk completely abrogated ajoene-mediated DNA fragmentation. Although the initiator caspase-8 was activated, the CD95 death receptor was not involved in death signaling since the HL-60 clone used was shown to express a functionally inactive CD95 receptor. Furthermore, ajoene induced the release of cytochrome c, which was not inhibited by zVAD-fmk indicating that cytochrome c release precedes caspase activation. Ajoene also led to a dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Overexpression of Bcl-x(L) clearly diminished ajoene-induced caspase activation as well as apoptosis. These results indicate that apoptosis in leukemia cells triggered by ajoene is based on the activation of a mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade which includes also the activation of the initiator caspase-8.","['Dirsch, V M', 'Antlsperger, D S M', 'Hentze, H', 'Vollmar, A M']","['Dirsch VM', 'Antlsperger DS', 'Hentze H', 'Vollmar AM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Center of Drug Research, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '99A0041VG8 (ajoene)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/analysis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Disulfides/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Permeability/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Sulfoxides', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):74-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402337.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402337 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the susceptibility of primary malignant and normal bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Extracellular domain of human TRAIL with N-terminal His(6) tag (His-TRAIL, amino acids 95-281) was produced in E. coli and its apoptosis-inducing ability was compared with the leucine-zipper containing TRAIL, LZ-TRAIL. Both variants of TRAIL had the same apoptosis-inducing ability. Clonogenic progenitor assays showed that His-TRAIL significantly reduced the number of myeloid colonies (CFU-GM) and clusters from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). His-TRAIL had no negative effect on the number of CFU-GM colonies and clusters derived from bone marrow cells of AML patients in complete remission, and lymphoma patients without bone marrow involvement, as well as those derived from normal cord blood cells. Moreover, we found that normal human stem cells treated with high doses of His-TRAIL maintain a repopulating potential when transplanted into NOD/SCID mice. To conclude, our data document that TRAIL does not affect normal human hematopoiesis but suppresses the growth of early primary leukemia and myelodysplasia progenitors.","['Plasilova, M', 'Zivny, J', 'Jelinek, J', 'Neuwirtova, R', 'Cermak, J', 'Necas, E', 'Andera, L', 'Stopka, T']","['Plasilova M', 'Zivny J', 'Jelinek J', 'Neuwirtova R', 'Cermak J', 'Necas E', 'Andera L', 'Stopka T']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (His-TRAIL protein, recombinant)', '0 (LZ-TRAIL protein, recombinant)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Graft Survival', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*drug effects', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2001/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):67-73. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402338.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402338 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD19, like CD20, is an antigen expressed on the surface of cells of the B lineage, and CD19 may provide an alternative target for radioimmunotherapy of B cell neoplasms. CD19 has been largely overlooked as a target for conventional 131I RIT, because the antigen rapidly internalizes upon binding of antibody, resulting in catabolism and significant release of 131I. Such modulation may be an advantage to RIT with radiometals such as 90Y, 177Lu, 213Bi and 225Ac. Herein, we have compared beta(-) particle RIT with antibodies targeting either CD19 or CD20. The anti-CD19 and anti-CD20 antibodies, B4 or C2B8, respectively, were appended with the SCN-CHX-A''-DTPA bifunctional chelating agent and labeled with 90Y. In the tumor model used, there were three times as many CD20 target sites on lymphoma cells as compared to CD19 sites (62000 vs 20000 binding sites, respectively). We compared the efficacy of the 90Y-labeled antibodies to reduce lymphoma in a nude mouse xenograft solid tumor model, after measurable lymphoma appeared. Reduction in tumor size began at day 3 in all three 90Y-treated groups, but tumor began to recur in many animals 9 days after the treatments. There was one cure in each specific treatment group. In contrast, the tumor in the two control groups showed no regression. There was a significant prolongation of median survival time from xenograft (P < 0.0001) in all the 90Y-labeled antibody construct-treated groups (32 days for 0.15 mCi 90Y-B4; 26 days for 0.20 mCi 90Y-C2B8, and 23 days for 0.15 mCi 90Y-C2B8) in comparison to the two control groups (11 days for 0.02 mg of C2B8 and 9 days for untreated growth controls). Specificity of the radioimmunotherapy was also shown. In conclusion, 90Y-labeled anti-CD19 antibody has efficacy comparable to 90Y-labeled anti-CD20 antibody in the treatment of mice bearing human lymphoma xenografts. These data suggest that CD19-targeted RIT merits further study.","['Ma, D', 'McDevitt, M R', 'Barendswaard, E', 'Lai, L', 'Curcio, M J', 'Pellegrini, V', 'Brechbiel, M W', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Ma D', 'McDevitt MR', 'Barendswaard E', 'Lai L', 'Curcio MJ', 'Pellegrini V', 'Brechbiel MW', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['P01 CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Yttrium Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Radioimmunotherapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/transplantation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Yttrium Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):60-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402320.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402320 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in 17 of these samples HM-FISH detected BCR-ABL(+) metaphases (0.3-11%), and in eight cases CA detected Ph(+) metaphases (2.5-25%). A comparison of IP-FISH performed on uncultivated cells vs cells cultivated for 48 h in 70 cases revealed a higher proportion of BCR-ABL+ cells in the cultivated samples. If nested PCR was negative, all other methods were negative in all cases too. In addition, 94 cases were evaluated using real-time PCR (LightCycler technology). The BCR-ABL/cABL ratio measured showed a high correlation with all other methods. Interestingly, a wide range in the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio was observed especially in patients who showed 100% Ph-positive metaphases in CA.

The effect of CD5 ligation on apoptosis was studied in 27 newly diagnosed patients with B-CLL, in relation to the expression of surface IgM (sIgM), CD79b, CD38, CD72 and CD19. B cells from 15 patients (group I) were resistant to anti-CD5-induced apoptosis, whereas apoptosis above spontaneous levels was seen in the remaining 12 studied (group II). Group II was then subdivided on the basis of differences in the time required to reach maximum apoptosis: whilst B cells from seven patients underwent apoptosis by 18 h, those from the remaining five needed 36 h to apoptose. The expression of sIgM, CD5, CD79b and CD38 was higher in group II than group I, suggesting that signaling for apoptosis might operate via CD79, and that CD38 expression was required. As shown by flow cytometry and confirmed by Western blotting, apoptosis was associated with a decrease in the ratios of Bcl-2/Bax and Bcl(XL)/Bax, due to an increase in the level of Bax, but no change in that of Bcl-2. This heterogeneous apoptotic response to CD5 ligation offers an explanation for the incomplete success of anti-CD5 monoclonal therapy, and might help identify patients who would respond to such treatment.","['Pers, J O', 'Berthou, C', 'Porakishvili, N', 'Burdjanadze, M', 'Le Calvez, G', 'Abgrall, J F', 'Lydyard, P M', 'Youinou, P', 'Jamin, C']","['Pers JO', 'Berthou C', 'Porakishvili N', 'Burdjanadze M', 'Le Calvez G', 'Abgrall JF', 'Lydyard PM', 'Youinou P', 'Jamin C']","['Institut de Synergie des Sciences et de la Sante, Brest University Medical School, Brest, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD5 Antigens/immunology/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):44-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402327.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402327 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested this hypothesis in resting B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) lymphocytes, after firstly characterizing unscheduled DNA synthesis occurring in these cells. We observed that the spontaneous incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine (dThd) into DNA of B-CLL cells was not completely inhibitable by hydroxyurea (HU) which blocks DNA replication. In addition, in the presence of HU, dThd incorporation could be upregulated by UVC radiation or DNA alkylation, without re-entry of the cells into S phase. CdA was found to inhibit both spontaneous and upregulated DNA synthesis in B-CLL cells. Phosphorylation of CdA was essential to exert this effect. We finally observed a strong synergistic cytotoxicity between UV light and CdA, which was correlated with activation of caspase-3 and high molecular weight DNA fragmentation, two markers of apoptosis. Taken together, these observations indicate that in B-CLL cells CdA inhibits unscheduled DNA synthesis which represents the polymerizing step of a repair process responsive to DNA aggression. Inhibition of this process by CdA, together with a combined activation of the apoptotic proteolytic cascade by CdA and UV, may explain their synergistic cytotoxicity.","['Van Den Neste, E', 'Cardoen, S', 'Husson, B', 'Rosier, J-F', 'Delacauw, A', 'Ferrant, A', 'Van den Berghe, G', 'Bontemps, F']","['Van Den Neste E', 'Cardoen S', 'Husson B', 'Rosier JF', 'Delacauw A', 'Ferrant A', 'Van den Berghe G', 'Bontemps F']","['Laboratory of Physiological Chemistry, Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology (ICP), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/pharmacology', 'Alkylation', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/analysis', 'Cladribine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prodrugs/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):36-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402331.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402331 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to determine whether mRNA levels of Mdm-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Bad, and Bax are independent prognostic parameters for outcome. Transcript levels were analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in 232 samples collected either at diagnosis or following induction chemotherapy (ICT). Multivariate COX regression analysis adjusted for chemotherapy protocol, de novo vs secondary AML, and de novo vs relapsed AML indicated: (1) At diagnosis, high expression of Bad (P = 0.015) and even more so high Bax and Bad levels (P = 0.018) predicted adverse outcome, regardless of the response to ICT. In patients who subsequently failed to enter complete remission (CR), high levels of Bad, Bax and Bax high/Bad high were associated with an increased relative risk (RR) to die from tumor (RR = 5.0 for Bad, 3.4 for Bax and 6.14 for Bax high/Bad high). (2) Following ICT, high expression of Bax (P= 0.005) and high Bcl-2/Bax ratios (P = 0.004) were independent predictors of unfavorable outcome, regardless of response to ICT. We conclude that high levels of Bax and Bad correlate with poor outcome, particularly in patients who do not enter CR and may serve as prognostic markers in AML.","['Kohler, T', 'Schill, C', 'Deininger, M W', 'Krahl, R', 'Borchert, S', 'Hasenclever, D', 'Leiblein, S', 'Wagner, O', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Kohler T', 'Schill C', 'Deininger MW', 'Krahl R', 'Borchert S', 'Hasenclever D', 'Leiblein S', 'Wagner O', 'Niederwieser D']","['Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, Division of Molecular Diagnostics, University of Leipzig Medical School, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Computer Systems', 'Female', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):22-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402340.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402340 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persisting MC is defined as MC for more than 2 years in patients without any evidence of relapse. Median leukemia-free survival in these patients was 150 (range, 50-218) months. Diagnoses were ALL (n= 10); AML (n = 2); CML (n = 2); NHL (n = 2); MDS (n= 1); MM (n = 1) and SAA (n = 1). Purpose of this study was the long-term follow-up of MC and definition of patterns of chimerism in the various subsets of PBMCs and granulocytes. Using a PCR-STR technique CD3(+)/CD4(+) (T4 lymphocytes), CD3(+)/CD8(+) (T8 lymphocytes), CD45(+)/CD19(+) (B lymphocytes), CD45(+)/CD14(+) (monocytes), CD45(+)/CD15(+) (granulocytes) and CD3(-)/CD56(+) (NK-cells) were analyzed. The majority of patients with persisting MC were conditioned with a less intensive conditioning regimen and had little GVHD. Sequential monitoring of the chimerism resulted in a group of patients (n = 7) with very slow transient mixed chimerism that resulted in complete DC after median 7 years. Another nine patients had a relatively high percentage of persisting autologous cells for a median of 12 years and in three patients we observed a stable low percentage of autologous cells. Only two out of 19 patients (AML-CR1, CML-CP1) relapsed during follow-up. Both patients had a relatively high percentage of autologous cells. Chimerism in granulocytes and PBMC subsets was analyzed at a median of 8 years after SCT in nine patients. In five patients mixed chimerism simultaneously detected by RCP and CYT was associated with MC in all subsets. Within each individual patient the percentages of donor and recipient cells were very different between the different subsets. Two CML-CP1 patients were mixed chimera in only two subsets and in one patient these subsets represented pending relapse. In another two patients mixed chimerism with a very low number of autologous red cells was not found in the PBMCs because of the different sensitivity level of the RCP and the PCR-STR technique. We conclude that in patients with persisting mixed chimerism after partially T cell-depleted SCT a remarkable number of patients had lymphoid malignancies, the majority of the patients were conditioned with less intensive conditioning regimens and the mixed chimerism was not correlated with relapse. Chimerism in granulocytes and PBMC subsets did show great intra-individual differences in the subsets and these data correlated well with RCP and CYT data with the exception of the NK cells.","['Schaap, N', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Mensink, E', 'Preijers, F', 'Hillegers, M', 'Knops, R', 'Pennings, A', 'Boezeman, J', 'Geurts van Kessel, A', 'de Pauw, B', 'de Witte, T']","['Schaap N', 'Schattenberg A', 'Mensink E', 'Preijers F', 'Hillegers M', 'Knops R', 'Pennings A', 'Boezeman J', 'Geurts van Kessel A', 'de Pauw B', 'de Witte T']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Survival', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2002 Jan;16(1):13-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402343.,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2402343 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For these patients this technique highlighted a new, recurring and cryptic translocation t(5;14)(q35;q32) in childhood T-ALL which might be phenotypically restricted. The most innovative part of this technique is the use of interspersed polymerase chain reaction (IRS-PCR) painting probes that show an R-band pattern simultaneous with the combinatorial labeling. Contrary to the DOP-PCR, IRS-PCR-derived probes provide stronger hybridization signals at the telomeric ends that potentially increase the possibility of detecting cryptic translocations. All the IPM-FISH findings were validated by FISH with whole chromosome painting and unique sequence probes. These results demonstrate the efficient use of IPM-FISH as an improved, single-step method for the identification of cryptic chromosomal abnormalities.

PCR results combined with the blast counts from 21 leukemia patients were analyzed. Complete chimerism (100% donor cells) was found in 15 cases with remission, and incomplete chimerism in six cases with relapse. In the majority of cases, complete chimerism was always associated with no detectable blasts, while blasts were often detected in association with incomplete chimerism. There is significant correlation (P<0.0001) between the percentage of donor DNA and blast percentage in these patients. Early detection of incomplete chimerism may therefore predict a poor prognosis. In one patient (case 15), a differing percentage of donor DNA was observed between samples of bone marrow and peripheral blood collected on the same day. This may be due to the fact that allogeneic stem cells proliferate at different rates depending on their environment (bone marrow or peripheral blood). In addition, 100% donor cells found in the peripheral blood may not reflect the number of cells in the bone marrow. In case 17, asynchronous engraftment of donor cells was present between the white and red blood cell lineages, indicating that the degree of chimerism may not be the same in all cell lineages.

We have previously demonstrated that the proto-oncogene TCL1 is an Akt kinase coactivator. TCL1 binds to Akt and mediates the formation of oligomeric TCL1-Akt high-molecular-weight protein complexes in vivo. Within these protein complexes, Akt is preferentially phosphorylated and activated. The MTCP1/TCL1/TCL1b oncogene activation is the hallmark of human T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), a form of adult leukemia. In the present study, using a PCR-generated random TCL1 library combined with a yeast two-hybrid screening detecting loss of interaction, we identified D16 and I74 as amino acid residues mediating the association of TCL1 with Akt. Based on molecular modeling, we determined that the beta C-sheet of TCL1 is essential for TCL1 homodimerization. Studies with mammalian overexpression systems demonstrated that both Akt association and oligomerization domains of TCL1 are distinct functional domains. In vitro kinase assays and overexpression experiments in mammalian cells demonstrated that both TCL1-Akt interaction and oligomerization of TCL1 were required for TCL1-induced Akt activation and substrate phosphorylation. Assays for mitochondrial permeability transition, nuclear translocation, and cell recovery demonstrated that both Akt association and homodimerization of TCL1 are similarly needed for the full function of TCL1 as an Akt kinase coactivator in vivo. The results demonstrate the structural basis of TCL1-induced activation of Akt, which causes human T-PLL.","['Kunstle, Gerald', 'Laine, Jarmo', 'Pierron, Gaelle', 'Kagami Si, Shin-ichiro', 'Nakajima, Hiroshi', 'Hoh, Francois', 'Roumestand, Christian', 'Stern, Marc-Henri', 'Noguchi, Masayuki']","['Kunstle G', 'Laine J', 'Pierron G', 'Kagami Si S', 'Nakajima H', 'Hoh F', 'Roumestand C', 'Stern MH', 'Noguchi M']","['Division of Immunology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCL1A protein, human)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Humans', 'Isoleucine', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt']",PMC134690,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/04/03 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2002 Mar;22(5):1513-25. doi: 10.1128/MCB.22.5.1513-1525.2002.,,,['10.1128/MCB.22.5.1513-1525.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have designated this gene Clg (common-site lymphoma/leukemia guanine nucleotide exchange factor). Proviral integrations on chromosome 7 at Evi24 are located 7.6-10.3 kb upstream of Clg and increased Clg expression 2-5-fold compared with leukemias lacking proviral integrations at Evi24. Clg contains Dbl/pleckstrin homology domains with substantial sequence homology to many Rho family activators, including the transforming Dbl and Dbs/Ost oncogenes. Nucleotide exchange assays indicated that Clg specifically activated nucleotide exchange on Cdc42, but not RhoA or Rac1, in vitro.

However, leukemic cells from a subset of CLL patients are relatively resistant to treatment with the PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, particularly when this drug is used in the absence of an adenylate cyclase stimulus such as forskolin. Elevated cAMP levels induce compensatory up-regulation of several cyclic nucleotide PDE families in other model systems. We here examine the hypothesis that CLL cells that survive treatment with rolipram do so as a result of residual PDE activity that is not inhibited by this drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined by Western analysis the effect of rolipram treatment on CLL expression of PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4D, and PDE7A. We also examined the ability of rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) or cilostamide (PDE3 inhibitor), alone or together, to induce apoptosis or elevate cyclic AMP in leukemic cells from patients with CLL. RESULTS: Rolipram increased levels of PDE4B and, to a variable extent, PDE4D. When combined with forskolin, rolipram also increased levels of a second family of PDEs, PDE3B. Addition of the specific PDE3 inhibitor, cilostamide, modestly augmented rolipram-induced apoptosis in five of seven ""rolipram-resistant"" CLL samples. CONCLUSIONS: Although this work confirms that PDE4 appears to be the most important PDE target for induction of apoptosis in CLL, combination therapy with PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors or use of dual-selective drugs may be of benefit in a subset of relatively PDE4-inhibitor resistant CLL patients.","['Moon, Eunyi', 'Lee, Richard', 'Near, Richard', 'Weintraub, Lewis', 'Wolda, Sharon', 'Lerner, Adam']","['Moon E', 'Lee R', 'Near R', 'Weintraub L', 'Wolda S', 'Lerner A']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology and Oncology, Boston Medical Center, 650 Albany Street, Boston, MA 02118, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 79838/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Quinolones)', '45S5605Q18 (cilostamide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', ""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 7)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE3B protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE4A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE4B protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE4D protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.17 (PDE7A protein, human)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis"", '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 3', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4', 'Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 7', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quinolones/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rolipram/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/05/29 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Feb;8(2):589-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a panel of dexamethasone and chemotherapy-resistant MM cell lines, we examined growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis, and changes in the redox state by As(2)O(3) alone or after preincubation with BSO. RESULTS: Whereas the sensitive cell lines showed 100% killing at 0.5 micromol/liter of As(2)O(3), the resistant cell lines required BSO pretreatment to achieve 100% killing at this dose. By comparison, the peak As(2)O(3) plasma concentration in acute promyelocytic leukemia in patients successfully treated was 5-7 micromol/liter with rapid decline to a sustained level of 1-2 micromol/liter. We demonstrated that BSO and As(2)O(3)-induced cytotoxicity was attributable to induction of apoptosis accompanied by activation of the death signals: caspases 3, 8, and 9. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that growth inhibition of highly resistant MM cell lines by As(2)O(3) is facilitated by BSO and that this effect is accompanied by caspase activation, presumably leading to activation of apoptosis. These data indicate that steroid and chemotherapy-resistant MM cell lines can be overcome by manipulation of the cellular redox state. Because BSO and As(2)O(3) can be used at clinically relevant concentrations, we believe that our observations may have important implications for the treatment of MM.","['Gartenhaus, Ronald B', 'Prachand, Sheila N', 'Paniaqua, Mary', 'Li, Yuyu', 'Gordon, Leo I']","['Gartenhaus RB', 'Prachand SN', 'Paniaqua M', 'Li Y', 'Gordon LI']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. r-gartenhaus@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Steroids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/*pathology', '*Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Steroids/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/05/29 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2002 Feb;8(2):566-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular VEGF levels were significantly lower in pediatric AML compared to adult AML patients. In contrast, there was no significant difference in VEGF-R2 levels between adult and pediatric AML. Higher VEGF and VEGF-R2 levels in pediatric AML patients correlated with higher white blood cell (WBC).

High dose methylprednisolone treatment has been shown to induce in vivo and in vitro differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells to mature granulocytes in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has been confirmed to have remission induction effects on APL. However, there are conflicting results on the effects with other AML subtypes. Also, it has been well established that the reversible phosphorylation of proteins is a major regulatory mechanism in the signal transduction pathways that control cell growth and differentiation. Serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PP) are major components of phosphorylation. In this study, we investigated the effect of As(2)O(3) on HL 60 and K 562 myeloid leukemic differentiation and compared the signalling cascades of the two inducers with respect to serine/threonine PP 1 and 2A. We utilised PP1 and PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A. In contrast to methylprednisolone, there was no effect of phosphatase inhibitors on As(2)O(3)-induced leukemic differentiation. Incomplete leukemic differentiation occurred with lower As(2)O(3) concentration as 10(-6)M. Unlike As(2)O(3), methylprednisolone induced complete granulocytic and/or monocytic differentiation of HL 60 and K 562 cells via upregulation of PP2A regulatory subunits. Therefore, As(2)O(3) and methylprednisolone are promising agents that have the potential to be used together in myeloid leukemic differentiation therapy.","['Yuksel, Safak', 'Saydam, Guray', 'Uslu, Ruchan', 'Sanli, Ulus Ali', 'Terzioglu, Ender', 'Buyukececi, Filiz', 'Omay, Serdar Bedii']","['Yuksel S', 'Saydam G', 'Uslu R', 'Sanli UA', 'Terzioglu E', 'Buyukececi F', 'Omay SB']","['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Ege University, Bornova, 35100 Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Methylprednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/05/02 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/02 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2002 Apr;26(4):391-8. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00147-3.,,,"['S0145212601001473 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00147-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Autologous BMSFs in AML were isolated from the stromal layers of long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) using immunomagnetic beads. BMSFs exhibited rapid proliferation even in the absence of growth factors. Cultures stimulated with bFGF produced significantly increased numbers of BMSFs than cultures without added growth factors. Using LNC/LacZ retroviral vector, the transduction efficiency of BMSFs was 13+/-4% at a 5 multiplicity of infection (MOI). LNC/interleukin-2 (IL-2)-transduced BMSFs produced between 1200 and 4800pg of IL-2/10(6) cells per 24h. Using adenoviral vector AdV/LacZ, the transduction efficiency was 84+/-10% at 100, and 92+/-8% at a MOI of 1000. Although the addition of basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor did not affect the transduction efficiency, they increased the numbers of transduced cells significantly (P<0.01). AdV/IL-2-treated BMSFs produced high levels of IL-2 over the course of 7 days between 9820 and 22,700pg of IL-2/10(6) cells per 24h.

The bad news is that about one-third of the cell lines are either cross-contaminated or mycoplasma-infected or both. The good news is that there are means to recognize and overcome these problems. In cases where, during attempts to establish new LL cell lines, primary LL cultures are cross-contaminated with continuous cell lines, intended new cell lines simply cannot be established (""early"" cross-contamination). In cases of ""late"" cross-contamination of existing LL cell lines where the intrusive cells have a growth advantage, the original (""uncontaminated"") cell lines may still be available elsewhere. DNA fingerprinting and cytogenetic analysis appear to be the most suitable approaches to detect cross-contaminations and to authenticate LL cell lines. A different but related aspect of ""false"" LL cell lines is the frequent misclassification of cell lines whereby the actual cell type of the cell line does not correspond to the purported model character of the cell line.

For instance, the plus-strand RNA of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is A-rich, and the genome of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is C-rich, and other retroviruses have a U-rich or G-rich genome. The biased composition of these genomes is most likely caused by directional mutational pressure of the respective reverse transcriptase enzymes. Using a set of retroviral genomes with a distinct nucleotide composition, we performed skew analyses of the nucleotide bias along the complete viral genome. Distinct nucleotide signatures were apparent, and these typical patterns were generally conserved across the viral genome. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this typical nucleotide bias, combined with a profound discrimination against the CpG dinucleotide sequence, strongly influences the codon usage of the retroviruses in a direct manner, and their amino acid usage in an indirect manner. The fact that both codon usage and amino acid usage are so closely entwined with the genome composition has important practical implications. For instance, the typical trends in nucleotide usage could influence the molecular phylogenetic reconstruction of the family Retroviridae.","['Berkhout, Ben', 'Grigoriev, Andrei', 'Bakker, Margreet', 'Lukashov, Vladimir V']","['Berkhout B', 'Grigoriev A', 'Bakker M', 'Lukashov VV']","['Department of Human Retrovirology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands. b.berkhout@amc.uva.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acids', 'Animals', '*Codon', 'CpG Islands', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nucleotides', 'Phylogeny', '*RNA, Viral', 'Retroviridae/classification/*genetics']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/05/09 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2002 Jan 20;18(2):133-41. doi: 10.1089/08892220252779674.,,,['10.1089/08892220252779674 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is therefore used in some departments as prophylaxis against infections with both bacteria and Pneumocystis carinii. The use of TMP/SMX for prophylaxis during the induction therapy is not uniform in the four departments of paediatric oncology in Denmark. This gave us the opportunity to describe the effect of TMP/SMX on bacterial infections in children with ALL during the induction therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1997, 210 children were diagnosed with ALL in Denmark. From a retrospective review of the medical charts, the number of children with fever (> 38 degrees C), the number of febrile days, days of antibiotic treatment, and the number of positive blood cultures were registered for each febrile episode. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen children received TMP/SMX prophylaxis (10-30 mg/SMX/kg/day) and 76 did not. Children who received TMP/SMX prophylaxis had significantly fewer episodes of fever (66/114 (58%) vs. 60/76 (79%), p < 0.01) and significantly fewer children who received the prophylaxis had positive blood cultures before the start of antibiotic treatment compared with children who did not receive prophylaxis (23/114 (20%) vs 37/76 (49%), p < 0.001)). Nineteen different species were isolated from the blood stream before the start of antibiotic treatment. In the non-prophylaxis group there were a preponderance of isolates with Staph. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. There was no difference in the mortality between the two groups (p = 0.44). There were no cases of P. carinii pneumonia in the period of induction therapy. DISCUSSION: TMP/SMX prophylaxis during induction therapy for childhood ALL seems to reduce the risk of bacteraemias and febrile illness.","['Agger, Kirstine E', 'Schroder, Henrik', 'Rosthoj, Steen', 'Carlsen, Niels Torp', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Agger KE', 'Schroder H', 'Rosthoj S', 'Carlsen NT', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Arhus Universitetshospital, Skejby Sygehus, borneonkologisk afdeling, DK-8200 Arhus N.']",['dan'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control', 'Pneumocystis Infections/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2002 Jan 21;164(4):488-92.,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol som antibakteriel profylakse under induktionsbehandling af born med akut lymfatisk leukaemi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New therapeutic principles, course and prognosis].",479-82,"The treatment of the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has formerly been supportive, primarily blood transfusions. Treatment with the growth factor erythropoietin, in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor is accompanied by a decline in the need for blood transfusions in about 40% of the patients. Likewise, the risk of infections is reduced. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine and antithymocyte globulin is also capable of improving the cytopenia in about 50% of the patients. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is the only possibility of cure in MDS, but the procedure is associated with high mortality. This treatment modality is therefore only recommended for younger patients, who are in a complete remission after being treated for acute myeloid leukaemia or are otherwise in a high risk group. The prognosis is poor, with an overall median survival of about 15 months. A simple scoring system has been elaborated and is based upon the percentage of myeloblasts in the bone marrow, a chromosomal analysis, and the number of cell lines with cytopenia. This system is able to distinguish between three distinct groups of patients with a highly different prognosis (low, intermediate, high risk), which is also of importance when evaluating the best treatment for the individual patient.","['Hasselbalch, Hans Carl', 'Juhl, Birgitte Ravn', 'Hansen, Per Boye']","['Hasselbalch HC', 'Juhl BR', 'Hansen PB']","['Medicinsk afdeling, Amtssygehuset Roskilde, DK-4000 Roskilde.']",['dan'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/therapeutic use', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2002 Jan 21;164(4):479-82.,"Det myelodysplastiske syndrom.

Known provoking factors for the disease are chemicals (benzene), previous treatment with alkylating agents, and radioactive irradiation. The pathogenesis involves an acquired lesion of the pluripotent haematopoietic stem cell with the evolution of a (pre-)malignant cell clone with an increased proliferation potential, but, in addition, severe dysplasia with ineffective haematopoiesis. An increased intramedullary production of various cytokines that inhibit haematopoiesis, including tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), may be responsible for the accelerated cell death (apoptosis). An increasing genetic instability during the course of the disease causes progression of the cytopenia with anaemia, infections, and bleeding. Autoimmune diseases may be seen. The disease often progresses to acute myeloid leukaemia. A chromosomal analysis is important, as 40-50% of the patients have chromosomal changes at the time of diagnosis. Differential diagnostic considerations include temporary dysplasia provoked by medical or toxic agents, B12 or folate deficiency, infectious bone marrow involvement (HIV, CMV infection), chronic alcoholism, aplastic anaemia, and myelofibrosis.","['Hasselbalch, Hans Carl', 'Juhl, Birgitte Ravn', 'Hansen, Per Boye']","['Hasselbalch HC', 'Juhl BR', 'Hansen PB']","['Medicinsk afdeling, Amtssygehuset Roskilde, DK-4000 Roskilde.']",['dan'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/diagnosis/etiology/genetics']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 2002 Jan 21;164(4):476-9.,"Det myelodysplastiske syndrom.

The N-terminal amino acid sequence of rhTRAP was identical to that of TRAP purified from osteoclastoma and hairy cell leukemia spleen. The monoclonal antibodies generated against rhTRAP also reacted to human placental TRAP (pTRAP). The optimum pH of rhTRAP and pTRAP were pH 5.0-5.5 and pH 6.0-6.5, respectively. The enzymatic activities of rhTRAP and pTRAP were activated by reducing agents such as 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol and ascorbic acid. The activities of rhTRAP and pTRAP were enhanced by Fe2+ ions, but were inhibited by Fe3+ ions. The present results indicate that rhTRAP has similar properties to the native human TRAP, and suggest that the enhancement of TRAP activity by reducing agents might be expressed via the reduction of Fe ions at the metal center.","['Miyazaki, S', 'Igarashi, M', 'Nagata, A', 'Komoda, T']","['Miyazaki S', 'Igarashi M', 'Nagata A', 'Komoda T']","['Immunology Laboratory, Diagnostic Department, Yamasa Corporation, Choshi, Japan. miyazaki@yamasa.com']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol,Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,7909595,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Reducing Agents)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acp5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Adult', 'Amino Acids/analysis/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Insecta/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Osteosarcoma/*enzymology', 'Placenta/*enzymology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Reducing Agents/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase']",,2002/02/13 10:00,2002/07/24 10:01,['2002/02/13 10:00'],"['2002/02/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/24 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/13 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 2001 Oct;23(8):433-9. doi: 10.1358/mf.2001.23.8.662130.,,,"['662130 [pii]', '10.1358/mf.2001.23.8.662130 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, HL-60 cells undergo rapid apoptosis upon treatment with TBF, as indicated by increased annexin V binding capacity and caspase 3 activation with flow cytometric analysis.

DESIGN: Prospective study of 61 client-owned cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma subjected to multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. PROCEDURE: An accepted chemotherapy protocol utilising l-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate and prednisolone was modified and used to treat 60 cats with lymphosarcoma. Clinical findings were recorded before and during therapy. As far as practical, cases were followed to death, euthanasia or apparent cure. Owner satisfaction with the results of chemotherapy was determined using a questionnaire sent after the completion of chemotherapy. RESULTS: One cat, with lymphosarcoma limited to a single mandibular lymph node, was treated using surgery alone and was cured. The other 60 cats were treated using multi-agent chemotherapy, although seven cats with localised intestinal, ocular and subcutaneous lesions had these lesions partially (2 intestinal lesions) or completely (2 eyes, 2 intestinal lesions and a cluster of regional lymph nodes) resected prior to starting chemotherapy. The median survival time for these 60 cats was 116 days. Of the 60 cats, 48 rapidly went into complete remission following the administration of 1-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone (complete remission rate 80%) and these cats had a median survival of 187 days. Three cats were censored from further analysis as their long-term survival data were uninterpretable because they died of causes unrelated to lymphosarcoma or were prematurely lost to follow-up. Twenty cats were classed as 'long-term survivors' based on survival time in excess of one year and at least 14 were 'cured' based on the absence of physical evidence of lymphosarcoma 2-years after initiating treatment. In other words, of the 48 cats that reached complete remission, in excess of 29% were 'cured'. Despite detailed analysis, few meaningful prognostic indicators based on patient or tumour characteristics were identified, although long-term survivors were more likely to be less than 4-years (P= 0.04) and to have tumours of the T-cell phenotype (P= 0.06). Excluding the one FeLV ELISA-positive cat with mediastinal LSA, 7 of 9 cats less than 4 years-of-age were long-term survivors (median survival time >1271 days). There was a strong association between achieving complete remission and long-term survival (P = 0.003). On the basis of 27 replies to a questionnaire, owners were generally very satisfied with the response to chemotherapy, irrespective of the survival time of the individual patient. Eighty five percent of owners expressed complete satisfaction with their decision to pursue chemotherapy and 70% believed their cat's health status improved during the first 2-weeks of treatment. Importantly, 78% of owners considered that chemotherapy required a very substantial time commitment on their part. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to cure approximately one quarter of cats with lymphosarcoma using sequential multi-agent chemotherapy and/or surgery. FeLV-negative cats younger than 4 years (typically with mediastinal lymphosarcoma) had a particularly favourable prognosis. The decision to embark on chemotherapy should be based on the results of induction chemotherapy with l-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone, as the response to this was a good predictor of long-term survival. Cats surviving the first 16 weeks of chemotherapy generally enjoyed robust remissions (in excess of 1 year) or were cured of their malignancy.","['Malik, R', 'Gabor, L J', 'Foster, S F', 'McCorkell, B E', 'Canfield, P J']","['Malik R', 'Gabor LJ', 'Foster SF', 'McCorkell BE', 'Canfield PJ']","['Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, New South Wales.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cat Diseases/*drug therapy/mortality/*surgery/virology', 'Cats', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/surgery/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'New South Wales', 'Patient Satisfaction', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2001 Dec;79(12):808-17. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb10923.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb10923.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Obesity defined indirectly from indices of height and weight, has been described in long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and hypothesised to be a consequence of previous cranial irradiation. PROCEDURE: In this study, measures of whole and regional body composition using skinfold and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) measurements have been made in 35 long-term survivors of ALL who had received cranial irradiation and chemotherapy. To assess the influence of cranial irradiation, results were compared with those obtained in 21 children treated for other malignancies, who received chemotherapy alone and with 31 healthy sibling controls. RESULTS: Girls treated for ALL were significantly fatter than those treated for other malignancies or healthy control siblings whether measured by skinfold thickness (median (range) 37.4% (17.9-41.3) vs. 24.6% (19.1-35.0) and 28.8% (19.6-43.1), respectively, P<0.01) or DEXA (33.5% (20.5-42.8) vs. 25.5% (16.5-31.0) and 24.5% (18.8-53.6), respectively, P<0.01). Boys treated for ALL were not significantly fatter than boys in the other two groups. Measures of whole body percent fat derived from DEXA were persistently less than those derived from skinfold measurements with a mean (95% CI) difference of 2.4% (1.7-3.1, P<0.001) for all groups combined. In ALL survivors, using regression equations for skinfold thicknesses derived from controls with DEXA as the 'gold standard' method, fat mass was significantly overestimated. CONCLUSION: Female survivors of ALL are significantly fatter than those of other malignancies and healthy sibling controls. Caution should be observed in the application of published equations, derived from the normal population, for the calculation of body composition in children treated for ALL. The mechanism of onset of obesity remains unclear, but is probably multifactorial and related to previous cranial irradiation.","['Warner, Justin T', 'Evans, William D', 'Webb, David K H', 'Gregory, John W']","['Warner JT', 'Evans WD', 'Webb DK', 'Gregory JW']","['Department of Paediatrics, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. justin.warner@orh.anglox.nhs.uk']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anthropometry/methods', 'Body Composition/*radiation effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sex Distribution', 'Skinfold Thickness', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survivors', 'Wales/epidemiology']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Mar;38(3):165-72. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1304.,,,"['10.1002/mpo.1304 [pii]', '10.1002/mpo.1304 [doi]']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These factors also assist in the selection of patients more likely to benefit from intensive treatments, especially in the context of clinical trials. Recently it has become clear that prognostic factors may have an additional benefit: they may provide insight into the biology of the cancer being studied and lead to improved understanding of the molecular pathogenesis. For malignant mesothelioma, the prognostic scoring systems of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) are the most useful of those currently available. These systems rate performance status, age, histological subtype, weight loss, and hematological parameters as the best prognostic factors for malignant mesothelioma. In the future, biological markers may provide additional information on mesothelioma and will help in prognostication.","['Steele, Jeremy P C']",['Steele JP'],"[""Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, England.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,,IM,"['Humans', 'Mesothelioma/*mortality/therapy', 'Pleural Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 2002 Feb;29(1):36-40. doi: 10.1053/sonc.2002.30299.,,26,"['S0093775402500579 [pii]', '10.1053/sonc.2002.30299 [doi]']",['Copyright 2002 by W.B.

Moreover, some authors reported that PTX suppresses spontaneous cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in vitro. It could influence the mechanism of killing target cells by PBMC. For this reason we evaluated the influence of PTX on spontaneous cytotoxicity of PBMC against K562 and CaSki cell lines. Subsequently, we compared this effect to that evoked by dexamethasone, one of the most effective anti-inflammatory drugs. Our study revealed that PTX inhibits natural cytotoxicity preferentially through inhibition of perforin-mediated cell membrane damage, without a statistically significant influence on apoptosis induction. Furthermore, pentoxifylline inhibits natural cytotoxicity as effectively as dexamethasone. However, the result of PTX inhibitory influence is observed much earlier than that of dexamethasone. Currently PTX is commonly used in diseases that occur more frequently in elderly patients. We suggest that PTX, inhibiting perforin-dependent PBMC cytotoxic activity, could weaken anti-cancer action of immune system thus accelerating the progress of neoplasm formation in these patients.","['Lazarczyk, M', 'Grzela, T', 'Korczak-Kowalska, G', 'Niderla, J', 'Oldak, M', 'Jozwiak, J', 'Skopinski, P']","['Lazarczyk M', 'Grzela T', 'Korczak-Kowalska G', 'Niderla J', 'Oldak M', 'Jozwiak J', 'Skopinski P']","['Department of Histology and Embryology, Center of Biostructure Research, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0R0008Q3JB (Chromium)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Chromium/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Pentoxifylline/*pharmacology', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/05/23 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2002 Mar-Apr;9(2):423-6. doi: 10.3892/or.9.2.423.,,,['10.3892/or.9.2.423 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are of particular interest in the search for new prognostic and therapeutic approaches in cancer. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) the amount of ""tumour mass"" at diagnosis can exceed 1 kg. To understand the endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine potential of the malignant transformed progenitor cells, the ability of these cells to express components of the IGF system needs to be investigated. AIM: To characterise the expression pattern of genes of the IGF system in malignant lymphoblasts of children suffering from ALL. METHODS: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of Ficoll separated mononuclear cells from 142 children with ALL, 127 cord blood samples, and 55 blood samples of age matched controls were studied. RESULTS: The expression of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein 5 (IGFBP-5), and CTGF (IGFBP-rP2) was seen in a higher proportion of mononuclear cells of patients with ALL than in controls. Patients with ALL who were in continuous remission had a lower percentage of IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 expressing mononuclear cells at diagnosis than did those who developed a relapse. Only malignant lymphoblasts of B cell origin showed expression of CTGF (IGFBP-rP2). Malignant lymphoblasts of T cell origin more often expressed IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-5, whereas IGF-II and IGFBP-3 expression was seen more often in lymphoblasts of B cell origin. CONCLUSIONS: Malignant lymphoblasts of patients with ALL express components of the IGF system and therefore promote their own growth in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner. Whether these components will be useful as prognostic factors in the stratification of ALL treatment in children needs to be evaluated.","['Vorwerk, P', 'Wex, H', 'Hohmann, B', 'Mohnike, K', 'Schmidt, U', 'Mittler, U']","['Vorwerk P', 'Wex H', 'Hohmann B', 'Mohnike K', 'Schmidt U', 'Mittler U']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg, Emanuel-Larisch-Weg 17-19, D-39112 Magdeburg, Germany.

We previously identified several mutants of the BLV Tax protein with an ability to transactivate transcription via the BLV enhancer that is significantly greater than that of the wild-type Tax protein. Moreover, the mutant proteins also activated other viral enhancers, such as the enhancer of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, which cannot be activated by wild-type BLV Tax. In this study, we demonstrated that the mutant proteins but not wild-type protein activate the upstream sequence of the human c-fos gene, which contains two major cis-acting elements, the CArG box and cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) motif. The mutant protein also strongly increased levels of endogenous c-fos mRNA in both human and bovine cell lines. On the other hand, the wild-type Tax protein has no activity to activate the expression of human c-fos, indicating that wild-type BLV Tax might discriminate between human and bovine c-fos promoter sequences. Deletion and point-mutational analysis of the cis-acting elements revealed that both the CArG box and the CRE motif were indispensable for the activation of c-fos by the mutant BLV Tax protein. Our results suggest that the mutant BLV Tax proteins might not only have the ability to enhance the production of virus particles but might also have increased ability to induce leukemia.","['Tajima, Shigeru', 'Aida, Yoko']","['Tajima S', 'Aida Y']","['Retrovirus Research Unit, RIKEN Tsukuba Institute, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, fos', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', '*Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC135937,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/03/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Mar;76(5):2557-62. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.5.2557-2562.2002.,,,['10.1128/jvi.76.5.2557-2562.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the majority of cats exposed to FeLV develop a transient infection and recover, a proportion of cats become persistently viremic and many subsequently develop fatal diseases. To define the dominant host immune effector mechanisms responsible for the outcome of infection, we studied the longitudinal changes in FeLV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in a group of naive cats following oronasal exposure to FeLV. Using (51)Cr release assays to measure ex vivo virus-specific cytotoxicity, the emerging virus-specific CTL response was correlated with modulations in viral burden as assessed by detection of infectious virus, FeLV p27 capsid antigen, and proviral DNA in the blood. High levels of circulating FeLV-specific effector CTLs appeared before virus neutralizing antibodies in cats that recovered from exposure to FeLV. In contrast, persistent viremia was associated with a silencing of virus-specific humoral and cell-mediated host immune effector mechanisms. A single transfer of between 2 x 10(7) and 1 x 10(8) autologous, antigen-activated lymphoblasts was associated with a downmodulation in viral burden in vivo.

To evaluate this gene as a potential candidate for LVIF, the mouse ApoF gene was cloned and sequenced and its expression was assessed in LVIF-positive and -negative mice; no obvious differences were detected, suggesting that LVIF is under the control of a distinct linked gene.","['Wu, Tiyun', 'Lee, Chun G', 'Buckler-White, Alicia', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Wu T', 'Lee CG', 'Buckler-White A', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Building 4, Room 329, 4 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Apolipoproteins)', '0 (apolipoprotein F)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/blood/chemistry/*genetics', 'Apolipoproteins/blood/chemistry/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/drug effects/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/virology']",PMC153798,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/03/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Mar;76(5):2279-86. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.5.2279-2286.2002.,,,['10.1128/jvi.76.5.2279-2286.2002 [doi]'],,,"['GENBANK/AF411830', 'GENBANK/AF411831', 'GENBANK/AF411832']",,,,,,,,,,,

Both temporal and tissue-specific effects were observed. During the first week of infection, IFN-gamma-deficiency caused increased levels of FV infection in multiple tissues. Surprisingly, however, by 2 weeks postinfection, IFN-gamma-deficient mice had significantly lower levels of infection in both the spleen and bone marrow compared to wild-type mice. The rapid reduction of virus in the IFN-gamma-deficient mice correlated with a more rapid virus-neutralizing antibody response than was observed in the wild-type mice. Furthermore, the virus-neutralizing antibody response in wild-type mice could be accelerated by ablation of their IFN-gamma response. Although the IFN-gamma-deficient mice developed an accelerated virus-neutralizing antibody response, they did not class-switch to immunoglobulin G class immunoglobulins nor could they maintain long-term virus-neutralizing antibody titers. Eventually, all of the IFN-gamma-deficient mice failed to keep persistent virus in check and developed fatal FV-induced erythroleukemia.","['Stromnes, Ingunn M', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Schumacher, Ton N M', 'Schepers, Koen', 'Messer, Ronald J', 'Evans, Leonard H', 'Peterson, Karin E', 'Race, Brent', 'Hasenkrug, Kim J']","['Stromnes IM', 'Dittmer U', 'Schumacher TN', 'Schepers K', 'Messer RJ', 'Evans LH', 'Peterson KE', 'Race B', 'Hasenkrug KJ']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/NIH, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Interferon-gamma/*deficiency/genetics/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/blood', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*physiopathology/virology', 'Spleen/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*physiopathology/virology']",PMC153801,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/03/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2002 Mar;76(5):2225-32. doi: 10.1128/jvi.76.5.2225-2232.2002.,,,['10.1128/jvi.76.5.2225-2232.2002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of microarrays allows simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes expressions per sample. This ability to measure gene expression en masse has resulted in data with the number of variables p(genes) far exceeding the number of samples N. Standard statistical methodologies in classification and prediction do not work well or even at all when N < p. Modification of existing statistical methodologies or development of new methodologies is needed for the analysis of microarray data. RESULTS: We propose a novel analysis procedure for classifying (predicting) human tumor samples based on microarray gene expressions. This procedure involves dimension reduction using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and classification using Logistic Discrimination (LD) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). We compare PLS to the well known dimension reduction method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Under many circumstances PLS proves superior; we illustrate a condition when PCA particularly fails to predict well relative to PLS. The proposed methods were applied to five different microarray data sets involving various human tumor samples: (1) normal versus ovarian tumor; (2) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) versus Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); (3) Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCLL) versus B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (BCLL); (4) normal versus colon tumor; and (5) Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Carcinoma (NSCLC) versus renal samples. Stability of classification results and methods were further assessed by re-randomization studies.","['Nguyen, Danh V', 'Rocke, David M']","['Nguyen DV', 'Rocke DM']","['Center for Image Processing and Integrated Computing, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA. nguyen@wald.ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],['P43 ES04699/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,,IM,"['Colonic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Computational Biology', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma/classification/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/06/11 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2002 Jan;18(1):39-50. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/18.1.39.,,,['10.1093/bioinformatics/18.1.39 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This information was combined with published data on the intensities of ELF magnetic fields associated with sources or work environments to estimate ELF magnetic field exposures for a wide range of jobs commonly held by women. Estimated exposures for 61 job categories ranged from 0.03 to 0.68 microT; the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles were 0.135, 0.17, and 0.23 microT, respectively. By job category, the most highly exposed jobs (>0.23 microT) included bakery worker, cashier, cook and kitchen worker, electronics worker, residential and industrial sewing machine operator, and textile machine operator. By work environment, the most highly exposed job categories were electronics worker in an assembly plant (0.70 microT) and sewing machine operators in a textile factory (0.68 microT) and shoe factory (0.66 microT).

In addition to its growth inhibitory properties, PKC412 reverses the efflux function of the multidrug resistance (MDR)-1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). DESIGN AND METHODS: The in vitro actions of PKC412 were investigated in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 4 normal volunteers, B-cell isolates from 3 normal tonsils and 31 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). Following incubation with PKC412 for 2 days, the viability of B-CLL cells was decreased relative to that of controls (63+/-23% at 1 micromole/L; 52+/-30% at 10 micromole/L; n=20). Normal PBL were significantly more resistant to the drug (91+/-5% viable cells at 1 micromole/L; 73+/-18% at 10 micromole/L; n=4). Thirteen of the B-CLL patients were treated with oral PKC412 in a phase II trial. RESULTS: PKC activity in malignant cells from these patients showed a reduction post-treatment of 25-96% of their respective pre-treatment levels. Morphologic analysis, as well as in situ assay for DNA strand breaks (TUNEL assay) showed that B-CLL cells were killed by an apoptotic mechanism. In B-CLL cells the mean IC50, for PKC412, as measured by the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), was 2.1 micromol/L in 16 samples in which the IC50 were below the maximum concentration of PKC412 used for the assay. In tonsillar B-cells, the mean IC50 was 11 micromol/L whereas PBL cells were resistant. Four of eight and 1/3 B-CLL samples that were resistant to chlorambucil and fludarabine, respectively, were sensitive to PKC412. In 15/31 B-CLL samples a dose-dependent reversal of P-gp-mediated drug efflux by PKC412 was observed. A statistically significant correlation (p<0.001) was observed between P-gp protein expression as measured by FACScan analysis and the reversal of efflux activity by either PKC412 or verapamil. PKC412 increased the sensitivity of B-CLL cells to 2'-chlorodeoxyadenosine and chlorambucil. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes the in vitro cytotoxic and multidrug resistance (MDR) modulatory properties of PKC412 towards malignant cells from B-CLL patients. The direct antitumor activity combined with the potential for P-gp modulation make PKC412 an attractive drug for the treatment of malignancies expressing the MDR phenotype, or in combination with conventional drugs.","['Ganeshaguru, Kanagasabai', 'Wickremasinghe, Ranmohan G', 'Jones, Dylan T', 'Gordon, Mathew', 'Hart, Steve M', 'Virchis, Andres E', 'Prentice, H Grant', 'Hoffbrand, A Victor', 'Man, Anthony', 'Champain, Kate', 'Csermak, Katalin', 'Mehta, Atul B']","['Ganeshaguru K', 'Wickremasinghe RG', 'Jones DT', 'Gordon M', 'Hart SM', 'Virchis AE', 'Prentice HG', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Man A', 'Champain K', 'Csermak K', 'Mehta AB']","['Department of Hematology, Royal Free & University College Medical School, Royal Free Campus, Rowland Hill Street, London NW3 2PF, UK. k.ganeshaguru@rfc.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', ""2627-62-5 (2'-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine)"", 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Feb;87(2):167-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to analyze the prognostic value of cytogenetic analysis in children and adults with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR-ALL) included in a prospective multicenter trial. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and thirty patients (44 children and 86 adults) with HR-ALL included in the PETHEMA ALL-93 trial had an adequate cytogenetic study after review. Cytogenetic subgroups were established according to the cancer and acute leukemia group B criteria (unfavorable: 11q23, t(9;22), -7 and +8; normal; miscellaneous: the remaining chromosome abnormalities) and their main clinicobiological features were compared. Univariable and multivariable analyses for complete remission (CR) attainment, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed. RESULTS: The mean SD age was 26 14 years. Two were infants (<1 year), 42 were children and 86 adults (19-50 years). The cytogenetic study was normal in 44 (34%) cases. The most frequent chromosomal rearrangement was t(9;22)(q34;q11) (34 cases, 26%, 30 adults), followed by 11q23 (12 cases, 9% -8 children-, including t(4;11)(q21;q23) in 8, 7 children). Patients with t(9;22) were older than the remaining cases, whereas those with 11q23 rearrangements were younger and had higher WBC counts. Multivariable analyses showed two associated factors in adults with a lower frequency of CR and a shorter EFS and OS: t(9;22) and slow response to therapy (assessed by a percentage of blast cells higher than 10% in bone marrow study on day 14). For children with very high-risk ALL, only slow response to therapy (assessed by the presence of blast cells in peripheral blood on day 8) was associated with a negative impact on CR, EFS and OS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia included in the PETHEMA ALL-93 protocol, cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis is a useful independent prognostic marker. The poorest prognosis for patients with t(9;22) justifies the development of specific treatments for these patients. In this small subgroup of children with very high-risk ALL no cytogenetic characteristics was found to influence the results of therapy, slow response to therapy being the only prognostic factor.","['Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Ortega, Juan-Jose', 'Oriol, Albert', 'Granada, Isabel', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria', 'Parody, Ricardo', 'Bethencourt, Concepcion', 'Rivas, Concepcion', 'Bastida, Pilar', 'del Potro, Eloy', 'Gonzalez-Valentin, Maria-Elvira', 'Moreno, Maria-Jose', 'Besalduch, Joan', 'Fernandez-Calvo, Javier', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Arias, Jesus', 'Molines, Antonio', 'Sanz, Miguel Angel', 'Maldonado, Juan', 'Milla, Fuensanta', 'Feliu, Evarist', 'San Miguel, Jesus-Fernando']","['Ribera JM', 'Ortega JJ', 'Oriol A', 'Granada I', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Parody R', 'Bethencourt C', 'Rivas C', 'Bastida P', 'del Potro E', 'Gonzalez-Valentin ME', 'Moreno MJ', 'Besalduch J', 'Fernandez-Calvo J', 'Tormo M', 'Arias J', 'Molines A', 'Sanz MA', 'Maldonado J', 'Milla F', 'Feliu E', 'San Miguel JF']","['Hematology Department and Hematopoietic Progenitor Transplant Unit, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Spain. jmribera@ns.hugtip.scs.es']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Karyotyping', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Feb;87(2):154-66.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['PETHEMA Group, Spanish Society of Hematology']",,,,

A biological study based on 62 patients.,148-53,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The terms acute erythroleukemia and AML-M6 are defined in the FAB classification as proliferations of dysplastic erythroid elements mixed with blasts of myeloid origin, but pure erythroid leukemias are not included. The recent WHO classification has a category of acute myeloid leukemia not otherwise categorized, which includes acute erythroid leukemia (M6) of two subtypes: M6a-erythroleukemia (erythroid/myeloid) and M6b-pure erythroid leukemia. The aims of this co-operative study were to discover the incidences of these different subtypes, and pay special attention to the morphology of these entities. DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed a series of 62 patients with erythroid neoplastic proliferations. Previous medical history, age, sex, peripheral blood and bone marrow cell counts, cytochemical stains, immunophenotype, and cytogenetics were evaluated at presentation. We analyzed the incidence of erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet abnormalities in the peripheral blood. In bone marrow we analyzed dysplastic features of erythroblasts, granulocytic elements and the megakaryocytic lineage. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients met the criteria of M6a subtype of the WHO classification, and 2 were classified as having pure erythremia (M6b); 7 cases could not be classified according to the WHO criteria. Fifty-five patients presented with de novo acute leukemia, and seven patients had secondary acute leukemia. The most frequent dysplastic features in blood smears were: schistocytes, tear-drop and pincered cells in erythrocytes; hypogranulation and hyposegmentation in leukocytes; gigantism and hypogranulation in platelets. In bone marrow, megaloblastic changes, multinuclearity, karyorrhexis and basophilic stippling in erythroblasts; hypogranulation and gigantism in granulocytic series, and micromegakaryocytes and unconnected nuclei in megakarocytes were the most dysplastic features. A positive PAS reaction and increase of bone marrow iron with ring sideroblasts were common features. Trilineage dysplasia was present in 54% of cases. Dysplastic features in granulocytic elements were absent in 26% of patients and minimal erythroblastic dysplasia was observed in seven patients. A complex karyotype was seen in 27% of patients; chromosomes 5 and 7 were the most frequently involved. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: De novo acute erythroid leukemia was more frequent than secondary cases in our series. The most frequent type of acute erythroid proliferation was the WHO M6a subtype and the least the pure erythroid leukemia. We found a group of seven patients (11%) who could not be classified according to the WHO criteria. Morphologic findings of erythrocytes in peripheral blood, such as schistocytes, tear-drop and pincered cells, were outstanding features. Morphologic aspects remain one of the most important tools for diagnosing these entities.","['Domingo-Claros, Alicia', 'Larriba, Itziar', 'Rozman, Maruja', 'Irriguible, Dolors', 'Vallespi, Teresa', 'Aventin, Anna', 'Ayats, Ramon', 'Milla, Fuensanta', 'Sole, Francesc', 'Florensa, Lourdes', 'Gallart, Miquel', 'Tuset, Esperanza', 'Lopez, Carmen', 'Woessner, Soledad']","['Domingo-Claros A', 'Larriba I', 'Rozman M', 'Irriguible D', 'Vallespi T', 'Aventin A', 'Ayats R', 'Milla F', 'Sole F', 'Florensa L', 'Gallart M', 'Tuset E', 'Lopez C', 'Woessner S']","[""Ciudad Sanitaria y Universitaria de Bellvitge, L'Hospitalet del Llobregat 08907, Barcelona, Spain. alicia@domingo.com""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood/classification/epidemiology/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Preleukemia/epidemiology', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Feb;87(2):148-53.,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR/ABL1 fusion gene is usually found on der(22). The additional gene(s) involved in complex variant Ph rearrangements have not been characterized. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in three complex variant Ph translocations involving the short arm of chromosome 6 in addition to 9 and 22. The BCR/ABL1 D-FISH probe was applied to localize the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene as well as the 5'ABL1 and the 3'BCR. Locus-specific probes were used to narrow the 6p breakpoint. RESULTS: In all cases the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene was located on the Ph chromosome whereas the reciprocal ABL1/BCR gene was detected only in patient #2. On 6p, breakpoints were narrowed to three different regions: centromeric to the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC), between PAC 524E15 and PAC162J16, in the first patient, and telomeric to the MHC, between PAC 329A5 and PAC 145H9, and between PAC 136B1 and PAC 206F19, in the second and third patients, respectively. In patients #2 and 3 a chromosomal rearrangement different from a true complex variant was discovered. In both cases, a classical t(9;22) was associated with an additional translocation involving the der(9)t(9;22). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Rearrangements at 6p in complex Ph aberrations involve more than one gene/locus. Classical t(9;22), masked by additional chromosomal rearrangements, can resemble complex variant Ph translocations, and can be detected only using appropriate FISH probes.","['La Starza, Roberta', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Ruggeri, Deborah', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Perla, Gianni', 'Martelli, Massimo Fabrizio', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Mecucci, Cristina']","['La Starza R', 'Testoni N', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Ruggeri D', 'Ottaviani E', 'Perla G', 'Martelli MF', 'Marynen P', 'Mecucci C']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Feb;87(2):143-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to assess whether co-transfection of the p16(INK4a) and p53 genes could inhibit K562 cell proliferation. DESIGN AND METHODS: p16(INK4a) and p53 genes were co-transfected into K562 cells with liposome, and the expression of the transfected genes was detected by Western-immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. The effect of the p16(INK4a) and p53 transfected cell culture was quantified by trypan blue staining, and the number of recovered viable cells was assessed every day after transfection. Cells were analyzed for expression of annexin V in order to detect apoptosis. Differentiation of transfected K562 cells was measured by the benzidine oxidation test, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: After co-transfection, there were 23% and 28% p53 and p16(INK4a) positive cells respectively. Co-transfection with p16(INK4a) and p53 genes significantly inhibited cell proliferation when compared to transfection with either p16(INK4a) or p53 gene. The percentage of cells expressing the apoptosis-related cell surface antigen annexin V was significantly higher in p53 and p16(INK4a) transfected cells than in p53 or p16(INK4a) transfected cells (6.24+/-0.37% vs 4.88+/- 0.17%, p<0.05 and vs 2.78+/-0.26%, p<0.05, respectively). p16(INK4a) and p53 co-transfection significantly increased the number of cells in G1 phase and decreased that in S phase. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Expression of wild-type p16(INK4a) and p53 genes in K562 cells results in reduced proliferation and apoptosis.

Increased storage of iron is considered a potential risk factor participating in the pathogenesis of malignant diseases. Since HFE gene mutations have recently been implicated in unbalanced iron homeostasis, we set out to examine the prevalence of these mutations in patients with hematologic disorders. DESIGN AND METHODS: C282Y and H63D mutations were determined in 232 patients with various hematologic disorders treated at Oulu University Hospital between 1987 and 2000. DNA samples extracted from either the peripheral blood or bone marrow of these patients were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using sequence-specific primers, and the products were analyzed on agarose gels. RESULTS: There was a slight tendency towards lower frequencies of the C282Y allele in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (3.8%, n=53) and higher frequencies in those with essential thrombocythemia (ET) (16.2%, n=37). Contrary to some expectations, however, the frequency of the C282Y allele in acute lymphoblastic leukemia turned out to be normal (7.0%, n=43). Our data showed no significant deviations in H63D mutation frequency in any of the categories of patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not show any significant association between HFE gene mutations and hematologic malignancies. The divergent frequencies observed for the C282Y mutation in patients with AML and ET highlight the need for larger population studies of HFE mutations in patients with hematologic diseases.","['Hannuksela, Jokke', 'Savolainen, Eeva-Riitta', 'Koistinen, Pirjo', 'Parkkila, Seppo']","['Hannuksela J', 'Savolainen ER', 'Koistinen P', 'Parkkila S']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Oulu, Finland. jokkeha@paju.oulu.fi']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (HFE protein, human)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Hemochromatosis Protein)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Alleles', '*Amino Acid Substitution', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Gene Frequency', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Hemochromatosis Protein', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Point Mutation', 'Prevalence', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Feb;87(2):131-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, an RF field used in mobile telecommunication was tested using 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in female Sprague-Dawley rats as a model for human breast cancer. Three experiments were carried out under strictly standardized conditions and were started on the same day of three consecutive years. The field consisted of a GSM-like signal (900 MHz pulsed at 217 Hz, pulse width 577 micros) of relatively low power flux density (100 microW/cm(2) +/- 3 dB) and was applied continuously throughout each experiment to freely moving animals. The specific absorption rates averaged over the whole body were 17.5-70 mW/kg. The highest values in young animals were at or around the exposure limit permissible for the general public (i.e. 80 mW/kg). The animals were palpated weekly for the presence of mammary tumors and were killed humanely when tumors reached a diameter of 1-2 cm to allow a reliable histopathological classification and a distinction between malignant and benign subtypes. The overall results of the three studies are that there was no statistically significant effect of RF-field exposure on tumor latency and that the cumulative tumor incidence at the end of the experiment was unaffected as well. The risk ratios were 1.08 (95% CI: 0.91-1.29) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85-1.07) for benign and malignant tumors, respectively. These observations are in agreement with other published findings. In the first experiment, however, the median latency for the development of the first malignant tumor in each animal was statistically significantly extended for RF-field-exposed animals compared to controls (278 days compared to 145 days, P = 0.009). No such differences were detected in the two subsequent experiments. These results show that low-level RF radiation does not appear to possess carcinogenic or cancer-promoting effects on DMBA-induced mammary tumors. To explain the mechanisms underlying the different results obtained in the three experiments, a hypothesis is presented which is based upon the neuroendocrine control mechanisms involved in the promotion of DMBA-induced mammary tumors. Despite the apparent absence of stimulatory effects of low-level RF-field exposure on the development and growth of solid tumors, it will be necessary to verify these results for leukemias and lymphomas, which may have completely different biological control mechanisms.","['Bartsch, H', 'Bartsch, C', 'Seebald, E', 'Deerberg, F', 'Dietz, K', 'Vollrath, L', 'Mecke, D']","['Bartsch H', 'Bartsch C', 'Seebald E', 'Deerberg F', 'Dietz K', 'Vollrath L', 'Mecke D']","['Center for Research in Medical and Natural Sciences, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany. hella.bartsch@uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Estrogens)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Estrogens', 'Female', 'Life Tables', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/*etiology/pathology', 'Models, Animal', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Hormone-Dependent/chemically induced/etiology/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/pathology', 'Radio Waves/*adverse effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Safety', 'Telephone/*instrumentation', 'Time Factors']",,2002/02/12 10:00,2002/03/14 10:01,['2002/02/12 10:00'],"['2002/02/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/12 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 2002 Feb;157(2):183-90. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2002)157[0183:cetagl]2.0.co;2.,,53,['10.1667/0033-7587(2002)157[0183:cetagl]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 7 patients out of 307 patients who underwent BMT were diagnosed with TTP during 1989-1999. The diagnosis of TTP was made based on thrombocytopenia and microhemangiopathic hemolytic anemia characterized by an elevated LDH and the presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Five patients were treated with plasma exchange (PE) using fresh frozen plasma and/or cryoprecipitate poor plasma as replacement fluid. One patient was treated using a protein A column. One patient did not receive plasma exchange because the 125 patient was clinically stable and was discharged. It was hard to assess the efficacy of PE due to the multiplicity of the patients' clinical condition and laboratory data. At least 4 patients did not respond to PE and 2 patients were not able to be evaluated due to multi organ failure. However, all patients died.

Interleukin-4, secreted by activated T-cells, has shown antitumor activity in vitro against multiple myelomas, lymphoma, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and some solid tumors. Early promising clinical studies have shown the efficacy of IL-4 in decreasing the malignant lymphocyte count and in normalizing hematologic parameters in patients with CLL and in inducing transient clinical responses in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Interleukin-6 possesses immunomodulating properties including enhancement of NK cell activity and induction of cytotoxic T-cell activity. IL-6 has shown antitumor activity in mice injected with weakly immunogenic syngeneic tumors and has been shown to inhibit in vitro human breast carcinoma and leukemia/lymphoma proliferation through a direct tumor inhibitory effect. Clinical studies investigating the antitumor activity of IL-6 are currently in phase II clinical trials. IL-6 and IL-11 have demonstrated thrombopoietic enhancing activity in primate models and early clinical trials. These agents have a potential application in ameliorating the thrombocytopenia associated with myeloablative chemotherapy. Yet to enter clinical trials, IL-12 has been shown to enhance the lytic activity of nonspecific NK/LAK cells and appears to be more efficient than IL-2 or IFN's in enhancing NK cytotoxicity. IL-12 has also been shown to enhance specific allogeneic human CTL responses and to induce the secretion of IFN-gamma from both resting and activated T and NK cells. In summary, these interleukins are now promising agents under investigation as effective treatment strategies in the oncologic setting.","['Oleksowicz, Leslie', 'Dutcher, Janice P.']","['Oleksowicz L', 'Dutcher JP']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein Cancer Center, 111 East 210th Street, Bronx, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ther,American journal of therapeutics,9441347,,,,,1994/08/01 00:00,2002/02/09 10:00,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:00 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ther. 1994 Aug;1(2):107-115. doi: 10.1097/00045391-199408000-00002.,,,['10.1097/00045391-199408000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both are members of the hematopoietic receptors family characterized by the cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domain, which consists of two barrel-like modules of around 100 amino acids each. The gp190 is among the very few members of this large family to contain two CRH domains. The membrane-distal one (herein called D1) is followed by an immunoglobulin-like domain, a membrane-proximal CRH domain called D2, and three type III fibronectin-like repeats. A minimal D1IgD2 fragment is required for binding LIF. By using transmembrane forms of deletion mutants in gp190 ectodomain, we demonstrated that removal of D1 led to spontaneous activation of the receptor and that this property was devoted to a peptidic sequence localized within the last 42 amino acids of the carboxyl-terminal module of D2. By using soluble forms of deletion mutants made by progressive truncations from the end of the D1IgD2 fragment, we demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal module of D2 was dispensable for LIF binding and that the correct conformation of the D1Ig fragment required a full amino-terminal module of D2. Therefore, the two constitutive modules of the membrane-proximal CRH domain D2 of gp190 fulfill two distinct roles in gp190 function, i.e. in stabilizing the conformation of gp190 allowing LIF binding and in activating the receptor.","['Voisin, Mathieu-Benoit', 'Bitard, Juliette', 'Daburon, Sophie', 'Moreau, Jean-Francois', 'Taupin, Jean-Luc']","['Voisin MB', 'Bitard J', 'Daburon S', 'Moreau JF', 'Taupin JL']","['CNRS UMR 5540, Universite de Bordeaux II, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (oncofetal antigens)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Deletion', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Ligands', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2002/02/09 10:00,2002/06/12 10:01,['2002/02/09 10:00'],"['2002/02/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/12 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2002 Apr 19;277(16):13682-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M111624200.

Although CT-1 and ET-1 gene expression in the heart is upregulated in experimental heart failure, their role in the activation of the cardiac fibroblast is unknown. This study was designed to identify the presence and action of CT-1 and its receptor complex, glycoprotein130 (gp130) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, on cardiac fibroblast growth in cultured adult canine cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, we investigated the interaction between CT-1/gp130/LIF receptor and ET-1/endothelin type A (ET(A)) receptor axis. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the indirect immunoperoxidase method, while we assessed the cell cycle of cardiac fibroblasts by flow cytometry, DNA synthesis by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, and collagen synthesis by [(3)H]proline incorporation, respectively. CT-1 and gp130/LIF receptor were widely present in the cytoplasm of the cardiac fibroblasts. Exogenous CT-1 markedly stimulated [(3)H]thymidine and [(3)H]proline incorporations (P<0.01), with accumulation of cells in the S phase. Blockade of gp130 or LIF receptor inhibited basal growth as well as CT-1- or ET-1-stimulated cardiac fibroblast growth. The specific ET(A) receptor antagonist, BQ123, significantly inhibited CT-1-stimulated DNA synthesis. This study demonstrates that CT-1 and its receptors are present in cardiac fibroblasts. In addition, growth of these cells stimulated by endogenous and exogenous CT-1 requires gp130/LIF receptor as well as ET(A) receptor activation. We conclude that gp130/LIF receptor and ET(A) receptor activation are essential for cardiac fibroblast growth by CT-1 and that there is synergism with ET-1/ET(A) receptor axis.","['Tsuruda, Toshihiro', 'Jougasaki, Michihisa', 'Boerrigter, Guido', 'Huntley, Brenda K', 'Chen, Horng H', ""D'Assoro, Antonino B"", 'Lee, Shang C', 'Larsen, Amy M', 'Cataliotti, Alessandro', 'Burnett, John C Jr']","['Tsuruda T', 'Jougasaki M', 'Boerrigter G', 'Huntley BK', 'Chen HH', ""D'Assoro AB"", 'Lee SC', 'Larsen AM', 'Cataliotti A', 'Burnett JC Jr']","['Cardiorenal Research Laboratory, Division of Cardiovascular Diseases, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. tsuruda.toshihiro@mayo.edu']",['eng'],['HL-36634/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Endothelin-2)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptor, Endothelin A)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Endothelin)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Endothelin-1/pharmacology', 'Endothelin-2/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Myocardium/cytology/metabolism', 'Receptor, Endothelin A', 'Receptors, Cytokine/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Endothelin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Subcellular Fractions']",,2002/02/09 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/09 10:00'],"['2002/02/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2002 Feb 8;90(2):128-34. doi: 10.1161/hh0202.103613.,,,['10.1161/hh0202.103613 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary-care medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-seven patients with a hematologic malignancy or after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for a hematologic malignancy who underwent a total of 71 FNAs for diagnosis of an unexplained parenchymal lung lesion from January 1, 1991, to June 30, 1999. RESULTS: The underlying malignancy was lymphoma in 42 patients (63%), leukemia in 8 patients (12%), after allogeneic BMT in 12 patients (18%), after autologous BMT in 3 patients (4%), and other diseases in 2 patients. Radiographs showed focal abnormalities in all cases, and were nodules in 37%, masses in 37%, focal infiltrates in 21%, and cavitary lesions in 5%. The yield of FNA for a finding specific infection or cancer was 56% (40 of 71 FNAs). The FNA with inflammatory changes was clinically sufficient in another 11 patients for a total yield of 72% (51 of 71 FNAs). The yield for lung cancer was 90% (9 of 10 FNAs), for pulmonary lymphoma was 68% (21 of 31 FNAs), and for infection was 67% (10 of 15 FNAs). Complications occurred in 18 of 71 FNAs (25%), with pneumothorax in 14 patients (20%) and chest tube placement required in 4 patients (6%). Bleeding occurred in six patients (8%), including one death in a patient with abnormal hematologic parameters. CONCLUSION: Transthoracic FNA in patients with hematologic malignancy and focal lung lesions has an excellent yield for detecting cancer and a yield comparable to bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of infections. It should be considered a useful diagnostic tool in this setting.","['Wong, Philip W', 'Stefanec, Tihomer', 'Brown, Karen', 'White, Dorothy A']","['Wong PW', 'Stefanec T', 'Brown K', 'White DA']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Chest,Chest,0231335,,IM,"['*Biopsy, Needle/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/pathology', 'Leukemia/*pathology/therapy', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/02/09 10:00,2002/03/23 10:01,['2002/02/09 10:00'],"['2002/02/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chest. 2002 Feb;121(2):527-32. doi: 10.1378/chest.121.2.527.,,,"['S0012-3692(16)35461-7 [pii]', '10.1378/chest.121.2.527 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This balance is critical for control of growth and differentiation. The role of tyrosine phosphatases during nephrogenesis and in kidney disease requires delineation. Appropriate regulation of focal adhesion proteins such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin are important in cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. We have previously shown that B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (bcl-2) -/- mice develop cystic kidneys and exhibit sustained phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin. We have examined the expression and activity of focal adhesion tyrosine phosphatases [Src homology-2 domain phosphatase (SHP-2), protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP 1B), and PTP-proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine sequences (PEST)] during normal nephrogenesis and in cystic kidneys from bcl-2 -/- mice. Cystic kidneys from postnatal day 20 bcl-2 -/- mice demonstrate a reduced expression, sixfold decrease in activity, and altered distribution of SHP-2 and PTP 1B. PTP-PEST expression and distribution were similar in both bcl-2 +/+ and bcl-2 -/- mice.

One hundred and twenty-four scholars and 124 nonfunded applicants were studied. Two bibliometric variables and their derivatives were examined from the Institute of Scientific Information database: the number of papers published and the number of citations to those papers. Published papers were measured through December 31, 1999, and citation counts to these papers through December 31, 2000. Scholars published 10,301 papers through the period of observation and nonfunded applicants published 6442 papers. Scholars' papers were cited 536,283 [corrected] times, whereas nonfunded applicants' papers were cited 245,586 times. The mean citations per paper were 52 for scholars and 38 for nonfunded applicants. The papers published per scholar, citations per scholar, and citations per paper per scholar were significantly greater than the corresponding measures for nonfunded applicants (P < 0.0001 in each case). Scholar's papers were cited 30% more often, whereas nonfunded applicants were cited 10% more frequently, than a comparison group of scientists publishing in the same journal in the same year. High-impact papers, e.g., papers that were cited more than 200 times, were nearly three times as frequent among scholars (494 papers) as among nonfunded applicants (173 papers). This difference was highly significant. The good (better than baseline) performance of nonfunded applicants may be a reflection of self-selection among the applicant pool for this competitive award; the more productive performance of the scholars is probably the result of the selection decisions made during the peer-review process.","['Lichtman, M A', 'Oakes, D']","['Lichtman MA', 'Oakes D']","['The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, White Plains, New York 10605, USA. mal@urmc.rochester.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,,IM,"['Bibliometrics', 'Financing, Organized/economics/*standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Peer Review, Research/methods/*standards', 'Publications/economics/standards', 'Societies, Medical/economics/*standards']",,2002/02/08 10:00,2003/03/29 05:00,['2002/02/08 10:00'],"['2002/02/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [medline]', '2002/02/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Nov-Dec;27(6):1020-7. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0476.,,,"['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0476 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90476-0 [pii]']",['Copyright 2001 Elsevier Science.'],,,,,,,,,,['Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Sep-Oct;41(2):236'],,,

Translation inhibitors such as cycloheximide and puromycin antibiotics were much more effective in blocking the synthesis of the frameshift polypeptide Gag-Pro than the synthesis of the Gag product. The preferential inhibition of the frameshift polypeptide Gag-Pro by the two antibiotics was not a reflection of the different sizes of the two gene products, but rather a consequence of the effect of the inhibitors on ribosomal translation efficiencies. To further analyze the effect of translation efficiencies on ribosomal frameshifting, we compared the translation of 5'-capped RNA to noncapped RNA. The translation of 5'-capped RNA was higher, as expected. Consequently, ribosomal frameshifting producing the Gag-Pro polypeptide was enhanced when compared to the translation of noncapped RNA. Taken together these results indicate that efficiencies of translation, in conjunction with the cis regulatory genetic elements at the frameshift sites, determine the ratio of the polypeptides Gag, Gag-Pro, and Gag-Pro-Pol produced in the HTLV-infected cell. Thus, physiological changes which affect the cellular translation machinery may alter the optimal ratio of these three polyprotein products needed for virus maturation.","['Honigman, A', 'Falk, H', 'Mador, N', 'Rosental, T', 'Panet, A']","['Honigman A', 'Falk H', 'Mador N', 'Rosental T', 'Panet A']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Cell-Free System', '*Frameshifting, Ribosomal', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ribosomes/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",,1995/04/01 00:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['1995/04/01 00:00'],"['1995/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '1995/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1995 Apr 1;208(1):312-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.1154.,,,"['S0042-6822(85)71154-3 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1995.1154 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early work based on assessment of IQ suggested considerable problems associated with CNS irradiation of 2400cGy, and that children who were younger on diagnosis (below 5 years) were particularly at risk. Consequently, new protocols were introduced in which the amount of irradiation was reduced, or children were treated by chemotherapy alone. There is some evidence that reduction from 2400 to 1800cGy irradiation is beneficial, especially for younger children, as is treatment by chemotherapy alone. Methodological problems in conducting this work and limitations in relying on IQ tests are discussed. Where there are no indications of differences in survival, there would seem to be implications for reducing as far as possible the use of CNS directed therapy among young children treated for leukaemia.","['Eiser, C', 'Tillmann, V']","['Eiser C', 'Tillmann V']","['Department of Psychology, Western Bank, Sheffield UK. c.eiser@sheffield.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Pediatr Rehabil,Pediatric rehabilitation,9709256,,IM,"['Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence/radiation effects', 'Learning Disabilities/*etiology', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",,2002/02/08 10:00,2002/09/07 10:01,['2002/02/08 10:00'],"['2002/02/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Rehabil. 2001 Jul-Sep;4(3):105-18. doi: 10.1080/13638490110064806.,,88,['10.1080/13638490110064806 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMATINIB IN CML: Earlier studies have shown that Imatinib is highly effective in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which is characterized by translocation of chromosome material from chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 with formation of the so-called Philadelphia chromosome. During this process, an abnormal fusion protein, tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL, is formed. In a phase I study it was shown that a daily dose of 300 mg Imatinib resulted in a complete hematological response in almost 98% of the patients. IMATINIB IN GIST: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are also suitable indications for treatment with Imatinib, the prerequisite being overexpression by the tumor of c-KIT (CD117). This tumor entity responds extremely poorly to polychemotherapy. Initial case reports and various study approaches appear to indicate that treatment of GIST with Imatinib is a highly promising therapeutic option in this entity. Follow-up studies with FDG-PET have shown an appreciable decrease in uptake by tumor tissue, in some cases within only a few days, which may well indicate an inhibition of intratumoral metabolism and growth. Most patients with metastatic GIST achieve durable responses with imatinib, and the disappearance of cancer-related symptoms is often rapid.

Recent phase I and phase II studies in patients with bcr/abl positive CML and ALL showed a low rate of grade III/IV toxicity and good clinical efficacy. This report describes the preliminary results in patients relapsing post autologous or allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. The focus of this analysis will include toxicity, feasibility and clinical efficacy. THERAPY AND RESULTS: 18 of 18 patients with cytogenetic and/or hematologic relapse in chronic phase CML post autologous stem cell transplantation achieved a complete hematologic remission upon therapy with Gleevec. The cytogenetic response rate was 75% with a complete cytogenetic response rate of 50%. After allogeneic stem cell transplantation, patients in cytogenetic or hematologic relapse also experienced high hematologic and cytogenetic response rates upon therapy with Gleevec. In these patients, Gleevec was shown to induce mixed chimerism. Overall, Gleevec was well tolerated after autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Most common side effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal discomfort and edema. No symptoms of chronic extensive or > grade I acute GvHD could be observed. Hematologic toxicity was dependent on stage of disease. Grade III/IV granulocytopenia and/or thrombopenia could be observed in 50% of patients with transformed phases of CML. Management of these patients required frequent controls of peripheral blood counts and transfusion of blood products. CONCLUSION: These results show a new approach in treatment of patients with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive leukemia relapsing post autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Gleevec is able to induce mixed chimerism without induction of severe GvHD. The data suggest that early start of STI-571 therapy in MRD-positive patients is a promising approach.

CML, a myeloproliferative disorder, progresses through three phases--chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis. Current therapies include drug regimens such as interferon alpha, hydroxyurea, busulfan or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the only curative treatment for CML, which is, however, limited to younger patients with a suitable donor. INHIBITION OF BCR-ABL AS EFFECTIVE AND SELECTIVE TREATMENT IN CML: In vitro studies and studies in animal models have shown, that Bcr-Abl is the molecular cause CML. Therefore inhibition of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase is expected to be an effective and selective treatment modality for CML. STI571 was shown to be a competitive inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and c-kit tyrosine kinases. It shows effects on proliferation and survival of Bcr-Abl-expressing cells without affecting normal cells or Ph-negative leukemic cells. DRUG RESISTANCE TO STI571: Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified from in vitro studies with Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines. Mechanisms include amplification or overexpression of Bcr-Abl or an increased expression of P-gly-coprotein. In a mouse model the binding of STI571 to acidic alpha 1 glycoprotein (AAG) has been proposed to be involved in the development of STI571 resistance. Recent studies with clinical samples from resistant patients have shown that point mutations in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl play a role in the development of resistance to STI571. CONCLUSIONS: STI571 is a promising example of a moleculary targeted therapy directed towards the molecular cause of CML. To maximize the therapeutic value and to avoid the induction of resistance, a combination of the drug with other chemotherapies should be considered. According to its pharmacological profile, STI571 could also be useful in the treatment of tumors with deregulated PDGF receptor or c-kit signaling, e.g., in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with a t(5;12) chromosomal translocation or in cases with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). STI571 shows a new paradigm in the development of new targeted therapies for the treatment of malignant diseases.","['Buchdunger, Elisabeth']",['Buchdunger E'],"['Praklinische Forschung Onkologie, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Schweiz. elisabeth.buchdunger@pharma.novartis.com']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",,2002/02/08 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/08 10:00'],"['2002/02/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2002 Jan 15;97 Suppl 1:2-6.,Bcr-Abl-Hemmung als molekularer Therapieansatz bei der chronischen myeloischen Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The central pathogenetic role of the constitutively activated and deregulated abl-tyrosine kinase that is a direct consequence of the bcr-abl rearrangement opens the possibility of treating this disease using a molecularly targeted approach. The recent development of the selective abl-tyrosine kinase inhibitor Glivec (formerly STI571) opens the opportunity of blocking the signal transduction pathways critically involved in bcr-abl induced leukemogenesis. TREATMENT RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Glivec exerts a significant anti-leukemic effect in patients with Ph+ ALL, with a remarkably favorable toxicity profile. This enables transfer of a subset of the responding patients to a potentially curative allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Despite promising initial therapeutic effects, treatment with Glivec alone is not able to achieve cures in the majority of patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL. The earlier administration of Glivec in patients with ""de novo"" ALL as well as combining it with other treatment modalities is likely to improve treatment results. The identification of specific resistance mechanisms towards Glivec should provide valuable information regarding the development of clinical strategies to circumvent resistance. Glivec can already be considered an important element in the treatment of Ph+ ALL, although the most effective ways of employing this novel agent remain to be established.","['Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Wassmann, Barbara', 'Hoelzer, Dieter']","['Ottmann OG', 'Wassmann B', 'Hoelzer D']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Medizinische Klinik III der Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt/Main. ottmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['ger'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,2002/02/08 10:00,2002/03/26 10:01,['2002/02/08 10:00'],"['2002/02/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2002 Jan 15;97 Suppl 1:16-21.,Therapie der Philadelphia-Chromosom-positiven akuten lymphatischen Leukamie (Ph+ ALL) mit einem Inhibitor der abl-Tyrosinkinase (Glivec).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes that are required specifically for the definitive program, or for both phases of hematopoiesis, have been described. However, a specific regulator of primitive hematopoiesis has yet to be reported. The zebrafish bloodless (bls) mutation causes absence of embryonic erythrocytes in a dominant but incompletely penetrant manner. Primitive macrophages appear to develop normally in bls mutants. Although the thymic epithelium forms normally in bls mutants, lymphoid precursors are absent. Nonetheless, the bloodless mutants can progress through embryogenesis, where red cells begin to accumulate after 5 days post-fertilization (dpf). Lymphocytes also begin to populate the thymic organs by 7.5 dpf. Expression analysis of hematopoietic genes suggests that formation of primitive hematopoietic precursors is deficient in bls mutants and those few blood precursors that are specified fail to differentiate and undergo apoptosis. Overexpression of scl, but not bmp4 or gata1, can lead to partial rescue of embryonic blood cells in bls. Cell transplantation experiments show that cells derived from bls mutant donors can differentiate into blood cells in a wild-type host, but wild-type donor cells fail to form blood in the mutant host. These observations demonstrate that the bls gene product is uniquely required in a non-cell autonomous manner for primitive hematopoiesis, potentially acting via regulation of scl.","['Liao, Eric C', 'Trede, Nikolaus S', 'Ransom, David', 'Zapata, Augustin', 'Kieran, Mark', 'Zon, Leonard I']","['Liao EC', 'Trede NS', 'Ransom D', 'Zapata A', 'Kieran M', 'Zon LI']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['P50 DK 49216/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (bmp4 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (gata1a protein, zebrafish)', '0 (tal1 protein, zebrafish)']",IM,"['Anemia/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation', 'Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Marrow/embryology', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Lymphoid Tissue/embryology', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Zebrafish/embryology/*genetics', '*Zebrafish Proteins']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/03/05 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 2002 Feb;129(3):649-59.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not known what role Meis proteins play in these complexes, nor is it clear which Hox functions require Meis proteins in vivo. We now show that a divergent Meis family member, Prep1, acts as a Hox co-factor in zebrafish. This suggests that all Meis family members have at least one shared function and that this function must be carried out by a conserved domain. We proceed to show that the Meinox domain, an N-terminal conserved domain shown to mediate Pbx binding, is sufficient to provide Meis activity to a Pbx/Hox complex. We find that this activity is separable from Pbx binding and resides within the M1 subdomain. This finding also presents a rational strategy for interfering with Meis activity in vivo. We accomplish this by expressing the Pbx4/Lzr N-terminus, which sequesters Meis proteins in the cytoplasm away from the nuclear transcription complexes. Sequestering Meis proteins in the cytoplasm leads to extensive loss of rhombomere (r) 3- and r4-specific gene expression, as well as defective rhombomere boundary formation in this region. These changes in gene expression correlate with impaired neuronal differentiation in r3 and r4, e.g. the loss of r3-specific nV branchiomotor neurons and r4-specific Mauthner neurons. We conclude that Meis family proteins are essential for the specification of r3 and r4 of the hindbrain.","['Choe, Seong-Kyu', 'Vlachakis, Nikolaos', 'Sagerstrom, Charles G']","['Choe SK', 'Vlachakis N', 'Sagerstrom CG']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']",['eng'],['NS 38183/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (PBX4 protein, human)', '0 (Pbx4 protein, zebrafish)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Rhombencephalon/*embryology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Zebrafish', 'Zebrafish Proteins/*metabolism']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/03/05 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/05 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 2002 Feb;129(3):585-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, it is a challenge to devise approaches for inducing the death of tumor cells in which the expression of prosurvival family members is elevated or deregulated. BL41-3, a spontaneously derived subline of BL41 Burkitt lymphoma cells, was found to have amplified the prosurvival MCL1 gene (3-fold) and overexpressed the MCL1 protein. The level of MCL1 protein was 5-fold elevated compared with ML-1 cells expressing maximal MCL1 on exposure to phorbol-12-myristate-13- acetate. To assess whether this increase in MCL1 expression was associated with enhanced protection from cell death, cells were exposed to conditions of growth factor deprivation or to various cytotoxic agents. Whereas BL41-3 and BL41 cells exhibited similar growth rates in logarithmic phase, BL41-3 cells remained largely viable on reaching saturation phase in contrast to BL41 cells, which began to die. Similarly, the BL41-3 subline remained viable for an extended period under conditions of reduced serum. BL41-3 cells were also more resistant to the apoptosis-inducing effects of etoposide, camptothecin, and staurosporine (>3-fold more than BL41 cells). Unexpectedly, these cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, but only on exposure for an extended period (>10-fold more sensitive than BL41 cells with a 24-h but not a 6-h exposure). Thus, whereas cells expressing prosurvival BCL2 family members are frequently resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, the findings presented here, using a cell line exhibiting amplification and overexpression of MCL1, indicate that such cells may exhibit increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic regimens.","['Vrana, Julie A', 'Bieszczad, Christine K', 'Cleaveland, Emily S', 'Ma, Yan', 'Park, Jonathan P', 'Mohandas, Thuluvancheri K', 'Craig, Ruth W']","['Vrana JA', 'Bieszczad CK', 'Cleaveland ES', 'Ma Y', 'Park JP', 'Mohandas TK', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Pharmacology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-3835, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA057359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI 07363/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Topoisomerase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Staurosporine/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Feb 1;62(3):892-900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are reported 2 novel chromosome 7p15 targets of the t(7;11)(p15;p15) chromosomal translocation in 2 patients with CML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of leukemia cell DNA failed to show rearrangement of HOXA9, whereas NUP98 was found to be rearranged in both cases. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis using a NUP98 primer and a degenerate primer corresponding to the third helix of the homeodomain of HOXA demonstrated that NUP98 was fused in-frame to HOXA11 in the patient with CML and to HOXA13 in the patient with MDS. The chromosomal breakpoints on 7p15 were located within introns of HOXA11 or HOXA13 genes. In both patients chimeric NUP98-HOXA9 transcripts were also observed. These findings suggest that AbdB-type HOXA genes are common targets of t(7;11)(p15;p15) chromosomal translocations and that a single translocation can produce more than one NUP98-HOXA fusion gene, presumably because of altered splicing.","['Fujino, Takashi', 'Suzuki, Akitaka', 'Ito, Yoshikazu', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma', 'Hatano, Yoshiaki', 'Miura, Ikuo', 'Nakamura, Takuro']","['Fujino T', 'Suzuki A', 'Ito Y', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Hatano Y', 'Miura I', 'Nakamura T']","['Department of Carcinogenesis, The Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HOXA11 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA11 fusion protein, human)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA13 fusion protein, human)', '0 (NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA13)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1428-33. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1428.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1428 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38241-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase has been shown to mediate terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. Interestingly, Bcr-Abl(+) CML cell lines established from blast crisis were found to have low Erk MAP kinase activity. In this study, we analyzed the role of the Gab2 docking protein in regulation of the Erk MAP kinase in Bcr-Abl(+) K562 human CML cells. Overexpression of Gab2 in K562 cells resulted in transcriptional activation of the c-fos serum response element (SRE) promoter, whereas overexpression of SHP2, Grb2, and CrkL had no effect. Activation of the c-fos SRE transcriptional activity by Gab2 required tyrosine 604, which is a SHP2 docking site on Gab2, and the SHP2 tyrosine phosphatase activity. Elk1, c-Jun, and CHOP trans-reporting assays indicated that overexpression of Gab2 selectively activated the Erk2-Elk1 signaling pathway. To determine cellular consequences of elevating the Gab2 level in K562 cells, stable cell lines for doxycycline-inducible expression of the wild-type Gab2 (Gab2WT) and an SHP2-binding defective Gab2 (Gab2Tyr604Phe) were established. Analysis of these cell lines indicated that induction of Gab2WT expression, but not Gab2Tyr604Phe expression, led to Erk activation, growth arrest, cell spreading, and enlargement; expression of megakaryocyte/platelet lineage-specific integrins alphaIIb/beta3 (CD41/CD61); and upregulation of RNA for megakaryocyte/platelet proteins. All of these changes are characteristics of megakaryocytic differentiation.

Inactivation of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) plays an important role in AraC resistance in vitro. We have identified inactive, alternatively spliced dCK forms in leukemic blasts from patients with resistant AML. Because these dCK-spliced variants were only detectable in resistant AML, it was hypothesized that they might play a role in AraC resistance in vivo. In the current study, the biologic role of the alternatively spliced dCK forms in AraC resistance was further investigated by retroviral transductions in rat leukemic cells. Introduction of inactive, alternatively spliced dCK forms into AraC-resistant K7 cells, with no endogenous wild-type (wt) dCK activity, could not restore AraC sensitivity, whereas wt dCK fully restored the AraC-sensitive phenotype. Transfection of alternatively spliced dCK forms into AraC-sensitive KA cells, as well as in human leukemic U937 cells and in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells, did not significantly change sensitivity toward AraC. In addition, cotransduction of wt dCK with alternatively spliced dCK in K7 cells did not result in altered sensitivity to AraC compared with K7 cells only transduced with wt dCK. These data indicate that the alternatively spliced dCK forms cannot act as a dominant-negative inhibitor on dCK wt activity when they are coexpressed in a single cell. However, a cell expressing alternatively spliced dCK forms that has lost wt dCK expression is resistant to the cytotoxic effects of AraC.","['Veuger, Marjan J T', 'Heemskerk, Mirjam H M', 'Honders, M Willy', 'Willemze, Roel', 'Barge, Renee M Y']","['Veuger MJ', 'Heemskerk MH', 'Honders MW', 'Willemze R', 'Barge RM']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. m.j.t.veuger@lumc.nl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alternative Splicing/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1373-80. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1373.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1373 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38235-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation analyses of RUNX1 in 3 families with FPD/AML showing linkage to chromosome 21q22.1 revealed 3 novel heterozygous point mutations (K83E, R135fsX177 (IVS4 + 3delA), and Y260X). Functional investigations of the 7 FPD/AML RUNX1 Runt domain point mutations described to date (2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 missense mutations) were performed. Consistent with the position of the mutations in the Runt domain at the RUNX1-DNA interface, DNA binding of all mutant RUNX1 proteins was absent or significantly decreased. In general, missense and nonsense RUNX1 proteins retained the ability to heterodimerize with PEBP2beta/CBFbeta and inhibited transactivation of a reporter gene by wild-type RUNX1. Colocalization of mutant RUNX1 and PEBP2beta/CBFbeta in the cytoplasm was observed. These results suggest that the sequestration of PEBP2beta/CBFbeta by mutant RUNX1 may cause the inhibitory effects. While haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 causes FPD/AML in some families (deletions and frameshifts), mutant RUNX1 proteins (missense and nonsense) may also inhibit wild-type RUNX1, possibly creating a higher propensity to develop leukemia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a second mutation has to occur, either in RUNX1 or another gene, to cause leukemia among individuals harboring RUNX1 FPD/AML mutations and that the propensity to acquire these additional mutations is determined, at least partially, by the initial RUNX1 mutation.","['Michaud, Joelle', 'Wu, Feng', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Cottles, Gregory M', 'Yanagida, Masatoshi', 'Asou, Norio', 'Shigesada, Katsuya', 'Ito, Yoshiaki', 'Benson, Kathleen F', 'Raskind, Wendy H', 'Rossier, Colette', 'Antonarakis, Stylianos E', 'Israels, Sara', 'McNicol, Archie', 'Weiss, Harvey', 'Horwitz, Marshall', 'Scott, Hamish S']","['Michaud J', 'Wu F', 'Osato M', 'Cottles GM', 'Yanagida M', 'Asou N', 'Shigesada K', 'Ito Y', 'Benson KF', 'Raskind WH', 'Rossier C', 'Antonarakis SE', 'Israels S', 'McNicol A', 'Weiss H', 'Horwitz M', 'Scott HS']","['Division of Medical Genetics, Geneva University Medical School, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['DK55820/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK58161/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blood Platelet Disorders/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Point Mutation/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1364-72. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1364.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1364 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38234-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four mutations were novel (Lys207Asn, Gly289Arg, Arg294Trp, and Pro407Ser), whereas one had been previously identified (Arg272Gln; normal RARalpha1 codon assignment). Five patients were treated with repeat RA plus phenylbutyrate (PB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and one patient experienced a prolonged clinical remission. Of the 5 RA + PB-treated patients, 4 had PML-RARalpha mutations. The Gly289Arg mutation in the clinical responder produced the most defective PML-RARalpha function in the presence of RA with or without sodium butyrate (NaB) or trichostatin A. Relapse APL cells from this patient failed to differentiate in response to RA but partially differentiated in response to NaB alone, which was augmented by RA. In contrast, NaB alone had no differentiation effect on APL cells from another mutant case (Pro407Ser) but enhanced differentiation induced by RA. These results indicate that PML-RARalpha mutations occurred with high frequency after multiple RA treatment relapses, indicate that the functional potential of PML-RARalpha was not correlated with clinical response to RA + PB treatment, and suggest that the response to RA + PB therapy in one patient was related to the ability of PB to circumvent the blocked RA-regulated gene response pathway.","['Zhou, Da-Cheng', 'Kim, Soon H', 'Ding, Wei', 'Schultz, Cynthia', 'Warrell, Raymond P Jr', 'Gallagher, Robert E']","['Zhou DC', 'Kim SH', 'Ding W', 'Schultz C', 'Warrell RP Jr', 'Gallagher RE']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Butyrates/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phenylbutyrates/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Recurrence', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1356-63. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1356.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1356 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38233-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spliced Ikaros isoforms 4 to 8 (Ik4-8) suppress the function of full-length Ik1 or Ik2 in a dominant-negative manner, owing to their reduced numbers of DNA binding sites. Thus, dominant-negative Ikaros isoforms may inhibit the normal transcriptional regulation of hematopoietic cell development. To clarify the function of Ik6 in developing blood cells, this isoform was transiently transfected into an Ik2(+), interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent 32D murine myeloid precursor cell line and studied the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins in relation to in vitro cell growth, using a tetracycline-inducible TREx system. The possibility of aberrant cell regulation due to Ikaros functional changes was examined by cotransfecting both Ik2 and Ik6 into Ikaros/Aiolos/Helios triple-negative Cos-7 cells. The results demonstrated IL-3-independent growth by Ik6-transfected 32D clones coincident with up-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL. Up-regulation of Bcl-XL, but not of other Bcl-2 family proteins, was associated with the suppression of functional Ik2 by Ik6 in a dominant-negative fashion. Thus, the pathogenesis of myelomonocytic/monocytic AML may involve aberrant regulation of apoptosis due to unscheduled expression of the Ik6 isoform.","['Yagi, Tomohito', 'Hibi, Shigeyoshi', 'Takanashi, Mami', 'Kano, Gen', 'Tabata, Yasuhiro', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Inaba, Tohru', 'Morimoto, Akira', 'Todo, Shinjiro', 'Imashuku, Shinsaku']","['Yagi T', 'Hibi S', 'Takanashi M', 'Kano G', 'Tabata Y', 'Imamura T', 'Inaba T', 'Morimoto A', 'Todo S', 'Imashuku S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Department of Clinical Laboratory and Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. tyagi@gan2.res.ncc.go.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blood Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Female', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1350-5. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1350.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1350 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38232-X [pii]']",,,,"['Blood. 2002 Aug 15;100(4):1511-2; 1512-3.

Infiltration of various tissues by circulating leukemic cells is a characteristic of ATL. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which mediate the degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, play an important role in metastasis and tumor cell dissemination. The aim of this study was to explore whether expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was deregulated by HTLV-I infection. The data showed that HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines expressed high levels of MMP-9 compared with uninfected T-cell lines. In contrast, the levels of the related MMP-2 were not significantly altered by HTLV-I infection. In addition, the elevated expression of MMP-9 in HTLV-I-infected cells was attributable to the action of the viral transactivator protein Tax. The results show that Tax can activate the MMP-9 promoter and induce MMP-9 expression in T cells, indicating that the constitutive expression of MMP-9 in virus-infected cell lines is at least in part mediated by Tax. Activation of the MMP-9 promoter by Tax occurs mainly through the action of NF-kappaB and SP-1. The biologic significance of these observations was validated by the following 2 findings: MMP-9 expression was increased in primary ATL cells, and plasma MMP-9 levels were elevated in ATL patients. In addition, plasma levels of MMP-9 correlated with organ involvement in ATL patients. Together these data suggest that overexpression of MMP-9 in HTLV-I- infected cells may be in part responsible for the invasiveness of ATL cells.","['Mori, Naoki', 'Sato, Hiroshi', 'Hayashibara, Toshihisa', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Hayashi, Tomayoshi', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Ikeda, Shuichi', 'Yamasaki, Yoshihiro', 'Morikawa, Shigeru', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Geleziunas, Romas', 'Yamamoto, Naoki']","['Mori N', 'Sato H', 'Hayashibara T', 'Senba M', 'Hayashi T', 'Yamada Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Ikeda S', 'Yamasaki Y', 'Morikawa S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Geleziunas R', 'Yamamoto N']","['Departments of Preventive Medicine and AIDS Research, and Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan. n-mori@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '6QYI7Y8OBO (mitopodozide)', '9000-55-9 (Podophyllin)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/blood/*genetics/physiology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Podophyllin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Podophyllotoxin/analogs & derivatives', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1341-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1341.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1341 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38231-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was hypothesized that abnormalties in C/EBPalpha function contribute to the development of malignancies in a variety of tissues. To test this, genomic DNA from 408 patient samples and 5 cell lines representing 11 different cancers was screened for mutations in the C/EBPalpha gene. Two silent polymorphisms termed P1 and P2 were present at frequencies of 13.5% and 2.2%, respectively.

Some mutations truncated the predicted protein with loss of the DNA-binding (basic region) and dimerization (leucine zipper [ZIP]) domains by either deletions or nonsense codons. Also, inframe deletions or insertions in the fork region located between the leucine zipper and basic region, or within the leucine zipper, disrupted the alpha-helical phase of the bZIP domain. The inframe deletion and insertion mutations abrogated the transcriptional activation function of C/EBPalpha on the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter. These mutants localized properly to the nucleus, but were unable to bind to the C/EBP site in the promoter and did not possess dominant-negative activity. The mutations in the MDS patient and one AML-M2 patient were biallelic, indicating a loss of C/EBPalpha function. These results suggest that mutation of C/EBPalpha is involved in specific subtypes of AML and in MDS, but may occur rarely in other types of leukemias or nonhematologic malignancies.","['Gombart, Adrian F', 'Hofmann, Wolf-K', 'Kawano, Seiji', 'Takeuchi, Seisho', 'Krug, Utz', 'Kwok, Scott H', 'Larsen, Renee J', 'Asou, Hiroya', 'Miller, Carl W', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Gombart AF', 'Hofmann WK', 'Kawano S', 'Takeuchi S', 'Krug U', 'Kwok SH', 'Larsen RJ', 'Asou H', 'Miller CW', 'Hoelzer D', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Burns and Allen Research Institute, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine, 90048, USA. gombarta@csmc.edu']",['eng'],['CA26038-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/*genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1332-40. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1332.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1332 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38230-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was recently reported that DSP30, a phosphorothioate CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) induces immunogenicity of B-CLL cells by up-regulation of CD25 and other antigens. The present study investigated the antitumor activity of LMB-2 in the presence of DSP30. To this end, B-CLL cells from peripheral blood of patients were isolated immunomagnetically to more than 98% purity. Incubation with DSP30 for 48 hours augmented CD25 expression in 14 of 15 B-CLL samples, as assessed by flow cytometry. DSP30 increased LMB-2 cytotoxicity dose dependently whereas a control ODN with no CpG motif did not. LMB-2 displayed no antitumor cell activity in the absence of CpG-ODN as determined colorimetrically with an (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium, inner salt (MTS) assay. In contrast, B-CLL growth was inhibited in 12 of 13 samples with 50% inhibition concentrations (IC(50)) in the range of LMB-2 plasma levels achieved in clinical studies. Two samples were not evaluable because of spontaneous B-CLL cell death in the presence of DSP30. Control experiments with an immunotoxin that does not recognize hematopoietic cells, and an anti-CD22 immunotoxin, confirmed that sensitization to LMB-2 was specifically due to up-regulation of CD25. LMB-2 was much less toxic to normal B and T lymphocytes compared with B-CLL cells. In summary, immunostimulatory CpG-ODNs efficiently sensitize B-CLL cells to a recombinant immunotoxin by modulation of its target. This new treatment strategy deserves further attention.","['Decker, Thomas', 'Hipp, Susanne', 'Kreitman, Robert J', 'Pastan, Ira', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Licht, Thomas']","['Decker T', 'Hipp S', 'Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I', 'Peschel C', 'Licht T']","['3rd Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. t.decker@lrz.tum.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (B3(Fv)-PE38KDEL recombinant immunotoxin)', '0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Thionucleotides)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Exotoxins', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis/drug effects/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1320-6.,,,['S0006-4971(20)38228-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In B-cell lines, such antibodies also induce apoptosis. In this study, the expression and function of CD20 on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells were analyzed. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that B-CLL cells express CD20 with a fluorescence intensity that is significantly weaker than that of normal CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells and that of malignant CD5(-) low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells. A small population of cells from healthy donors that have an expression pattern of CD5 and CD20 identical to that of B-CLL cells were identified, and this population was confirmed to be of T lineage, not B lineage. Culture of freshly isolated B-CLL cells in the presence of the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab and a cross-linking F(ab)(2) fragment, resulted in dose- and time-dependent induction of apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis occurred under conditions in which the influence of complement activation and ADCC was negligible. Cross-linking of rituximab induced strong and sustained phosphorylation of the 3 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38. Introduction of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 into the system completely blocked signaling downstream of p38, as evidenced by the absence of MAPKAP K2 activity, and significantly reduced the degree of anti-CD20-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrate that cross-linking of rituximab bound to CD20 on freshly isolated B-CLL cells induces apoptosis through a signaling pathway that is dependent on p38 MAP-kinase activation.","['Pedersen, Irene Munk', 'Buhl, Anne Mette', 'Klausen, Pia', 'Geisler, Christian H', 'Jurlander, Jesper']","['Pedersen IM', 'Buhl AM', 'Klausen P', 'Geisler CH', 'Jurlander J']","['Leukemia Laboratory, Department of Hematology, The Finsen Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1314-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1314.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1314 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38227-6 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A significant correlation was found between the MRD level on day 15 (D15) and day 29 (D29) after the start of induction therapy (r(s) = 0.70, P <.0001). The 15 patients with T-cell disease had higher D29 MRD than those with B-lineage ALL (P =.01). Age was positively related to D29 MRD (r(s) = 0.32, P =.001). The 16 patients who had a relapse had higher D15 and D29 MRD levels than the patients who stayed in remission (median levels D15, 1% versus 0.1%, P =.03; D29, 0.4% versus 0.01%, P =.0001). No patients with a MRD level less than 0.01% on D29 have so far had a relapse, whereas the 7-year probability of event-free survival for patients with higher MRD levels was 0.52 (P =.0007). The group of patients with a D29 MRD less than 0.01% included patients with T-cell disease, white blood cell count more than 50 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis, or age 10 years or older, and could not be identified by up-front criteria. The best-fit Cox model to predict the risk of relapse included D29 MRD (P =.004) and age (P =.009). These findings indicate that with the present treatment protocol MRD quantification at an early stage of therapy identifies patients with a very low risk of relapse. Further trials are needed to reveal whether such patients with D29 MRD less than 0.01% can be cured with less intensive chemotherapy, which would reduce the risk of serious late effects as well as the costs of therapy.","['Nyvold, Charlotte', 'Madsen, Hans O', 'Ryder, Lars P', 'Seyfarth, Jeanette', 'Svejgaard, Arne', 'Clausen, Niels', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Nyvold C', 'Madsen HO', 'Ryder LP', 'Seyfarth J', 'Svejgaard A', 'Clausen N', 'Wesenberg F', 'Jonsson OG', 'Forestier E', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Department of Pediatrics, National University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1253-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1253.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1253 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38219-7 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,['Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology'],,,,

To test this hypothesis, an ODN targeted to the c-myb proto-oncogene was developed and used to purge marrow autografts administered to allograft-ineligible chronic myelogenous leukemia patients. CD34(+) marrow cells were purged with ODN for either 24 (n = 19) or 72 (n = 5) hours. After purging, Myb mRNA levels declined substantially in approximately 50% of patients. Analysis of bcr/abl expression in long-term culture-initiating cells suggested that purging had been accomplished at a primitive cell level in more than 50% of patients and was ODN dependent. Day-100 cytogenetics were evaluated in surviving patients who engrafted without infusion of unmanipulated ""backup"" marrow (n = 14). Whereas all patients were approximately 100% Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) before transplantation, 2 patients had complete cytogenetic remissions; 3 patients had fewer than 33% Ph(+) metaphases; and 8 remained 100% Ph(+). One patient's marrow yielded no metaphases, but fluorescent in situ hybridization evaluation approximately 18 months after transplantation revealed approximately 45% bcr/abl(+) cells, suggesting that 6 of 14 patients had originally obtained a major cytogenetic response. Conclusions regarding clinical efficacy of ODN marrow purging cannot be drawn from this small pilot study. Nevertheless, these results lead to the speculation that enhanced delivery of ODN, targeted to critical proteins of short half-life, might lead to the development of more effective nucleic acid drugs and the enhanced clinical utility of these compounds in the future.","['Luger, Selina M', ""O'Brien, Stephen G"", 'Ratajczak, Janina', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z', 'Mick, Rosemarie', 'Stadtmauer, Edward A', 'Nowell, Peter C', 'Goldman, John M', 'Gewirtz, Alan M']","['Luger SM', ""O'Brien SG"", 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Mick R', 'Stadtmauer EA', 'Nowell PC', 'Goldman JM', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology and the Stem Cell Biology/Therapeutics Program, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA72765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA66731/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, myb/*drug effects/genetics', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Autologous/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/04/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 15;99(4):1150-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.4.1150.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.4.1150 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38206-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I.v. injection of a beta-galactosidase-expressing RV at 3 days after birth resulted in transduction of 9% of hepatocytes. Prior treatment with human hepatocyte growth factor at 2.5 mg/kg did not increase transduction.

Neonatal dogs with mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) received an i.v.injection of an RV containing the canine beta-glucuronidase (cGUSB) cDNA. At several months after transduction, clusters of hepatocytes that expressed high levels of cGUSB were present in the liver, which probably derived from replication of transduced hepatocytes. At 6 months after transduction, serum GUSB levels were 73% that of homozygous normal dogs and were 34% of the peak values observed at 1 week.

We characterized the effect of transplanted donor mononuclear cells on relapse- and event-free survival after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). We studied 113 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies who received non-T-cell-depleted BMT from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings. Most patients (n = 103) received busulfan (Myleran)-based conditioning, and all patients received standard short-course methotrexate and tacrolimus (Prograf) as graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis. Sixty-four patients had low-risk diagnoses (acute lymphoblastic leukemia/acute myeloid leukemia [first complete remission], myelodysplastic syndrome [refractory anemia/refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts], and chronic myeloid leukemia [first chronic phase]); 49 patients had high-risk diagnoses (all others). Cox regression analyses evaluated risk strata, age, gender, and the numbers of nucleated cells, CD3-positive T cells, CD34-positive hematopoietic cells, and type 2 dendritic cells (DC2) as covariates for event-free survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality. Recipients of larger numbers of DC2 cells had significantly lower event-free survival, a lower incidence of chronic graft-vs-host disease, and an increased incidence of relapse. Recipients of larger numbers of CD34-positive cells had improved event-free survival; recipients of fewer CD34-positive cells had delayed hematopoietic engraftment and increased death from infections. In conclusion, content of donor DC2 cells was associated with decreased chronic graft-vs-host disease and graft-vs-leukemia effects consistent with Th2/Tc2 polarization of donor Tcells following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Waller, Edmund K', 'Rosenthal, Hilary', 'Sagar, Lonial']","['Waller EK', 'Rosenthal H', 'Sagar L']","['Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncology (Williston Park),"Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)",8712059,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/07 10:00,2002/07/26 10:01,['2002/02/07 10:00'],"['2002/02/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/07 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncology (Williston Park). 2002 Jan;16(1 Suppl 1):19-26.,,52,['162766 [pii]'],,,,['Oncology (Williston Park). 2002 Jan;16(1 Suppl 1):7-9.

The central diphenylfuran core of furimidazoline has been replaced with a trithiophene (DB358) or a trifuran (DB669) unit and the terminal imidazoline groups were preserved. The strength and mode of binding of the drugs to nucleic acids were investigated by complementary spectroscopic techniques including spectrophotometric, surface plasmon resonance, circular and linear dichroism measurements. The trifuran derivative forms intercalation complexes with double-stranded DNA, whereas the mode of binding of the trithiophene derivative varies depending on the drug/DNA ratio, as independently confirmed by NMR spectroscopic studies performed with (A-T)7 and (G-C)7 oligomers. Two-dimensional NMR data provided a molecular model for the binding of DB358 within the minor groove of the AATT sequence of the decanucleotide d(GCGAATTCGC)(2). DNase I footprinting experiments confirmed the sequence-dependent binding of DB358 to DNA. The trithiophene derivative interacts preferentially with AT-rich sequences at low concentrations, but can accomodate GC sites at higher concentrations. DNA relaxation assays revealed that DB358 stimulated DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, in contrast to DB669. The substitution of N-alkylamidines for the imidazoline terminal groups abolished the capacity of the drug to poison topoisomerase II. At the cellular level, flow cytometry analysis indicated that DB358, which is about six times more cytotoxic than the trifuran analogue, induced a significant accumulation of HL-60 human leukemia cells in the G2/M phase. The incorporation of thiophene heterocycles appears as a convenient procedure to limit the strict AT selectivity of dications containing an extended unfused aromatic system and to design cytotoxic DNA intercalating agents acting as poisons for human topoisomerase II.","['Bilik, P', 'Tanious, F', 'Kumar, A', 'Wilson, W D', 'Boykin, D W', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Facompre, M', 'Tardy, C', 'Bailly, C']","['Bilik P', 'Tanious F', 'Kumar A', 'Wilson WD', 'Boykin DW', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Facompre M', 'Tardy C', 'Bailly C']","['Department of Chemistry, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, USA.']",['eng'],['GM61587/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Chembiochem,Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology,100937360,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (DB358)', '0 (DB669)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (furimidazoline)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/*chemistry', 'Cations, Divalent', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'DNA Footprinting', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Furans/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Thiophenes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2002/02/06 10:00,2002/05/01 10:01,['2002/02/06 10:00'],"['2002/02/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chembiochem. 2001 Aug 3;2(7-8):559-69. doi: 10.1002/1439-7633(20010803)2:7/8<559::AID-CBIC559>3.0.CO;2-U.,,,"['10.1002/1439-7633(20010803)2:7/8<559::AID-CBIC559>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/1439-7633(20010803)2:7/8<559::AID-CBIC559>3.0.CO;2-U [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve housekeeping genes commonly used as controls in classical expression studies (including GAPD, ACTB, B2M, TUBA, G6PD, LDHA, and HPRT) show considerable variability of expression both within and across microarray datasets. Although we can identify genes with lower variability within individual datasets by heuristic filtering, such genes invariably show different expression levels when compared across other microarray datasets. We confirm these results with an analysis of variance in a controlled mouse dataset, showing the extent of variability in gene expression across tissues. The results show the problems inherent in the classical use of control genes in estimating gene expression levels in different mammalian cell contexts, and highlight the importance of controlled study design in the construction of microarray experiments.","['Lee, Peter D', 'Sladek, Robert', 'Greenwood, Celia M T', 'Hudson, Thomas J']","['Lee PD', 'Sladek R', 'Greenwood CM', 'Hudson TJ']","['Montreal Genome Centre, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal H3G 1A4, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Profiling/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', '*Genes, Regulator', '*Genetic Variation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",PMC155273,2002/02/06 10:00,2002/03/15 10:01,['2002/02/06 10:00'],"['2002/02/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/06 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2002 Feb;12(2):292-7. doi: 10.1101/gr.217802.,,,['10.1101/gr.217802 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the following three obvious toxicities were displayed in KG-1, they were observed only minimally in U937. These were: a dramatic arrest at the G2/M phase indicated by a marked increase in both the number of G2/M cells and the expression of cyclin B1, cdc2, and mitotic phosphoprotein monoclonal-2 (MPM-2)-reactive proteins; a severe apoptosis shown by a marked increase in the number of cells with hypo-diploid DNA and DNA fragmentation; and as a result, a severe inhibition of cell growth and proliferation measured by the MTT test and [(3)H]-thymidine uptake assay. As expected, KG-1 exhibited a significant increase in the 8-hydroxyguanine level in DNA whereas U937 did not.

The QLQ-C30 questionnaire was administered also after 4, 8, 16 and 20 months. Tape-recorded open-ended interviews were conducted every 4 months before the patients responded to the questionnaires.

This difference remained throughout the study period. There was no correspondence in responses between questionnaire and personal interviews, although the results from the interviews, in some aspects, validated the result from the QLQ-C30. Those patients who relapsed may have had different prerequisites or been in a worse position at the onset of the disease and, reasonably, they needed more compensatory nursing care.

METHOD: Secondary analysis of patient-level data for all cases of DRG 780 separated from Victorian hospitals with clinical costing systems in the years 1994/95, 1995/96 and 1996/97 using the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) option of Answer Tree Version 2.0. RESULTS: Different cancers have different costs. There is a significant difference (F=316.8, df=4, 11091, p=0.00) between the cost of colon cancer (mean=$289), breast cancer (mean=$481), lymphatic cancer (mean=$605), leukemia (mean=$1,118) and other cancers (mean=$512). The differences are sufficiently large that they meet the statistical criteria for splitting a DRG. CONCLUSION: Application of nationally agreed criteria for creation of Diagnosis Related Groups suggests that the existing DRG 780 should be split into five groups: colon, breast and lymphatic cancers, leukemia and a residual 'other cancers' category. The new groups increase the explanation of variation in costs (about a 10% reduction in variance).

The results suggest the possibility that alexithymic characteristics may be predictive of the manifestation of avoidance and emotional numbing among posttraumatic stress responses following medical treatment for refractory hematological diseases.","['Fukunishi, I', 'Tsuruta, T', 'Hirabayashi, N', 'Asukai, N']","['Fukunishi I', 'Tsuruta T', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Asukai N']","['Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry, Tokyo Metropolitan Organization for Medical Research, Japan. fukunisi@prit.go.jp']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Psychol Rep,Psychological reports,0376475,,IM,"['Affective Symptoms/diagnosis/*psychology', 'Child', 'Disasters', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*psychology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Personality Assessment', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', '*Sick Role', 'Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/diagnosis/*psychology']",,2002/02/05 10:00,2002/03/15 10:01,['2002/02/05 10:00'],"['2002/02/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychol Rep. 2001 Dec;89(3):527-34. doi: 10.2466/pr0.2001.89.3.527.,,,['10.2466/pr0.2001.89.3.527 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of Down's syndrome involves reactive oxygen species arising from a mutation in gene encoding, which disproportionately elevates superoxide dismutase activity. Reactive oxygen species and total antioxidant capacity were evaluated using two new spectrophotometric methods in a selected group of 40 children with Down's syndrome and in 20 apparently healthy children used as controls. Reactive oxygen species were significantly higher (p <0.05) in children with Down's syndrome than in controls: 452 (+/- 72) U.Carr vs. 270 (+/- 66) U.Carr respectively. Total antioxidant capacity was significantly higher (p <0.05) in controls than in children with Down's syndrome: 380 (+/- 52) micromol hypochlorous acid (HCLO)/ml vs. 281 (+/- 33) micromol HCLO/ml, respectively. In fact, thiol groups (sulfhydryl) were significantly higher (p <0.05) in controls than in children with Down's syndrome: 644 (+/- 78) micromol/l vs. 462 (+/- 54) micromol/l, respectively Our data show how to simply measure chemical indices of oxidative status in serum samples from children with Down's syndrome. We determined the plasmatic activities of reactive oxygen metabolites and oxidative defense molecules. Accumulated macromolecular damage may be one of the causes of some of the abnormalities that are considered part of the syndrome. Therefore, children with Down's syndrome have to cope with a significant prooxidant environment. Oxidative stress causes alterations such as atherosclerosis, early aging, immunological default and neurologic disorders in Down's syndrome patients. The new test available for measuring reactive oxygen species in serum proved to be reliable and useful as an early marker of tissue damage.","['Carratelli, M', 'Porcaro, L', 'Ruscica, M', 'De Simone, E', 'Bertelli, A A', 'Corsi, M M']","['Carratelli M', 'Porcaro L', 'Ruscica M', 'De Simone E', 'Bertelli AA', 'Corsi MM']","['Diacron S.r.l., Diagnostic Division, Grosseto, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int J Clin Pharmacol Res,International journal of clinical pharmacology research,8110183,"['0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Down Syndrome/blood/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oxidants/*blood', 'Oxidative Stress/physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/blood']",,2002/02/05 10:00,2002/07/16 10:01,['2002/02/05 10:00'],"['2002/02/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Res. 2001;21(2):79-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leptin was identified as the gene of ob/ob mouse in genetic obesity syndromes. It has very strong food intake control, and body weight and energy expenditure. The name ""leptin"" derived from the Greek word leptos, meaning ""thin."" We hereby review major advances leading to our current finding of leptin, leptin receptor and its structure, the outline of homozygote, and also influence of leptin in the pituitary. (The structure of leptin) The mouse obese gene has been localized to chromosome 6. With human leptin gene on chromosome 7q31.3, its DNA has more than 15000 base pairs and consists of three exons and two introns. For bioactivation of leptin the importance of disulfide-binding site is suggested. Human leptin which replaced the 128-th arginine with glutamine has the function of an aldosteron antagonist, which is reported to have the function of athrocytosis inhibition. The resemblance of leptin precursor of human, mouse and rat is very high, i.e., mouse and rat homology is 96% and mouse and human homology is 83%. (The structure of leptin receptor) The mutant gene, which is the cause of obesity, was shown on map on diabetic mouse (db/db) chromosome 4, and it was proven to be the same as the leptin receptor gene cloned by Tartaglia et all. Further studies have found the Zucker fatty rat (fa/fa) to be incorporated into a linkage map of rat chromosome 5, whose region of rat is the equivalent to the region of conserved synteny of the db/db mouse gene. The leptin receptor is glycoprotein consisting of a single transmembrane-spanning component. The primary structure of leptin receptor belongs to the cytokine-class1 family, the single membrane-spanning receptor, and is highly related to the gp130 signal-transducing component of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor, and the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor. The leptin receptor is known to have at least six existing isoforms (Ob-Ra, b, c, d, e, f) from the difference in splicing. (Homozygote Mutation of Leptin and Leptin Receptor :Hormone Secretion Disorders) The point mutation of ob/ob mouse and the splicing mutation of db/db mouse show remarkable obesity and hyperphagia. These obesity models show a reproduction disorder with both the male and the female, and they develop with homozygote. The cause is thought to be the gonadotropin secretory abnormality in pituitary. Three family lines report the cases of this deficiency, and it is considered that the secretory abnormality in pituitary develops into hypogonadotropic. These patients show low value in plasma FSHbeta (follicle stimulating hormone-beta and LHbeta (luteinizing hormone-beta which are produced from pituitary, and the plasma GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) level is also low. Furthermore, the leptin receptor deficient family line was reported in 1998, in which case only the homozygote developed. The plasma leptin concentration of normal human is about 8.0 ng/ml, and this case with leptin receptor deficiency has high value of 500-700 ng/ml, which is the equivalent to the db/db mouse. (Role of Leptin in Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Periphery Function) The role of leptin which regulates pituitary hormones suggests the promotion the GHRH (growth hormone releasing hormone) secretion in hypothalamus-pituitary axis, with the possibility of the rise in secretion of GH (growth hormone) in pituitary, i.e. effects of icv (intracerebroventricular) infusion of leptin has spontaneously stimulated GHRH, which promotes GH secretion in the normal rats. On the other hand, topical treatment of GH3 (derived from a rat pituitary GH-secreting cell line) with leptin directly inhibits cell proliferation. The obesity model animals (ob/ob, db/db, fa/fa) have equally plump body compared to the normal models, which shows signs of sufficient growth. (Localization and Functional Relevance of Leptin and Leptin Receptor in Rodents Pituitary) Aside from being the food intake inhibitor and the energy control factor, leptin takes part in controlling the pituitary hormones. Promoting the secretion of GH, PRL (prolactin), TSHbeta (thyroid stimulating hormone-beta, FSHbeta/LHbeta, and inhibiting the secretion of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) are the major changes of pituitary hormones which are brought on by leptin. The expressive localization is specific, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) method recognized leptin in granular state in FSHbeta, LHbeta and TSHbeta positive cells. In our biochemical examination, the bulk of the expression of leptin is recognized in fraction of the secretory granule. In particular, FSHbeta cells had the highest percentage rate of colocalized leptin in rat pituitary. On the other hand, leptin receptor has been reported to be found only in normal rat pituitary, human pituitary adenoma, and respective cell lines in pituitaries by the RT-PCR method until now, but we disclosed for the first time the localization of leptin receptor on the plasma membrane of GH-secreting cells with the IHC method that has not been cleared so far. These findings show that leptin and leptin receptor have been expressed in different cells, and that the rat pituitary glands entertain paracrine mechanism between leptin (FSHbeta/LHbeta cells) and leptin receptor (GH cells). The function of paracrine in this pituitary suggests a new point of view in hypothalamus-pituitary axis, and it shall be concerned with many aspects such as hormone secretions and proliferation/inhibition. (Human Pituitary Adenoma) Preliminary report of leptin and leptin-receptor relationship with pituitary adenoma that has secretion abnormality has been filed, and its manifestation is being observed by the RT-PCR. Leptin and leptin receptor are expressed in most adenoma, and it is thought to function by autocrine and paracrine pathway in the adenomas. Leptin has been located in ACTH-secreting adenoma most frequently, especially in ACTH carcinoma. The leptin receptor is detected in all adenomas with high percentage rate, with both long and short forms, and then many cases of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, compared with other adenomas, have been reported to be positive with both long and short forms of leptin receptor as detected by RT-PCR. The HP75 cell line is derived from the nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, which produces FSHbeta and LHbeta. The expression of leptin receptor in nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma, and the suppression of HP75 multiplication may lead to the possible hypothesis of leptin becoming one factor for the treatment of pituitary adenoma, especially in gonadotropin adenomas.","['Sone, M', 'Osamura, R Y']","['Sone M', 'Osamura RY']","['Department of Pathology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pituitary,Pituitary,9814578,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (leptin receptor, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/physiology', 'Leptin/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation', 'Pituitary Gland/*physiology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'Rodentia/physiology']",,2002/02/05 10:00,2002/07/06 10:01,['2002/02/05 10:00'],"['2002/02/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/05 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pituitary. 2001 Jan-Apr;4(1-2):15-23. doi: 10.1023/a:1012978525492.,,64,['10.1023/a:1012978525492 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, CRT has always been associated with adverse cognitive side effects. Therefore, the impact of CRT on neuropsychological function in children with AML was retrospectively evaluated. PATIENTS: We tested 53 children (30 boys, 23 girls) treated according to the AML-BFM-87 protocol (median age at diagnosis: 8.5 years, range 0.3 - 17.5; median time since diagnosis: 5.7 yrs, 3.8 - 10.7 yrs). To avoid any bias from additional therapy elements, patients with relapse or initial CNS involvement and transplanted patients were excluded (n=32). Our cohort was representative of the total group of 104 long term survivors of study AML-BFM 87. CNS prophylaxis consisted of ARA-C i.th., high dose ARA-C i. v. and either no CRT (n=15) or CRT (n=38) at a dose of 12 - 18 Gy depending on age. METHODS: Neuropsychological function was evaluated by psychological tests of attention and concentration (test d2 by Brickenkamp) and an intelligence test (Progressive Matrices by Raven). In addition, patients and their parents were interviewed about the occurrence of learning problems, subjective deficits in concentration and physical impairment. RESULTS: In the total group, no significant differences were seen between irradiated and non-irradiated patients regarding the psychological tests. However, the irradiated patients scored below the non-irradiated control group in test ""d2"" (concentration: 41st vs. 59th percentile). In the interview, irradiated patients tended to report more learning problems (lp) (10/36 vs. 1/14; p=0.15) and subjective deficits in concentration (con). In irradiated girls (con: 6/15 vs. 0/8; p=0.06; lp: 5/15 vs. 0/8; p=0.12) and younger patients (0 - 5 years at diagnosis; con: 7/12 vs. 2/9; p=0.18; lp 3/10 vs. 1/9; p=0.18) this trend was even more pronounced. CONCLUSION: Children with AML and CRT had no significant intellectual impairment in standardized tests when compared to non-irradiated patients. However, more irradiated patients reported learning problems and subjective concentration deficits.","['Reinhardt, D', 'Thiele, C', 'Creutzig, U']","['Reinhardt D', 'Thiele C', 'Creutzig U']","['Padiatrische Hamatologie/Onkologie, Westfalischen-Wilhelms Universitat, Munster. dreinh@uni-muenster.de']",['ger'],,['Journal Article'],Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Attention/radiation effects', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Intelligence/radiation effects', 'Learning Disabilities/diagnosis/psychology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*radiotherapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Meninges/*pathology', '*Neuropsychological Tests', 'Radiation Injuries/*diagnosis/psychology', 'Risk Factors']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2002 Jan-Feb;214(1):22-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2002-19861.,Neuropsychologische Folgen der prophylaktischen ZNS-Bestrahlung bei Kindern mit akuter myeloischer Leukamie.,,['10.1055/s-2002-19861 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,['AML-BFM-Studiengruppe'],,,,

While cells expressing a constitutively active form of murine Notch1 (Notch1IC) completely lacked B cells, a profound suppression of the B lineage was also seen in the nontransduced compartment. Experiments performed with retroviral supernatants of varying titers showed that the perturbations of B cell development among the nontransduced population correlated with the percentage of Notch1IC-transduced cells inoculated into the mice. The myeloid lineage of the Notch1IC-transplanted mice was altered as well, and this also affected the nontransduced population that had features of excessive maturation. To explore the basis of these non-cell-autonomous modifications we prepared conditioned medium from ex vivo cultures of Notch1IC-transplanted mice bone marrow and showed that it inhibited B cell maturation and promoted myeloid differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we found that the T cell leukemia/lymphomas that occur in Notch1IC-transplanted mice were accompanied by abnormal maturation of nontransduced T cells in the bone marrow.

Pgp, the prototypical transmembrane transporter molecule, may also facilitate the migration of skin dendritic cells (DC). Vaults--ribonucleoprotein cell organelles, frequently overexpressed in Pgp-negative drug-resistant tumor cells--have also been associated with intracellular transport processes. Given the pivotal role of DC in dealing with exposure to potentially harmful substances, the present study was set out to examine the expression of Pgp and vaults during differentiation and maturation of DC. DC were obtained from different sources, including blood-derived monocytes, CD34(+) mononuclear cells, and chronic myeloid leukemia cells. Whereas flow cytometric and immunocytochemical analyses showed slightly augmented levels of Pgp, up-regulation of vault expression during DC culturing was strong, readily confirmed by Western blotting, and independent of the source of DC. In further exploring the functional significance of vault expression, it was found that supplementing DC cultures with polyclonal or mAbs against the major vault protein led to lower viabilities of LPS- or TNF-alpha-matured monocytes-DC. Moreover, expression of critical differentiation, maturation, and costimulatory molecules, including CD1a and CD83, was reduced and their capacity to induce Ag-specific T cell proliferative and IFN-gamma release responses was impaired.

In order to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for the cellular defects of ICSBP(-/-) mice, we used bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) to identify genes deregulated in the absence of ICSBP. Here, we report that disabled-2 (Dab2), a signal phosphoprotein, is transcriptionally up-regulated and accumulates in the cytoskeleton/membrane fraction of ICSBP(-/-) BMM. Moreover, our results revealed Dab2 as a novel IFN-gamma-response gene. Both ICSBP and the Ets-transcription factor PU.1 bind to the Dab2 promoter, whereby ICSBP represses PU.1-induced Dab2 promoter transactivation in vitro. Notably, repression of Dab2 expression by ICSBP is also found in myeloid progenitors. Overexpression of Dab2 leads to accelerated cell adhesion and spreading, accompanied by enhanced actin fiber formation. Furthermore, cell adhesion induces transient Dab2 phosphorylation and its translocation to the cytoskeletal/membrane fraction. Our results identify a novel role of Dab2 as an inducer of cell adhesion and spreading, and strongly suggest that the up-regulation of Dab2 contributes to the hematopoietic defect seen in ICSBP(-/-) mice.","['Rosenbauer, Frank', 'Kallies, Axel', 'Scheller, Marina', 'Knobeloch, Klaus-Peter', 'Rock, Charles O', 'Schwieger, Maike', 'Stocking, Carol', 'Horak, Ivan']","['Rosenbauer F', 'Kallies A', 'Scheller M', 'Knobeloch KP', 'Rock CO', 'Schwieger M', 'Stocking C', 'Horak I']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Institute of Molecular Pharmacology, and Benjamin Franklin Medical Center, Free University of Berlin, Krahmerstrasse 6, D-12207 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DAB2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'K562 Cells', 'Macrophages/cytology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC125345,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2002 Feb 1;21(3):211-20. doi: 10.1093/emboj/21.3.211.,,,['10.1093/emboj/21.3.211 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on their hydrolysis profile patterns, Lactobacillus alimentarius 15M, Lactobacillus brevis 14G, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis 7A, and Lactobacillus hilgardii 51B were selected and used in sourdough fermentation. A fractionated method of protein extraction and subsequent two-dimensional electrophoresis were used to estimate proteolysis in sourdoughs. Compared to a chemically acidified (pH 4.4) dough, 37 to 42 polypeptides, distributed over a wide range of pIs and molecular masses, were hydrolyzed by L. alimentarius 15M, L. brevis 14G, and L. sanfranciscensis 7A. Albumin, globulin, and gliadin fractions were hydrolyzed, while glutenins were not degraded. The concentrations of free amino acids, especially proline and glutamic and aspartic acids, also increased in sourdoughs. Compared to the chemically acidified dough, proteolysis by lactobacilli positively influenced the softening of the dough during fermentation, as determined by rheological analyses. Enzyme preparations of the selected lactobacilli which contained proteinase or peptidase enzymes showed hydrolysis of the 31-43 fragment of A-gliadin, a toxic peptide for celiac patients. A toxic peptic-tryptic (PT) digest of gliadins was used for in vitro agglutination tests on K 562 (S) subclone cells of human myelagenous leukemia origin. The lowest concentration of PT digest that agglutinated 100% of the total cells was 0.218 g/liter. Hydrolysis of the PT digest by proteolytic enzymes of L. alimentarius 15M and L. brevis 14G completely prevented agglutination of the K 562 (S) cells by the PT digest at a concentration of 0.875 g/liter. Considerable inhibitory effects by other strains and at higher concentrations of the PT digest were also found. The mixture of peptides produced by enzyme preparations of selected lactobacilli showed a decreased agglutination of K 562 (S) cells with respect to the whole 31-43 fragment of A-gliadin.","['Di Cagno, Raffaella', 'De Angelis, Maria', 'Lavermicocca, Paola', 'De Vincenzi, Massimo', 'Giovannini, Claudio', 'Faccia, Michele', 'Gobbetti, Marco']","['Di Cagno R', 'De Angelis M', 'Lavermicocca P', 'De Vincenzi M', 'Giovannini C', 'Faccia M', 'Gobbetti M']","['Dipartimento di Protezione delle Piante e Microbiologia Applicata, Facolta di Agraria di Bari, Via G.

The purpose of our research is to develop a new class of platinum-based anticancer drugs containing moieties of synergistic potency such as platinum core and a radiotherapeutic isotope which, delivered directly to the tumorous cells by a specifically designed vectors, should produce a local enhancement of therapeutic dose. Thus, we have synthesized a new platinum-iodohistamine complex and its radioactive analogues labeled with I-125 and I-131. In the present study some biological properties of those compounds have been investigated. The in vitro screening study pointed out that non-radioactive platinum-iodohistamine complex possesses high cytostatic activity against COLO-205 cells, and moderate activity against HL-60 cell line. No cytotoxicity was observed against MOLT-4 and L-1210 cells, as well as against VERO normal cells. The biodistribution of intravenously administered radioactive platinum-[131I]-iodohistamine complex to normal rats revealed the highest accumulation in the liver (c.a. 40%ID). Intraperitoneal injections of the complex to tumor-bearing C3H mice resulted in scattering of the dose in the organs (mainly in GIT, liver, kidney). The retention of radioactive complex in neoplastic tissue was 3-4 times higher than in normal muscular tissue, although exhibited the tendency to decrease with time post injection. The results of the present study show promising features of the newly developed platinum-iodohistamine complexes and justify prospective investigation of in vivo anticancer potency on animal models of solid tumors.","['Garnuszek, Piotr', 'Licianska, Iwona', 'Skierski, Janusz S', 'Koronkiewicz, Miroslawa', 'Mirowski, Marek', 'Wiercioch, Rafal', 'Mazurek, Aleksander P']","['Garnuszek P', 'Licianska I', 'Skierski JS', 'Koronkiewicz M', 'Mirowski M', 'Wiercioch R', 'Mazurek AP']","['Drug Institute, 30/34 Chelmska St., 00-725, Warsaw, Poland. pg@il.waw.pl']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nucl Med Biol,Nuclear medicine and biology,9304420,"['0 ((iodohistamine)platinum(II))', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia L1210/therapy', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/05/30 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/30 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Biol. 2002 Feb;29(2):169-75. doi: 10.1016/s0969-8051(01)00294-3.,,,"['S0969805101002943 [pii]', '10.1016/s0969-8051(01)00294-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To evaluate this mechanism we investigated HEL cells as a model system in which there is a marked increase in DNA content during megakaryocyte differentiation induced by phorbol-diesters. Specific cell-cycle phases were separated by centrifugal elutriation and SDS PAGE and Western analysis were performed to determine the relative abundance of these proteins. Kinase assays were carried out following immunoprecipitation of cellular lysates with the antibodies to the proteins. RESULTS: Polyploid HEL cells show an increase in the abundance of the CAK complex proteins, CDK7 and cyclin H, and a sixfold increase in CAK-specific activity. Increased CAK activity in polyploid HEL cells follows both the downregulation of p53 protein and its decreased association with CAK complex. Consistent with the reduction of p53, polyploid HEL cells undergo a dramatic increase in MDM2 protein abundance that in turn facilitates increased interaction of this protein with p53. CONCLUSION: These observations demonstrate that deregulated expression of MDM2 and p53 during megakaryocyte differentiation allow a relaxation of the control over genomic stability, allowing further replicative rounds of DNA synthesis.","['Datta, Nabanita S', 'Long, Michael W']","['Datta NS', 'Long MW']","['Department of Pediatrics and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Ploidies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/04/11 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Feb;30(2):158-65. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00780-9.,,,"['S0301472X01007809 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00780-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the effect of Cb2 overexpression on hematopoietic development in vivo, Cb2 transgenic mice were generated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Cb2 expression vector was constructed containing a Cb2 cDNA fragment cloned into the 14kb Sca-1 (Ly-6E.1) gene. Two transgenic lines in which Cb2 expression is controlled by the Sca-1 promoter were generated, and the effect on hematopoietic development was studied. Expression of Cb2 mRNA or protein was studied by RNase protection analysis and ligand binding assays, respectively. Leukemic predisposition was investigated by injecting newborn transgenic as well as control animals with Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus (Cas-Br-M MuLV). RESULTS: Although increased expression of the Cb2 gene was observed in hematopoietic tissues, follow-up of more than 1 year did not reveal any hematologic defect. Interestingly, infection of newborn pSca-1/Cb2 transgenic mice with Cas-Br-M MuLV revealed that significantly more transgenic mice developed leukemia than virus-treated control littermates. Because these studies provide evidence for the cooperative potential of Cb2 in leukemia progression, we wished to identify genes that may collaborate with Cb2 in leukemic transformation. Our study suggests that Evi1, another common target for proviral integration in mouse leukemias, may be overexpressed in virus-induced leukemias in pSca-1/Cb2 transgenic mice. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that hematopoietic precursor cells that express high levels of Cb2 possess increased susceptibility for leukemia development and that Cb2 and Evi1 might collaborate in leukemogenesis.","['Joosten, Marieke', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Jorda, Meritxell Alberich', 'Vankan-Berkhoudt, Yolanda', 'Verbakel, Sandra', 'van den Broek, Marion', 'Beijen, Antoinette', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Delwel, Ruud']","['Joosten M', 'Valk PJ', 'Jorda MA', 'Vankan-Berkhoudt Y', 'Verbakel S', 'van den Broek M', 'Beijen A', 'Lowenberg B', 'Delwel R']","['The Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ly6a protein, mouse)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cannabinoid)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Cannabinoid', 'Receptors, Drug/*genetics', '*Transcription Factors']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/04/11 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Feb;30(2):142-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00779-2.,,,"['S0301472X01007792 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00779-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the tumor cell expression of the BLyS-Receptor (BLyS-R) and the serum BLyS protein levels in patients with different types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). METHODS: BLyS-R expression was assessed by flow cytometry on B cells from 43 NHL patients and 10 normal donors. BLyS protein serum levels were analyzed by ELISA. RESULTS: All B cells, tumor and normal, expressed BLyS-R. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI +/- SD) of BLyS-R on normal B cells was 25.2 +/- 2.3 arbitrary units, while follicular NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) exhibited significantly lower expression of the BLyS-R (17.7 +/- 3.1; 15.5 +/- 3.9, respectively, p < 0.0001 for both); other lymphoma subtypes expressed levels comparable to normal B cells (diffuse large cell, 24.8 +/- 4.3; mantle cell, 20 +/- 4.7; marginal zone, 20.7 +/- 3.7). BLyS protein serum levels were analyzed in 15 normal donors and 17 patients with follicular NHL. Levels of BLyS protein were, on average, threefold higher in patients with follicular lymphoma compared to normal donors (mean +/- SD; 13.4 +/- 5.6 ng/mL vs 4.6 +/- 0.7 ng/mL; p < 0.0001). BLyS protein alone was unable to stimulate proliferation in cultures of follicular lymphoma B cells or normal B cells.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred ten consecutive AML patients observed at diagnosis were studied by flow cytometry. In selected experiments, in vitro cultures with CD34(+)CD86(+) or CD34(-)CD86(+) blasts were performed in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating actor (GM-CSF) with or without tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or GM-CSF + interleukin-4 (IL-4), respectively, to induce a dendritic differentiation, documented by morphologic and immunophenotypic assays. T-cell alloreactivity to CD86(+) AML cells and leukemic dendritic cells (AML-DC) was tested in mixed leukocyte cultures and anti-leukemic cytotoxic assays. RESULTS: CD86 was expressed in 54% AML, whereas CD80 and CD1a were only occasionally positive. CD86(+) AML samples included M5 and M4, but also 47% M0-M1 FAB types, and were more frequently CD14(+) (p < 0.00001) and CD34(-) (p = 0.00005) than CD86(-)AML. Six different patterns of CD86(+) AML were identified, according to CD34 or CD14 total or partial coexpression. Four samples enriched in CD34(+)CD86(+) AML cells differentiated into AML-DC CD86(+), CD80(+), CD40(+), CD11c(+), HLA-DR(++), CD14(+/-) that also were CD1a(+) or CD83(+), after 6 days of in vitro culture with GM-CSF +/- TNF-alpha. CD34(-)CD86(+) AML cells differentiated into AML-DC after 3 to 5 days (n = 5 experiments), and trisomy 8 was found in two AML and AML-DC samples by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. Finally, AML-DC induced more potent allo-T-cell proliferation, cytokine release, and anti-leukemic cytotoxicity than CD86(+) blasts. CONCLUSIONS: In AML, CD86 is a marker of monocytic/dendritic lineage.

The fate of genetically modified cells and their progeny was followed in vivo, after reinfusion in patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy for poor-prognosis breast or ovarian carcinomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients received genetically modified autologous peripheral blood progenitors, together with unmanipulated aphereses, following high-dose chemotherapy. CD34(+) cells were immunoselected from aphereses, and retrovirally transduced by coculture with the retroviral vector producing cell line, to express a nuclear localized version of E. coli beta-galactosidase, encoded by a defective Moloney-murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vector. Cells were reinfused to the patients after myeloablation, without prior ex vivo selection. RESULTS: Five out of six patients showed the transient presence of low numbers of beta-galactosidase(+) cells, as detected with an immunocytochemical assay, in the peripheral blood, during the first month following infusion. One patient had beta-galactosidase(+) clonogenic progenitors in her marrow at two months after transplantation, including HPP-CFC; intriguingly, this patient had the lowest percentage of X-gal(+) cells in her graft. Patients experienced side effects that are often observed after high-dose chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Feasibility and safety of genetic modification of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are demonstrated by this study. Ex vivo or in vivo selection is not mandatory, even in clinical situations where transduced cells have no survival advantage over wild-type cells; however, significant improvements in gene transfer technology are needed to achieve potentially useful levels of expression in such clinical situations.","['Bagnis, Claude', 'Chabannon, Christian', 'Gravis, Gwenaelle', 'Imbert, Anne-Marie', 'Maroc, Christine', 'Bardin, Florence', 'Ladaique, Patrick', 'Viret, Frederic', 'Genre, Dominique', 'Faucher, Catherine', 'Stoppa, Anne-Marie', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Maraninchi, Dominique', 'Viens, Patrice', 'Mannoni, Patrice']","['Bagnis C', 'Chabannon C', 'Gravis G', 'Imbert AM', 'Maroc C', 'Bardin F', 'Ladaique P', 'Viret F', 'Genre D', 'Faucher C', 'Stoppa AM', 'Vey N', 'Blaise D', 'Maraninchi D', 'Viens P', 'Mannoni P']","[""Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genetic Vectors', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/04/11 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/11 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Feb;30(2):108-15. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00773-1.,,,"['S0301472X01007731 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00773-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the efficacy of this nonmyeloablative strategy for BM transplantation (BMT) as immunotherapy for minimal residual disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BALB/c mice inoculated with leukemia (BCL1) or breast carcinoma (4T1) cells were conditioned for BMT with TLI (200 cGy) followed by priming with donor (C57BL/6) BM cells on day 1, and by injection with 200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide on day 2. After conditioning (day 3), recipients were transplanted with BM cells from the same donor. Treated animals were monitored for 230 days for survival, development of leukemia/solid tumor, and GVHD. RESULTS: BMT converted the mice to complete chimeras and prevented development of leukemia in 90% of recipients and locally growing breast carcinoma in 40% of the mice. Immunization of donors of the second BM with 4T1 cells prevented development of breast carcinoma in 80% of 4T1 inoculated mice. Fewer animals treated for malignancy by nonmyeloablative BMT died of GVHD than those treated by myeloablative BMT. However, late GVHD-related mortality in mice treated for leukemia was higher than after nonmyeloablative BMT to naive recipients (p < 0.00001). Infusion of host-type anti-donor immune lymphocytes 8 days after BMT improved the survival of recipients treated for leukemia without affecting engraftment and the graft-vs-leukemia potential of donor BM. CONCLUSIONS: Effective eradication of malignant cells can be achieved following allogeneic BMT after nonmyeloablative conditioning.","['Prigozhina, Tatyana B', 'Gurevitch, Olga', 'Morecki, Shoshana', 'Yakovlev, Elena', 'Elkin, Gregory', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Prigozhina TB', 'Gurevitch O', 'Morecki S', 'Yakovlev E', 'Elkin G', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, The Cancer Immunotherapy & Cancer Immunobiology Research Center, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/radiation effects', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/pathology/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm, Residual/therapy', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jan;30(1):89-96. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00759-7.,,,"['S0301472X01007597 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00759-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain further insight into Hox gene-mediated regulation of hematopoiesis, we investigated the expression pattern of representative Hox genes and two of their cofactors, Pbx1 and Meis1, at different stages of murine hematopoiesis. METHODS: Functionally distinct subpopulations of murine bone marrow (BM) and fetal liver day 14.5 (FL) cells were isolated by flow cytometry, and gene expression of various homeobox-containing genes was assessed by global cDNA amplification technique. RESULTS: Hox genes were found preferentially expressed in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-enriched subpopulations and downregulated following differentiation and maturation. This profile of expression was observed at both adult and fetal stages of hematopoiesis. The Pbx1 and Meis1 genes had important differences in their expression pattern but were both detected in Hox expressing subpopulations. In particular, Meis1 consistently showed an expression profile closely resembling that of Hox genes. Finally, using the in vitro embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation model to mimic embryonic hematopoiesis, we found coexpression of Hox genes and their cofactors coincided with the appearance of hematopoietic progenitor cells. CONCLUSION: Together, these results further support the notion that Hox genes are involved in the regulation of early hematopoietic cells and provide strong evidence that they are involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis throughout ontogeny.","['Pineault, Nicolas', 'Helgason, Cheryl D', 'Lawrence, H Jeffrey', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Pineault N', 'Helgason CD', 'Lawrence HJ', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['DK48642/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jan;30(1):49-57. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00757-3.,,,"['S0301472X01007573 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00757-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heparanase activity was found to correlate with the metastatic potential of solid tumors. We evaluated heparanase expression, at the levels of gene and protein expression and activity in a variety of leukemias, and compared it with normal hematopoietic cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heparanase expression was evaluated in leukocytes isolated from peripheral blood of 71 patients with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Analysis was performed at two levels: heparanase RNA was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and heparanase protein was evaluated by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. RESULTS: In eight peripheral blood samples from normal donors, heparanase RNA was detected, and protein was found within the cytoplasm of granulocytes. In mononuclear cells derived from various leukemias, heparanase RNA was expressed in 14 of 15 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. In contrast, cells derived from all 33 chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, all 7 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 7 of 8 chronic myeloid leukemia, and 6 of 8 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients showed no detectable expression of the heparanase RNA. Heparanase protein was detected primarily within the cytoplasm of AML cells, indicating that the enzyme is produced and stored within the cytoplasm of myeloid cells, with limited expression on the cell surface. CONCLUSION: We propose that heparanase expression is associated with the myeloid lineage and may serve as an independent marker to support the identification of AMLs.","['Bitan, Menachem', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Zecchina, Gabriella', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Friedmann, Yael', 'Nadav, Liat', 'Deutsch, Varda', 'Pecker, Iris', 'Eldor, Amiram', 'Vlodavsky, Israel', 'Katz, Ben-Zion']","['Bitan M', 'Polliack A', 'Zecchina G', 'Nagler A', 'Friedmann Y', 'Nadav L', 'Deutsch V', 'Pecker I', 'Eldor A', 'Vlodavsky I', 'Katz BZ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hadassah-Hebrew University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucuronidase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/enzymology/genetics']",,2002/02/02 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2002/02/02 10:00'],"['2002/02/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2002 Jan;30(1):34-41. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00766-4.,,,"['S0301472X01007664 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00766-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because hTERT expression is positively correlated with telomerase activity, its regulation is suggested as the major determinant of enzymatic activity. The hTERT promoter region contains two CpG islands, which are known to be target sites for de novo DNA methylation. To elucidate the impact of this epigenetic mechanism on telomerase activity, we analyzed the degree of hTERT promoter methylation in 30 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: hTERT promoter methylation was assessed using a methylation-specific competitive polymerase chain reaction assay. The assay is based on digestion of genomic DNA with a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme before amplification with an internal standard. RESULTS: Patients exhibiting high telomerase activity showed significantly less methylation of the hTERT promoter core domain than patients with low enzyme activity. In addition, telomerase activity was significantly associated with telomere length and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the degree of CpG island methylation of the hTERT promoter exhibits an impact on telomerase activity in a subgroup of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and therefore is assumed to play a role in regulating hTERT gene expression in these patients.","['Bechter, Oliver E', 'Eisterer, Wolfgang', 'Dlaska, Margit', 'Kuhr, Thomas', 'Thaler, Josef']","['Bechter OE', 'Eisterer W', 'Dlaska M', 'Kuhr T', 'Thaler J']","['Department of General Internal Medicine, Innsbruck University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria.

Because some data suggest ATM is frequently rearranged in T-PLL, it was decided to investigate such rearrangements in detail by cloning breakpoints. Among 17 T-PLL tumour samples, three rearrangements were detected by Southern blotting. Two cases harboured a unique type of intragenic duplication in which breakpoints arose at the consensus sequence RGYW/WRCY. The third case harboured a large deletion terminating within the ATM gene. Also, 13 T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples were examined and one sample harboured a deletion- insertion with the RGYW motif at the breakpoint in ATM. This is the first known deleterious mutation detected in ATM in T-ALL. Interestingly, the RGYW motif is the signal for a cell-cycle regulated DNA double strand break (DSB) that initiates somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin and, probably, T-cell receptor genes. The structures of the ATM duplications suggest they may arise from an error in somatic hypermutation. We suggest that aberrant components of somatic hypermutation may contribute to the defective DSB repair characteristic of cancer.","['Bradshaw, Paul S', 'Condie, Alison', 'Matutes, Estella', 'Catovsky, Daniel', 'Yuille, Martin R']","['Bradshaw PS', 'Condie A', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D', 'Yuille MR']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Chromosome Breakage/*genetics', 'Consensus Sequence/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*chemistry/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/02/15 10:01,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2001/10/17 00:00 [revised]', '2001/10/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2002 Jan 17;21(3):483-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1205105.,,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1205105 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective study. SETTING: Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Children aged 15 years or younger. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The types of cancer were classified into 12 diagnostic groups according to morphology (following the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology M-code). The incidences of the different types of cancer were obtained with reference to the Hong Kong population aged 15 years or younger. Data collected between 1989 and 1991 were checked by paediatric oncologists from the Hong Kong Paediatric Haematology and Oncology Study Group. RESULTS: A total of 1756 cases of paediatric cancer were registered during the 10-year period. The incidence of cancer was 144.3 new cases per million children. Leukaemia was the most common form of childhood cancer (40.0%), followed by brain tumour (16.3%), and lymphoma (10.8%). The relative frequencies of neuroblastoma (2.4%) and Wilms' tumour (3.5%) were lower than those reported from western countries. CONCLUSION: The incidences and types of paediatric cancer in Hong Kong are similar to those in western countries. Collaboration with paediatric oncology groups should provide more accurate information on the incidence and survival rates of children with cancer in Hong Kong.","['Li, C K', 'Mang, O WK', 'Foo, W']","['Li CK', 'Mang OW', 'Foo W']","[""Department of Paediatrics, Lady Pao Children's Cancer Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, Shatin, Hong Kong.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],China,Hong Kong Med J,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,9512509,,,,,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/02/01 10:00,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hong Kong Med J. 1999 Jun;5(2):128-134.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: SDC in four Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trials was compared with hematopoietic stem-cell support in patients from the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry. Cox proportional hazard regression incorporated potentially confounding effects. A total of 1,509 women were enrolled onto CALGB trials, and 1,188 women received HDC. No significant survival differences existed by CALGB trial or HDC regimen. Consideration was restricted to candidates for both SDC and HDC. The resulting sample included 635 SDC and 441 HDC patients. The outcome of interest was overall survival. RESULTS: The HDC group displayed better performance status. The SDC group had slightly better survival in first year after treatment. The HDC group had lower hazard of death from years 1 to 4 and had somewhat higher probability of 5-year survival (adjusted probabilities [95% confidence intervals], 23% [17% to 29%] v 15% [11% to 19%], P =.03). CONCLUSION: After controlling for known prognostic factors in this nonrandomized analysis of two large independent data sets, women receiving HDC versus SDC for metastatic breast cancer have a similar short-term probability of survival, and might have a modestly higher long-term probability of survival.","['Berry, Donald A', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Klein, John P', 'Antman, Karen', 'Aisner, Joseph', 'Bitran, Jacob', 'Costanza, Mary', 'Freytes, Cesar O', 'Stadtmauer, Edward', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Lazarus, Hillard M', 'McCarthy, Philip L Jr', 'Norton, Larry', 'Parnes, Howard', 'Pecora, Andrew', 'Perry, Michael C', 'Rowlings, Philip', 'Spitzer, Gary', 'Horowitz, Mary M']","['Berry DA', 'Broadwater G', 'Klein JP', 'Antman K', 'Aisner J', 'Bitran J', 'Costanza M', 'Freytes CO', 'Stadtmauer E', 'Gale RP', 'Henderson IC', 'Lazarus HM', 'McCarthy PL Jr', 'Norton L', 'Parnes H', 'Pecora A', 'Perry MC', 'Rowlings P', 'Spitzer G', 'Horowitz MM']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA. dberry@odin.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Rate']",,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 1;20(3):743-50. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.743.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.743 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the utility of this assay in node-positive patients treated with adjuvant cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) has not been well studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunostaining for factor VIII-related antigen was performed on tissue sections from a subset of node-positive patients who received one of three dose/schedule regimens of CAF during participation in Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol 8541. Sections from 577 cancers exhibited acceptable tumor and immunostaining quality and were included in the study. Each section was examined quantitatively for MVD as well as non-quantitatively by scoring the presence or absence of a prominent vascular pattern. RESULTS: MVD counts were not associated with relapse-free or OS in univariate analysis. The presence of a prominent plexiform vascular pattern was correlated with decreased OS (P =.0085) in univariate analysis, but this pattern was not an independent prognostic indicator of survival in multivariate analysis. No apparent clinically important interactions between measures of angiogenesis, other prognostic factors, administration of tamoxifen, and chemotherapy dose were observed. CONCLUSION: Assessment of angiogenesis does not provide useful information regarding prognosis in node-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant CAF, nor do these measures predict which patients will benefit from dose intensification or addition of tamoxifen.","['Guidi, Anthony J', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Broadwater, Gloria', 'Helmchen, Birgit', 'Bleiweiss, Ira J', 'Budman, Daniel R', 'Henderson, I Craig', 'Norton, Larry', 'Hayes, Daniel F']","['Guidi AJ', 'Berry DA', 'Broadwater G', 'Helmchen B', 'Bleiweiss IJ', 'Budman DR', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L', 'Hayes DF']","['North Shore Medical Center, Salem, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA64061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'CAF protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Fluorouracil/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology', 'Observer Variation', 'Treatment Outcome', 'von Willebrand Factor/analysis']",,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 1;20(3):732-42. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.732.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.732 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled. Stratum I consisted of 26 patients, median age 50 years (range, 25 to 71 years), with relapsed or refractory leukemia. Stratum II contained eight patients, median age 62.5 years (range, 38 to 83 years), who had received fewer than three cycles of myelotoxic therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia or myelodysplasia that had evolved into leukemia. Patients received mitoxantrone at 12 mg/m(2) daily for 3 days. After the first mitoxantrone dose, gemcitabine was provided intravenously at 10 mg/m(2)/min with the duration adjusted by following a continuous reassessment model. RESULTS: Severe myelosuppression, and stomatitis or esophagitis were the most common hematologic and nonhematologic dose-limiting toxicities. Several patients developed febrile neutropenia, nausea, or vomiting. In both strata, the maximum recommended duration of infusion of gemcitabine was 12 hours (7,200 mg/m(2)). The mean steady-state concentration of gemcitabine was 24.72 micromol/L and varied over a fivefold range among patients. Overall response rates in this phase I trial for strata I and II were 42% and 63%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Prolonged-infusion gemcitabine at a fixed dose rate of 10 mg/m(2)/min for 12 hours with 12 mg/m(2)/d mitoxantrone for 3 days is a tolerable induction regimen and achieves plasma concentrations sufficient for maximal intracellular activation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in a phase I trial by escalating the duration of gemcitabine infusion at a fixed-dose rate of 10 mg/m(2)/min. Patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) received gemcitabine for 8.0 (n = 3), 10.0 (n = 3), 12.5 (n = 8), 15.5 (n = 3), or 18.0 hours (n = 2). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigations were undertaken in circulating AML blasts. RESULTS: Gemcitabine was infused for up to 18 hours at the fixed-dose rate. Four patients had grade 3 toxicities at longer infusion schedules. One patient had a partial remission; two others had a reduction in blasts and concomitant rise in neutrophils. Gemcitabine triphosphate was detectable in AML cells even at 1 hour after the start of infusion in eight patients. The concentration ranged from 130 to 900 micromol/L at the end of the infusion. Consistently, there was a rapid decline in DNA synthesis, which remained suppressed at 85% to 95% during and for at least 10 hours after the end of the infusion. Compared with levels in cells measured before therapy, at 8 hours after the start of the infusion, there was a decline in the cellular purine deoxynucleotide pools.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Study participants were patients with refractory or relapsed acute myeloid (AML) or lymphocytic (ALL) leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP). Troxacitabine was provided as an intravenous infusion for more than 30 minutes daily for 5 days at a dose of 8.0 mg/m(2)/d (40 mg/m(2) per course). Courses were given every 3 to 4 weeks according to antileukemic efficacy. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (AML, 18 patients; MDS, one patient; ALL, six patients; CML-BP, 17 patients) were treated. Median age was 51 years (range, 23 to 80 years); 22 patients were male. Stomatitis was the most significant adverse event, with three patients (7%) and two patients (5%), respectively, experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Ten patients (24%) had grade 3 hand-foot syndrome, and two patients (5%) had grade 3 skin rash. One patient (2%) had grade 3 fatigue and anorexia. Marrow hypoplasia occurred between days 14 and 28 in 12 (75%) of 16 assessable patients with AML. Two complete remissions and one partial remission (18%) were observed in 16 assessable patients with AML. None of six patients with ALL responded. Six (37%) of 16 assessable patients with CML-BP experienced a return to chronic-phase disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the incidence of additional cancers in those patients registered in the nationwide registry of the Italian Cooperative Group for the Study of HCL, asking the cooperating centers for additional information on initial and subsequent therapies and on time and type of second malignancies, if they developed. Here we report the final results of this survey, consisting of 54 cases of second malignancies (excluding nine cases of epithelial skin cancer) which developed in 54 patients of 1,022 with adequate follow-up. RESULTS: The cumulative risk of development of a second cancer was 5%, 10%, and 14% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. The incidence of second malignancies was not significantly higher than the expected rate (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.33; P = 1.0). However, the SIR of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the entire cohort was 5.3 (95% CI, 1.9 to 11.5). Second malignancies occurred in eight (4.7%) of 386 patients who never received interferon (IFN), nine (5.9%) of 495 patients treated with IFN at the time of diagnosis, and seven (6.9%) of 102 patients who received IFN as second-line therapy. These differences were not statistically significant. Analysis of the separate calendar periods did not reveal any particular trends with respect to variations in SIR. CONCLUSION: The present study does not support the suspicion that patients with HCL are at increased risk of additional second malignancies, although the incidence of lymphoid neoplasms was significantly higher than expected. In addition, our data indicate that IFN therapy did not exert an oncogenic effect in such patients.","['Federico, Massimo', 'Zinzani, Pier Luigi', 'Frassoldati, Antonio', 'Vinceti, Marco', 'Mode, Alessia', 'Annino, Luciana', 'Chisesi, Teodoro', 'Pagnucco, Guido', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Spriano, Mauro', 'Resegotti, Luigi', 'Bendandi, Maurizio', 'Damasio, Eugenio E']","['Federico M', 'Zinzani PL', 'Frassoldati A', 'Vinceti M', 'Mode A', 'Annino L', 'Chisesi T', 'Pagnucco G', 'Invernizzi R', 'Spriano M', 'Resegotti L', 'Bendandi M', 'Damasio EE']","['Oncologia Medica and Dipartimento di Scienze Igienistiche, Universita di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy. federico@unimo.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Interferons/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*pathology']",,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 1;20(3):638-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.638.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.638 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,['Italian Cooperative Group for the Study of Hairy Cell Leukemia'],,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-two patients with stage III or IV or locally extensive mediastinal stage I or II Hodgkin's disease received Stanford V chemotherapy for 12 weeks followed by 36-Gy RT to initial sites of bulky (> or =5 cm) or macroscopic splenic disease. Freedom from progression (FFP), overall survival (OS), and freedom from second relapse (FF2R) were determined using life-table estimates. Outcomes were analyzed according to the international prognostic score. Late effects of treatment were recorded in follow-up. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the 5-year FFP was 89% and the OS was 96%. No patient progressed during treatment, and there were no treatment-related deaths. FFP was significantly superior among patients with a prognostic score of 0 to 2 compared with those with a score of 3 and higher (94% v 75%, P <.0001). No secondary leukemia was observed. To date, there have been 42 pregnancies after treatment. Among 16 patients who relapsed, the FF2R was 69% at 5 years. CONCLUSION: These data confirm our preliminary report that Stanford V chemotherapy with RT to bulky disease sites is highly effective in locally extensive and advanced Hodgkin's disease. It is most important to compare this approach with standard doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine chemotherapy in the ongoing intergroup trial (E2496) to determine whether Stanford V with or without RT represents a therapeutic advance.","['Horning, Sandra J', 'Hoppe, Richard T', 'Breslin, Sheila', 'Bartlett, Nancy L', 'Brown, B William', 'Rosenberg, Saul A']","['Horning SJ', 'Hoppe RT', 'Breslin S', 'Bartlett NL', 'Brown BW', 'Rosenberg SA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Medical Oncology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, CA 94304, USA. sandra.horning@stanford.edu']",['eng'],['2RO1 CA56060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 1;20(3):630-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.630.,,,['10.1200/JCO.2002.20.3.630 [doi]'],,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2002 Feb 1;20(3):607-9.

Further investigation is warranted because of conflicting findings, biases, and the need to test specific hypotheses. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted (England and Wales, ages 0-14 years). Cases were ascertained from the National Registry of Childhood Tumours, and were born and diagnosed during 1968-1986. Birth record controls were matched 1:1 to cases on date of birth, sex and area. Information on variables of interest for both groups came from birth records. In all, 10 162 pairs could contribute to matched analyses. RESULTS: The odds ratio (OR) for retinoblastoma resulting from assumed new germ cell mutations among children of fathers aged > or =45 years was 3.0 (95% CI : 0.2-41.7). The risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was significantly higher among children of older mothers and fathers, and significant trends with increasing mothers' (P < 0.001) and fathers' (P = 0.002) ages were found. There was a strong and significant protective effect of increasing parity on risk of childhood ALL. The adjusted OR for parity of > or =5 (versus 0) was 0.5 (95% CI : 0.3-0.8). Children in more deprived communities had a lower risk of ALL; but this was not significant after confounders were allowed for. There was no significant effect of social class based on parental occupation on ALL risk, but the numbers were small in those analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The associations between ALL and parental ages did not disappear when children with Down syndrome were excluded, suggesting an additional explanation beyond known links. The strong ALL association with parity may be because of an unknown environmental risk factor.","['Dockerty, J D', 'Draper, G', 'Vincent, T', 'Rowan, S D', 'Bunch, K J']","['Dockerty JD', 'Draper G', 'Vincent T', 'Rowan SD', 'Bunch KJ']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HJ, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', '*Maternal Age', 'Middle Aged', '*Parity', '*Paternal Age', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Retinal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Retinoblastoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Risk Factors', '*Social Class', 'Wales/epidemiology']",,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/03/14 10:01,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 2001 Dec;30(6):1428-37. doi: 10.1093/ije/30.6.1428.,,,['10.1093/ije/30.6.1428 [doi]'],,,,['Int J Epidemiol. 2001 Dec;30(6):1438-9.

Although the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of these conditions remains largely uninvestigated, it is speculated that mediators produced in the lesional skin provide a favorable microenvironment for mast cell growth. Among the proinflammatory mediators, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which shares a receptor component (gp130 subunit) with interleukin-6 (IL-6), has been identified as a mast cell growth-enhancing factor produced by cells of the keratinocyte-derived cell line (KCMH-1). In this study, we investigated the effect of four IL-6 family cytokines, IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM) and LIF on mast cell growth in a mast cell/fibroblast co-culture system. When mouse bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMMC) were maintained on a NIH/3T3 fibroblast monolayer, these cytokines induced proliferation of the mast cells, but none of the cytokines had any effect on mast cell proliferation in the absence of fibroblasts. mRNA for gp130 and receptors for the four IL-6 family cytokines were detected in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts by reverse transcriptase-mediated polymerase chain reaction. In contrast, only mRNA for the IL-11 receptor and gp130 were detected in BMMC. Tyrosine phosphorylation of gp130 was observed in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts after stimulation with all the cytokines. Some IL-6 family cytokines enhanced the production of stem cell factor (SCF), a potent mast cell growth factor, from NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, but the amount of SCF produced by NIH/3T3 fibroblasts was not paralleled by the mast cell growth-enhancement induced by the IL-6 family cytokines. When anti-SCF antibody was added with the IL-6 family cytokines in the BMMC/fibroblast coculture system, a significant effect of these cytokines remained, although the growth-enhancing activity was markedly reduced. A similar result was obtained when BMMC were prepared from W/W(V)-mice, which lack functional c-kit, in the BMMC/ fibroblast coculture system. These results suggest that IL-6 family cytokines stimulate mast cell growth by a fibroblast-dependent mechanism, and also suggest the existence of another pathway between BMMC and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts cooperating with the SCF/c-kit pathway. IL-6 family cytokines may thus contribute to mast cell hyperplasia in skin diseases.","['Gyotoku, E', 'Morita, E', 'Kameyoshi, Y', 'Hiragun, T', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Hide, M']","['Gyotoku E', 'Morita E', 'Kameyoshi Y', 'Hiragun T', 'Yamamoto S', 'Hide M']","['Department of Dermatology, Hiroshima University, Faculty of Medicine, Japan. gyotoku@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism']",,2002/02/01 10:00,2002/07/09 10:01,['2002/02/01 10:00'],"['2002/02/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/02/01 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 2001 Nov;293(10):508-14. doi: 10.1007/pl00007465.,,,['10.1007/pl00007465 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PA level was significantly increased in bone marrow and blood cells in vitro in cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, decreased until total disappearance in remission and not revealed in control.

Trephine biopsies of the bone marrow were carried out in fixative solution and paraffin embedding. Hematoxylin and eosin and monoclonal antibody CD 61 were applied on thin sections. Phenomenon of megakaryocytic emperipolesis in human bone marrow was found in 6 cases: in 5 cases in CLL and in 1 case in HCL. In most of them emperipolesis was related to single megakaryocytes.

METHODS: The full-length cDNA of TRAIL was inserted into a vector under the control of the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE) to obtain the plasmid pRevTRE-TRAIL, which was transfected into a packaging cell line PT67. In addition, vector pRev-Tet On and pRevTRE were also transfected into PT67 separately. After hygromycin and G418 selection, the viral titer was determined. The medium containing retroviral vectors was collected and used to transduce a gastric carcinoma cell line NCI-N87. The resulting cell line NCI-N87-Tet On TRE-TRAIL and a control cell line, NCI-N87 Tet On-TRE, were established. TRAIL expression in the cell line was induced by incubating cells with doxycycline (Dox), which is a tetracycline analogue. The killing effect on gastric carcinoma cells was analyzed after induction. RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid pRev-TRE-TRAIL was constructed. After hygromycin or G418 selection, the producer cell lines PT67-TRE, PT67-TRE-TRAIL and PT67-Tet On were obtained,with titers of about 10(8)CFU.L(-1). By transducing NCI-N87 cells with retroviral vectors from these cell lines, stable cell lines NCI-N87-Tet-On TRE-TRAIL (NN3T) and control cell line NCI-N87-Tet-On-TRE (NN2T) were established. The growth curves of the selected cell lines were the same with the wild type NCI-N87. When Dox was added, cell death was obvious in the test groups (29%-77%), whereas no difference was observed in control and wild type cell lines. With the addition of a medium from the test group, human leukemia cell line Jurkat was activated till death (83%), indicating the secretion of active TRAIL proteins from the test cells to the medium. CONCLUSION: With the use of the RevTet-On system, a regulated expression system for TRAIL was constructed. Using this system, the selected killing effect of TRAIL on gastric carcinoma cell line NCI-N87 could be observed.","['Wei, X C', 'Wang, X J', 'Chen, K', 'Zhang, L', 'Liang, Y', 'Lin, X L']","['Wei XC', 'Wang XJ', 'Chen K', 'Zhang L', 'Liang Y', 'Lin XL']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, 38 Xue Yuan Road, Haidian District, Beijing 100083, China. xinjuan@sun.bjmu.edu.cn']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tnfsf10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Doxycycline/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Stomach Neoplasms', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",PMC4688673,2002/01/31 10:00,2002/06/06 10:01,['2002/01/31 10:00'],"['2002/01/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2001 Aug;7(4):559-62. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v7.i4.559.,,,['10.3748/wjg.v7.i4.559 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, arsenic trioxide has shown great promise for the induction, consolidation, and maintenance of complete remission in relapsed patients with APL. The unique mechanisms of action by which arsenic trioxide exerts its effects are complementary to those of ATRA, potentially allowing for combination therapies with additive or even synergistic results. Within this context autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantations are also considered in second or subsequent relapse, especially after arsenic trioxide-induced complete remission in relapsing patients. Furthermore, molecular monitoring for the PML-RARalpha fusion protein permits prompt intervention for early molecular relapse of APL before clinical relapse, ultimately improving chances of prolonged remission.","['Douer, Dan']",['Douer D'],"['Division of Hematology, Keck School of Medicine, USC/Norris Cancer Center, 1441 Eastlake Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90033, USA. douer-d@mikey.hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/therapy', 'Oxides/pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Recurrence', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity']",,2002/01/31 10:00,2002/04/03 10:01,['2002/01/31 10:00'],"['2002/01/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2002;107(1):1-17. doi: 10.1159/000046623.,,116,"['aha07001 [pii]', '10.1159/000046623 [doi]']","['Copyright 2002 S.

How a protease of a fibrinolytic pathway can induce migration is not understood and no link between this protease and migration-promoting G protein-coupled receptors has been described. We now show that FPRL1/LXA4R, a G protein-coupled receptor for a number of polypeptides and for the endogenous lipoxin A4 (LXA4), is the link between urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and migration as it directly interacts with an activated, soluble, cleaved form of uPA receptor (uPAR) (D2D3(88-274)) to induce chemotaxis. In this article we show that (i) both uPAR and FPRL1/LXA4R are necessary for the chemotactic activity of uPA whereas FPRL1/LXA4R is sufficient to mediate D2D3(88-274)-induced cell migration. (ii) Inhibition or desensitization of FPRL1/LXA4R by antibodies or specific ligands specifically prevents chemotaxis induced by D2D3(88-274) in THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes. (iii) Desensitization of FPRL1/LXA4R prevents the activation of tyrosine kinase Hck induced by D2D3(88-274). (iv) D2D3(88-274) directly binds to FPRL1/LXA4R and is competed by two specific FPRL1/LXA4R agonists, the synthetic MMK-1 peptide and a stable analog of LXA4. Thus, a naturally produced cleaved form of uPAR is a unique endogenous chemotactic agonist for FPRL1/LXA4R receptor and its activity can be antagonized by specific ligands. These results provide the first direct link, to our knowledge, between the fibrinolytic machinery and the inflammatory response, demonstrating that uPA-derived peptide fragments can activate a specific chemotactic receptor.","['Resnati, M', 'Pallavicini, I', 'Wang, J M', 'Oppenheim, J', 'Serhan, C N', 'Romano, M', 'Blasi, F']","['Resnati M', 'Pallavicini I', 'Wang JM', 'Oppenheim J', 'Serhan CN', 'Romano M', 'Blasi F']","['Molecular Genetics Unit, Department of Cell Biology and Functional Genomics, DIBIT-Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 58, 20132 Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM038765/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM038765/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 38765/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (FPR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (MMK-1 peptide)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Plaur protein, mouse)', '0 (Plaur protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoxin)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/physiology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', '*Lipoxins', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Plasminogen Activators/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', '*Receptors, Lipoxin', 'Receptors, Peptide/*physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism']",PMC122195,2002/01/31 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/01/31 10:00'],"['2002/01/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Feb 5;99(3):1359-64. doi: 10.1073/pnas.022652999.

Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) bind to and inhibit caspases 3, 7, and 9 activity and the induction of apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate that undifferentiated HL-60 cells express IAP. During their differentiation, IAP expression is decreased at the mRNA and protein levels. In addition, we show that there is a corresponding increase in the expression and functional activity of active caspases 3 and 9. This activity was associated with the cleavage of XIAP, NAIP, and cIAP-2. Most importantly, we demonstrate that blocking caspase activity does not alter the decrease in IAP protein expression during differentiation but prevents caspase activation, IAP cleavage, and the induction of apoptosis. This result shows that the loss of IAP expression is independent of the induction of apoptosis and is solely related to the differentiation process. However, IAP cleavage is caspase-dependent.

Because the specific inhibitors for PI3-K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), ERK (extracellular signal-regulating kinase), and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) blocked p43-stimulated ICAM-1 expression and homotypic THP-1 cell adhesion, these kinases were responsible for p43-induced cell-cell adhesion. p43-Dependent activation of ERK was inhibited by PI3-K inhibitors, and the activation of p38 MAPK was not.

In the previous report, the effect of pyrethroid pesticides and organophosphorus pesticides on immediate allergic reaction was investigated. Subsequently, 12 organonitrogen pesticides, 14 carbamate pesticides and 4 other pesticides were investigated for their effects on the enzyme activity of beta-hexosaminidase as an index of chemical mediator release from rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). Two organonitrogen pesticides, bitertanol and pyridaben, and two organotin pesticides, cyhexatin and fenbutatin oxide, were found to promote beta-hexosaminidase release. Bitertanol non-specifically caused the promotion of chemical mediator release, while the release-promotive action of pyridaben was related to IgE antibody and those of cyhexatin and fenbutatin oxide to cell injury. On the other hand, two organonitrogen pesticides, propiconazole and triadimenol, and imazalil showed release-inhibitory action.

There are Indian studies on HTLV-I infection among people with sexually transmitted infection, but no large study has been conducted on individuals with haematological malignancies. In this group of individuals, serology is known to under-diagnose HTLV-I infection. This study was carried out to identify serologically and where possible with molecular techniques, HTLV-I infection in individuals with haematological malignancies. To understand the modes of transmission, family members of individuals with proven HTLV-I infection were also studied. Individuals with sexually transmitted infection (STI), blood donors and pregnant women were also studied. METHODS: Particle agglutination test was used to detect antibody to HTLV-I. HTLV genome was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and detected with probes by digoxiginin (Dig) ELISA. RESULTS: There was no serological evidence of HTLV-I infection among the healthy blood donors and pregnant women studied. High prevalence of anti-HTLV-I antibody was identified in the patients with haematological malignancies (8 of 86 patients, 9.3%) and a lower prevalence in individuals with STI (8 of 670 individuals, 1.2%). In the STI group, all 8 individuals seroreactive to HTLV-I were coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the group with haematological malignancies, three of 22 (13.6%) patients with leukemia, 3 of 11 (27.3%) with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and 2 of 53 (3.8%) with lymphoma were reactive for anti-HTLV-I antibody. In this group, PCR identified all the seroreactive individuals tested. There were also seronegative infected individuals who were only identified by PCR. There was also a large number of seronegative family members who were only positive by PCR. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The study revealed a strong disease association of HTLV-I with haematological malignancies and evidence for both horizontal and vertical transmission of the infection in the Indian population. HTLV-I infection appears to be common among family members of individuals with HTLV-I associated haematological malignancies.","['Ramalingam, S', 'Kannangai, R', 'Prakash, K J', 'Ajithkumar, K', 'Jacob, M', 'George, R', 'Pradeepkumar, S', 'Daniel, D', 'Dennison, D', 'Babu, P G']","['Ramalingam S', 'Kannangai R', 'Prakash KJ', 'Ajithkumar K', 'Jacob M', 'George R', 'Pradeepkumar S', 'Daniel D', 'Dennison D', 'Babu PG']","['Department of Clinical Virology, Christian Medical College & Hospital, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Indian J Med Res,The Indian journal of medical research,0374701,,IM,"['Adult', 'Family', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications/*epidemiology/transmission', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors']",,2002/01/31 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2002/01/31 10:00'],"['2002/01/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/31 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Res. 2001 Jun;113:201-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results from two National Cancer Institute-approved cooperative group trials (Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 8931 [CALGB 8931] and CALGB 9130) were analyzed retrospectively to determine the participation, tolerance of treatment, and outcome of patients age > 70 years. METHODS: Five hundred fifteen patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma participated in two separate, randomized, Phase III clinical trials conducted by CALGB. Retrospective evaluation of patients by four distinct age cohorts (< 50 years, 50-59 years, 60-69 years, and > 70 years) was carried out to determine differences in toxicity, response, and survival. RESULTS: No patients age > 80 were entered on either study, even though there was no age restriction in the study eligibility criteria. No significant differences were seen in response, survival, or continuation of treatment based on age cohort. Significantly increased leukocyte toxicity was seen in older cohorts without a concomitant increase in severe or worse infectious events. CONCLUSIONS: No patients age > 80 were entered on either trial despite their potential eligibility. Patients in the oldest cohort showed no negative impact of age on treatment tolerance, response to treatment, or survival.

While endostatin is being investigated for its usefulness in treating solid tumors, its significance in hematologic malignancies is unknown. METHODS: The authors evaluated plasma endostatin (PE) levels using an enzyme linked immunoassay in 71 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 43 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and correlated PE with various clinical parameters. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the median PE level between AML/MDS patients and the normal controls. Nevertheless, patients who achieved complete remission (CR) had a significantly lower median PE level compared to those who did not. In multivariate analysis, PE was found to be a significant (P = 0.03) predictor of overall survival (OS) with adjustment of the other baseline covariates, including patient age, history of antecedent hematologic disorders, and the use of protective environments. The prognostic value of PE was also evaluated by dividing MDS/AML patients into high and low PE groups using the median PE level of normal controls as the cut-off. The authors found that patients in the high PE group survived for a significantly shorter time than those patients in the low PE group.

In this report, we describe in detail six cases of B-LBL presenting with cutaneous lesions. Three occurred in the scalp, one in the skin of the thigh, one in the skin of the face and breast, and one in the subcutaneous tissue of the orbit. All six patients are females ranging in age at presentation from 5 to 15 years (mean = 9.6). None of the cases had bone marrow involvement, while two had bone involvement (maxilla, distal tibia, and distal humerus in one case, and distal tibia and orbital bone in another case); only one case had lymphadenopathy (retroperitoneal). Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for CD79a and CD43 in all six cases. LCA and L26 positivity were also each seen in one case. Staining for MIC-2 (CD99) showed strong positivity in three cases. Vimentin was positive in four cases and TdT was positive in all five patients tested. Staining for keratin, UCHL-1, or CD30 was not encountered. Cases in which cell marker studies by flow cytometry were performed showed positivity for CD10, CD19 with negative CD20, pan-T-cell, and myeloid markers. The five patients who received multiagent chemotherapy are alive with follow-up intervals of 2 to 18 years. Two patients had local recurrences and were given radiation therapy (one with repeating multiagent chemotherapy). One patient (diagnosed in 1962) died of disseminated disease; she had been treated with radiation therapy and 6MP only. Cutaneous B-LBL must be included in the differential diagnosis of small blue cell tumors, especially in children. In contrast to its T-cell counterpart, B-LBL occurs more frequently in females, tends to present as skin or bone lesions, and is associated with a potential cure, even in cases that relapse.","['Kahwash, Samir B', 'Qualman, Stephen J']","['Kahwash SB', 'Qualman SJ']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital, 700 Children's Drive, Columbus, OH 43205, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/chemistry/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemistry/*pathology/therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology/therapy']",,2002/01/30 10:00,2002/03/14 10:01,['2002/01/30 10:00'],"['2001/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2001/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/01/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2002 Jan-Feb;5(1):45-53. doi: 10.1007/s10024-001-0104-4.,,,['10.1007/s10024-001-0104-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circulating serum levels of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were found increased in MMM, CML and ET but the frequent thrombocytosis that accompanies these diseases could limit the interpretation of these data since platelets and megakaryocytes may be considered a major source at least for VEGF.

Several receptors regulate this process by localizing proteolytic activity to the cell surface. One such receptor is annexin II, a calcium and phospholipid-binding protein. Annexin II serves as a profibrinolytic coreceptor for both plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator on the surface of endothelial cells and facilitates the generation of plasmin. The dysregulation of fibrinolytic assembly on endothelial cells may lead to atherothrombotic disease. In addition to its role in fibrinolysis at the surface of endothelial cells, annexin II may play other potential cellular roles. For example, the overexpression of annexin II on the surface of leukemic cells and cell lines derived from acute promyelocytic leukemia correlates with both the clinical manifestation of bleeding and the in vitro ability of the leukemic cells to generate plasmin. The abundant presence of annexin II on the surface of other cell types including monocytic cell lines and different cancer cells may contribute to their invasive potential through extracellular matrix either by generation of plasmin or, by plasmin-mediated proteolytic activation of other metalloproteinases. This dissolution of extracellular matrix may also cause the release of potent matrix-bound angiogenic factors such as VEGF and FGF. On the other hand, by increasing the pool of plasmin, a precursor to an important anti-angiogenic factor, angiostatin, and by fragmentation of collagen XVIII (a precursor to the anti-angigenic factor, endostatin) by plasmin-activated metalloproteases, annexin II could play a pivotal physiological role in the pro- and anti-angiogenic switch mechanism.","['Kim, Jiyun', 'Hajjar, Katherine A']","['Kim J', 'Hajjar KA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Box 45, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['67839/PHS HHS/United States', 'HL 42493/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '58981/PHS HHS/United States', '46403/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Front Biosci,Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,9709506,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Annexins)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'EC 3.4.21.68 (Tissue Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Annexin A2/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Annexins/chemistry', 'Arteriosclerosis/etiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Plasminogen/*metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activators/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Tissue Plasminogen Activator/metabolism']",,2002/01/30 10:00,2002/06/06 10:01,['2002/01/30 10:00'],"['2002/01/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/30 10:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Front Biosci. 2002 Feb 1;7:d341-8. doi: 10.2741/kim.,,56,['10.2741/kim [doi]'],,20020201,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear export of this mRNA by the regulator of expression of virion proteins (Rev) would allow its translation into wild type (WT) (MoTN-Ti-GE-Ri- Ter) or trans-dominant negative mutant (TDM) (MoTN-Ti-GmEm-Ri-Ter) Gag and Env proteins. Thus, the antisense RNA produced in a constitutive manner would ensure that even if there is leaky expression, no WT/TDM Gag or Env protein would be produced in the uninfected cells. If cells become infected by HIV-1, the antisense RNA would inhibit HIV-1 replication. Failure on the part of antisense RNA to inhibit virus replication would allow GE/GmEm mRNA production. The GE/GmEm mRNA would cause partial inhibition of HIV-1 replication as it contains the TAR, RRE, and Psi(e) signal sequences. Translation of GmEm mRNA would give rise to TDM Gag and Env proteins, which would further decrease progeny virus infectivity. Tat- and Rev-inducibility was demonstrated in transfected HeLa and HeLa-Tev cells. Full-length WT/TDM Gag production was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Amphotropic vector particles were used to transduce a human CD4+ T-lymphoid cell line, and the stable transductants were challenged with HIV-1. Virus replication was better inhibited by the MoTN-Ti-GE-Ri-Ter vector than by the MoTN-Ti-GmEm-Ri-Ter vector.

The araC-induced cytotoxicity is a direct result of its interference with nucleic acids synthesis, whereas 5-aza-dC is a potent suppressor of DNA methylation. We employed the standard version of the wing somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the genotoxic potential of these two antimetabolites as a function of exposure concentration. In addition, we determined the relative contributions of mutational and recombinational events to total genotoxicity. The compounds were administered by chronic feeding of 3-day-old larvae. Our results indicate that recombinagenicity is the major genotoxic effect of araC and 5-aza-dC (approximately, 77 and 81%, respectively, recombination). The standardised clone induction frequencies (per mM concentration per cell per cell division) show that 5-aza-dC is 85 times more powerful then araC (inducing approximately 58 mutant clones per 10(5) cells per mM). The high recombinagenic activity of these two drugs suggests that--despite their therapeutic effects against cancer--a question is raised whether these drugs should be considered for adverse effects in cancer chemotherapy.","['Cunha, Kenya Silva', 'Reguly, Maria Luiza', 'Graf, Ulrich', 'de Andrade, Heloisa Helena Rodrigues']","['Cunha KS', 'Reguly ML', 'Graf U', 'de Andrade HH']","['Departamento de Ciencias Fisiologicas, Universidade Federal de Goias, CP 131, 74001-970, GO, Goiania, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/toxicity', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Decitabine', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Female', 'Male', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Recombination, Genetic']",,2002/01/30 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/01/30 10:00'],"['2002/01/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2002 Feb 15;514(1-2):95-103. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00326-6.,,,"['S1383571801003266 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00326-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also evidence that proinflammatory cytokines and induction of IRS activation are associated with sickness behavior in experimental animals. However, no research has examined the IRS in somatization disorder. The aim of this study was to examine possible immunological differences between major depression, somatization and healthy controls. We measured the following IRS variables in patients with major depression (n=36), somatization syndrome (SSI-8; n=37), major depression and somatization (n=40) and healthy controls (n=37): interleukin-6 (IL-6); interleukin-1-receptor-antagonist (IL-1RA); plasma soluble interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R); soluble suppressor/cytotoxic antigen (CD8); leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF-R); and Clara cell protein (CC16), an endogenous anticytokine. Serum CD8 concentrations were significantly increased in patients with major depression compared with concentrations in patients with somatization syndrome, whereas concentrations in normal controls were intermediate between those of the two groups of patients. Serum CC16 was significantly lower in major depression than in healthy controls. The highest CC16 scores were found in patients with somatization syndrome. Somatizing patients have significantly lower serum IL-6 values than normal controls and depressed patients. The present results indicate (1) an activation of the IRS in depression with signs of T-cell activation (increased CD8), monocytic activation (IL-1RA) and a lowered anti-inflammatory capacity of the serum (lower CC16) and (2) an immune alteration in somatizing syndrome, such as monocytic activation (increased IL-1RA) and indicators of lowered T-lymphocytic activity (lowered CD8 and IL-6). These results suggest different immune alterations in somatization syndrome and depression.","['Rief, W', 'Pilger, F', 'Ihle, D', 'Bosmans, E', 'Egyed, B', 'Maes, M']","['Rief W', 'Pilger F', 'Ihle D', 'Bosmans E', 'Egyed B', 'Maes M']","['Klinik Roseneck, Center for Behavioral Medicine, Prien am Chiemsee, Germany. rief@mailer.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Ireland,Psychiatry Res,Psychiatry research,7911385,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (IL1RAPL1 protein, human)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD8 Antigens/blood/*immunology', 'Comorbidity', 'Depressive Disorder, Major/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*blood/*immunology', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatric Status Rating Scales', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/blood/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/blood/*immunology', 'Somatoform Disorders/epidemiology/*immunology']",,2002/01/30 10:00,2002/05/08 10:01,['2002/01/30 10:00'],"['2002/01/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/30 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Psychiatry Res. 2001 Dec 31;105(3):165-74. doi: 10.1016/s0165-1781(01)00338-9.,,,"['S0165-1781(01)00338-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-1781(01)00338-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified a further Shaker homologue, xKv1.4, in X. laevis. The open reading frame encodes a K(+)-channel that shares 72% of its 698 amino acids with the human Shaker homologue, hKv1.4. Northern blot analysis revealed xKv1.4 in the brain, muscle, and spleen but not in the ovary, intestine, heart, liver, kidney, lung, and skin. Whole-cell patch clamp recording from rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells transfected with xKv1.4 revealed a voltage-gated, outward rectifying, transient A-type, K(+) selective current. xKv1.4 was strongly dependent on extracellular K(+). Exposure of cells to K(+) free bath solution almost completely abolished the current, whereas in the presence of high K(+), inactivation in response to a maintained depolarizing step and the frequency-dependent cumulative inactivation decreased. Ion channels encoded by xKv1.4 are sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and quinidine but insensitive to tetraethylammonium and the peptide toxins, charybdotoxin, margatoxin, and dendrotoxin.

This randomised study evaluates the role of G-CSF given after a 5-day intensification block in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Forty-six children with ALL or T-Cell non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) treated on MRC ALL 97, UKALL XI or UKCCSG 9504 NHL protocols were randomised to receive granulocyte colony-stimulating factor following either the first or the second block of intensive chemotherapy in a cross-over study to determine if the prophylactic administration of G-CSF could reduce the rate of readmission to hospital for management of febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the rate of hospital admission in the group receiving prophylaxis, with 34 of 46 being admitted, compared to 42 of 46 patients in the control arm (74 vs. 91%; P=0.0386). There were no differences found in duration of hospital admission, haematological toxicity, neutrophil recovery or duration of supportive care between the two groups. There was no demonstrable cost benefit derived from the prophylactic administration of G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the prophylactic administration of G-CSF following intensification chemotherapy for childhood ALL and T-NHL produces a significant reduction in the rate of readmission to hospital for the management of febrile neutropenia.","['Little, M A', 'Morland, B', 'Chisholm, J', 'Hole, A', 'Shankar, A', 'Devine, T', 'Easlea, D', 'Meyer, L C', 'Pinkerton, C R']","['Little MA', 'Morland B', 'Chisholm J', 'Hole A', 'Shankar A', 'Devine T', 'Easlea D', 'Meyer LC', 'Pinkerton CR']","['Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Patient Readmission/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2002/01/29 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2002/01/29 10:00'],"['2002/01/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2002 Feb;38(2):98-103. doi: 10.1002/mpo.1279.,,,"['10.1002/mpo.1279 [pii]', '10.1002/mpo.1279 [doi]']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because T cells play an important role in engraftment of the bone marrow and decrease the probability of relapse of leukemia, a treatment strategy was developed to preserve the benefits of T cells in the graft and to control the severe complications of GvHD. This can be accomplished by the genetic modification of donor T cells with a suicide gene that allows their selective in vivo elimination and subsequently the abrogation of GvHD. For clinical benefit the alloreactivity of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene-transduced T cells should be retained. Therefore, we investigated the influence of gene transduction and the selection procedure on T cells. We demonstrated that activation and culturing of T cells reduce their capacity to induce lethal GvHD in an allogeneic rat bone marrow transplantation model. Furthermore, positive immunomagnetic selection of gene-transduced T cells resulted in loss of the GvHD-inducing capacity of HSV-TK(+) T cells directly after MACS (magnetic cell sorting) selection; this loss could be recovered by a 1-day expansion of the selected T cells. No effect on alloreactivity was observed to be caused by the gene transduction procedure. Our study resulted in the development of an optimized culture and gene transduction protocol with preservation of T cell alloreactivity. Treatment of transplanted rats with ganciclovir resulted in a rapid reduction in the number of HSV-TK(+) T cells in the peripheral blood and in increased survival of the animals.","['Weijtens, Mo', 'van Spronsen, Anke', 'Hagenbeek, Anton', 'Braakman, Eric', 'Martens, Anton']","['Weijtens M', 'van Spronsen A', 'Hagenbeek A', 'Braakman E', 'Martens A']","['Jordan Laboratory of Hemato-Oncology, Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2002/01/29 10:00,2002/08/23 10:01,['2002/01/29 10:00'],"['2002/01/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/08/23 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2002 Jan 20;13(2):187-98. doi: 10.1089/10430340252769725.,,,['10.1089/10430340252769725 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Either the NH(2)-terminal (chimera RILLIFdeltaI) or the COOH-terminal LIFR CBM (chimera RILLIFdeltaII) were replaced by the structurally related CBM of the IL-6R which does not bind LIF. Chimera RILLIFdeltaI is functionally inactive, whereas RILLIFdeltaII binds LIF and mediates signalling as efficiently as the wild-type LIFR. Deletion mutants of the LIFR revealed that both the NH(2)-terminal CBM and the Ig-like domain of the LIFR are involved in LIF binding, presumably via the LIF site III epitope. The main function of the COOH-terminal CBM of the LIFR is to position the NH(2)-terminal CBM and the Ig-like domain, so that these can bind to LIF. In analogy to a recently published model of the IL-6R complex, a model of the active LIFR complex is suggested which positions the COOH-terminal CBM at LIF site I and the NH(2)-terminal CBM and the Ig-like domain at site III. An additional contact is postulated between the Ig-like domain of gp130 and the NH(2)-terminal CBM of the LIFR.","['Aasland, Dorthe', 'Oppmann, Birgit', 'Grotzinger, Joachim', 'Rose-John, Stefan', 'Kallen, Karl-Josef']","['Aasland D', 'Oppmann B', 'Grotzinger J', 'Rose-John S', 'Kallen KJ']","['Biochemisches Institut, Christian Albrechts Universitat Kiel, Ohlshausenstr. 40, Kiel, D-24098, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/genetics', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*chemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Ligands', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Transfection']",,2002/01/29 10:00,2002/03/15 10:01,['2002/01/29 10:00'],"['2002/01/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/15 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2002 Jan 25;315(4):637-46. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.2001.5282.,,,"['10.1006/jmbi.2001.5282 [doi]', 'S0022283601952829 [pii]']",['Copyright 2002 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the anti-apoptotic effects of this blocker on epithelial cells and the mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effect remain unknown. We examined the anti-apoptotic effects of a chloride-bicarbonate exchange blocker in a renal epithelial cell line (MDCK cells). Changes in the expression of bcl-2 family proteins, which are known to have anti-apoptotic effects, were also examined. Staurosporine was used to induce apoptotic cell death in the MDCK cells. Staurosporine treatment was sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death, detected by propidium iodide and DNA ladder formation. A chloride-bicarbonate exchange blocker was added 24 h before the staurosporine treatment and during treatment. The chloride-bicarbonate exchange blocker inhibited the staurosporine-induced apoptosis in the MDCK cells in a dose-dependent manner. The expression of bcl-2 family gene products was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting. No changes in the expression of Bax, Bid and Bik (pro-apoptotic proteins), or Bcl-2 (an anti-apoptotic protein) were detected. However, Mcl-1 expression was reduced by the staurosporine treatment, and this reduction was recovered when the chloride-bicarbonate exchange blocker was added. LY294002, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, partially inhibited this anti-apoptotic effect. In conclusion, chloride-bicarbonate exchange blockers appear to offer cell-protective effects via Mcl-1 up-regulation.","['Araki, Takashi', 'Hayashi, Matsuhiko', 'Watanabe, Naohide', 'Kanuka, Hirotaka', 'Yoshino, Jun', 'Miura, Masayuki', 'Saruta, Takao']","['Araki T', 'Hayashi M', 'Watanabe N', 'Kanuka H', 'Yoshino J', 'Miura M', 'Saruta T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)""]",IM,"[""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics/*physiology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Size', 'Dogs', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2002/01/29 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/01/29 10:00'],"['2002/01/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/29 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2002 Feb 1;290(4):1275-81. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2002.6329.,,,"['10.1006/bbrc.2002.6329 [doi]', 'S0006291X02963291 [pii]']",['(c)2002 Elsevier Science (USA).'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Itraconazole was given orally at a dose of 200 mg (four capsules of 50 mg) once daily for at least 14 days. An H2-receptor antagonist was also given to prevent chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. Trough plasma concentrations of itraconazole and its metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, were determined by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.

Ceftadizime-susceptible and -resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration; >/=8 &mgr;g/ml) K. pneumoniae strains were isolated over a month from the blood, ascites, and feces of a 44-year-old man after bone marrow transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (patient 2); this patient died of K. pneumoniae sepsis and peritonitis followed by multiple organ failure. These isolates produced penicillinase, which was inhibited by clavulanic acid. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study showed that both isolates carried the SHV or LEN genes, but not the TEM, Toho-1, and IMP-1 genes. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profile of the strain isolated from patient 1 was genetically distinguishable from the profiles of the strains isolated from patient 2. It appeared that mutation of the beta-lactamase gene may have occurred in the body of patient 2, since the genotypes of the ceftadizime-susceptible and -resistant isolates from this patient were identical. Another 12 strains of K. pneumoniae, isolated from other patients in the same wards during the period in which the K. pneumoniae strains were isolated from patients 1 and 2, did not produce ESBLs and showed different genotypes. The results suggest that these isolates of resistant K. pneumoniae did not spread by cross transmission in the hospital and that the two cases were sporadic. Surveillance of these types of resistant bacteria is necessary, since they may well be present in other hospitals in Japan. Although the organisms are suspected to produce SHV-type ESBLs or LEN-1 variant beta-lactamases, further studies are necessary to specify the resistance genes.","['Hirakata, Y.', 'Ishii, Yoshikazu', 'Nakano, Michiko', 'Matsuda, Junichi', 'Ozaki, Yumi', 'Mochida, Chikako', 'Iori, Fumiaki', 'Ma, Ling', 'Izumikawa, Kohichi', 'Yamaguchi, Toshiyuki', 'Miyazaki, Yoshitsugu', 'Maesaki, Shigefumi', 'Tomono, Kazunori', 'Yamada, Yasuaki', 'Yamaguchi, Keizo', 'Kamihira, Shimeru', 'Kohno, Shigeru']","['Hirakata Y', 'Ishii Y', 'Nakano M', 'Matsuda J', 'Ozaki Y', 'Mochida C', 'Iori F', 'Ma L', 'Izumikawa K', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Maesaki S', 'Tomono K', 'Yamada Y', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Kamihira S', 'Kohno S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 852-8501, Japan. hirakata@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,,,,,2002/01/26 10:00,2002/01/26 10:01,['2002/01/26 10:00'],"['1998/07/06 00:00 [received]', '1998/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/01/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/26 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 1999 Jun;5(2):91-96. doi: 10.1007/s101560050015.,,,"['10.1007/s101560050015 [doi]', 'S1341-321X(99)71368-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous molecular studies had established that the 3' BCR had recombined at a novel site within the variable region of the immunoglobulin lambda locus ( IGL). A segment of DNA mapping very close to the site of the IGL/3' BCR recombination recognized a previously undescribed insertion polymorphism. A combination of molecular hybridization studies and long-range polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate a 6-kb full-length long interspersed nuclear element (LINE or L1), here designated L1(IGL), which occupies 19% of alleles in the general population. Although unclonable, DNA sequence analysis by a primer walking approach established that L1(IGL) has features characteristic of an actively retrotransposing element. The L1(IGL) element has a 5' untranslated region, two open reading frames (ORF-1 and ORF-2), a 3' untranslated region and terminates in a poly-A tail. We compared the DNA sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence of L1(IGL) with a consensus sequence compiled from seven reported active L1 elements. This analysis indicated that L1(IGL) has high potential for involvement in as yet undetermined somatically and constitutionally acquired disease, not only through recombination mechanisms, but also through retrotransposition events. This full-length L1 element maps close within the IGLlocus to L1.2, one of only nine active L1 elements that have been reported so far.

Multi-probe RNase protection assays were used to examine Th1, Th2, and Th3 cytokine and cytokine receptor expression. Th2 [interleukin (IL)-6, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M] and Th3 (transforming growth factor-beta1, 2, 3) cytokine and their receptor transcripts were strongly expressed in almost all glioblastomas and glioma cell lines. Two other Th2 cytokine receptor subunit transcripts (IL-4Ralpha and IL-13Ralpha) were also commonly detected.

A retrospective study.,55-9,"OBJECTIVES: An attempt has been made to demonstrate the value of the immunocytochemical assay of Ki67 antigen expression in blast cells in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) before initiation of treatment and its correlation with early treatment failure. METHODS: Bone marrow specimens were obtained before treatment from children hospitalised in the years 1997-2000. A total of 60 children diagnosed with ALL have been examined. Immunocytochemical staining for Ki67 expression was based on the ABC technique. RESULTS: Out of 45 children assigned to the low risk group, the presence of Ki67 Ag was demonstrated in 31 cases (68.8%). Out of 15 patients in the high risk group, Ki67 Ag expression in blast cells was positive in 8 children (53.3%). The fraction of immunopositive cells in these groups ranged from 19.8 to 81.3% compared to 5% in the control group. Early treatment failure was observed in both groups and these were closely related to the lack of Ki67 expression observed at the beginning of treatment. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a possible connection between the Ki67 immunonegative blast pattern and early leukaemia progression. It may also justify routine determination of Ki67 Ag before the treatment of ALL is initiated.","['Nowicki, Michal', 'Miskowiak, Bogdan', 'Kaczmarek-Kanold, Malgorzata']","['Nowicki M', 'Miskowiak B', 'Kaczmarek-Kanold M']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Institute of Paediatrics, Karol Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland. mapar@eucalyptus.usoms.poznan.pl']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure']",,2002/01/26 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2002/01/26 10:00'],"['2002/01/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2002;62(1):55-9. doi: 10.1159/000048247.,,,"['ocl62055 [pii]', '10.1159/000048247 [doi]']","['Copyright 2002 S.

In order to better understand the complexity and function of these structures, we prepared mAb against lipid rafts from the rat basophilic leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3, which is extensively used for analysis of Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation. One of the antibodies was found to recognize a novel glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored plasma membrane glycoprotein of 250 amino acids, designated TEC-21, containing a cysteine-rich domain homologous to those found in the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor/Ly-6/snake neurotoxin family. TEC-21 is abundant on the surface of RBL-2H3 cells (>10 (6) molecules/cell), but is absent in numerous rat tissues except for testes. Aggregation of TEC-21 on RBL-2H3 cells induced a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates including Syk kinase and LAT adaptor, calcium flux, and release of secretory components. Similar but more profound activation events were observed in cells activated via Fc epsilon RI. However, aggregation of TEC-21 did not induce changes in density of IgE-Fc epsilon RI complexes, tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc epsilon RI beta and gamma subunits, and co-aggregation of Lyn kinase. TEC-21-induced activation events were also observed in Fc epsilon RI(-) mutants of RBL-2H3 cells. Thus, TEC-21 is a novel lipid raft component of RBL-2H3 cells whose aggregation induces activation independently of Fc epsilon RI.","['Halova, Ivana', 'Draberova, Lubica', 'Draber, Petr']","['Halova I', 'Draberova L', 'Draber P']","['Department of Mammalian Genes Expression, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (TEC-21 antigen, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/chemistry/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Microdomains/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",,2002/01/26 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2002/01/26 10:00'],"['2002/01/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 2002 Feb;14(2):213-23. doi: 10.1093/intimm/14.2.213.,,,['10.1093/intimm/14.2.213 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results establish that BCR/ABL promotes cell cycle progression by altering expression of cyclin D2 and that cyclin D2 induction plays a critical role in proliferation of hematopoietic cells by BCR/ABL.","['Jena, Nilamani', 'Deng, Ming', 'Sicinska, Eva', 'Sicinski, Piotr', 'Daley, George Q']","['Jena N', 'Deng M', 'Sicinska E', 'Sicinski P', 'Daley GQ']","['Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA76418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ccnd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin D2)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cyclin D2', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Genes, abl', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetracycline/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2002/01/26 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2002/01/26 10:00'],"['2002/01/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jan 15;62(2):535-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the lung, C/EBPalpha is expressed in bronchial cells and type II pneumocytes. Abnormal proliferation of the latter cell type was reported in C/EBPalpha knockout mice. We determined the expression of C/EBPalpha by Northern blot analysis in 30 lung cancer cell lines and found significant down-regulation in 24 cell lines. Immunohistochemical study of primary tumor specimens showed undetectable or low expression of C/EBPalpha in 23 of 53 specimens. Its expression was more frequently down-regulated in adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated cancer specimens than in squamous cell cancers. A higher frequency of reduced expression was found in more advanced stages. To investigate the consequences of C/EBPalpha expression in lung cancer cells, we stably transfected two cell lines that do not express the gene (Calu1 and H358) with a plasmid allowing for induction of C/EBPalpha protein expression. Induction of C/EBPalpha led to significant growth reduction attributable to proliferation arrest, morphological changes characteristic of differentiation, and apoptosis. These results suggest that C/EBPalpha is down-regulated in a large proportion of lung cancers and that it has growth-inhibitory properties in airway epithelial cells. Genetic analysis of the C/EBPalpha gene is in progress to fully evaluate its role as a novel tumor suppressor in lung cancer.","['Halmos, Balazs', 'Huettner, Claudia S', 'Kocher, Olivier', 'Ferenczi, Katalin', 'Karp, Daniel D', 'Tenen, Daniel G']","['Halmos B', 'Huettner CS', 'Kocher O', 'Ferenczi K', 'Karp DD', 'Tenen DG']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA88046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7733-02-0 (Zinc Sulfate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Sulfate/pharmacology']",,2002/01/26 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2002/01/26 10:00'],"['2002/01/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2002 Jan 15;62(2):528-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that the MLL gene on 11q23 was fused to the SEPTIN6 gene on Xq24, a human homologue to mouse Septin6, in three de novo infant AML with complex chromosomal abnormalities involving 11q23 and Xq22-24. SEPTIN6 consisted of at least 12 exons and was predicted to encode at least two types of proteins by alternative splicing. Expression of approximately 2.3-, 3.1-, and 4.6-kb SEPTIN6 transcripts was simultaneously detected in fetal lung, liver, and brain, in all of the adult tissues except brain, and in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and AML cell lines. However, the expression of an approximately 2.7-kb transcript was detected alone in fetal heart and adult brain. The SEPTIN6 protein is homologous to septin family members including CDCREL1 and AF17q25/MSF, which generate fusion products with MLL. The MLL-SEPTIN6 fusion proteins contain almost the entire septin protein, similar to MLL-CDCREL1 and MLL-AF17q25/MSF. Notably, all three of the patients were diagnosed with M1 or M2.

Liver transplantation was not feasible because of poor nutritional status, pre-existing renal dysfunction and uncertainty about the prognosis of his leukaemia. The patient underwent a successful transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), with immediate resolution of ascites, enabling cessation of diuretics and improvement in nutritional status.

METHODS: Thirty women accepted controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) and oocyte retrievals. Human cumulus granulosa cells were obtained during oocyte retrievals. Using 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) and p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) as substrates, NAT activity of all samples was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. After the incubation with different time and concentrations of 2-AF, PABA, and LIF, 2-acetyl-aminofluorene (2-AAF) and N-acetyl-PABA (N-Ac-PABA) were measured. RESULTS: After incubation with 2.812, 5.625, 11.25, and 22.5 microM of 2-AF/PABA, their product concentrations (2-AAF/N-Ac-PABA) were 0.42/0.32, 0.76/0.58, 1.29/1.04, and 1.94/1.26 nmol/10(6) cells, respectively. After 6, 12, 18, and 24 h incubation with 11.25 microM of 2-AF/PABA, their product concentrations were 0.19/0.12, 0.56/0.4, 0.98/0.79, and 1.3/1.0 nmol/10(6) cells, respectively. After incubation with 0, 5, and 50 microM of LIF, the 2-AAF/N-Ac-PABA concentrations were 0.98/0.80, 0.70/0.52, and 0.49/0.30 nmol/10(6) cells, respectively. CONCLUSION: Intact human cumulus granulosa cells could acetylate arylamine carcinogen (2-AF) and noncarcinogens drug (PABA). LIF decreased the NAT activities.

METHODS: Family cancer history in first- and second-degree relatives was compared in 279 incident cases (242 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia and 37 of acute myeloid leukemia) and 285 controls. Recruitment was stratified by age, gender, hospital, area of residence, and ethnic origin. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using an unconditional regression model taking into account the stratification variables, socioeconomic status, and familial structure. RESULTS: A significant association between childhood acute leukemia and a family history of hematologic neoplasm (OR = 2.7, confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-6.9) was found. This association was particularly clear-cut when the cases were restricted to acute myeloid leukemia (OR = 13.3, CI = 2.5-70.9). Childhood acute leukemia was associated with a family history of solid tumor (OR = 1.5, CI = 1.0-2.2), and elevated odds ratios were observed for family history of gastrointestinal cancer and melanoma. Those results are most unlikely to be explained by socioeconomic status and familial structure, which were very similar for the cases and controls. Differential misclassification is also unlikely for the first-degree relatives, even though it is difficult to rule it out for the second-degree relatives' history. CONCLUSION: The present study supports the hypothesis that a family history of cancer may be a risk factor for childhood acute leukemia.","['Perrillat, F', 'Clavel, J', 'Jaussent, I', 'Baruchel, A', 'Leverger, G', 'Nelken, B', 'Philippe, N', 'Schaison, G', 'Sommelet, D', 'Vilmer, E', 'Bonaiti-Pellie, C', 'Hemon, D']","['Perrillat F', 'Clavel J', 'Jaussent I', 'Baruchel A', 'Leverger G', 'Nelken B', 'Philippe N', 'Schaison G', 'Sommelet D', 'Vilmer E', 'Bonaiti-Pellie C', 'Hemon D']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, INSERM U170, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Child, Preschool', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",,2002/01/26 10:00,2002/05/25 10:01,['2002/01/26 10:00'],"['2002/01/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/25 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 Dec;12(10):935-41. doi: 10.1023/a:1013758114381.,,,['10.1023/a:1013758114381 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Levels of CD59 expression may impair the clinical efficacy of C-activating monoclonal antibodies (mAb); thus, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the lack of CD59 expression in selected melanoma cells. Serological and biochemical analyses showed that MeWo melanoma cells expressed CD59 neither at cell surface nor at cytoplasmic levels; however, no critical mutations were identified in their CD59 mRNA. Consistently, MeWo CD59 cDNA (MeWo-CD59) was appropriately translated when transfected into the CD59-positive Mel 100 melanoma cells, and into the CD59-negative Nalm-6 pre-B leukemia cells that acquired resistance to C. In contrast, transfection of MeWo cells with CD59 cDNA from Mel 275 melanoma cells did not induce CD59 expression; however, their transfection with the CD59-TM chimeric construct, obtained by replacing the GPI-anchoring signal of MeWo-CD59 with the transmembrane tail of the human low-density lipoprotein receptor, induced the expression of a C-protective transmembrane form of CD59. These data, together with the absent expression of additional GPI-anchored proteins (i.e., CD55), suggest that defects in the biosynthesis and/or processing of GPI-anchored proteins underlie the lack of CD59 expression in MeWo cells. Further unveiling of the molecular mechanism that turns off CD59 expression in human melanoma cells will help to set-up more effective therapeutic strategies utilizing C-activating mAb in melanoma patients.","['De Nardo, Chiara', 'Fonsatti, Ester', 'Sigalotti, Luca', 'Calabro, Luana', 'Colizzi, Francesca', 'Cortini, Enzo', 'Coral, Sandra', 'Altomonte, Maresa', 'Maio, Michele']","['De Nardo C', 'Fonsatti E', 'Sigalotti L', 'Calabro L', 'Colizzi F', 'Cortini E', 'Coral S', 'Altomonte M', 'Maio M']","['Cancer Bioimmunotherapy Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, Istituto Nazionale di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['CD59 Antigens/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Complement System Proteins/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*physiopathology', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/02/06 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2002 Feb;190(2):200-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10050.,,,"['10.1002/jcp.10050 [pii]', '10.1002/jcp.10050 [doi]']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the exact sequence of events that occur during the early stages of infection are not known in detail, the initial route of infection may predetermine, along with host, environmental, and viral factors, the subset of target cells and/or the primary immune response encountered by HTLV-I, and whether an HTLV-I-infected individual will remain asymptomatic, develop ATL, or progress to the neuroinflammatory disease, HAM/TSP. Although a large number of studies have indicated that CD4(+) T cells represent an important target for HTLV-I infection in the peripheral blood (PB), additional evidence has accumulated over the past several years demonstrating that HTLV-I can infect several additional cellular compartments in vivo, including CD8(+) T lymphocytes, PB monocytes, dendritic cells, B lymphocytes, and resident central nervous system (CNS) astrocytes. More importantly, extensive latent viral infection of the bone marrow, including cells likely to be hematopoietic progenitor cells, has been observed in individuals with HAM/TSP as well as some asymptomatic carriers, but to a much lesser extent in individuals with ATL. Furthermore, HTLV-I(+) CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells can maintain the intact proviral genome and initiate viral gene expression during the differentiation process. Introduction of HTLV-I-infected bone marrow progenitor cells into the PB, followed by genomic activation and low level viral gene expression may lead to an increase in proviral DNA load in the PB, resulting in a progressive state of immune dysregulation including the generation of a detrimental cytotoxic Tax-specific CD8(+) T cell population, anti-HTLV-I antibodies, and neurotoxic cytokines involved in disruption of myelin-producing cells and neuronal degradation characteristic of HAM/TSP.","['Grant, Christian', 'Barmak, Kate', 'Alefantis, Timothy', 'Yao, Jing', 'Jacobson, Steven', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Grant C', 'Barmak K', 'Alefantis T', 'Yao J', 'Jacobson S', 'Wigdahl B']","['Laboratory for Molecular Retrovirology and Viral Neuropathogenesis, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],['CA54559-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/virology', 'Central Nervous System/virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/immunology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Nervous System Diseases/*virology', 'Neuritis/virology', 'Viremia']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/02/06 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/06 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2002 Feb;190(2):133-59. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10053.,,220,"['10.1002/jcp.10053 [pii]', '10.1002/jcp.10053 [doi]']","['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that beta-carotene may act as a pro- or anticancerogenic agent by modulating pathways involved in cell growth and that such a modulation may involve a redox mechanism. To test this hypothesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis and redox status were evaluated in undifferentiated and dimethylsulfoxide-differentiated HL-60 cells exposed to beta-carotene. The carotenoid modified cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. These effects were more remarkable in undifferentiated cells than in differentiated cells. In accord with these findings, in undifferentiated cells, beta-carotene was more effective in decreasing cyclin A and Bcl-2 expression and in increasing p21 and p27 expression. Neither Bcl-xL nor Bax expression were significantly modified by the carotenoid. From a mechanistic point of view, the delay in cell growth by beta-carotene was highly coincident with the increased intracellular reactive oxygen species production and oxidized glutathione content induced by the carotenoid. Moreover, alpha-tocopherol minimized the effects of beta-carotene on cell growth. These data provide evidence that beta-carotene modulates molecular pathways involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis and support the hypothesis that a redox mechanism may be implicated. They also suggest that differentiated cells may be less susceptible to the carotenoid than highly neoplastic undifferentiated cells.","['Palozza, Paola', 'Serini, Simona', 'Torsello, Angela', 'Boninsegna, Alma', 'Covacci, Valeria', 'Maggiano, Nicola', 'Ranelletti, Franco O', 'Wolf, Federica I', 'Calviello, Gabriella']","['Palozza P', 'Serini S', 'Torsello A', 'Boninsegna A', 'Covacci V', 'Maggiano N', 'Ranelletti FO', 'Wolf FI', 'Calviello G']","['Institute of General Pathology, Catholic University, Rome, Italy. ibipg@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '01YAE03M7J (beta Carotene)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'H4N855PNZ1 (alpha-Tocopherol)', 'ULW86O013H (Glutathione Disulfide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin A/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione Disulfide/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'alpha-Tocopherol/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'beta Carotene/*pharmacology']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/02/09 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Feb 10;97(5):593-600. doi: 10.1002/ijc.10094.,,,"['10.1002/ijc.10094 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.10094 [doi]']","['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of these serious complications after autologous hematopoietic transplantation ranges from 1.1% to 24%. Prior chemotherapy is its most likely cause, but other variables related to these long-term complications are seriously discussed. There is evidence that priming of progenitor cells isolated from peripheral blood with chemotherapy is also related to a higher risk of secondary MDS/AL. Whether progenitor cells isolated from bone marrow or peripheral blood after mobilization only with cytokines are related to higher risk is a controversial issue. In this paper, we analyze the incidence and variables related to these complications in a series of 99 patients diagnosed with lymphoma or multiple myeloma who underwent autologous transplantation using hematopoietic progenitors isolated from peripheral blood mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). The probability of MDS/AL in patients alive 5 years after transplant in our series is 8.58%, similar to that reported in other series using bone marrow grafts. The total dose of cyclophosphamide ( p=0.099), the number of chemotherapy cycles ( p=0.04) received before transplant, and the total dose of mononuclear cells infused at the time of transplant were the only variables associated with secondary MDS/AL.

These factors act via receptor complexes involving gp130 and LIFR-beta and ligand binding leads to activation of various signaling pathways, including phosphorylation of Stat3. The role of Stat3 in neuronal survival was investigated in mice by Cre-mediated gene ablation in motoneurons. Cre is expressed under the neurofilament light chain (NF-L) promoter, starting around E12 when these neurons become dependent on neurotrophic support. Loss of motoneurons during the embryonic period of naturally occurring cell death is not enhanced in NF-L-Cre; Stat3(flox/KO) mice although motoneurons isolated from these mice need higher concentrations of CNTF for maximal survival in culture. In contrast, motoneuron survival is significantly reduced after facial nerve lesion in the adult. These neurons, however, can be rescued by the addition of neurotrophic factors, including CNTF. Stat3 is essential for upregulation of Reg-2 and Bcl-xl expression in lesioned motoneurons. Our data show that Stat3 activation plays an essential role for motoneuron survival after nerve lesion in postnatal life but not during embryonic development, indicating that signaling requirements for motoneuron survival change during maturation.","['Schweizer, Ulrich', 'Gunnersen, Jennifer', 'Karch, Christoph', 'Wiese, Stefan', 'Holtmann, Bettina', 'Takeda, Kiyoshi', 'Akira, Shizuo', 'Sendtner, Michael']","['Schweizer U', 'Gunnersen J', 'Karch C', 'Wiese S', 'Holtmann B', 'Takeda K', 'Akira S', 'Sendtner M']","['Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, University of Wurzburg, 97080 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Lithostathine)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurofilament Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (neurofilament protein L)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Axotomy', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Facial Nerve Injuries/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Integrases/genetics/metabolism', 'Lithostathine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Neurons/*cytology/metabolism/pathology', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nervous System/*embryology/growth & development/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurofilament Proteins/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",PMC2199226,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/03/29 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/29 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2002 Jan 21;156(2):287-97. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200107009.

A variety of pathways of tumor cytotoxicity different from cytotoxic chemotherapy have been proposed for this therapeutic antibody including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis. This report describes that a proportion of patients with CLL receiving rituximab treatment have in vivo activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage in blood leukemia cells immediately following infusion of rituximab. This suggests that apoptosis using a pathway similar to fludarabine and other chemotherapeutic agents is intricately involved in the blood elimination of tumor cells after rituximab treatment. Patients having caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in vivo had a significantly lower blood leukemia cell count after treatment as compared to those without caspase activation. Significant down-modulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP and Mcl-1 was also noted, possibly explaining in part how rituximab sensitizes CLL cells to the cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy in vivo. These findings suggest that the therapeutic benefit of antibody-based therapy in vivo for patients with CLL depends in part on induction of apoptosis and provides another area of focus for studying mechanisms of antibody-resistance in neoplastic cells.","['Byrd, John C', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Aron, Jennifer L', 'Pearson, Michael', 'Lucas, David', 'Reed, John C']","['Byrd JC', 'Kitada S', 'Flinn IW', 'Aron JL', 'Pearson M', 'Lucas D', 'Reed JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, B302 Starling Loving Hall, 320 W 10th Ave, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. byrd-3@medctr.ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['CA 98099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 81534-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects', 'Proteins/drug effects', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 1;99(3):1038-43. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.3.1038.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.3.1038 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38300-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NLCs express cytoplasmic vimentin and stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1). NLCs also express CD14, as well as CD11b, CD33, CD40, CD45RO, CD68, CD80, CD86, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR, but not CD1a, CD2, CD3, CD11c, CD19, CD45RA, CD83, CD106, or CD154. Consistent with this phenotype, NLCs failed to differentiate from blood mononuclear cells that were depleted of CD14+ cells or from isolated CD19+ cells. CD14+ blood cells of healthy donors could differentiate into cells with the morphology and phenotype of NLCs when cultured in direct contact with CLL B cells, but not with normal B cells. Despite expressing antigens in common with blood monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and macrophages, NLCs expressed significantly higher levels of CD68 than these other cell types. Consistent with the notion that NLCs are present in vivo, CD14+ splenocytes from CLL patients have NLC morphology and express significantly higher levels of CD68 than CD14+ splenocytes from persons without known B-cell malignancy. These findings indicate that although NLCs may differentiate from blood monocytes, they probably represent a distinctive hematopoietic cell type that exists in vivo, differentiates from hematopoietic CD14+ cells in the context of CLL, and in turn protect CLL cells from apoptosis via a mechanism that is independent of CD106 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1).

CD38 expression has been suggested as a surrogate marker for the 2 subtypes. IgV(H) mutations and CD38 expression in 145 patients with B-CLL with a long follow-up were compared. The 2 assays gave discordant results in 41 patients (28.3%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Binet stage, IgV(H) mutations and CD38 were independent prognostic indicators. Median survival time in patients whose cells had unmutated IgV(H) genes and expressed CD38 was 8 years; in those with mutated IgV(H) genes not expressing CD38, it was 26 years. For those with discordant results, median survival time was 15 years. Thus, although CD38 expression does not identify the same 2 subsets as IgV(H) mutations in CLL, it is an independent risk factor that can be used with IgV(H) mutations and clinical stage to select patients with B-CLL with the worst prognoses. Using cryopreserved cells taken at intervals during the course of the disease, however, changes of CD38 expression over time were demonstrated in 10 of 41 patients. Causes of the variation of CD38 expression require further study. Additional prospective studies are required for comparing CD38 expression with other prognostic factors and for taking sequential measurements during the course of the disease.","['Hamblin, Terry J', 'Orchard, Jenny A', 'Ibbotson, Rachel E', 'Davis, Zadie', 'Thomas, Peter W', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Oscier, David G']","['Hamblin TJ', 'Orchard JA', 'Ibbotson RE', 'Davis Z', 'Thomas PW', 'Stevenson FK', 'Oscier DG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Castle Lane East, Bournemouth, BH7 7DW, United Kingdom. terjoha@aol.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*blood', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/blood/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Survival Analysis']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 1;99(3):1023-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.3.1023.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.3.1023 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38298-7 [pii]']",,,,['Blood. 2002 Aug 1;100(3):1106.

Recently, arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) has been identified as an alternative therapy in patients with both ATRA-sensitive and ATRA-resistant APL. At the cellular level, As(2)O(3) triggers apoptosis and a partial differentiation of APL cells in a dose-dependent manner; both effects are observed in vivo among patients with APL and APL animal models. To further explore the mechanism of As(2)O(3)-induced differentiation, the combined effects of arsenic and a number of other differentiation inducers on APL cell lines (NB4 and NB4-R1) and some fresh APL cells were examined. The data show that a strong synergy exists between a low concentration of As(2)O(3) (0.25 microM) and the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analogue, 8-CPT-cAMP, in fully inducing differentiation of NB4, NB4-R1, and fresh APL cells. Furthermore, cAMP facilitated the degradation of As(2)O(3)-mediated fusion protein PML-RARalpha, a process considered to play a key role in overcoming the differentiation arrest of APL cells. On the other hand, cAMP could significantly inhibit cell growth by modulating several major players in G(1)/S transition regulation.

Median follow-up of this study was 7.3 years. From January 1988 to April 1994, among 794 adult (> 12 but < 60 years) patients registered, 778 were eligible. Their median age was 27.5 years; 73% had B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 22% had T-lineage disease; 18% showed associated myeloid markers; 47 of 216 analyzed patients (22%) had Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Response to PDN pretreatment was observed in 65% of cases. CR was achieved in 627 patients (82%). Resistant patients and induction death rates were 11% and 7%, respectively. Random II was applied to 388 patients with CR; 201 had maintenance alone and 187 had consolidation followed by maintenance. The relapse rate was 60%; isolated central nervous system relapses were 8% of all CRs and 13% of all relapses. Median survival (overall survival [OS]), continuous complete remission (CCR), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 2.2, 2.4, and 2 years, respectively. PDN pretreatment response resulted the main independent factor influencing CR achievement, OS, CCR, and DFS; the addition of cyclophosphamide in induction significantly influenced CR achievement in a multivariate analysis. Neither induction intensification nor early consolidation appeared to influence CCR and DFS duration.

CMML shares myelodysplastic characteristics with features of myeloproliferative disorders. No treatment has proven effective in modifying the natural course of the disease. To improve the prognostic assessment of clinical outcome, the associations of patient and disease characteristics with survival times of 213 patients with CMML was investigated retrospectively. Median survival was 12 months. Univariate analysis identified low hemoglobin level; low platelet count; high white blood cell, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts; presence of circulating immature myeloid cells, high percentage of marrow blasts, low percentage of marrow erythroid cells, abnormal cytogenetics, and high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta(2)-microglobulin as characteristics associated with shorter survival. Hemoglobin level below 120 g/L (12 g/dL), presence of circulating immature myeloid cells, absolute lymphocyte count above 2.5 x 10(9)/L, and marrow blasts 10% or more were independently associated with shorter survival by multivariate analysis and were used to generate a prognostic score. The model identified 4 subgroups of patients with median survival of 24, 15, 8, and 5 months for low, intermediate-1, intermediate-2, and high risk, respectively. Researchers could not confer objective evidence suggesting that arbitrary divisions of CMML by white blood cell counts into ""dysplastic"" and ""proliferative"" categories reflect clinical entities differing in the risk of acute leukemia development, although a trend of shorter survival in patients with leukocytosis was observed. The prognostic model was compared with 6 previously published scoring systems for myelodysplastic syndrome/CMML.

Thus, antiangiogenic therapy could constitute a novel strategy for the treatment of AML. To test this hypothesis, a phase I/II dose-escalating trial was performed to study the safety and efficacy of thalidomide, a putative inhibitor of angiogenesis, in 20 patients with AML. Thirteen patients were assessable for both toxicity and response, tolerating a maximum dose of 200 to 400 mg daily for at least 1 month. Seven patients had to be prematurely withdrawn from drug administration owing to progressive disease and death (3 patients), personal decision (2 patients), or inability to tolerate thalidomide (2 patients). Overall, adverse events were fatigue, constipation, rash, and neuropathy (grade 1 to 2 in most patients). In 4 patients, a partial response, defined as reduction of at least 50% in the blast cell infiltration of the bone marrow accompanied by increases in platelet counts and hemoglobin values, was observed. One additional patient showed a hematologic improvement without fulfilling the criteria of a partial response. The responses lasted a median of 3 months (range, 1-8 months). In parallel, microvessel densities significantly decreased in these 5 patients during treatment with thalidomide (P <.05). This decrease was accompanied by declining plasma levels of basic fibroblast growth factor, one of the most potent angiogenic growth factors. In conclusion, single-agent thalidomide has antiangiogenic and antileukemic activity in AML, although a causal relationship between both effects has still to be proven.","['Steins, Martin B', 'Padro, Teresa', 'Bieker, Ralf', 'Ruiz, Sandra', 'Kropff, Martin', 'Kienast, Joachim', 'Kessler, Torsten', 'Buechner, Thomas', 'Berdel, Wolfgang E', 'Mesters, Rolf M']","['Steins MB', 'Padro T', 'Bieker R', 'Ruiz S', 'Kropff M', 'Kienast J', 'Kessler T', 'Buechner T', 'Berdel WE', 'Mesters RM']","['Department of Medicine/Hematology and Oncology, University of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, D-48129 Muenster, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply/drug effects/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*drug therapy', 'Leukemic Infiltration/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Thalidomide/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 1;99(3):834-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.3.834.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.3.834 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38274-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, it is shown that the addition of SDF-1 to long-term cultures (LTCs) of normal human marrow can selectively, reversibly, and specifically block the S-phase entry of primitive quiescent erythroid and granulopoietic colony-forming cells (CFCs) present in the adherent layer. Conversely, addition of anti-SDF-1 antibody or SDF-1(G2), a specific CXCR4 antagonist, to preactivated human LTCs prevented both types of primitive CFCs from re-entering a quiescent state, demonstrating that endogenous SDF-1 contributes to the control of primitive CFC proliferation in the LTC system. Interestingly, SDF-1 failed to arrest the proliferation of primitive chronic myeloid leukemia CFCs in the adherent layer of LTCs containing normal marrow stromal cells. In vivo, injection of SDF-1 arrested the cycling of normal human LTC-initiating cells as well as primitive CFCs in the marrow of nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice engrafted with human cord blood cells. Conversely, injection of the antagonist, SDF-1(G2), reactivated the cycling of quiescent primitive human CFCs present in the marrow of mice engrafted with human marrow cells. These studies are the first to demonstrate a potential physiological role of SDF-1 in regulating the cell-cycle status of primitive hematopoietic cells and suggest that the deregulated cycling activity of primitive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells is due to the BCR-ABL-mediated disruption of a pathway shared by multiple chemokine receptors.","['Cashman, Johanne', 'Clark-Lewis, Ian', 'Eaves, Allen', 'Eaves, Connie']","['Cashman J', 'Clark-Lewis I', 'Eaves A', 'Eaves C']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 601 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['eng'],['P01 HL 55435/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD/*blood', 'Mice, SCID/*blood', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 1;99(3):792-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.3.792.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.3.792 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38268-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which induces differentiation of the leukemic cells into mature granulocytes, represents the important advance. The incorporation of ATRA in induction results in a high complete remission rate, leads to rapid resolution of the characteristic life-threatening coagulopathy, and, most importantly, decreases the relapse rate compared with treatment with chemotherapy alone. However, ATRA is associated with unique toxicities not observed with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. A number of clinical trials have been performed to define the optimal role of ATRA in the treatment of patients. The therapeutic strategies have rapidly evolved as a result of both single institution and large cooperative group trials. Arsenic trioxide and stem cell transplantation are effective treatments for patients with APL who relapse after or are refractory to ATRA-based therapy. As experience with ATRA and arsenic trioxide in patients with APL accumulates, a number of important questions arise that need to be addressed.","['Tallman, Martin S', 'Nabhan, Chadi', 'Feusner, James H', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Tallman MS', 'Nabhan C', 'Feusner JH', 'Rowe JM']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Robert H.

Nevertheless, how RAR activity might be regulated in the presumably homogenous concentration of retinoids in blood and bone marrow and how these receptors might interact with specific hematopoietic cytokines to regulate normal myeloid differentiation remain unclear. Here, using several cytokine-dependent in vitro models of myeloid development, it was observed that specific hematopoietic cytokines that normally regulate myeloid lineage commitment and differentiation (interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) trigger the enhancement of both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent transcriptional activity of both endogenous and exogenous (transiently transfected) RARs. This cytokine-mediated enhancement of RAR activity is not associated with any observed changes in expression of the RARs or their respective coactivators/corepressors. These studies define a previously unknown cytokine-RAR interaction during myelopoiesis and suggest that RAR activation might be a critical downstream event following interleukin-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling during myeloid differentiation. This observation of ligand-independent activation of RARs that is mediated by certain cytokines represents a new paradigm with respect to how RAR activity might be modulated during hematopoiesis and also suggests a molecular basis for the differential sensitivity of human acute myelogenous leukemia cells to retinoids.","['Johnson, Barton S', 'Mueller, LeMoyne', 'Si, Jutong', 'Collins, Steven J']","['Johnson BS', 'Mueller L', 'Si J', 'Collins SJ']","['Division of Hospital Dentistry, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, 1100 Fairview Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA 58292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/chemistry/cytology/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection']",,2002/01/25 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2002/01/25 10:00'],"['2002/01/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/25 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2002 Feb 1;99(3):746-53. doi: 10.1182/blood.v99.3.746.,,,"['10.1182/blood.v99.3.746 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)38263-X [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A highly conserved Pro-Thr-Ala-Pro (PTAP) motif (the ""late"" or ""L"" domain), is critical for the virus-budding activity of p6. Recently, it was demonstrated that the product of tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), which contains at its N terminus a domain highly related to ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes, binds HIV-1 Gag in a p6-dependent fashion. We examined the impact of overexpressing the N-terminal region of TSG101 on HIV-1 particle assembly and release. We observed that this domain (referred to as TSG-5') potently inhibits virus production. Examination of cells coexpressing HIV-1 Gag and TSG-5' by electron microscopy reveals a defect in virus budding reminiscent of that observed with p6 L domain mutants. In addition, the effect of TSG-5' depends on an intact p6 L domain; the assembly and release of virus-like particles produced by Gag mutants lacking a functional p6 PTAP motif is not significantly affected by TSG-5'. Furthermore, assembly and release of murine leukemia virus and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus are insensitive to TSG-5'. TSG-5' is incorporated into virions, confirming the Gag/TSG101 interaction in virus-producing cells. Mutations that inactivate the p6 L domain block TSG-5' incorporation. These data demonstrate a link between the E2-like domain of TSG101 and HIV-1 L domain function, and indicate that TSG101 derivatives can act as potent and specific inhibitors of HIV-1 replication by blocking virus budding.","['Demirov, Dimiter G', 'Ono, Akira', 'Orenstein, Jan M', 'Freed, Eric O']","['Demirov DG', 'Ono A', 'Orenstein JM', 'Freed EO']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/physiology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*growth & development/physiology/ultrastructure', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/growth & development/physiology', 'Mason-Pfizer monkey virus/growth & development/physiology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",PMC117412,2002/01/24 10:00,2002/05/01 10:01,['2002/01/24 10:00'],"['2002/01/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/01 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Jan 22;99(2):955-60. doi: 10.1073/pnas.032511899.,,,"['10.1073/pnas.032511899 [doi]', '99/2/955 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insufficient transfection and inflammatory responses that are due to the immunogenicity of multiple vector systems are often limiting factors in these approaches. The potential of genetically modified T lymphocytes was investigated as a delivery system for therapeutic transgenes to transplanted organs as a way to circumvent immunogenicity and efficiency problems in a rat transplant model. Gene-engineering of alloantigen-specific rat T cell lines was performed by using a Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV)-based enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) encoding retroviral transduction system. The ex vivo gene-modified lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into syngeneic rats carrying allogeneic, syngeneic, or third party kidneys. Homing behavior, activation level, and transgene expression of the adoptively given cells were monitored. The T(EGFP) lymphocytes infiltrated the transplanted kidneys in an antigen-specific manner. High numbers of alloantigen-specific T lymphocytes accumulated exclusively in allografts but not in syngeneic or third party grafts. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that only T(EGFP) lymphocytes found in allografts had an activated phenotype that resulted in higher transgene expression. Alloantigen-specific homing, activation, and transgene expression are important prerequisites for the guarantee of localized delivery and expression of transgenic proteins by gene-engineered T lymphocytes. Antigen-specific gene-targeting strategies using ex vivo modified T lymphocytes with donor specificity are a novel approach to the delivery of therapeutic transgenes in transplantation.","['Hammer, Markus H', 'Schroder, Grit', 'Risch, Kirsten', 'Flugel, Alexander', 'Volk, Hans-Dieter', 'Lehmann, Manfred', 'Ritter, Thomas']","['Hammer MH', 'Schroder G', 'Risch K', 'Flugel A', 'Volk HD', 'Lehmann M', 'Ritter T']","['*Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Neuroimmunology, Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.', '*Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Neuroimmunology, Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.', '*Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Neuroimmunology, Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.', '*Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Neuroimmunology, Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.', '*Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Neuroimmunology, Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.', '*Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Neuroimmunology, Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.', '*Institute of Medical Immunology, Charite, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany; Institute of Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany; Department of Neuroimmunology, Max-Planck Institute for Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Gene Expression/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Isoantigens/*physiology', 'Kidney Transplantation/immunology/*physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Rats, Inbred WF', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/physiology', 'Transgenes/*physiology']",,2002/01/24 10:00,2002/03/14 10:01,['2002/01/24 10:00'],"['2002/01/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/14 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 2002 Feb;13(2):511-518. doi: 10.1681/ASN.V132511.,,,"['13/2/511 [pii]', '10.1681/ASN.V132511 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1681/ASN.V132511 [doi]

We report the radiologic features of ATRA syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the past 5 years, 69 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with ATRA. Of this group, 15 patients developed ATRA syndrome. Serial chest radiographs of the 15 patients with ATRA syndrome were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of pleural effusion, pulmonary nodules, consolidation, ground-glass opacity, septal lines, increased pulmonary blood volume, peribronchial cuffing, and air bronchogram. Also, we measured the cardiothoracic ratio and the vascular pedicle width. RESULTS: Chest radiographs showed increased cardiothoracic ratio in 13 of the 15 patients, increased vascular pedicle width in 13, increased pulmonary blood volume in 13, septal lines in nine, peribronchial cuffing in nine, ground-glass opacity in nine, consolidation in seven, and nodules in seven. Pleural effusion was noted in 11 of the 15 patients, and air bronchogram was noted in five of the 15 patients. Pulmonary hemorrhage developed in three patients who were being treated with ATRA; they showed bilateral, diffuse, poorly defined nodules and ground-glass opacity on radiography. CONCLUSION: Most patients with ATRA syndrome have abnormal findings on chest radiographs, and the abnormalities are similar to those of pulmonary edema.","['Jung, Jung Im', 'Choi, Jung Eun', 'Hahn, Seong Tai', 'Min, Chang Ki', 'Kim, Chun Choo', 'Park, Seog Hee']","['Jung JI', 'Choi JE', 'Hahn ST', 'Min CK', 'Kim CC', 'Park SH']","[""Department of Radiology, St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 62 Yeouidodong, Youngdungpo-gu, Seoul 150-713, South Korea.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

However, the regions of HTLV-1 gp46 that contain conformational epitopes are poorly defined. We previously reported on human monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) to conformational epitopes within the HTLV-1 surface glycoprotein (gp46) that inhibit HTLV-1-mediated syncytium formation (Hadlock KG, Rowe J, Perkins S, et al.: J Virol 1997;71:5828-5840). To localize the conformational epitopes recognized by these antibodies, chimeric envelope proteins were constructed in which selected regions of the HTLV-1 envelope were replaced with the corresponding sequences from other members of the HTLV family of retroviruses. The chimeras were tested for reactivity with three hMAbs to conformational epitopes in HTLV-1 gp46, PRH-7A, PRH-3, and PRH-4, and one hMAb to a linear epitope, 0.5alpha. hMAb PRH-3 was specifically nonreactive with a chimera that replaced amino acids 32-36 of HTLV-1 gp46 and exhibited sharply reduced reactivity with a chimera that replaced amino acids 224-251 of HTLV-1 with the corresponding HTLV-2 sequence. hMAb PRH-4 was specifically nonreactive with a construct replacing amino acids 1-162 of HTLV-1 gp46 with the corresponding HTLV-2 sequence.

Pharmacogenomics is a burgeoning field that aims to elucidate inherited differences in drug disposition and treatment response, toward individualizing therapy to enhance efficacy and reduce toxicity.

Infused hematopoietic cells have to engraft in the presence of host hematopoietic cells that survive conditioning. The net result is the appearance of the so called mixed chimerism, which indicates the presence of a variable number of donor cells among cells of host origin. Further immunomodulation after transplantation is used to increase engraftment, decrease graft versus host disease and to maintain graft versus disease effect. This strategy permits allogeneic transplantation to be used in older patients and those with comorbidities that are unable to tolerate conventional high-dose preparative regimens. In consequence, it would increase the range of disorders to be treated with bone marrow transplantation. Additionally, this could be supplemented by the transfer of immune cells of bone marrow transplant donor to induce graft-versus leukemia effect. Different non-myeloablative conditioning regimens have been proposed: one regimen is using low dose TBI [200 cGy] and several others are based on purine analogues.

Therefore, glucocorticoids are commonly used as immunosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents. This review examines many facets of the process by which glucocorticoids induce apoptosis. This process is divided into three stages, an initiation stage that involves glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene regulation, a decision stage that involves the counterbalancing influence of prosurvival and proapoptotic factors, and the execution stage which involves caspase and endonuclease activation. Many aspects of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation, are important steps in virtually all forms of apoptosis.

We soon observed that there seemed to be a considerable discrepancy between the reimbursement amount and the real cost of allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation. It was therefore decided to undertake a prospective micro-cost analysis to define a more realistic reimbursement. To identify real costs, we undertook a registration of pre-transplant procedures, transplantation and 1 year follow-up costs, including harvesting, personnel costs, clinical and laboratory procedures, together with blood products and drugs related to patients and donors. These data were compared to hospital DRG reimbursement. This information was registered for 17 consecutive patients, with a mean age 40 years (range 17-58 years). Ten patients had chronic myeloid leukaemia, three had acute lymphatic leukaemia, two had acute myeloid leukaemia and two had myelodysplastic syndrome. The data analysis showed a mean cost of US$ 106825 (NOK 901982), (range US$ 42376-362430). The average actual hospital revenue (50% DRG reimbursement + income related to length of stay + special procedure funding) was US$ 36404 (range US$ 26228-55998).

Full inhibitions were accomplished with most RT and IN combinations tested at around equimolar RT/IN ratios. The disintegration activity of IN was also inhibited by RTs. Neither DNA synthesis nor the ribonuclease H (RNase H) domain of RT were involved in IN inhibition, since specific DNA polymerase inhibitors did not affect the level of IN inhibition, and the p51 isoform of HIV-1 RT (which lacks the RNase H domain) is as effective in inhibiting IN as the heterodimeric p66/p51 isoform. On the other hand, the catalytic activities of HIV RTs were not affected by the INs, showing that RTs can inhibit IN activities, whereas INs do not inhibit RTs. We postulate that sequences and/or three-dimensional protein structures common to RTs interact with INs and inhibit their activities.

To explore the molecular mechanisms of its cell-specific localization, a fusion protein between green fluorescent protein (GFP) and human 5-LO (GFP-5LO) was expressed in various cells. GFP-5LO was localized in the cytosol in HL-60 cells and in both the nucleus and the cytosol in RBL (rat basophilic leukaemia) cells, similarly to the native enzyme in these cells. The localization of GFP fusion proteins for mutant 5-LOs in a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS), amino acids 638-655, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 and Swiss3T3 cells revealed that this motif is important for the nuclear localization of 5-LO. A GFP fusion protein of this short peptide localized consistently in the nucleus. Leptomycin B, a specific inhibitor of nuclear export signal (NES)-dependent transport, diminished the cytosolic localization of 5-LO in HL-60 cells and that of GFP-5LO in CHO-K1 cells, suggesting that an NES-system might also function in determining 5-LO localization. Analysis of the localization of 5-LO during the cell cycle points to a controlled movement of this enzyme. Thus we conclude that a balance of NLS- and NES-dependent mechanisms determines the cell-type-specific localization of 5-LO, suggesting a nuclear function for this enzyme.","['Hanaka, Hiromi', 'Shimizu, Takao', 'Izumi, Takashi']","['Hanaka H', 'Shimizu T', 'Izumi T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Gunma University School of Medicine, 3-39-22 Showamachi, Maebashi, Gunma 371-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Localization Signals)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Localization Signals/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC1222333,2002/01/23 10:00,2002/03/13 10:01,['2002/01/23 10:00'],"['2002/01/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/23 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2002 Feb 1;361(Pt 3):505-14. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3610505.,,,['10.1042/0264-6021:3610505 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of t(12;16) translocations, CHOP is rearranged and fused to TLS in 16p11 in about 90% of myxoid liposarcomas/round cell liposarcomas (MLS/RCLS). The TLS-CHOP protein consists of the N-terminal half of TLS juxtaposed to the N-terminal of the entire CHOP. It is capable of forming dimers with the natural dimer partners of CHOP. Here we report that recombinant TLS-CHOP-green fluorescence protein localizes to nuclear structures, similar to, but distinct from, PML nuclear bodies. The TLS-CHOP-green fluorescent protein nuclear structures are resistant to high salt concentration and nuclease treatment. Transfection of TLS-CHOP to normal fibroblasts causes a rapid down regulation and relocation of PML nuclear bodies. An abnormal extra nuclear localization of PML bodies was also found in TLS-CHOP carrying cell lines established from myxoid liposarcomas. Transfection of TLS-CHOP induced a rapid disappearance of PCNA. TLS-CHOP may disturb the nuclear machinery by binding and sequestering important factors from their natural sites.","['Thelin-Jarnum, Sofia', 'Goransson, Melker', 'Burguete, Alondra Schweizer', 'Olofsson, Anita', 'Aman, Pierre']","['Thelin-Jarnum S', 'Goransson M', 'Burguete AS', 'Olofsson A', 'Aman P']","['The Lundberg Laboratory for Cancer Research, Department of Pathology, Goteborg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TLS-CHOP fusion protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-12-7 (Transcription Factor CHOP)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Dimerization', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fibrosarcoma/pathology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/analysis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Liposarcoma, Myxoid/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*RNA-Binding Protein FUS', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor CHOP', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2002 Feb 1;97(4):446-50. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1632.,,,"['10.1002/ijc.1632 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1632 [doi]']","['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care children's hospital. PATIENTS: Three children underwent surgery between April 1996 and June 1998. Ages at treatment ranged from 11 to 14 years. All had bilateral, biopsy-proven invasive fungal disease of the lateral walls of the nose. All were undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). INTERVENTION: Bilateral lateral rhinotomies for medial maxillectomy. Two of 3 also had simultaneous total septectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Skin survival and patient survival. RESULTS: All three patients had bilateral simultaneous medial maxillectomy for invasive fungal disease in the presence of profound pancytopenia secondary to treatment of leukemia. One patient had minor nasal edema postoperatively, but none showed any loss of the central nasal skin or facial skeleton. All patients survived the invasive fungal disease with follow-up of at least 24 months. All patients underwent multiple debridements after the original surgery, and 3 of 6 eyes had permanent epiphora requiring dacryocystorhinostomies. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral simultaneous lateral rhinotomies are safe in children and did not result in any central skin loss. Aggressive bilateral surgery for invasive fungal disease is compatible with a good esthetic outcome and long-term survival.","['Malhotra, P S', 'Danahey, D', 'Sidman, J']","['Malhotra PS', 'Danahey D', 'Sidman J']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, University of Minnesota Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Laryngoscope,The Laryngoscope,8607378,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Male', 'Maxillary Sinus/*surgery', 'Maxillary Sinusitis/immunology/*microbiology/*surgery', 'Mycoses/immunology/*surgery', 'Nose/*surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Laryngoscope. 2001 Nov;111(11 Pt 1):1960-3. doi: 10.1097/00005537-200111000-00017.,,,['10.1097/00005537-200111000-00017 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was followed by accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy (AHFTRT) consisting of 30 Gy given as 1.5-Gy fractions twice daily with a 2-week break and then the AHFTRT was repeated. The AHFTRT was given concomitantly with daily oral etoposide and daily intravenous cisplatin. Prophylactic cranial radiation was delivered with the AHFTRT. After completion of the AHFTRT, patients received 4 cycles of oral etoposide maintenance chemotherapy. Follow-up of patients was continued until death or a minimum of 42 months. Three patients had severe toxic responses. No patients completed the entire protocol because of toxicity or progression during treatment. Three patients completed the majority of the protocol except for the four cycles of maintenance etoposide. Four of five patients achieved a complete response. There were two recurrences within the irradiated field, and distant metastases developed in four patients. Acute nonlymphocytic leukemia developed in one patient, who died 2 months later.

We have recently found that VAA-I is a potent inducer of human neutrophil apoptosis, but the mechanism(s) involved require further elucidation. In this study, we found that VAA-I alters mitochondrial transmembrane potential and increases intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Despite these observations, treatment with the mitochondrial stabilizer, bongkrekic acid, or with catalase, known to degrade H(2)O(2), fails to reverse VAA-I-induced apoptosis. Moreover, VAA-I was found to induce apoptosis in PLB-985 cells deficient in gp91(phox), indicating that the lectin acts via an ROS-independent mechanism. Pretreatment of neutrophils with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of vesicular transport, was found to reverse VAA-I-induced apoptosis. Protein expression of Mcl-1 was decreased by VAA-I. The role of caspases in the degradation of cytoskeletal proteins during both spontaneous and VAA-I-induced neutrophil apoptosis was also investigated. Paxillin and vimentin were markedly degraded by VAA-I when compared with neutrophils that undergo spontaneous apoptosis, but not vinculin or alpha- and beta-tubulin. Caspases were involved in cytoskeletal protein degradation because preincubation with the pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-V-A-D-O-methylfluoromethyl ketone was found to reverse protein cleavage. We conclude that VAA-I needs to be internalized to mediate apoptosis and that its activity is not dependent on a cell surface receptor-mediated pathway. Also, we conclude that VAA-I induces apoptosis by ROS-independent and Mcl-1-dependent mechanisms and that caspases are involved in cytoskeletal protein degradation in both spontaneous and VAA-I-induced neutrophil apoptosis.","['Lavastre, Valerie', 'Pelletier, Martin', 'Saller, Reinhard', 'Hostanska, Katarina', 'Girard, Denis']","['Lavastre V', 'Pelletier M', 'Saller R', 'Hostanska K', 'Girard D']","['Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique-Institut Armand-Frappier/Sante Humaine, Universite du Quebec, 245 boulevard Hymus, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada H9R 1G6.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PXN protein, human)', '0 (Paxillin)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (VAA-I protein, Viscum album)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (ribosome inactivating protein, Viscum)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Brefeldin A/pharmacology', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intermediate Filaments/drug effects/metabolism', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/physiology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mistletoe', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/physiology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Paxillin', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Plant Preparations', '*Plant Proteins', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 2', 'Toxins, Biological/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vimentin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Feb 1;168(3):1419-27. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.3.1419.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.168.3.1419 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lipid mediator 15-d-PGJ(2) regulates numerous processes, including adipogenesis, apoptosis, and inflammation. The 15-d-PGJ(2) has been shown to both inhibit as well as induce the production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and cyclooxygenase, mostly occurring via a nuclear receptor called peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). Data concerning the effects of 15-d-PGJ(2) on human T cells and immune regulation are sparse. IL-8, a cytokine with both chemotactic and angiogenic effects, is produced by T lymphocytes following activation. Whether 15-d-PGJ(2) can regulate the production of IL-8 in T cells in unknown. Interestingly, 15-d-PGJ(2) treatment of unstimulated T cells induces cell death. In contrast, in activated human T lymphocytes, 15-d-PGJ(2) does not kill them, but induces the synthesis of IL-8. In this study, we report that 15-d-PGJ(2) induced a significant increase in both IL-8 mRNA and protein from activated human T lymphocytes. The induction of IL-8 by 15-d-PGJ(2) did not occur through the nuclear receptor PPAR-gamma, as synthetic PPAR-gamma agonists did not mimic the IL-8-inducing effects of 15-d-PGJ(2). The mechanism of IL-8 induction was through a mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB pathway, as inhibitors of both systems abrogated IL-8 protein induction. Therefore, 15-d-PGJ(2) can act as a potent proinflammatory mediator in activated T cells by inducing the production of IL-8. These findings show the complexity with which 15-d-PGJ(2) regulates T cells by possessing both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties depending on the activation state of the cell. The implications of this research also include that caution is warranted in assigning a solely anti-inflammatory role for 15-d-PGJ(2).","['Harris, Sarah G', 'Smith, Roger S', 'Phipps, Richard P']","['Harris SG', 'Smith RS', 'Phipps RP']","['Cancer Center, University of Rochester, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['DE 11390/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 007216/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 56002/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2)', '0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Dinoprost/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*immunology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/agonists/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*enzymology/*immunology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/agonists/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/02/13 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/13 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2002 Feb 1;168(3):1372-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.168.3.1372.,,,['10.4049/jimmunol.168.3.1372 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytokinins such as kinetin, isopentenyladenine, and benzyladenine were very effective in inducing nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and morphological changes in the cells into mature granulocytes. On the other hand, cytokinin ribosides such as kinetin riboside, isopentenyladenosine, and benzylaminopurine riboside were the most potent for growth inhibition and apoptosis. Cytokinin ribosides greatly reduced the intracellular ATP content and disturbed the mitochondrial membrane potential and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, whereas cytokinins did not. When the cells were incubated with cytokinin ribosides in the presence of O(2)(-) scavenger, antioxidant or caspase inhibitor, apoptosis was significantly reduced and differentiation was greatly enhanced.

DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients with advanced hematologic malignancies were included. PBSC were collected in matched (N=16) or one-mismatch (N=8) related donors and CD34-selected. On day 60, donors donated lymphocytes that were CD8-depleted and separated into 3 aliquots containing 2 x 10(6), 1 x 10(7) and 5 x 10(7) CD3+ cells/kg (patients 1-13) or into 2 aliquots containing 1 x 10(7) and 5 x 10(7) CD3+ cells/kg (patients 14-24). The 1st aliquot was infused on day 60 and the other 1 (2) cryopreserved and infused on days 100 (and 140). RESULTS: An average of 100%, 100% and 84% of the scheduled dose could be administered in DLI 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Although the study group was at very high risk of GVHD, the actuarial incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 28% (13% for HLA-identical siblings) with only 1 patient developing grade III-IV GVHD (after DLI). The actuarial 2-year probability of extensive chronic GVHD was similarly low (13% for all patients and 0% for HLA-identical siblings). Individual cases as well as a 30% relapse rate (0% for standard-risk patients versus 55% for high-risk patients) indicated preservation of the GVL effect. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that allogeneic transplantation of CD34-selected PBSC followed by pre-emptive CD8-depleted DLI is feasible with rapid engraftment and minimizes the risk of severe GVHD. Large prospective trials are required to prove that it preserves the GVL effect fully.","['Baron, Frederic', 'Siquet, Jean', 'Schaaf-Lafontaine, Nicole', 'Baudoux, Etienne', 'Hermanne, Jean-Philippe', 'Fillet, Georges', 'Beguin, Yves']","['Baron F', 'Siquet J', 'Schaaf-Lafontaine N', 'Baudoux E', 'Hermanne JP', 'Fillet G', 'Beguin Y']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Liege, CHU Sart-Tilman, 4000 Liege, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (CD8 Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/etiology', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukapheresis', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', '*Transplantation, Homologous/statistics & numerical data', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jan;87(1):78-88.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 66 patients, undergoing PBPCT for HD, NHL, MM or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients reported in this study had to be in continuous complete remission after transplantation without receiving chemo-radiotherapy or other biological response modifiers, had to show absence of cytogenetic abnormalities and myelodysplastic features at transplantation and had to have at least 12 months of follow-up. We evaluated the bone marrow, peripheral blood, cytogenetics and clonality (HUMARA) 12 months after the transplant and thereafter every 12 months or every 6 months if lineage dysplasia, clonal or cytogenetic abnormalities were detected. RESULTS: We did not observe MDS/sAML, according to the FAB classification, in 163 assessments of 66 patients over a median follow-up of 25 months (range 12-106) after PBPCT. Twelve patients showed lineage dysplasia: six patients had dyserythropoiesis, 2 patients dysgranulopoiesis, one dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, two patients showed double lineage dysplasia (erythroid and granulocytic), and one patient showed dysgranulopoiesis at the first control acquiring dyserythropoiesis at the next follow-up. We found three cytogenetic abnormalities in the absence of concomitant dysplastic features: transient -5q, -Y, fra(10)(q25). The female patient with the cytogenetic abnormality -5q showed transient unbalanced clonality by HUMARA assay; further controls documented normalization of both clonality and cytogenetics. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of MDS/sAML depends on a variety of risk factors such as the number and type of prior courses of chemo-radiotherapy, total body irradiation in conditioning regimen, cytogenetic and morphologic alterations prior to transplant. This may account for the difference in reporting MDS/sAML after transplantation. The lack of exposure to recognized risk factors for MDS/sAML in our patients may account for the absence of this complication in this study. We consider that the use of stringent morphologic criteria, especially during the first period after PBPCT, combined with cytogenetic, clonality and FISH analyses are necessary for a correct diagnosis of MDS and to overcome the limitations of the FAB and WHO classifications in this setting.","['Laurenti, Luca', 'Chiusolo, Patrizia', 'Garzia, Maria Grazia', 'Zini, Gina', 'Sora, Federica', 'Piccirillo, Nicola', 'Piccioni, Paola', 'Zollino, Marcella', 'Leone, Giuseppe', 'Sica, Simona']","['Laurenti L', 'Chiusolo P', 'Garzia MG', 'Zini G', 'Sora F', 'Piccirillo N', 'Piccioni P', 'Zollino M', 'Leone G', 'Sica S']","['Istituto di Semeiotica Medica, Divisione di Ematologia, Policlinico A.Gemelli, largo A.

DESIGN AND METHODS: From October 1986 to February 2000, 104 consecutive patients (male: n = 63; median age: 21, range 1.3-44.2 years) with high-risk acute leukemia underwent a non-T-cell depleted graft from an HLA-identical sibling following a standard or alternative myeloablative conditioning regimen. Sixty patients were affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 44 by acute myeloid leukemia (AML); the phase at transplant was >= 2nd complete remission (CR) in 76, untreated 1st relapse with < 20% blasts in 11, refractory leukemia or overt resistant relapse in 17. Pre-transplant regimens consisting of either 12 Gy fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) or 16 mg/kg busulphan (BU) combined with cyclophosphamide (CY) were defined standard (n = 38), whereas all other myeloablative regimens (TBI plus 60 mg/kg etoposide and three-drug combinations) were considered alternative (n = 66). RESULTS: No significant differences in terms of baseline characteristics, incidence and severity of either acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were observed between the two groups, but a significantly higher proportion of patients prepared with an alternative regimen were not evaluable for chronic GVHD (36% vs 16%) (p = 0.026). Sixty-six patients died, 38 of relapse, 26 of transplant-related mortality (TRM) and 2 of other causes. Thirty-eight patients are still alive with a follow-up ranging from 0.7 to 13.8 years (median, 7.1 years); only 1 of 39 patients who relapsed after transplant is alive in CR at 5.7 years from relapse. At the median follow-up, the actuarial probabilities of overall survival, relapse and TRM for patients conditioned with standard and alternative regimens are respectively 52% vs 25% (95% CI, 36-68% vs 13-37%; p = 0.0163), 34% vs 58% (95% CI, 18-51% vs 43-73%; p = 0.0377) and 25% vs 32% (95% CI, 9-40% vs 19-44%; p = ns). After adjustment for diagnosis, age, period, leukemia phase, duration of 1st CR, GVHD prophylaxis and donor-recipient sex combination, the multivariate analysis showed that alternative regimens are associated with a significantly worse survival (hazard ratio 2.31; p = 0.0071) and relapse rate (hazard ratio 2.75; p = 0.0187). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: From this retrospective analysis we can conclude that the alternative myeloablative conditioning regimens we used did not improve the outcome of patients transplanted for high-risk acute leukemia.","['Mengarelli, Andrea', 'Iori, AnnaPaola', 'Guglielmi, Cesare', 'Romano, Atelda', 'Cerretti, Raffaella', 'Torromeo, Concetta', 'Micozzi, Alessandra', 'Fenu, Susanna', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Donato, Vittorio', 'De Felice, Lidia', 'Arcese, William']","['Mengarelli A', 'Iori A', 'Guglielmi C', 'Romano A', 'Cerretti R', 'Torromeo C', 'Micozzi A', 'Fenu S', 'Laurenti L', 'Donato V', 'De Felice L', 'Arcese W']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Premedication', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jan;87(1):52-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients with CLL and related disorders, i.e. CLL/PL and prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), without 11q- at diagnosis were sequentially ascertained at 1-2 year intervals by conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using an ATM-specific probe. RESULTS: Eight patients acquired a submicroscopic 11q deletion 13-43 months after diagnosis: the diagnosis at presentation was CLL in 3 cases, CLL/PL in 3 cases and PLL in 2 cases. A 13q14 deletion preceded the development of 11q- in four patients; additional aberrations included +12 (three cases), 17p13 deletion and 6q21 deletion (one case each). The acquisition of the 11q deletion was more frequently found in those patients presenting with CLL/PL and PLL than typical CLL (p=0.0016) and with splenomegaly (p=0.003). Follow-up data showed that karyotype evolution (p=0.009) and cytological transformation (p<0.001) were associated with the acquisition of this cytogenetic lesion. The variables predicting for a shorter survival in this series included the 11q deletion (p=0.03), along with other classical clinicobiological parameters (performance status, advanced stage, splenomegaly, elevated serum beta2 microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase levels. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: a) Submicroscopic 11q deletion involving the ATM locus may, in some instances, represent a secondary change in CLL, CLL/P and PLL, suggesting that sequential FISH analyses are necessary to detect this chromosome anomaly in some patients; b) the acquisition of 11q-/ATM deletion may play a role in determining cytological transformation and disease progression of CLL and related disorders.","['Cuneo, Antonio', 'Bigoni, Renato', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Roberti, Maria Grazia', 'Bardi, Antonella', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Milani, Raffaella', 'Minotto, Claudia', 'Tieghi, Alessia', 'Della Porta, Matteo', 'Agostini, Paola', 'Tammiso, Elisa', 'Negrini, Massimo', 'Castoldi, Gianluigi']","['Cuneo A', 'Bigoni R', 'Rigolin GM', 'Roberti MG', 'Bardi A', 'Cavazzini F', 'Milani R', 'Minotto C', 'Tieghi A', 'Della Porta M', 'Agostini P', 'Tammiso E', 'Negrini M', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, via Savonarola 9, 44100 Ferrara, Italy. sse@dns.unife.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Patient Selection', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*deficiency/genetics', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jan;87(1):44-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to investigate relationships between the efficacy of IDEC-C2B8 and expression of CD20, presence of complement, and effects of differently acting chemotherapeutic agents used in lymphoma treatment (doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, cladribine, bendamustine). DESIGN AND METHODS: DOHH-2, WSU-NHL and Raji lymphoma cell lines and ex vivo cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (n=17) and leukemic B-cell lymphomas (n=9) were studied. Additionally, the effect of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha on expression of CD20 molecules per cell was determined. RESULTS: We demonstrate that 10 mg/mL rituximab saturated 80-95% of CD20 molecules per cell in all tested lymphoma samples. Although rituximab induced only a minor increase of apoptosis, combinations of rituximab with different cytotoxic drugs significantly decreased the IC(30)- and IC(50) dosages of the chemotherapeutic agents necessary for induction of apoptosis irrespective of addition of complement, demonstrating a chemosensitizing effect of rituximab in combination with cytotoxic drugs in the neoplastic lymphocytes. This effect seemed to be independent of the percentage of saturated CD20 molecules. After addition of caspase inhibitors to the cell lines incubated with rituximab and cytotoxic agents, caspase-7 and -8 were found, by Western blotting, to be the executioner caspases, possibly explaining the rituximab-sensitized apoptosis. Preincubation of lymphoma cells with cytokines did not alter the expression of CD20; IL-2 and IL-4 even decreased the rate of apoptosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that rituximab sensitizes lymphoma cells to the effect of differently acting cytotoxic drugs used in lymphoma treatment, that this effect does not require complement, and that caspase-7 and -8 may represent the main executioner caspases in chemosensitization by rituximab.","['Chow, Kai U', 'Sommerlad, Wolf Daniel', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Schneider, Bernd', 'Seipelt, Gernot', 'Rummel, Mathias Johannes', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Mitrou, Paris S', 'Weidmann, Eckart']","['Chow KU', 'Sommerlad WD', 'Boehrer S', 'Schneider B', 'Seipelt G', 'Rummel MJ', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Weidmann E']","['University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Frankfurt/Main, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Cladribine/pharmacology', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement System Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Rituximab', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jan;87(1):33-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method is based on hybridization probe (HybProbe) chemistry applied in LightCycler equipment. The study group comprised 44 successive cases of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P-ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: The quantitative estimation of TEL-AML1 transcripts was performed in 10 P-ALL TEL-AML1-positive patients. The PCR was performed in capillary tubes in 10 microL final volumes using two sets of primers: M1, which detects the long (L-form) and short (S-form) transcripts, and M2, specific for the L-form. The fluorescently labeled HybProbes (TEL 3FL and TEL 5LC) hybridize to the TEL region. TEL-AML1 expression was normalized relative to the levels of AML1 transcripts. Standard curves were prepared using serial dilutions of plasmids with TEL-AML1 or AML1 inserts. RESULTS: The sensitivity attained allowed the detection of TEL-AML1 transcripts at a 10-4 dilution of a cDNA sample from a patient at diagnosis. The within-assay coefficient of variation (CV) for TEL-AML1 was 7.0% and the between-assay CV was 13%. Levels of TEL-AML1 transcript and the TEL-AML1/AML1 ratio decreased by more than four log units (p <0.001) during or after the course of initial treatment. Most of the patients who achieved complete remission after 5-6 months of initial treatment were TEL-AML1 negative, although some positive samples with negligible amounts of TEL-AML1 transcripts were still detected. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This method has the sensitivity and reliability required to monitor the presence of minimal residual disease, and could be a powerful tool in monitoring the efficacy of the response to chemotherapy.","['Bolufer, Pascual', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Verdeguer, Amparo', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Fernandez, Jose Maria', 'Moreno, Isabel', 'Lerma, Enrique', 'Esquembre, Carlos', 'Tasso, Maria', 'Fuster, Vicente', 'Bermudez, Mar', 'Sanz, Miguel A']","['Bolufer P', 'Barragan E', 'Verdeguer A', 'Cervera J', 'Fernandez JM', 'Moreno I', 'Lerma E', 'Esquembre C', 'Tasso M', 'Fuster V', 'Bermudez M', 'Sanz MA']","['Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, (Lab Hormonas), C Maternal Hospital Universitario La Fe, Avda Campanar 21, 46009 Valencia, Spain. bolufer_pas@gva.es']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Computer Systems', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Female', 'Fluorescein', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2002/01/22 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2002/01/22 10:00'],"['2002/01/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2002/01/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2002 Jan;87(1):23-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
