One hundred two (80%) patients belonged to high-risk group. The complete remission rate for all the patients was 91%. The event-free survival at 5 years was 32.0% +/- 23%. On multivariate analysis the event-free survival and disease-free survival was not altered by age, sex, WBC count, platelet count, LDH level, and surface phenotype. Infection due to prolonged marrow aplasia was a common complication, leading to mortality of 8 patients during induction and 33 patients during first remission. The relapse rate has been 36% (42 patients). The predominance of high-risk ALL in the Indian population underscores the need for intensive therapy. Improved supportive care during induction and remission seems essential to decrease therapy-related mortality, leading to improved survival.","['Advani, S H', 'Iyer, R S', 'Pai, S K', 'Gopal, R', 'Saikia, T K', 'Nair, C N', 'Kurkure, P A', 'Nadkarni, K S', 'Pai, V R']","['Advani SH', 'Iyer RS', 'Pai SK', 'Gopal R', 'Saikia TK', 'Nair CN', 'Kurkure PA', 'Nadkarni KS', 'Pai VR']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, Bombay, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)']",IM,['Am J Hematol. 1993 Jun;43(2):155.

The biologic and clinical implications of peripheral blood involvement.,591-8,"Monocytoid B-cell lymphoma (MBCL) is a newly recognized malignant lymphoma that shares clinical and pathologic features with other low-grade B-cell neoplasms, especially small lymphocytic lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia. However, although circulating malignant cells and bone marrow involvement are relatively common in small lymphocytic lymphoma and are characteristic features of hairy cell leukemia, MBCL in the peripheral blood and bone marrow rarely have been described. From 124 patients entered in the MBCL registry, three cases with peripheral blood involvement are described and the clinical and pathologic features in these patients are compared with those of other low-grade B-cell neoplasms. Monocytoid B-cell lymphoma was confirmed by lymph node biopsy in each case. Two patients had lymphocytosis at the time of presentation; the remaining patient presented with pancytopenia. For each patient, phenotypic studies of lymph node and peripheral blood revealed identical monoclonal surface immunoglobulin expression. The morphologic appearance of the circulating MBCL cells was different in each case, varying from a relatively homogeneous population of small lymphocytes to a heterogeneous collection of large and small lymphoid cells. The two patients with lymphocytosis also had extensive replacement of the bone marrow by MBCL; the third patient had diffuse infiltration by MBCL in a normocellular marrow. All three patients had advanced-stage (Stages III or IV) disease, and all required systemic chemotherapy for disease control. The two patients with lymphocytosis had relentless, progressive infirmity despite relatively aggressive treatment regimens. These patients ultimately died of lymphoma 13 and 18 months after initial diagnosis. The third patient is alive and well with stable disease 30 months after coming to the authors' institution. The clinical and pathologic features of the patients reported here reaffirms the placement of MBCL in the spectrum of low-grade B-cell neoplasms. However, unlike small lymphocytic lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia, MBCL only rarely undergoes leukemic conversion. Furthermore, it appears that peripheralization of MBCL occurs primarily in patients with advanced-stage disease and may be indicative of a relentless course and progressive disease despite aggressive chemotherapeutic intervention.","['Traweek, S T', 'Sheibani, K']","['Traweek ST', 'Sheibani K']","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,['Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Aug;100(2):187-8.

The efficacy and toxicity of the drug were assessed at two dose levels: 2,000 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days (14 patients) and 2,500 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days (17 patients). One patient with ALL at each dose level achieved a complete response (CR) lasting 6 months and 1 month, respectively. The patient with CML achieved a partial response lasting 4 months.

This phenomenon was found to simulate the same process as that previously shown with normal human granulocytes. Binding to both DNA and RNA of the cells was determined quantitatively by use of 14C-labeled acetaminophen congeners. Protein binding occurred to about the same extent as did RNA binding. Simultaneous labeling experiments with [ring-14C]- and [14C = O]acetaminophen further showed that the acetaminophen molecule was bound to DNA in an intact manner, while binding to RNA showed about a 50% excess binding of the acetaminophen ring relative to the carbonyl group. Experiments with certain inhibitors showed that catalase and azide ion strongly inhibited DNA binding, while superoxide dismutase had a slight stimulatory effect on binding. These results suggest a significant role for myeloperoxidase in the bioactivation process, which contrasts with the proposed bioactivation mechanism of certain arylamine compounds. A mechanism was proposed for acetaminophen binding to nucleic acids that requires the 1 e- oxidation of this substrate to its phenoxyl radical, although the production of the N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine metabolite, which has been proposed to account for the extensive protein binding known to occur for acetaminophen, might also contribute to such binding. The potential genotoxicity of acetaminophen was considered in view of what might be a unique pathway which can metabolize this chemical to a nucleic acid-binding species.","['Corbett, M D', 'Corbett, B R', 'Hannothiaux, M H', 'Quintana, S J']","['Corbett MD', 'Corbett BR', 'Hannothiaux MH', 'Quintana SJ']","['Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Acetaminophen/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Respiratory Burst']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0041-008x(92)90011-g [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1992 Mar;113(1):80-6. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(92)90011-g.,['ES 03631/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding may be explained by a stimulatory effect of GM-CSF and IL-3 on ara-C phosphorylating enzymes and a more rapid incorporation of ara-CTP into the DNA of leukemic blasts. These effects translated into a 2.2- to 229.0-fold increase in the cytotoxic activity of ara-C against clonogenic leukemic cells after GM-CSF or IL-3 pretreatment. Hence, GM-CSF and IL-3 enhance the intracellular metabolism of ara-C and its incorporation into the DNA of leukemic cells leading to a higher antileukemic activity of ara-C on clonogenic leukemic cells (CFU-L).","['Hiddemann, W', 'Kiehl, M', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Busemann, C', 'Schleyer, E', 'Wormann, B', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Kiehl M', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Busemann C', 'Schleyer E', 'Wormann B', 'Buchner T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'S Phase/drug effects', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(92)90155-T [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1992 Apr;19(2 Suppl 4):31-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important aspect of this inquiry is comparing the long-term psychosocial impact of two treatments for acute leukemia: chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. This study examines the psychosocial adjustment of 70 acute leukemia survivors who received either conventional chemotherapy alone (N = 49) or chemotherapy and an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (N = 21). At the time of assessment, patients were an average of 31 years old, had completed treatment 5 years ago and were physically healthy (mean Karnofsky score of 97). Psychometrically sound, self-report questionnaires assessed global and illness-specific psychological distress and social adjustment. Despite the additional strain and longer hospitalization associated with bone marrow transplantation, there was no difference found between BMT survivors and those treated with conventional chemotherapy alone in current psychological and social functioning. Both groups, however, had significantly greater levels of distress than that observed in normal physically healthy samples. The distress neither reached a psychiatric threshold nor significantly interfered with social adjustment. These data suggest that, irrespective of treatment, acute leukemia survivors experience overall psychological well-being and social adjustment even though they still carry a psychological burden that should be recognized in their continuing follow-up and care.","['Lesko, L M', 'Ostroff, J S', 'Mumma, G H', 'Mashberg, D E', 'Holland, J C']","['Lesko LM', 'Ostroff JS', 'Mumma GH', 'Mashberg DE', 'Holland JC']","['Psychiatry Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Psychosom Med,Psychosomatic medicine,0376505,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Patient Compliance', '*Social Adjustment', 'Survival Rate']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006842-199201000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychosom Med. 1992 Jan-Feb;54(1):30-47. doi: 10.1097/00006842-199201000-00006.,['CA-39370/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Study of 12 cases].,161-5,"BACKGROUND: The idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHS) is a rare entity of unknown etiology. Hematological and cardiac involvement is predominant. A series of 12 patients with this syndrome, initiated in 1982, is described. METHODS: Cardiological study by repeated echocardiograms and hematological study in peripheral blood and bone marrow upon initiation of the disease were performed. RESULTS: Median follow up was of 48 +/- 31 months. Males predominated (75%) with mean age being 55 +/- 15 years. The principal organs or systems involved were the heart (50%) and the nervous system (41%). Of the 6 cases with cardiac involvement only 2 had clinical manifestations. The remaining 4 patients were diagnosed from echocardiographic changes with the principal alterations observed being: atypical occupation of the ventricles, endocardial thickening and mitral and tricuspid subvalvular cumulus. Echocardiographic follow-up only showed changes in one case. Hematological involvement was characterized by moderate leukocytosis with hypereosinophilia formed by mature eosinophils, conservation of other hematopoietic series, absence of blasts in peripheral blood, finding suggestive of diseosinophilopoiesis and appearance of myelofibrosis and cytogenetic alterations. Survival at four years was 58%. CONCLUSIONS: In the series studied cardiac involvement is frequent, being principally diagnosed in a subclinical phase and with a very slow echocardiographic evolution. At a hematological level changes typical in myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloid leukemia were observed.","['San Jose, A', 'Bosch, J A', 'Candell, J', 'Pinar, J', 'Torrabadella, M', 'Vallespi, T', 'Oristrell, J', 'Vilardell, M']","['San Jose A', 'Bosch JA', 'Candell J', 'Pinar J', 'Torrabadella M', 'Vallespi T', 'Oristrell J', 'Vilardell M']","[""Servicio de Medicina Interna, Hospital General Universitario Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona.""]",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiography', 'Eosinophilia/blood/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/*physiopathology', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Syndrome']",1992/02/08 00:00,1992/02/08 00:01,['1992/02/08 00:00'],"['1992/02/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/08 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/08 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1992 Feb 8;98(5):161-5.,,Afeccion cardiaca y hematologica en el sindrome hipereosinofilico idiopatico.

The principal aim of the present study was to analyze the contribution of this new technology in the diagnosis of acute leukemia (AL) and chronic lymphoproliferative syndromes (CLS) through analysis of lymphoid clonality and genetic rearrangement proper to the lymphoid differentiation of the B and T cells. METHODS: The genetic rearrangement of the heavy chain immunoglobulins (IgH) and the beta (beta) and gamma (gamma) chains of the T receptor (TRC) in 121 patients with the following malignant hemopathies: acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 28 cases; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 27 cases; and CLS, 66 cases. The Southern method was used. RESULTS: Clonality analysis: presence of genetic rearrangement (clonality) in all the cases of lymphoblastic AL (ALL) and CLS and in 5 of 28 cases of AML (3 IgH and 2 TRC). Strain analysis: presence of absolute coincidence (exclusive rearrangement of the IgH or TRC genes in proliferations of the B or T strain, respectively) in 18 of 27 cases (67%) of ALL, in 14 of 15 cases (93%) of T-CLS and in all cases (100%) of B-CLS.

However, high Evi-1 mRNA expression has been reported in mouse myeloblastic leukemias, due to transcriptional activation by proviral integration in either the Fim-3 or Evi-1 loci.

In this paper three examples are presented of human acute myelogenous leukemias presenting common characteristics: (i) high Evi-1 mRNA expression; (ii) chromosomal abnormalities t(3;3)(q21;q26) or inv(3;3)(q21-22;q26); and (iii) high platelet counts and dystrophic megakaryocytes. Thirty-four other patients with hematological malignancies, among which 11 had chromosomal rearrangements in the 3q24-q28 region did not exhibit such abnormalities. Of the 13 permanent hemopoietic cell lines tested, Evi-1 RNA expression was found in HEL and K-562 cell lines. Weak Evi-1 expression was also seen in fibroblasts and lung cells. This expression was affected neither in skin cells from a patient with a 3q27 constitutional translocation nor in a lung epithelioma cell line containing an excess of chromosome 3 long arm. Ectopic strong expression of Evi-1 in human leukemias could define an uncommon subclass of acute myelogenous leukemias with translocations involving the 3q25-28 chromosomal domain and abnormal megakaryopoiesis.","['Fichelson, S', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Berger, R', 'Melle, J', 'Bastard, C', 'Miclea, J M', 'Gisselbrecht, S']","['Fichelson S', 'Dreyfus F', 'Berger R', 'Melle J', 'Bastard C', 'Miclea JM', 'Gisselbrecht S']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie et Oncologie des Maladies Retrovirales, INSERM U152, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Feb;6(2):93-9.,,,,"['BuChE', 'Evi-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia was induced by inoculating rats with leukemic cells. The earliest stage of leukostasis was found from day 14 onward, when leukemic cells appeared in the peripheral blood, and was characterized by accumulation of leukemic cells at the capillary level. Simultaneous with the increase of leukemic cell concentrations in the peripheral blood, accumulation in capillaries increased gradually over a period of several days. This was accompanied by increasing severity of tachypnea. Shortly before death, aggregates consisting almost solely of leukemic cells were found in medium-sized blood vessels. This stage was rapidly followed by the end-stage, characterized by complete obstruction of the lung vasculature--including the largest arteries and veins--by leukemic cell aggregates, giving rise to extensive hemorrhages and edema. The end-stage was considered to be the cause of death, which occurred 18-26 days after the inoculation. The histological and ultrastructural findings in this study suggest that besides the size and stiffness of individual leukemic cells, interactions not only between leukemic cells, but also between leukemic cells and the endothelium play a role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary leukostasis.","['van Buchem, M A', 'Hogendoorn, P C', 'Levelt, C N', 'van Hengel, P', 'Colly, L P', 'Kluin, P M', 'Willemze, R']","['van Buchem MA', 'Hogendoorn PC', 'Levelt CN', 'van Hengel P', 'Colly LP', 'Kluin PM', 'Willemze R']","['Department of Hematology, University of Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Leukocytosis/*etiology', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Pulmonary Circulation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Feb;6(2):142-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In transplanted mice, the hematocrit was elevated (90 +/- 5%) and the mice died at a mean of 71 days after transplantation. In the blood, platelet counts were usually low and nucleated blood cells slightly elevated. Spleen weight increased 5-fold and bone marrow cellularity decreased slightly. There was a 9.9-fold increase in erythroblast numbers, a 2-fold reduction of lymphocytes, and no variation of the myeloid cells when the total cellularity of bone marrow, spleen, peripheral blood, and peritoneal cells were considered. Calculation of the total numbers of progenitor cells in these organs revealed a 18-fold increase in erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E) but no significant variation of the erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), and myeloid progenitor cell numbers. A variable proportion of CFU-E, (12% or 24% in bone marrow or spleen, respectively) was able to proliferate in unstimulated cultures. Erythropoietic amplification occurred in the spleen and there was a redistribution of the BFU-E and myeloid cells from the bone marrow to the spleen.

They differ, however, in the separation of the two aryl moieties. To attempt to understand this variability we prepared a series of analogues modeled on 3 and 4 (""benzodioxole series"") and on 7 and 8 (""combretastatin series"") which differed only in the number of methylene units (ranging from none to four) separating the aryl moieties. These compounds were evaluated for their effects on tubulin polymerization, colchicine binding, and the growth of L1210 murine leukemia cells. In terms of inhibitory effects on tubulin polymerization, for the combretastatin series there was an optimal separation of the two phenyl rings by a two-carbon bridge (compound 24), with progressively decreasing inhibitory activity when the separation was by one carbon (20), three carbons (25), or four carbons (28) (the biphenyl analogue 16 was inactive). The benzodioxole series, however, did not permit us to generalize this finding, because the least active agents prepared (39 and 40) had a two-carbon bridge, while those with one- (5 and 6) and three-carbon (46 and 47) bridges were nearly equivalent in potency. Submicromolar IC50 values for inhibition of L1210 cell growth were only obtained for compounds 20 (IC50, 0.2 microM), 24 (0.07 microM), and 25 (0.4 microM). While evaluating the effects of these agents on tubulin polymerization, we noted with the combretastatin series and with several standard agents that apparent potency (in terms of IC50 values) was always lower if the reaction was performed at 30 degrees C, with 0.25 mM MgCl2, than at 37 degrees C, with 1.0 mM MgCl2. This enhancement of IC50 values in the former system as compared with the latter was particularly dramatic for the less active agents (e.g., 28) as compared with the more active (e.g. 24).","['Getahun, Z', 'Jurd, L', 'Chu, P S', 'Lin, C M', 'Hamel, E']","['Getahun Z', 'Jurd L', 'Chu PS', 'Lin CM', 'Hamel E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bibenzyls)', '0 (Bridged-Ring Compounds)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tubulin)', '7O62J06F18 (combretastatin)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Bibenzyls/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Bridged-Ring Compounds/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Colchicine/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', '*Stilbenes', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tubulin/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism']",1992/03/20 00:00,1992/03/20 00:01,['1992/03/20 00:00'],"['1992/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00084a011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1992 Mar 20;35(6):1058-67. doi: 10.1021/jm00084a011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accounting for a large proportion of the early B cell repertoire, such polyspecific autoantibodies are speculated to contribute to the homeostasis and/or competence of the primary humoral immune system. Recent studies indicate that the leukemia cells from most patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) also express such IgM autoantibodies. Similarly, the leukemia cells from many CLL patients react with murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for crossreactive idiotypes (CRIs) associated with human IgM autoantibodies. In particular, leukemic cells frequently react with G6, a mAb specific for an Ig heavy chain (H chain)-associated CRI, and/or with 17.109, a mAb that defines a kappa light chain (L chain)-associated CRI. Generated against IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) paraproteins, G6 and 17.109 each recognize a major CRI that is present in many IgM RF paraproteins. Furthermore, over 90% of the IgM paraproteins found to bear both H and L chain-associated CRIs also are found to have RF activity. Molecular characterization of these CRIs demonstrates that each is a serologic marker for expression of a highly conserved Ig V gene. As such, the frequent production of IgM polyspecific autoantibodies in CLL simply may reflect the frequent use of such highly conserved autoantibody-encoding Ig V genes with little or no somatic mutation. To test this hypothesis, we generated murine transfectomas to pair the 17.109-reactive kappa L chain of SMI, a 17.109/G6-reactive CLL population, with the Ig H chain of SMI or other G6-reactive leukemia cells or tonsillar lymphocytes. Cotransfection of vectors encoding the Ig H and L chains of SMI generated transfectomas that produce IgM kappa RF autoantibodies reactive with human IgG1 and IgG4. In contrast to G6/17.109-reactive IgM kappa RF Waldenstrom's paraproteins, the SMI IgM kappa also reacts with several other self-antigens, including myoglobin, actin, and ssDNA. However, cotransfection of the SMI L chain with a vector encoding any one of 10 different G6-reactive Ig H chains generated transfectomas that produce IgM kappa antibodies without detectable polyspecific autoantibody activity. These results indicate that polyspecific antiself-reactivity of G6/17.019-reactive Ig is dependent on the somatically generated Ig third complementarity determining region. Collectively, these studies imply that selection may be responsible for the frequent expression of polyspecific autoantibodies in CLL and early B cell ontogeny.","['Martin, T', 'Duffy, S F', 'Carson, D A', 'Kipps, T J']","['Martin T', 'Duffy SF', 'Carson DA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Institut de Chimiebiologique, Faculte de Medecine, Strasburg, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/chemistry/*genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Rheumatoid Factor/chemistry/genetics', 'Transfection']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.175.4.983 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1992 Apr 1;175(4):983-91. doi: 10.1084/jem.175.4.983.,"['AG-04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-38475/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2119194,,,,,,,,,,,

Serial measurements of serum IgG levels were made; analysis of eight samples taken at intervals after the end of the last (17th) infusion showed that the half-life of IgG in such patients was no shorter than in normal individuals. To look at the average rates of catabolism of IgG during the year serum IgG was measured at four time points (pre, post, day 7, and day 21) after the 5th, 8th, 13th, and 17th infusions; these data showed that there were no changes in catabolism. Finally, there was a significant correlation (P less than 0.005) between the pretreatment serum IgG level and the increase to the mean trough level achieved after the fifth and subsequent infusions (in each individual). These data suggest that the catabolic rate of IgG is normal in patients with low-grade B-cell tumours and that it is not altered by regular IVIg infusions once a steady state is reached. Significant correlation of the increment of serum IgG with the endogenous synthesis level supports the theory that the IgG half-life is proportional to the IgG level at any given time.","['Chapel, H M', 'Lee, M']","['Chapel HM', 'Lee M']","['Department of Immunology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,,"['Agammaglobulinemia/etiology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00918268 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1992 Jan;12(1):17-20. doi: 10.1007/BF00918268.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular properties of the transporter in an overproducing variant and evidence for down-regulation of its synthesis in maturating cells.,6628-34,"Studies are described examining further the decline in folate analogue influx mediated by the one-carbon reduced-folate transport system in HL-60 cells following induction of maturation by cytodifferentiation agents. To facilitate the investigation of the underlying basis of this phenomenon, we derived a variant (HL-60/LCV) with 4-5-fold elevated influx capacity (Vmax) for folate analogues. A commensurate increase in the putative transporter for this system was documented by affinity labeling of these cells with N-hydroxysuccinimide-[3H]aminopterin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the affinity labeled plasma membrane in HL-60/LCV cells delineated a protein peak at Mr = 75,000-80,000. This was substantially greater than the analogous transporter (Mr = 45,000-47,000) we had delineated (Yang, C.-H., Sirotnak, F.M., and Mines, L.S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9703-9709) with the same methodology in the L1210 cell plasma membrane. In addition, the rate of translocation of the Mr = 75,000-80,000 transporter in HL-60 and HL-60/LCV cells was 2-fold lower than the rate of translocation determined for the Mr = 45,000-47,000 transporter in L1210 cells. During induced maturation of HL-60/LCV cells toward the granulocyte pathway, [3H]methotrexate (MTX) influx capacity and the amount of the affinity labeled transporter decreased rapidly in a parallel fashion. The decrease in [3H]MTX influx and in affinity labeling and in the amount of the Mr = 75,000-80,000 transporter was 5-fold following exposure to 210 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 5 days during growth in culture. Moreover, during cycloheximide treatment, the decay in [3H]MTX influx at 37 degrees C and in amount of affinity labeled transporter was the same (t1/2 = 144-155 min) for both control and Me2SO-treated HL-60/LCV cells. These results, which reveal no difference in metabolic turnover for control and Me2SO-treated cells, suggest that the decline in folate analogue influx in HL-60/LCV influx cells is a very early event in the program of differentiation and probably occurs by down-regulation of synthesis of the transporter for the one-carbon reduced-folate transport system.","['Yang, C H', 'Pain, J', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Yang CH', 'Pain J', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Program in Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Affinity Labels', 'Biological Transport', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Folic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/05 00:00,1992/04/05 00:01,['1992/04/05 00:00'],"['1992/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)50473-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Apr 5;267(10):6628-34.,"['CA 08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 46673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This drug is a structural analogue of daunorubicin and has the same mechanism of action as daunorubicin and doxorubicin. Unlike the other currently available anthracyclines, idarubicin has significant oral bioavailability (average 28%), and an oral dosage form is currently under investigation. Idarubicin is at least as effective as daunorubicin for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and two studies indicate greater activity and longer survival with an idarubicin-cytarabine regimen than with a daunorubicin-cytarabine regimen. Additional data indicate activity in acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas, and breast cancer. Adverse effects are similar to those seen with other anthracyclines, although idarubicin may be associated with less cardiotoxicity than doxorubicin or daunorubicin. A maximum cumulative dose to prevent chronic cardiomyopathy has not yet been defined.

Similar results were obtained for the five human cell lines tested. The accumulation factors (intracellular vs extracellular concentrations) found for [3H]-S 12,363 (54- to 167-fold) were significantly higher than those observed for [3H]-VCR (5- to 14-fold) or [3H]-VLB (19- to 41-fold).

Two different deoxyadenosine-resistant cell lines (Y8 and ED2) had elevated steady-state levels of c-myc and fos but essentially no p53 mRNA. Hydroxyurea-resistant L1210 cells had the same levels of c-myc, fos, and p53 as the wild-type cells. There was no amplification of the gene for c-myc in the Y8 or ED2 cell lines. The half-life for c-myc mRNA was essentially the same in the wild-type and the Y8 and ED2 cells. Nuclear runoff experiments showed that the rates of transcription for c-myc in the Y8 and ED2 cells were elevated and could account for the increased steady-state levels of c-myc in these two cell lines. The transcription rate for p53 mRNA was not decreased in the Y8 and ED2 cells and therefore did not account for the loss of the steady-state levels of p53 in the cells.

Enzyme properties were as follows. Optimum pH was 6.8 in cacodylate buffer, and Km values were 2 microM for lactotriaosylceramide and 29 microM for UDP-galactose. The enzyme activity was inhibited by the addition of alpha-lactalbumin. Glucose (20 mM) inhibited the enzyme activity in the presence of alpha-lactalbumin (0.1 mg/ml) but not in its absence. These enzyme properties are similar to those of bovine milk galactosyltransferase, indicating that the enzyme in the sera might be lactose synthetase. The enzyme activities in sera from patients with cancer, patients with benign disease, or a reference sample group were assayed. The activity was below the limit of detection (5.5 pmol/25 microliters serum/2 h) in the reference sample group. Remarkable elevations of the enzyme activity were observed with high incidence in patients with cancer, especially those with blood cancer (100%). A high incidence was observed in the progressive stage, and the enzyme activity was detected at stage 1 in lung, esophagus, stomach, colorectal, and testis cancer. The enzyme activity in sera from patients with benign disease was elevated in 22% of the patients. After effective therapies, the enzyme activity decreased to below the limit of detection. Release of the galactosyltransferase into culture medium of cancer cells could be demonstrated. These observations suggest that the galactosyltransferase is released from cancer tissue into the circulation.

We now report that these agents are potent cytotoxins in vitro against a panel of highly malignant human tumor cell lines possessing primitive neural features. Proliferation and/or survival of fibroblasts, primary neuronal cultures, and several leukemia cell lines are unaffected at concentrations resulting in greater than 99% cell loss in sensitive lines. The tumorigenicity in nude mice of sensitive cell lines can also be markedly reduced by either systemic or topical administration of these agents without apparent toxicity to the whole animal.

Due to their potency, relative selectivity, and novel mechanism(s) of action, these drugs could prove clinically useful in the therapy of a number of human cancers of neural derivation.","['Whitesell, L', 'Shifrin, S D', 'Schwab, G', 'Neckers, L M']","['Whitesell L', 'Shifrin SD', 'Schwab G', 'Neckers LM']","['Tumor Cell Biology Section, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'Z3K3VJ16KU (geldanamycin)']",IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Transfection']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Apr 1;52(7):1721-8.,,,,['v-src'],,,,,,,,,,,,

After the treatment, the number of Ph+ bone marrow (BM) cells decreased gradually and the intensity of the rearranged major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR) gene became faint; however, a lymphoblastic crisis developed about 1 year later. At the time of the blast crisis, the rearranged M-BCR band was detected, indicating that the blast crisis clone was derived from CML cells. The patient was treated with a combination of vincristine, prednisolone, daunorubicin, and L-asparaginase, and a hematologic remission was obtained. During the remission status, no rearranged M-BCR fragment was detected by conventional Southern analysis. Thus, the hematologic and genetic alteration in this case appeared to be identical to Ph+ acute leukemia with M-BCR rearrangement. The current case therefore indicates that alpha-IFN can reduce the proportion of Ph+ cells, but is unable to prevent blast crisis. Furthermore, the quantitative reduction of the cell population with a Ph chromosome may have some effects in modifying the genetic manifestations and clinical features of Ph+ CML, e.g., the delay in the appearance of the blast crisis.","['Kawakubo, K', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Tauchi, T', 'Ohto, T', 'Toyama, K']","['Kawakubo K', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Tauchi T', 'Ohto T', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(92)90105-H [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(92)90105-h [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1992 Feb;58(2):165-8. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(92)90105-h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic heteromorphisms were used to determine the origin of cells present post-BMT. Differences were found between results from blood and bone marrow samples, and between karyotype and interphase Y-body studies on the same samples. Philadelphia negative (Ph-) hematopoietic chimerism was found in 6 of 7 patients, all of whom had been Ph+ before BMT. One patient also demonstrated hematopoietic chimerism with Ph+ recipient cells following clinical evidence of relapse. In two patients who had received T-cell depleted grafts, cytogenetically rearranged Ph- clones of recipient cells were prominent in PHA-stimulated blood. In one case two clones had appeared only 1 month post BMT. The appearance of these clones so soon after transplant suggests very rapid clonal expansion, or that they were already present pre-BMT but at levels too low to have been detected. In the second patient, clones were not observed until more than 12 months post-BMT, after which four were found. These collectively expanded to occupy an increasing proportion of the total cells. These two patients with clones both remain in good health 44 and 51 months post-BMT.

Leukocytes cells contain relatively high concentrations of thiamine-dependent enzymes compared with erythrocytes. Because no other cause could be found, it was postulated that consumption of thiamine by blast cells was responsible for the deficiency. After studying this patient, the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) effect was measured in five other consecutive patients with fast-growing hematologic malignant tumors. In two patients, the TPP effect was elevated slightly, but another patient had a definite thiamine deficiency with severe cardiac failure. It is suggested that the clinician be alert for this underdiagnosed potentially fatal but easily treatable deficiency in nonalcoholic patients with fast-growing hematologic cancers.","['van Zaanen, H C', 'van der Lelie, J']","['van Zaanen HC', 'van der Lelie J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thiamine Deficiency/*etiology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19920401)69:7<1710::aid-cncr2820690711>3.0.co;2-d [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Apr 1;69(7):1710-3. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920401)69:7<1710::aid-cncr2820690711>3.0.co;2-d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such domains have been characterized on the basis of: (1) fluorescence resonance energy transfer between 1,6-diphenylhexa-1,3,5-triene or 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene as energy donors, which are well known in their positioning within the membrane, and daunomycin as the energy acceptor, and (2) quenching of the fluorescence of the membrane-associated drug by the water-soluble quencher iodide. The distribution of DNM between the two plasma membrane domains is different depending on the cellular phenotype. Thus, in membranes from drug-sensitive cells, DNM is preferentially confined to 'surface' domains, while in membranes from drug-resistant cells, the drug distributes more homogeneously between 'surface' and 'deep' domains. Experiments using artificial lipid vesicles suggest that differences in the relative levels of certain lipids in the plasma membranes from drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells, namely phosphatidylserine and cholesterol, are partly responsible for the observed differences in the distribution of DNM. Since drug-membrane interactions are important in anthracycline cytotoxicity, it is possible that our observations on a different membrane distribution of daunomycin, may be related to the different sensitivity to the drug exhibited by these cells.","['Ferrer-Montiel, A V', 'Gonzalez-Ros, J M', 'Ferragut, J A']","['Ferrer-Montiel AV', 'Gonzalez-Ros JM', 'Ferragut JA']","['Department of Neurochemistry, University of Alicante, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,['ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Energy Transfer', 'Fluorescence', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/17 00:00,1992/02/17 00:01,['1992/02/17 00:00'],"['1992/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(92)90138-C [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(92)90138-c [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1992 Feb 17;1104(1):111-6. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(92)90138-c.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increase of 2-5OAS mRNA level was seen in six patients with HCL treated with dCF and in one patient treated with alpha-IFN who responded to therapy. A patient with a variant form of HCL treated with dCF and the second patient treated with alpha-IFN did not show an increase of 2-5OAS mRNA and neither responded to therapy.

By analogy, we suggest that one mechanism of action of dCF in hairy cell leukaemia may be to break down an autocrine growth loop for TNF or other cytokines. An alternative explanation for these observations is that cytokines released from hairy cells in the bone marrow killed by dCF induce a rise in 2-5OAS in circulating leucocytes.","['Ganeshaguru, K', 'de Mel, W C', 'Sissolak, G', 'Catovsky, D', 'Dearden, C E', 'Mehta, A B', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Ganeshaguru K', 'de Mel WC', 'Sissolak G', 'Catovsky D', 'Dearden CE', 'Mehta AB', 'Hoffbrand AV']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*drug effects"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08900.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Feb;80(2):194-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08900.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean cell cycle time (tg) was similar in lymphoid malignancies of precursor B cell and T cell origin (115 h and 102 h, respectively), while B cell neoplasias had a mean tg of only 25 h. A positive correlation between the LI and the GF (r = 0.892) and a negative correlation between the LI and tg (r = -0.908) could be detected in childhood lymphoid malignancies. The proliferation of neoplastic precursor B cells was compared with the proliferation of presumably normal terminal transferase (TdT) positive bone marrow cells that, according to the immunophenotype, correspond mainly to normal precursor B cells. Although mean ts was identical in both cell populations (18-19 h), the neoplastic cell population showed a significantly longer mean tg than the normal counterpart (115 h and 65 h, respectively). However, if malignant and normal precursor B cell populations with a similar LI were compared, the difference in tg disappeared. Therefore, a down-regulation of leukaemic cell proliferation by an increasing cell mass is postulated for most cases of untreated precursor B cell ALL.","['Hirt, A', 'Werren, E M', 'Luethy, A R', 'Gerdes, J', 'Wagner, H P']","['Hirt A', 'Werren EM', 'Luethy AR', 'Gerdes J', 'Wagner HP']","['Department of Pediatrics (Inselspital), University of Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Cell Cycle/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08899.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Feb;80(2):189-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08899.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we extended our findings studying such mutations in 66 unselected additional cases of AML, using polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis and nucleotide sequencing. Three of the 66 new cases had a point mutation, leading to a change in one encoded amino acid. Thus, eight of the 112 AML studied had P53 mutations in exons 5-8, suggesting that the incidence of P53 mutation is relatively low in AML. A predominance of mutations in exon 8 (5/8) was found. Six of the eight patients with mutations were older than 60 years of age, and all eight cases had a short survival. All seven mutated cases karyotyped showed complex cytogenetic findings, especially monosomy 5 and/or 7, thus questioning the pathogenic importance of P53 mutations in a context of multiple genetic abnormalities. However, five of them also had 17p monosomy, and in the remaining two cases SSCP and sequence analysis also suggested loss of the normal P53 allele. This supported a role for the P53 gene mutations in leukaemogenesis in the relatively small number of AML patients in whom they were found, through loss of tumour suppressive activity of both normal P53 alleles, as reported in solid tumours.","['Fenaux, P', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Quiquandon, I', 'Jonveaux, P', 'Lai, J L', 'Vanrumbeke, M', 'Loucheux-Lefebvre, M H', 'Bauters, F', 'Berger, R', 'Kerckaert, J P']","['Fenaux P', 'Preudhomme C', 'Quiquandon I', 'Jonveaux P', 'Lai JL', 'Vanrumbeke M', 'Loucheux-Lefebvre MH', 'Bauters F', 'Berger R', 'Kerckaert JP']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Female', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08897.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Feb;80(2):178-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08897.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither T-cell receptor beta (TCRB), T-cell receptor gamma (TCRG) nor Ig heavy chain (IGH) genes were clonally rearranged. Furthermore, there was neither rearrangement nor expression of ABL, which is located at 9q34, indicating that the deletion involved bands centrometric to 9q34 did not induce the activation of ABL. DNA synthesis of the blasts was stimulated (stimulation index greater than 2.0) in the presence of interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or erythropoietin (Epo). IL-3 and IL-4 could also support the in vitro growth of leukaemic blast colonies, and the IL-3- or IL-4-dependent blast colony growth was synergistically enhanced by the addition of IL-6 or Epo.

This study is a retrospective review of all adult patients with acute leukemia treated at our institutions from 1978-1989. Those with both leukemia and thyroid disease were evaluated and are presented. Twenty-seven of eight hundred seventy patients with acute leukemia had evidence of thyroid disease. This is a 3-fold increase in overall incidence. Twenty-one patients had acute myeloid leukemia, five had acute lymphoid leukemia, and one had accelerated chronic myeloid leukemia. Thyroid disease entities included toxic multinodular goiter (four patients), idiopathic hypothyroidism (eight patients), Graves' disease (eight patients), and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (seven patients). Whereas the association may have had a negative effect on elderly patients, those with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's disease appeared to have an improved outcome of the leukemia. There is an increased association of autoimmune thyroid disease and acute leukemia. Since thyroid hormones are important regulators of hematopoiesis and utilize receptors similar to those of differentiating factors such as retinoids, the association may be important for further study of mechanisms of growth regulations in leukemia.","['Moskowitz, C', 'Dutcher, J P', 'Wiernik, P H']","['Moskowitz C', 'Dutcher JP', 'Wiernik PH']","['Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Goiter, Nodular/complications', 'Graves Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Hypothyroidism/complications/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thyroid Diseases/*complications', 'Thyroiditis, Autoimmune/complications']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830390206 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1992 Feb;39(2):102-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830390206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 5 patients had no major coexisting disease and 4 of those 5 achieved a remission marrow. The study illustrates and underscores the following problems of remission induction in the elderly: (a) increased susceptibility to the stress of the induction period, with 6 patients (24%) dying before treatment day sixteen; (b) disease resistance to antileukemic therapy with persistent ANLL in 6 patients (24%), despite two induction courses; and (c) hematopoietic stem cell sensitivity in the elderly with marrow regeneration failure documented in 2 patients (8%) following induction.

Imaging results showed sequential increases in fat fractions among responding patients (n = 9), consistent with biopsy-confirmed clinical remission. In the two patients who later relapsed, sharp decreases in fat fractions were noted. In the two patients who failed to regenerate normal marrow, unchanging, low fat fractions were seen.

We have investigated the mechanisms of T-cell activation by HTLV-I in freshly isolated blood T cells and in naturally infected T-cell clones obtained by direct single-cell cloning from patients with HAM/TSP. Both CD4+ and CD8+ HTLV-I-infected T-cell clones showed the unusual ability to proliferate in the absence of exogenous interleukin 2 (IL-2). Nevertheless, HTLV-I-infected clones were not transformed, as they required periodic restimulation with phytohemagglutinin and feeder cells for long-term growth. Irradiated or fixed HTLV-I-infected clones were found to induce the proliferation of blood T cells when cocultured, which we refer to as THTLV-1-T cell activation. This THTLV-1-T cell-mediated activation was blocked by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD2/lymphocyte function-associated molecule 3 (LFA-3), LFA-1/intercellular cell-adhesion molecule (ICAM), and the IL-2 receptor but not by mAbs against class I or class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, HTLV-I gp46, or a high-titer HAM/TSP serum. Spontaneous proliferation of blood T cells from HAM/TSP patients could also be inhibited by mAbs to CD2/LFA-3, LFA-1/ICAM and to the IL-2 receptor (CD25). These results show at the clonal level that HTLV-I infection induces T-cell activation and that such activated T cells can in turn stimulate noninfected T cells by cognate THTLV-1-T cell interactions involving the CD2 pathway.","['Wucherpfennig, K W', 'Hollsberg, P', 'Richardson, J H', 'Benjamin, D', 'Hafler, D A']","['Wucherpfennig KW', 'Hollsberg P', 'Richardson JH', 'Benjamin D', 'Hafler DA']","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Clone Cells', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genome, Viral', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.6.2110 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 15;89(6):2110-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.6.2110.,,,,,PMC48606,,,,,,,,,,,

The cDNAs are inserted between the human beta-globin promoter and the second intron of the human beta-globin gene, and this expression cassette is then placed downstream of the LCR and transfected into MEL cells. The cDNAs are expressed at levels similar to those of the murine beta-globin in the induced MEL cells. Heterologous genomic sequences can also be expressed at similar levels when linked to to the LCR and beta-globin promoter. In addition we demonstrate that, after induction of differentiation, MEL cells are capable of secreting heterologous proteins over a prolonged time period, making this system suitable for use in continuous production systems such as hollow fibre bioreactors. The utility of the LCR/MEL cell system is demonstrated by the expression of growth hormone at high levels (greater than 100 mg/l) 7 days after induction. Since the expression levels seen do not depend upon gene amplification and are independent of the integration position of the expression cassette, it is possible to obtain clones with stable high-level expression within 3-4 weeks after transfection.","['Needham, M', 'Gooding, C', 'Hudson, K', 'Antoniou, M', 'Grosveld, F', 'Hollis, M']","['Needham M', 'Gooding C', 'Hudson K', 'Antoniou M', 'Grosveld F', 'Hollis M']","['ICI Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology Department, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cloning, Molecular/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Growth Hormone/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/11 00:00,1992/03/11 00:01,['1992/03/11 00:00'],"['1992/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/20.5.997 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1992 Mar 11;20(5):997-1003. doi: 10.1093/nar/20.5.997.,,,,,PMC312082,,,,,,,,,,,

Both smg p21A mRNA and smg p21B mRNA were detected in CMK, a human megakaryocytic leukemia cell line, and their levels were markedly elevated by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which caused the differentiation of this cell line into more mature megakaryocytes. The smg p21 protein molecules also increased during the TPA-induced differentiation of CMK cells. The mRNA level of glycoprotein IIb (GPIIb), a typical marker of the megakaryocytes, was increased by this treatment, but the time course of the increase in the smg p21 mRNA levels as more rapid than that of the increase in the GPIIb mRNA level. Ha-ras p21 mRNA was undetectable, but both Ki- and N-ras p21 mRNAs were detected in CMK cells and their levels were also increased during TPA-induced differentiation of CMK cells, although to a lesser extent than those of smg p21 mRNAs. Protein kinase C inhibitors inhibited the basal and TPA-induced smg p21A mRNA level, but cyclic AMP-elevating prostaglandin E1 or Ca(2+)-mobilizing ionomycin did not inhibit them. Cycloheximide enhanced the basal and TPA-induced smg p21A mRNA levels. Actinomycin D blocked the TPA-induced smg p21A mRNA levels, but showed no detectable effect on the elevated smg p21A mRNA level which was induced by pretreatment with TPA. A dramatic increase in the smg p21 mRNA levels was also observed in other leukemia cell lines during TPA-induced differentiation. These results suggest that TPA stimulated expression of the smg p21A gene, presumably through the action of protein kinase C at the transcriptional level rather than at the post-transcriptional level, in hematopoietic leukemia cells.","['Adachi, M', 'Ryo, R', 'Yoshida, A', 'Sugano, W', 'Yasunaga, M', 'Saigo, K', 'Yamaguchi, N', 'Sato, T', 'Sano, K', 'Kaibuchi, K']","['Adachi M', 'Ryo R', 'Yoshida A', 'Sugano W', 'Yasunaga M', 'Saigo K', 'Yamaguchi N', 'Sato T', 'Sano K', 'Kaibuchi K', 'et al.']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rap GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Alprostadil/metabolism', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'rap GTP-Binding Proteins']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1992 Feb;7(2):323-9.,,,,"['Ha-ras', 'Ki-ras', 'N-ras', 'smg']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The hst-2 cDNA was cloned from the NIH3T3 transformant. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA indicates that the hst-2 gene encodes a 198 amino acid transforming protein containing a signal peptide with the characteristics of a heparin-binding growth factor.

One patient was studied at time of diagnosis of MDS and again after progression to AML. At the preleukemic stage of disease, an N-ras mutation was identified; however, after development of AML this mutation was not present in the leukemic clone.

To test this hypothesis, we introduced point mutations that disrupt myristoylation into two activated Abl proteins, v-Abl and a deletion mutant of c-Abl (delta XB), and examined their ability to transform an interleukin-3-dependent lymphoblastoid cell line, Ba/F3. Neither of the nonmyristoylated Abl proteins transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, but like P210bcr/abl, both were capable of transforming the Ba/F3 cells to factor independence and tumorigenicity. Nonmyristoylated Abl variants did not associate with the plasma membrane in the transformed Ba/F3 cells.

Previously, it was found that breakpoints on chromosome 9 are clustered in one of the introns of a large gene named Cain (can). cDNA probes derived from the 3' part of can detect an aberrant, leukemia-specific 5.5-kb transcript in bone marrow cells from t(6;9) AML patients. cDNA cloning of this mRNA revealed that it is a fusion of sequences encoded on chromosome 6 and 3' can. A novel gene on chromosome 6 which was named dek was isolated. In dek the t(6;9) breakpoints also occur in one intron. As a result the dek-can fusion gene, present in t(6;9) AML, encodes an invariable dek-can transcript. Sequence analysis of the dek-can cDNA showed that dek and can are merged without disruption of the original open reading frames and therefore the fusion mRNA encodes a chimeric DEK-CAN protein of 165 kDa. The predicted DEK and CAN proteins have molecular masses of 43 and 220 kDa, respectively.

B1 is a murine homolog of the human SINE Alu; these elements are composed of 5' G + C-rich regions juxtaposed to A-rich tracts and are flanked by direct repeats. Internal promoters direct RNA polymerase III to transcribe B1 and Alu elements and proceed into the 3' flanking DNA until it reaches a (dT)4 termination signal. The resulting transcripts contain 3'-terminal oligo(U) tracts which can presumably base pair with the A-rich tract to form self-primed templates for reverse transcriptase and retrotransposition. Nuclear extracts from mouse tissue culture cells contain an RNA processing activity that removes the A-rich and 3'-terminal regions from purified B1 RNAs (R. Maraia, Nucleic Acids Res. 19:5695-5702, 1991). In this study, we examined transcription and RNA processing in these nuclear extracts. In contrast to results with use of purified RNA, nascent transcripts synthesized in nuclear extract by RNA polymerase III are not processed, suggesting that the transposition-intermediate-like RNA is shielded from processing by a protein(s). Alteration of an AATTTT TAA termination signal to a GCTTTTGC signal activated processing by greater than 100-fold in coupled transcription/processing reactions. A similar difference was found when expression was compared in frog oocytes. No difference in processing was found if the transcripts were made by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the nuclear extract, indicating that the different processing effects of the two terminators were dependent on synthesis by polymerase III. The modulation of processing of B1-Alu transcripts and the potential for retrotransposition of B1 and Alu DNA sequences are discussed.","['Maraia, R J', 'Chang, D Y', 'Wolffe, A P', 'Vorce, R L', 'Hsu, K']","['Maraia RJ', 'Chang DY', 'Wolffe AP', 'Vorce RL', 'Hsu K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (RNA Precursors)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (RNA Polymerase III)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell-Free System/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'RNA Polymerase III/*genetics', 'RNA Precursors/*metabolism', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.4.1500-1506.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Apr;12(4):1500-6. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.4.1500-1506.1992.,,,,,PMC369591,,,,,,,,,,,

In both cell lines aerobic glycolysis accounts for virtually all glucose consumption. The use of D-[13C2]glucose provided a simple method to measure the glucose flux through the pentose phosphate pathway as 9% (CEM-C1) and 11% (CEM-C7) of glucose channeled into glycolysis. The dexamethasone-sensitive CEM-C7 cells consume glucose at a rate about 50% higher than the dexamethasone-resistant CEM-C1 cells.

The overall median duration of survival is more than 5 years, and the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia adversely affects prognosis. B-CLL is readily diagnosed because of the characteristic and specific phenotypic expressions of the neoplastic cells. Clinical staging continues to be the best prognostic indicator in B-CLL. In addition, cytogenetic status, pattern of leukemic infiltration in the bone marrow, and lymphocyte doubling time are now considered to have additional prognostic value.

Although leukemic cells generally have immunophenotypes comparable to their normal counterparts, it is possible to use immunological marker analysis for the detection of MRD based on the assumption that the presence of positive cells outside their normal breeding sites and 'homing areas' is indicative of malignancy. This approach can be used for the detection of MRD in blood and bone marrow of patients with a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) positive T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and patients with a TdT+ acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with a TdT+ leukemia. In other types of acute leukemias, immunological marker analysis generally does not allow detection of low frequencies of malignant cells, but in a part of them the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique may be valuable. The PCR technique allows the amplification of tumor-specific DNA sequences or mRNA sequences (after reverse transcription into cDNA), if the flanking sequences are well-defined. This PCR-mediated amplification can detect specific sequences which are derived from only a few malignant cells between many normal cells. Well-defined chromosome translocations have been used as tumor-specific markers, such as t(9;22). An advantage of using specific chromosome aberrations as tumor-specific markers is their stability during the disease course. However, only 10-15% of ALL and 25-30% of AML have a specific chromosome translocation and in a large part of them the precise breakpoints are not (yet) known. Recent studies indicate that it is possible to detect MRD in acute leukemias by use of PCR-mediated amplification of the junctional regions of rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TcR) genes, using variable (V) and joining (J) gene-specific oligonucleotides as primers. Major pitfalls of this application are the occurrence of multiple rearrangements at diagnosis (oligoclonality) and changes in rearrangement patterns at relapse (clonal evolution), which will lead to false negative results of this MRD-PCR technique. In conclusion, the technique of choice for the detection of MRD is dependent on the immunophenotype of the leukemia, the presence of a well-defined chromosome translocation and the presence of a rearranged Ig and/or TcR gene as well as the chance of immunophenotypic shifts and changes in Ig and TcR gene rearrangement patterns.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['van Dongen, J J', 'Breit, T M', 'Adriaansen, H J', 'Beishuizen, A', 'Hooijkaas, H']","['van Dongen JJ', 'Breit TM', 'Adriaansen HJ', 'Beishuizen A', 'Hooijkaas H']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital, Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992;6 Suppl 1:47-59.,,,,"['IGH', 'TCR']",,96,,,,,,,,,,

We have purified the IN protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) after production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found it to have many of the properties described for retroviral IN proteins. The protein performs both 3' processing and strand transfer reactions by using HIV-1 or HIV-2 attachment (att) site oligonucleotides. A highly conserved CA dinucleotide adjacent to the 3' processing site of HIV-1 is important for both the 3' processing and strand transfer reactions; however, it is not sufficient for full IN activity, since alteration of nucleotide sequences internal to the HIV-1 U5 CA also impairs IN function, and Moloney murine leukemia virus att site oligonucleotides are poor substrates for HIV-1 IN. When HIV-1 att sequences are positioned internally in an LTR-LTR circle junction substrate, HIV-1 IN fails to cleave the substrate preferentially at positions coinciding with correct 3' processing, implying a requirement for positioning att sites near DNA ends. The 2 bp normally located beyond the 3' CA in linear DNA are not essential for in vitro integration, since mutant oligonucleotides with single-stranded 3' or 5' extensions or with no residues beyond the CA dinucleotide are efficiently used. Selection of target sites is nonrandom when att site oligonucleotides are joined to each other in vitro. We modified an in vitro assay to distinguish oligonucleotides serving as the substrate for 3' processing and as the target for strand transfer. The modified assay demonstrates that nonrandom usage of target sites is dependent on the target oligonucleotide sequence and independent of the oligonucleotide used as the substrate for 3' processing.","['Leavitt, A D', 'Rose, R B', 'Varmus, H E']","['Leavitt AD', 'Rose RB', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'DNA, Fungal/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/enzymology/*genetics', 'Integrases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/*genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.4.2359-2368.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Apr;66(4):2359-68. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.4.2359-2368.1992.,,,,,PMC289031,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper describes the identification and development of novel 6,7-imidazotetrahydroquinoline TS inhibitors by iterative ligand design, synthesis, and crystallographic analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes. Beginning with a high-resolution crystal structure of E. coli TS (TS, EC 2.1.1.45), an imidazotetrahydroquinoline inhibitor was designed de novo to occupy the folate binding pocket. Structural modifications of the initial compound 1h (Ki approximately 5 microM human/E. coli TS) were then made on the basis of feedback from additional cocrystal structures and activity data. An amino group in the 2-position of the imidazole was found to increase the potency of the series by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Other substitutions on the imidazole ring (1-CH3, 2-CH3, 2-NHCH3, 2-SCH3) generally led to weaker inhibition. Additional improvements in activity were obtained by modification of the substituents on the tetrahydroquinoline nitrogen, bringing the Ki of three of the compounds below 15 nM against the human TS enzyme. The compounds were tested for cytotoxicity and were shown to inhibit the growth of three tumor cell lines in vitro.","['Reich, S H', 'Fuhry, M A', 'Nguyen, D', 'Pino, M J', 'Welsh, K M', 'Webber, S', 'Janson, C A', 'Jordan, S R', 'Matthews, D A', 'Smith, W W']","['Reich SH', 'Fuhry MA', 'Nguyen D', 'Pino MJ', 'Welsh KM', 'Webber S', 'Janson CA', 'Jordan SR', 'Matthews DA', 'Smith WW', 'et al.']","['Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, California 92121.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Quinolines)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Crystallization', '*Drug Design', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Quinolines/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/06 00:00,1992/03/06 00:01,['1992/03/06 00:00'],"['1992/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00083a007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1992 Mar 6;35(5):847-58. doi: 10.1021/jm00083a007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, adult patients with poor-risk LBL are candidates for alternative intensive consolidation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine adult patients with poor-risk LBL in first remission after treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP; six patients) or ALL-like regimens (three patients), were treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) followed by nonpurged autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). RESULTS: Two of nine patients relapsed at 4 and 8 months, respectively, after BMT, and one patient died of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) 7 months after ABMT without recurrence of his lymphoma. Six patients are in unmaintained first remission with a follow-up of 12 to 113 months (median, 53 months) after transplantation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with CML in chronic phase were treated with recombinant human IFN alfa-2b for 7 to 39 months. RESULTS: In eight patients IFN alfa-2b treatment failed due to lack of hematologic response. A complete or partial hematologic remission was achieved in the remaining six patients, of whom two patients experienced a complete cytogenetic response. Retrospective analysis of serum samples obtained from all patients before the onset of IFN alfa-2b administration revealed that levels (mean +/- SEM) of circulating TNF were higher (P less than .001) in the group of patients who did not respond to IFN alfa-2b treatment (157 +/- 15 U/mL) than in the responders (10.3 +/- 4 U/mL) or healthy control subjects (9.1 +/- 3 U/mL). However, there was no correlation between TNF serum levels and other patient characteristics at study enrollment including age, sex, duration of disease, performance status, splenomegaly, WBC count, platelet count, hemoglobin value, prior therapy, and prognostic category. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that circulating levels of TNF are increased in a subset of patients with chronic-phase CML and that this elevation is associated with poor response to IFN alfa-2b therapy.","['Herrmann, F', 'Helfrich, S G', 'Lindemann, A', 'Schleiermacher, E', 'Huber, C', 'Mertelsmann, R']","['Herrmann F', 'Helfrich SG', 'Lindemann A', 'Schleiermacher E', 'Huber C', 'Mertelsmann R']","['Department of Internal Medicine 1, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*analysis']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.4.631 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Apr;10(4):631-4. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.4.631.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcome and toxicity observed in 80 patients with isolated testicular leukemia treated on POG 8304 are presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The following are common features of POG 8304: (1) remission reinduction therapy with vincristine, prednisone, and doxorubicin; (2) bilateral testicular irradiation (2,600 cGy) during reinduction therapy; (3) CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal hydrocortisone, methotrexate (MTX), and cytarabine (Ara-C); and (4) continuation therapy (for 80 weeks) with alternating 6-week cycles of oral mercaptopurine (6-MP)/MTX and intravenous vincristine and cyclophosphamide. Treatment differences consisted of pulses (administered every 7 weeks) of either prednisone and doxorubicin (arm 1) or VM-26 and Ara-C (arm 2) during continuation therapy and a 4-week late intensification phase with either vincristine, prednisone, and doxorubicin (arm 1) or VM-26 and Ara-C (arm 2). RESULTS: Fifty-five boys with ALL had isolated microscopic testicular leukemia detected by an elective biopsy at completion of initial treatment, and 25 had a late (greater than or equal to 6 months off-therapy) isolated overt testicular relapse. All patients with overt testicular leukemia attained a second clinical remission, and no patient with microscopic testicular leukemia progressed during reinduction. Of 42 patients on arm 1, 11 have relapsed compared with 18 of 38 patients on arm 2 (log-rank analysis, P = .22), indicating no significant difference between an anthracycline and an epipodophyllotoxin-Ara-C combination in the treatment of testicular leukemia. The overall 4-year event-free survival (EFS) among boys with occult testicular relapse was 53% +/- 8%. Age greater than 10 years at initial diagnosis, a WBC count greater than 50,000/microL at diagnosis, and black race were associated with a worse outcome. The 4-year EFS for boys with a late overt testicular relapse was 84% +/- 10%, and these patients fared significantly better than patients with occult disease (P = .007). CONCLUSION: The treatment approach reported here can secure a prolonged second remission in many patients with occult or late overt testicular leukemia.","['Wofford, M M', 'Smith, S D', 'Shuster, J J', 'Johnson, W', 'Buchanan, G R', 'Wharam, M D', 'Ritchey, A K', 'Rosen, D', 'Haggard, M E', 'Golembe, B L']","['Wofford MM', 'Smith SD', 'Shuster JJ', 'Johnson W', 'Buchanan GR', 'Wharam MD', 'Ritchey AK', 'Rosen D', 'Haggard ME', 'Golembe BL', 'et al.']","['Bowman-Gray School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.4.624 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Apr;10(4):624-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.4.624.,"['CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Age, leukocyte count, sex, immunophenotype (expression of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin [Ig] and of surface antigens CD10 and CD34), and DNA index (ratio of the flow cytometry-determined DNA content of leukemia cells to that of normal diploid cells) were the variables used in the evaluation of four antimetabolite-based chemotherapy regimens in 1,535 children with the newly diagnosed B-progenitor cell ALL between February 1986 and May 1990. RESULTS: There were three subgroups at widely different risks of treatment failure. A DNA index greater than 1.16 was the most prognostic feature. The final prognostic subgrouping was as follows: (1) DNA index greater than 1.16; (2) DNA index less than or equal to 1.16, age less than 11.0 years, and leukocyte count less than 50 x 10(9)/L; and (3) DNA index less than or equal to 1.16, (age greater than 11.0 years, and/or leukocyte count greater than 50 x 10(9)/L). These groups made up 20%, 53%, and 27% of the patients and had 4-year EFS rates (SE) of 90.1% (6.3%), 80.5% (5.1%), and 50.4% (7.6%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the DNA index, leukocyte count, and age--data that are relatively inexpensive and simple to obtain--may be sufficient to stratify patients with B-progenitor cell ALL for risk-directed therapy. Patients at an extremely low risk of failing therapy (approximately 20% of cases in this study) can thus be identified and spared the toxic short-term and late effects of more intensive therapies that may be needed for children with less favorable clinical and biologic features.","['Trueworthy, R', 'Shuster, J', 'Look, T', 'Crist, W', 'Borowitz, M', 'Carroll, A', 'Frankel, L', 'Harris, M', 'Wagner, H', 'Haggard, M']","['Trueworthy R', 'Shuster J', 'Look T', 'Crist W', 'Borowitz M', 'Carroll A', 'Frankel L', 'Harris M', 'Wagner H', 'Haggard M', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Kansas, Kansas City.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', '*Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.4.606 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Apr;10(4):606-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.4.606.,"['CA-28841/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group.,549-57,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the contribution of semustine (MeCCNU) to adjuvant benefit, previously untreated patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum who had undergone curative resection were randomized to treatment with combination radiation therapy and fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by either 12 months of 5-FU and MeCCNU or 6 months of escalating 5-FU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 1981 and November 1985, 210 patients were randomized by Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) investigators. Subsequent to randomization, 11 (5%) patients (six treated with 5-FU and MeCCNU; five with escalating 5-FU) were found to be ineligible and are excluded from survival analyses. RESULTS: About half the patients on each of the two treatment arms experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity, and there was one treatment-related death on each arm. No episodes of leukemia have been reported. Median follow-up time for surviving patients is 5.8 years, and 3-year follow-up is available for all but five surviving patients. Recurrent disease has been reported in 54% (51 of 95) of 5-FU- and MeCCNU-treated patients compared with 43% (45 of 104) of escalating 5-FU-treated patients. Probability of 3-year disease-free survival for the two treatment cohorts is 54% and 68%, respectively. Ninety-one deaths have occurred: 46% (44 of 95) of 5-FU- and MeCCNU-treated patients and 45% (47 of 104) of escalating 5-FU-treated patients.

This study was initiated to determine if AF64A can damage DNA and prematurely terminate RNA transcription in vitro, and to produce cytotoxic and DNA damaging effects in cells exposed to the drug in vivo. The ability of AF64A to produce N-7 guanine alkylations in DNA in vitro was assessed using a modified Maxam and Gilbert DNA sequencing technique, and the ability of AF64A to terminate RNA transcription was assessed by an in vitro RNA transcription system. AF64A was capable of producing extensive dose-dependent N-7 guanine alkylations in DNA fragments exposed to AF64A in vitro, although no sequence specificity of AF64A attack could be discerned. Furthermore, AF64A was able to produce RNA transcription-terminating lesions in vitro, also in a dose-dependent fashion. Transcription of AF64A-damaged DNA resulted in RNA molecules terminated not at every alkylated guanine, but at various discrete sites along the DNA template. AF64A was also found to be cytotoxic in a dose-dependent manner in cultured mouse leukemia L1210 cells. The induced cytotoxicity was accompanied by DNA lesions which were detected as DNA single strand breaks using the DNA alkaline elution technique. The results of these experiments support the hypothesis that AF64A may alter the structure and function of cellular DNA and may help explain the observed long-term cholinergic deficits.","['Futscher, B W', 'Pieper, R O', 'Barnes, D M', 'Hanin, I', 'Erickson, L C']","['Futscher BW', 'Pieper RO', 'Barnes DM', 'Hanin I', 'Erickson LC']","['Department of Medicine, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, Illinois 60153.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Aziridines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'A668M9E227 (ethylcholine aziridinium)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Aziridines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Choline/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'DNA/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1471-4159.1992.tb11371.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurochem. 1992 Apr;58(4):1504-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.1992.tb11371.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal diploid cells, unreplicated DNA segments give singlet hybridization signals while replicated loci are characterized by doublets. The distribution of these two patterns in unsynchronized cell populations can be used to determine the S phase replication time of any DNA sequence. The validity of this approach was established by analyzing genes whose replication profiles in expressing and non-expressing cells had been determined previously by conventional methods. Using this technique it has been possible to map the replication timing topography of the DNA within and flanking the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene locus on chromosome 7. The gene itself is located within a defined time zone which is approximately 500 kb in length and is under developmental control. It is early replicating in cells which express CF but late replicating in other cell types. These time zones probably represent basic units of chromosome structure.","['Selig, S', 'Okumura, K', 'Ward, D C', 'Cedar, H']","['Selig S', 'Okumura K', 'Ward DC', 'Cedar H']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry, Hebrew University, Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,,"['Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cystic Fibrosis/genetics', 'DNA Probes', '*DNA Replication', 'Fluorescence', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Mar;11(3):1217-25.,"['GM-40015/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HG-00246/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['CF'],PMC556564,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluorescent non-vital DNA dyes, particularly propidium iodide (PI), have been used routinely in flow cytometry for discrimination of dead cells from viable cells on the basis of fluorescence. We describe here the use of an alternative DNA dye, 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD), which can replace PI for the exclusion of nonviable cells. As an example, we present in this paper the utilization of 7-AAD on various leukemic cell lines for dead cell exclusion whenever the viable cell population could not be discriminated reliably from nonviable cells on the light scatter histogram; 7-AAD is suitable for dead cell discrimination in lengthy experiments because it is efficiently excluded by intact cells and has a high DNA binding constant. In addition, the dye is valuable in combination with phycoerythrin (PE)-fluorescence dual-color flow cytometry on a single argon laser instrument, since its emission in the far red can easily be separated from the emission of PE; 7-AAD was used on fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC) and PE surface-labeled human thymocytes for characterization of the dying subpopulation of cells which is undergoing programmed cell death. In this heterogeneous cell preparation, the spectral properties of the dye permitted the classification of viable and nonviable cell subpopulations by multiparameter analysis.","['Schmid, I', 'Krall, W J', 'Uittenbogaart, C H', 'Braun, J', 'Giorgi, J V']","['Schmid I', 'Krall WJ', 'Uittenbogaart CH', 'Braun J', 'Giorgi JV']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '7240-37-1 (7-aminoactinomycin D)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,,"['Cell Death', 'DNA/analysis', 'Dactinomycin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Preleukemia/pathology', 'Propidium', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*cytology', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/pathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990130216 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1992;13(2):204-8. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990130216.,"['CA-16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that antigen-stimulated Ca2+ influx and secretion are impaired and ionomycin-induced responses are strongly inhibited following the removal of HCO3- from the medium. These results raised the possibility that HCO3(-)-dependent pH regulation mechanisms play a role in the cascade of events leading to mast cell activation. To test this hypothesis, intracellular pH (pHi) was measured by ratio imaging microscopy in individual RBL-2H3 cells labeled with 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). In unstimulated cells, it was found that basal pHi in the presence of HCO3- is 7.26, significantly greater than pHi in its absence, 7.09 (P less than 10(-6]. These results, as well as evidence that pHi increases rapidly when HCO3- is added to cells initially incubated in HCO3(-)-free medium, indicate that unstimulated cells use a HCO3(-)-dependent mechanism to maintain cytoplasmic pH. Further analyses comparing unstimulated with stimulated cells showed that antigen causes a small transient acidification in medium containing HCO3- and a larger sustained acidification in HCO3(-)-depleted medium. Ionomycin is a more potent acidifying agent, stimulating a sustained acidification in complete medium and causing further acidification in HCO3(-)-free medium. These results support the hypothesis that the inhibition of antigen- and ionomycin-induced 45Ca2+ influx and secretion in cells incubated in HCO3(-)-free medium is at least partially due to the inactivation of HCO3(-)-dependent mechanisms required to maintain pH in unstimulated cells and to permit pH recovery from stimulus-induced acidification.","['Lee, R J', 'Oliver, J M', 'Deanin, G G', 'Troup, C D', 'Stump, R F']","['Lee RJ', 'Oliver JM', 'Deanin GG', 'Troup CD', 'Stump RF']","['Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque 87131.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Bicarbonates)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', ""85138-49-4 (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*physiology', 'Bicarbonates/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Culture Media/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/drug effects', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescence', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ionomycin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/physiology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990130204 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1992;13(2):127-36. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990130204.,['GM37202/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the SCID phenotype was the only obvious abnormality detected in RAG-2 mutant mice, RAG-2 function and V(D)J recombinase activity, per se, are not required for development of cells other than lymphocytes.","['Shinkai, Y', 'Rathbun, G', 'Lam, K P', 'Oltz, E M', 'Stewart, V', 'Mendelsohn, M', 'Charron, J', 'Datta, M', 'Young, F', 'Stall, A M']","['Shinkai Y', 'Rathbun G', 'Lam KP', 'Oltz EM', 'Stewart V', 'Mendelsohn M', 'Charron J', 'Datta M', 'Young F', 'Stall AM', 'et al.']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Rag2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinases)', '0 (V(D)J recombination activating protein 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (integron integrase IntI1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*analysis', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', '*Integrases', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Recombinases', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry']",1992/03/06 00:00,1992/03/06 00:01,['1992/03/06 00:00'],"['1992/03/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/06 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(92)90029-C [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(92)90029-c [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1992 Mar 6;68(5):855-67. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(92)90029-c.,['AI20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To effectively monitor minimal leukemic activity after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), we used a competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification technique to quantify expression of the characteristic bcr-abl fusion message in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Quantitative results were obtained between the 0.001% and 0.1% level in control experiments. This represents a significant advantage over cytogenetic and Southern blotting techniques routinely used to diagnose CML, which may not be sensitive below the 1% level. To illustrate the potential clinical usefulness of the quantitative PCR strategy, we compared results of bcr-abl messenger RNA expression with those obtained using cytogenetic and Southern blotting techniques, in a study of consecutive BM and peripheral blood (PB) samples from two CML patients at high risk for relapse after BMT. One patient received a syngeneic transplant during the chronic phase of the disease and relapse was apparent at the molecular level 4.5 months after BMT, while the patient was in complete clinical remission. The second patient was treated with an allogeneic BMT during the accelerated phase of the disease. A slow, but progressive decrease in bcr-abl expression was observed during the first 12 months after BMT, and expression was undetectable thereafter. Our results indicate that the competitive PCR technique can be used to monitor disease activity in patients at high risk of relapse, while the patients are in complete clinical remission, which should facilitate the early detection of relapse or the identification of progressive disappearance of leukemic activity. The approach used may serve as a model for the study of residual disease in an increasing number of other hematologic malignancies that express cancer-specific RNAs.","['Thompson, J D', 'Brodsky, I', 'Yunis, J J']","['Thompson JD', 'Brodsky I', 'Yunis JJ']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73726-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 15;79(6):1629-35.,['CA33314/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the hematopoietic microenvironment provided by the stroma is required for stem cell maintenance both in vivo and in vitro, we reasoned that cell-free transduction of bone marrow cells (BMC) may be aided by stromal support. We used two high-titer replication-defective retroviral vectors to differentially mark progenitor cells. The transducing vector was shown to be a specific DNA fragment by polymerase chain reaction of colony-forming cells derived from progenitors maintained in long-term culture (LTC). BMC were infected separately by cell-free virions with or without pre-established, irradiated, allogeneic stromal layers, and in the presence or absence of exogenous growth factors (GF). The GF assessed were interleukin-3 (IL-3) and IL-6 in combination, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), mast cell growth factor (MGF), and LIF and MGF in combination. In addition, we developed a competitive LTC system to directly assess the effect of infection conditions on the transduction of clonogenic progenitors as reflected by the presence of a predominate provirus after maintenance in the same microenvironment. The results show gene transfer into human LTC-initiating cells by cell-free retroviral vector and a beneficial effect of stromal support allowing a transduction efficiency of 64.6% in contrast to 15.8% without a supporting stromal layer. A high transduction rate was achieved independent of stimulation with exogenous GF.

Using a bioassay, high serum IL-6 (S-IL-6) levels were correlated with disease severity in plasma cell dyscrasias. Since other cytokines could interfere with the bioassays, we developed a specific radioimmunoassay to study S-IL-6 levels in 102 patients with monoclonal gammopathy (MG). S-IL-6 level was studied by a double antibody radioimmunoassay using a rabbit polyclonal anti-IL-6 antibody and a human recombinant IL-6 as the standard. The lowest value of the standard significantly different from zero was found to be 78 pg/ml. Within-run and between-run precisions were characterized by a mean coefficient of variation of 3.72 and 5.5%, respectively. The mean analytical recovery was found to be 113% and the immunochemical identity of IL-6 standard and S-IL-6 was shown by dilution tests. IL-6 was detected in all tested sera. Sera from 66 healthy volunteers and 43 patients with acute leukemia or malignant lymphoma were tested as controls. In healthy subjects, S-IL-6 values were 294 +/- 86 pg/ml. MG were classified as multiple myeloma (MM), macroglobulinemia, and MG of undetermined significance (MGUS). The distribution of S-IL-6 levels in patients with MG was significantly higher than in healthy subjects but lower than in patients with acute leukemia or Hodgkin's lymphoma. Results obtained in 55 patients with MM were related to other biological parameters. S-IL-6 levels correlated with bone-marrow plasmacytosis (P less than .0005), serum-lactate dehydrogenase (S-LDH; P less than .005), serum beta 2 microglobulin (S -beta 2m; P less than .01), and serum calcium (S-Ca; P less than .025) and inversely correlated with haemoglobin (P less than .025). Our results indicate that 1) radioimmunoassay is suitable for the measurement of human IL-6 in serum; 2) high S-IL-6 levels are observed in a small number of patients with MG; and 3) S-IL-6 level correlates with tumour cell mass in patients with overt MM.","['Solary, E', 'Guiguet, M', 'Zeller, V', 'Casasnovas, R O', 'Caillot, D', 'Chavanet, P', 'Guy, H', 'Mack, G']","['Solary E', 'Guiguet M', 'Zeller V', 'Casasnovas RO', 'Caillot D', 'Chavanet P', 'Guy H', 'Mack G']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, C.H.U.

Our observations indicate the existence of CNS cells permissive for the expression of HTLV-I and which may be of importance in the pathogenesis of TSP.","['Gonzalez-Dunia, D', 'Grimber, G', 'Briand, P', 'Brahic, M', 'Ozden, S']","['Gonzalez-Dunia D', 'Grimber G', 'Briand P', 'Brahic M', 'Ozden S']","['Departement des Retrovirus, UA CNRS 1157, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*microbiology', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(92)90473-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1992 Apr;187(2):705-10. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(92)90473-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tf-Gel-1 was developed by continuous exposure of HL-60 cells to human iron-saturated transferrin covalently linked to the plant toxin gelonin (Tf-Gel); this variant was five- to sixfold more resistant to Tf-Gel than parental HL-60 cells. The amount of cell surface, as well as of solubilized, TfR and the cycling pools of TfR in Tf-Gel-1 cells, as measured by the binding of [125I]Tf, were all decreased to 20-30% of the levels present in parental cells. The growth of Tf-Gel-1 cells was independent of exogenous Fe3+ and was comparable to that of parental HL-60 cells. Despite the lower levels of TfRs, the Tf-Gel-1 clone retained the capacity to alter receptor expression, depending upon the phase of growth and the intracellular iron concentration, and to down-regulate TfRs in response to inducers of differentiation. Southern hybridization of cellular DNA with TfR cDNA did not reveal differences between parental and Tf-Gel-1 cells in the level and arrangement of the TfR gene. Basal and inducible (repressible) levels of TfR mRNA from Tf-Gel-1 cells, as measured by northern hybridization of cellular RNA with TfR cDNA, were comparable to those of parental cells. Metabolic labeling of cells with [35S]methionine, followed by immunoprecipitation of TfRs, demonstrated that the amount of radioactivity incorporated into TfRs in Tf-Gel-1 cells was reduced to a degree that approximated the decrease in [125I]Tf binding. Cell surface TfRs prepared from exponentially growing parental cells labeled with 125I by the solid-phase lactoperoxidase-glucose oxidase method existed as a doublet, with one form being phosphorylated and the other not phosphorylated. In contrast, Tf-Gel-1 cells not only contained diminished amounts of TfRs but also contained only the phosphorylated form of TfRs in the surface membrane. The decrease in the surface membrane concentration of the TfR in Tf-Gel-1 cells was specific for this glycoprotein, since the levels of other cell surface antigens, such as CD13, CD15 and CD45, were normal in Tf-Gel-1 cells. A reduction in the incorporation of [3H]mannose into the acid-insoluble fraction of cells and an increase in sensitivity to ricin suggested that Tf-Gel-1 cells possessed an aberration in carbohydrate metabolism.","['Ishiguro, K', 'Ho, P T', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Ishiguro K', 'Ho PT', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Toxins, Biological)', '0 (Transferrin)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Surface/biosynthesis', 'Carbohydrates/biosynthesis', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Lectins/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Plant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Toxins, Biological/pharmacology', 'Transferrin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01233448 [doi]'],ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1992 Jan;18(1):45-63. doi: 10.1007/BF01233448.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A chimeric mRNA is formed containing sequences from a chromosome 22 gene (bcr) at its 5' end and all but the variable exon 1 of c-abl sequence. The product of this mRNA, p210bcr-abl, has constitutively high protein-tyrosine kinase activity. We examined K562 cells and other lines established from CML patients for the presence of phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr)-containing proteins which might be p210bcr-abl substrates. Two-dimensional gel separation of 32P-labeled proteins followed by phosphoamino acid analysis of 25 phosphoproteins, which comprised the major alkali-stable phosphoproteins, indicated that three related proteins of 41 kDa are the most prominent P-Tyr-containing proteins detected by this method. The 41-kDa phosphoproteins are found in two other CML lines that we examined but not in lines of similar lineage isolated from patients with distinct leukemic disease. A protein that comigrates with the major form of pp41 (pp41A) and contains P-Tyr is also found in murine fibroblasts and B-lymphoid cells transformed by Abelson murine leukemia virus, which encodes the v-abl protein, and in platelet-derived growth factor-treated fibroblasts, in which it has been described previously. We analyzed three pairs of Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B-cell lines from individual CML patients and found that only the lines in which active p210bcr-abl was present contained detectable pp41. We also performed immunoblotting with anti-P-Tyr antibodies on the same CML cell lines and detected at least four other putative substrates of p210bcr-abl, which were undetected with use of the two-dimensional gel technique.","['Freed, E', 'Hunter, T']","['Freed E', 'Hunter T']","['Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, California 92186.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.3.1312-1323.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Mar;12(3):1312-23. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.3.1312-1323.1992.,"['CA-14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39785/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC369564,,,,,,,,,,,

As members of the steroid receptor superfamily, ELP and FTZ-F1 have both DNA binding and putative ligand binding domains which are well conserved between the two. ELP and FTZ-F1 function in cells in the extremely early stage of development. A high degree of conservation between the two transcription factors during the evolution of these species indicates the importance of their functions in early-stage embryogenesis.

Approximately 20% of patients have a hematologic relapse after BMT. The frequency of cytogenetic or molecular relapse (or both), despite hematologic remission, is reportedly higher. We performed allogeneic BMT in 32 patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia by using unmanipulated donor marrow and a conditioning regimen that consisted of cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation. Of these 32 patients, 23 had cytogenetic studies after BMT. Seven of these patients had cytogenetically detectable Philadelphia chromosomes some time after BMT, during hematologic remission. The Philadelphia chromosome was detected transiently in two patients, and the fraction of abnormal metaphases exceeded 25% in three patients. None of the patients with negative results of cytogenetic studies or with the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in less than 25% of analyzed metaphases had a clinical relapse, whereas two of the three patients with more than 25% abnormal metaphases had clinical relapses.

IP showed that HLA-DR was most strongly and frequently expressed by M1 blasts (53.5%, 86%) and least strongly and frequently expressed by M3 blasts (4.5%, 0%). HLA-DR was also relatively strongly expressed by M4, M5A, M5B (21.5%, 43%; 34.9%, 69%; and 19.2%, 56%, respectively). CD11b was uniformly weakly expressed by all FAB subgroups.

The optimal plating concentration for CML PB CFU-GM was similar to that observed in PB collected from patients with ovarian carcinoma during haematological recovery following chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (recovery phase). The recovery phase PB was used as a source of non-leukaemic cells with a higher incidence of CFU-GM similar to that of CML. IFN produced a dose-related inhibition of CFU-GM growth in normal, recovery phase ovarian carcinoma and CML, PB MNC. The IFN concentration required to inhibit 50% of the CFU-GM in culture (LD50) was found to be significantly influenced by the plating concentration. When cells were cultured at 1.0 x 10(5) MNC/ml the mean LD50 for 7 CML patients was similar to that in normal (n = 5) or recovery phase (n = 5) peripheral blood, 273 i.u./ml, 1047 i.u./ml and 795 i.u./ml, respectively. In contrast when CML cells were cultured at 0.03 x 10(5) MNC/ml the concentration for optimal CML CFU-GM growth, the mean LD50 was significantly lower than that in normal PB and recovery phase PB, 4 i.u./ml, 251 i.u./ml and 78 i.u./ml, respectively (p less than 0.05). This is the first report of a differential sensitivity to IFN between CML and non-CML progenitors using an optimized PB CFU-GM assay system and proposes that further study of the in vitro culture of CML progenitors may increase our understanding of the clinical effects of IFN.","['Gronthos, S', 'To, L B', 'Haylock, D N', 'Juttner, C A']","['Gronthos S', 'To LB', 'Haylock DN', 'Juttner CA']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media', 'Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90126-r [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992;16(2):153-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90126-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the effects of these GI factors on the growth of variant cell lines (Mm-A, Mm-P and Mm-S2) of mouse monocytic line Mm-1 cells were examined. Mm-A are highly leukemogenic to syngeneic SL mice, Mm-P cells are moderately leukemogenic, while Mm-S2 cells have little or no leukemogenicity. The R1-GI factor markedly suppressed the growth of Mm-A cells, whereas it inhibited the growth of Mm-P and Mm-S2 cells only moderately. Recombinant mouse interferon beta (IFN beta) had similar target specificities to those of the R1-GI factor on these variant cells. Moreover, anti-mouse IFN beta antibody completely neutralized the GI activity of the R1-GI factor on Mm-A cells. These results show that the R1-GI factor and mouse IFN beta are very similar and probably identical proteins. The L-GI factor had different target specificities from the R1-GI factor: it showed strongest GI activity on Mm-P cells, moderate GI activity on Mm-S2 cells and weak GI activity on Mm-A cells. Recombinant human interleukin 6 (IL-6) had similar target specificities to the L-GI factor on these Mm-1 variant cells. Furthermore, the L-GI factor could support the proliferation of IL-6-dependent MH60.BSF2 cells. Anti-mouse IL-6 antiserum neutralized the GI activity of the L-GI factor on Mm-P cells. Thus the L-GI factor and mouse IL-6 seem to be closely related and possibly to be identical proteins.","['Kasukabe, T', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Honma, Y', 'Hozumi, M', 'Matsuda, T', 'Hirano, T']","['Kasukabe T', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Honma Y', 'Hozumi M', 'Matsuda T', 'Hirano T']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*isolation & purification', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-beta/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90124-p [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992;16(2):139-44. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90124-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Food and Drug Administration received a report of an increased frequency of cerebellar toxicity at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics after a switch from the product (Cytosar-U) manufactured by The Upjohn Co., Kalamazoo, Mich., to the generic form made by Quad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Indianapolis, Ind. PURPOSE: To compare the incidence of cerebellar toxicity in Quad-treated patients with Upjohn-treated patients, a record-based cohort study was conducted at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics between January 1986 and August 1989. METHODS: The incidence of cerebellar toxicity was studied in 63 leukemia patients according to the manufacturer of the product received (34 Upjohn only, 25 Quad only, and four both manufacturers). The relative risk of cerebellar toxicity was adjusted for other known risk factors. RESULTS: Patients in the manufacturer-defined treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, type of leukemia, disease stage, calculated creatinine clearance, presence of abnormal liver function tests, or total dose received. The crude relative risk of cerebellar toxicity comparing the Quad product with the Upjohn product was 5.0 (95% confidence interval = 1.8-13.7). Adjustment for potential confounders did not alter the association. Other risk factors for cerebellar toxicity, independent of manufacturer, were age greater than 50 years, type of leukemia, disease stage, total dose greater than or equal to 20 g/m2, abnormal pretreatment liver function, and reduced creatinine clearance. CONCLUSION: This study found a significantly higher incidence of cerebellar toxicity with high-dose cytarabine manufactured by Quad Pharmaceuticals when compared with the incidence of cerebellar toxicity with the Upjohn product. Further research at independent institutions would be necessary to allow generalization of this finding. In addition, our findings suggest that a dose reduction in high-dose cytarabine therapy may be indicated for patients with reduced glomerular filtration rates.","['Jolson, H M', 'Bosco, L', 'Bufton, M G', 'Gerstman, B B', 'Rinsler, S S', 'Williams, E', 'Flynn, B', 'Simmons, W D', 'Stadel, B V', 'Faich, G A']","['Jolson HM', 'Bosco L', 'Bufton MG', 'Gerstman BB', 'Rinsler SS', 'Williams E', 'Flynn B', 'Simmons WD', 'Stadel BV', 'Faich GA', 'et al.']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, Md 20857.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cerebellar Diseases/*chemically induced/urine', 'Cerebellum/*drug effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/urine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/urine', 'Risk Factors']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/84.7.500 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Apr 1;84(7):500-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.7.500.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the released IL-6R could bind efficiently to purified rIL-6 on solid phase and suppressed the proliferative responses of PBMC. These results suggest that the release of soluble IL-6R might be linked to regulatory functions of immune responses induced by IL-6 stimulation during normal and human retrovirus-infected cell growth and differentiation.","['Honda, M', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Cheng, M', 'Yasukawa, K', 'Suzuki, H', 'Saito, T', 'Osugi, Y', 'Tokunaga, T', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Honda M', 'Yamamoto S', 'Cheng M', 'Yasukawa K', 'Suzuki H', 'Saito T', 'Osugi Y', 'Tokunaga T', 'Kishimoto T']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",IM,,"['Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Apr 1;148(7):2175-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complex is comprised of three components: mature TGF-beta 1, the TGF-beta 1 latency-associated peptide (beta 1-LAP), and the latent TGF-beta 1-binding protein (LTBP). LTBP plays an important role in the assembly and secretion of the latent TGF-beta 1 complex; if the TGF-beta 1 precursor fails to bind to LTBP, much of it remains inside the cells and may contain anomalous disulfide bond(s) between beta 1-LAP and the mature TGF-beta 1 molecule (Miyazono, K., Olofsson, A., Colosetti, P., and Heldin, C.-H. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1091-1101). In the present work, we have investigated the subcellular localization and properties of the TGF-beta 1 precursor retained intracellularly. When the HEL cells were metabolically labeled and chased for up to 72 h, a considerable part of the TGF-beta 1 precursor was still observed intracellularly in an unprocessed form. The secreted form of the TGF-beta 1 precursor was resistant to endoglycosidase H, whereas the intracellular form of the TGF-beta 1 precursor was sensitive to endoglycosidase H, regardless of the presence or absence of swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the TGF-beta 1 precursor co-localized with mannosidase II, a marker for the Golgi complex, but not with protein disulfide isomerase, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum. The intracellular TGF-beta 1 precursor was prepared from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated HEL cells and tested for TGF-beta 1 bioactivity. Half-maximal inhibition of the DNA synthesis in mink lung epithelial cells, Mv1Lu, was observed at 80 pM of the acid-treated TGF-beta 1 precursor, whereas nontreated material showed minimal growth inhibitory activity. Taken together, these results indicate that the TGF-beta 1 precursor is retained inside the cells in the Golgi complex, mainly in a latent, immature form.","['Miyazono, K', 'Thyberg, J', 'Heldin, C H']","['Miyazono K', 'Thyberg J', 'Heldin CH']","['Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Biomedical Center, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.2.1.96 (Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Golgi Apparatus/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mannosyl-Glycoprotein Endo-beta-N-Acetylglucosaminidase/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Precursors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42818-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Mar 15;267(8):5668-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of an effect of intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin depletion upon in vitro proliferation of two human cell lines.,5599-607,"N-Acetylserotonin (compound 1) and N-acetyldopamine (compound 7) inhibit bovine adrenal medullary sepiapterin reductase in a manner competitive with the pterin substrate and have Ki values of 0.12 and 0.4 microM, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that the phenyl rings of the two compounds bind in the pyrimidine pocket of the enzyme with the 3-hydroxyl of dopamine or the 5-hydroxyl of serotonin aligned at the pyrimidine 4-position. Further, the acetyl moieties of the two inhibitors appear to mimic the substrate side chain. Consistent with this analysis, N-acetyl-m-tyramine (compound 13) is also an excellent competitive inhibitor (Ki = 0.13 microM), whereas N-acetyltryptamine (compound 2), N-acetyl-p-tyramine (compound 14) and N-acetylphenylethylamine (compound 15) all bind poorly. Interestingly, restricted-rotation analogs of N-acetyldopamine and N-acetyl-m-tyramine are noncompetitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Modification of N-acetyldopamine to N-chloroacetyldopamine (compound 10) or of N-acetylserotonin to the N-chloroacetyl (5) or N-methoxyacetyl (compound 6) analogs results in greatly increased competitive affinity, with Ki = 0.014 microM for the dopamine analog and 0.006 and 0.008 microM, respectively, for the serotonin analogs. In MOLT-4 T-cell leukemia and MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma in culture, 0.1 mM N-methoxyacetylserotonin depleted tetrahydrobiopterin by greater than or equal to 97 and greater than 50%, respectively, with no effect upon cell growth. In both cell lines, the GTP cyclohydrolase inhibitor, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine at 1-5 mM also depleted tetrahydrobiopterin greater than or equal to 97%. In this case, however, modest growth inhibition did occur. Since the growth inhibition could not be reversed upon tetrahydrobiopterin repletion, inhibition was due to other effects of the inhibitor rather than to tetrahydrobiopterin depletion. The results show that there is no effect on cell growth when at least 97% of the tetrahydrobiopterin in these cell lines is depleted. Since the sepiapterin reductase inhibitor depleted tetrahydrobiopterin with fewer nonspecific effects than the cyclohydrolase inhibitor, it will be useful for determining metabolic effects of tetrahydrobiopterin depletion.","['Smith, G K', 'Duch, D S', 'Edelstein, M P', 'Bigham, E C']","['Smith GK', 'Duch DS', 'Edelstein MP', 'Bigham EC']","['Division of Cell Biology, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Pteridines)', '0 (Pterins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'CJQ26KO7HP (sepiapterin)', 'EC 1.1.- (Alcohol Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.1.1.153 (sepiapterin reductase)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)']",IM,,"['Alcohol Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Pteridines/*pharmacology', '*Pterins', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Serotonin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42807-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Mar 15;267(8):5599-607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Down-regulation of CD31 in activated T lymphocytes.,5243-9,"We report the independent cloning of the cDNA for CD31, a recently described cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily present on platelets, granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. Northern analysis revealed three major mRNA transcripts in Jurkat (a human T cell line) and K562 and HEL (leukemia cell lines) cells with an additional 5.3-kilobase transcript seen in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Following T cell activation, CD31 mRNA was down-regulated by Northern analysis, and decreased CD31 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblots. The down-regulation of CD31 was partially mediated by decreased transcription as demonstrated by nuclear run-on studies. CD31 became rapidly phosphorylated in platelets, Jurkat cells, and endothelial cells after cell activation. We were unable to demonstrate the presence of a phosphotyrosine in CD31 using monoclonal and polyclonal phosphotyrosine antibodies. In addition, CD31 phosphorylation in platelets was induced by phorbol ester and was blocked by staurosporin, a protein kinase C inhibitor, suggesting that CD31 phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase C and involves serine and/or threonine residues. The phosphorylation of CD31 following cell activation may modulate its cellular adhesiveness, and the down-regulation of its expression may serve to impart target specificity and to localize effector lymphocytes to areas of inflammation.","['Zehnder, J L', 'Hirai, K', 'Shatsky, M', 'McGregor, J L', 'Levitt, L J', 'Leung, L L']","['Zehnder JL', 'Hirai K', 'Shatsky M', 'McGregor JL', 'Levitt LJ', 'Leung LL']","['Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305-5112.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)42758-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Mar 15;267(8):5243-9.,"['1RO1-HL35774/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K04 HL02213-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we examined the point of inhibition of differentiation by elevated levels of c-Myc in one (clone 38-2) of the typical transformants. Commitment assay indicated that elevated levels of c-Myc interfere with entry of the transformant into the commitment event, but when c-myc expression was reduced by removing Zn ions from the medium, the cells could reenter the commitment program. However, once the cells were committed, such cells could not return to the uncommitted state. In addition, time-dependent expression of two erythroid specific genes was inhibited by elevated levels of c-Myc in time-dependent manner. These results suggest that c-Myc modulates MEL cell differentiation at a reversible point of commitment.","['Takada, S', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Ohmori, Y', 'Matsui, Y', 'Obinata, M']","['Takada S', 'Yamamoto T', 'Ohmori Y', 'Matsui Y', 'Obinata M']","['Department of Cell Biology, Tohoku University, Sendai.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zinc/pharmacology', '*Zinc Compounds']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1992.tb02352.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1992 Jan;83(1):61-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1992.tb02352.x.,,,,,PMC5918659,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified N-ras mutations in 5 of the patients (30%). In one patient, we observed 2 mutations that were shown to be located in different alleles. With the solid-phase minisequencing method, we were able to determine the proportion of mutated cells in the samples. We found that in 4 of the samples only a fraction (7-64%) of the blasts carried an N-ras mutation, and in one sample practically all blast cells were mutated.

Results showed that AcSDKP, whatever the doses used, did not modify the proliferation of both HL-60 cells and AML cells even when enhanced by stimulating factors such as interleukin 3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). In addition, no change in the number and the percentage in S-phase of both HL-60 clonogenic cells and CML progenitors was observed. Our data clearly demonstrate that the tetrapeptide AcSDKP was ineffective on leukemic cells and therefore by acting selectively on normal progenitors represents a potent therapeutical agent for the protection of normal bone marrow progenitors during chemotherapy.","['Bonnet, D', 'Cesaire, R', 'Lemoine, F', 'Aoudjhane, M', 'Najman, A', 'Guigon, M']","['Bonnet D', 'Cesaire R', 'Lemoine F', 'Aoudjhane M', 'Najman A', 'Guigon M']","['Department of Hematology, CHU St. Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Feb;20(2):251-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier work from our laboratory indicated that long-term treatment of LP-BM5 MuLV-infected mice with AZT induced peripheral anemia but increased the number of splenic and bone marrow erythroid burst-forming units (BFUe). In contrast, other workers have demonstrated that short-term intensive AZT treatment decreases bone marrow BFUe of normal mice. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of short-term oral AZT treatment in immune deficient animals. LP-BM5 MuLV-infected and normal mice were given 0, 1, and 2.5 mg/ml of AZT in their drinking water. Mice were killed after 2, 4, 8, 15, and 30 days of AZT treatment. The hematocrits of all AZT-treated mice decreased in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. AZT treatment decreased the absolute numbers of circulating reticulocytes in both normal and infected mice after 4 days of treatment. In contrast, the percentage of bone marrow early erythroblasts was increased in both normal and infected animals after 4 days of treatment. AZT at both doses decreased the number of BFUe per femur in both infected and normal mice after 2, 4, and 8 days. However, after 15 days the number of bone marrow BFUe increased. In spleen, the numbers of BFUe were increased only with high-dose AZT in both normal and infected mice at all time points, although the increases were more dramatic in infected mice. Our results indicate that the effect of AZT on bone marrow BFUe is time dependent, with inhibition being observed only at early time points.

This was achieved using a recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF)-stimulated myeloid cell colony formation (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, GM-CFC) assay as well as a recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo)-stimulated erythroid burst formation (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E) assay. Cells were obtained from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of normal healthy donors and from patients with suppressed bone marrows. The latter group included aplastic anemia, leukemia, and lymphoma patients and patients with solid tumors who responded to intensive chemotherapy with significant pancytopenia. THF gamma 2 significantly enhanced normal BM and PB GM-CFC and PB BFU-E by 2- to 2.5-fold. This effect was totally dependent on the presence of the respective growth factors, that is, rGM-CSF or rEpo, and was specifically reversed by an anti-THF gamma 2 antiserum. Furthermore, although THF gamma 2-induced enhancement of GM-CFC colony formation was not affected by lymphocyte or monocyte depletion, the augmenting effect of the peptide on BFU-E was completely abrogated in the absence of lymphocytes. THF gamma 2-induced augmented growth of progenitor cells derived from severely suppressed marrows was minimal. However, cells from moderately neutropenic patients with leukemia in remission or with lymphoma under chemotherapy responded to the peptide similarly to cells from normal donors. These results suggest a stimulatory role for THF gamma 2 on human myeloid and erythroid hematopoietic progenitor cells. They also suggest the lymphocyte dependence of BFU-E enhancement and lymphocyte independence of GM-CFC stimulation by THF gamma 2. In the former case the thymus-derived peptide may act through the induction of certain erythroid-enhancing lymphokines.","['Barak, Y', 'Hahn, T', 'Pecht, M', 'Karov, Y', 'Berrebi, A', 'Zaizov, R', 'Stark, B', 'Buchner, V', 'Burstein, Y', 'Trainin, N']","['Barak Y', 'Hahn T', 'Pecht M', 'Karov Y', 'Berrebi A', 'Zaizov R', 'Stark B', 'Buchner V', 'Burstein Y', 'Trainin N']","['Pediatric Research Institute and Hematology Unit, Kaplan Hospital, Petach Tiqva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '107489-37-2 (thymic humoral factor gamma 2)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Feb;20(2):173-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 48-h exposure of murine plasmacytomas MPC-11 to the phorbol ester TPA reduces their growth and induces vimentin synthesis without affecting the composition of their nuclear lamina. When applied to human leukemic promyelocytes HL-60, such treatment promotes their maturation into macrophage-like cells: their proliferative ability is suppressed, a differentiated phenotype is developed, and their content in intermediate filament proteins now includes vimentin and a full complement of lamins A, B, and C. In the present study, a kinetic analysis of vimentin and lamin A/C expression in relation to proliferation and differentiation has been performed in these two cellular systems. Proliferation rates of MPC-11 and HL-60 populations were evaluated by monitoring cell growth and measuring thymidine incorporation. Maturation of HL-60 cells was assessed by Giemsa staining and percentage of adherent cells. Expression of vimentin and lamins A/C was analyzed using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting techniques. Our data show that there is a relationship between the level of vimentin expression and the extent of growth inhibition in both systems.

There is no evidence of the generation of cells with suppressive activity on B cells but IL-2 increases the ratio of circulating virgin:memory cells. These results may help to explain the increased rate of bacterial infection in patients receiving IL-2.

Using fura-2 to measure cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations, [Ca2+]i, in cell suspensions, and by using ratio imaging of fura-2 in single cells, we did not observe an early significant increase in [Ca2+]i in HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis. The latter stages of apoptosis were, however, accompanied by increasing [Ca2+]i; these increases were apparently a result of, rather than a cause of, apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis could be induced in HL-60 cells under conditions of vastly reduced [Ca2+]i achieved by loading these cells with fura-2 in the presence of EGTA.

The purpose of this study was to determine if cell membranes and growth medium from human leukemia cell lines and solid tumor cell lines induced TNF release by cultured human blood monocyte-derived macrophages. The capacity for TNF release and direct tumor killing was highest in monocytes cultured for 7 to 11 days. Cell membranes and culture media from K562 erythroleukemia and several small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, including H82, induced the release of up to 1500 TNF units per 10(6) macrophages over 24 hr. By contrast, allogeneic peripheral blood lymphocytes, cell membranes from normal mixed donor peripheral blood leukocytes, or growth medium from normal embryonic lung fibroblasts induced the release of little or no TNF during culture up to 24 hr, suggesting that this macrophage response was specific for tumor cells. Release of TNF by tumor-stimulated macrophages was gradual, peaking 24 hr following the addition of stimuli. Induction of macrophage TNF release was concentration dependent, with half-maximal TNF levels induced by 12.5 and 25 micrograms/ml cell membranes prepared from K562 and H82, respectively. Pretreatment of tumor cell membranes with polymixin B, which inhibits many of the actions of endotoxin, failed to neutralize tumor induction of TNF, suggesting that endotoxin was not responsible for this activity. Depletion of macrophages by treatment with 3C10 monoclonal antibody and complement abrogated tumor-induced TNF release, indicating that macrophages were the source of the secreted TNF. HPLC analysis of H82 growth medium demonstrated a single peak of macrophage activating activity with approximate 40-kDa molecular weight. We have demonstrated that cell membranes and growth medium from some human leukemia and solid tumor cell lines, but not from normal human cells, induce human peripheral blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages to release functionally active TNF.

Evidence of autoantibodies, immune complexes, and complement consumption is typically absent. Myelodysplastic syndromes can be confidently linked to vasculitis on the basis of recent literature. The temporal relationship of malignancy to vasculitis development is variable except that vasculitis generally follows the discovery of hairy cell leukemia and splenectomy. Vasculitis may occasionally be a complication of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation. Occasionally, malignant disorders may mimic vasculitic syndromes. The etiopathogenesis of vasculitis in patients with malignant disorders is unknown.

The interaction of both drugs with DNA has been studied. Binding data are consistent with a model in which the acridine nucleus occupies an intercalation site and the tetrapeptidic or octapeptidic portion is located in the DNA minor groove. Compound 1 fully intercalates into DNA. In contrast, minor groove binding of the octapeptide SPKKSPKK seems to partially modify the intercalative properties of the acridine moiety of 2. In vitro cytostatic and cytotoxic activities against a murine leukemia cell line (L1210), as well as inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation, are reported. Compound 1, which is a better inhibitor of DNA synthesis than 2, is also 2.8-fold more potent in terms of growth inhibition. Both drugs are efficient cytostatic agents, but are weakly cytotoxic.

In contrast, activin A/EDF activity was reduced in the chronic renal failure patients and 23/26 serum samples examined showed levels below 1.2 ng/ml. Further analysis using HPLC revealed that chronic renal failure serum actually contained as much activin A/EDF as normal serum, and that the difference between normal and patient serum existed in the content of a specific inhibitor of activin A/EDF.

CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old woman with hairy cell leukemia returned 1 year after diagnosis with spider angiomata of the face and neck, palmar erythema, and diffuse telangiectasias. The liver span was normal. Laboratory studies included: aspartate aminotransferase, 56 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 283 U/L; gamma-glutamyltransferase, 157 U/L; and normal bilirubin. A liver biopsy demonstrated modest infiltration of hairy cells with hemosiderosis and intact hepatocytes. RESULTS: The patient responded to interferon-alpha with resolution of the angiomata, decreased palmar erythema, and improved liver function tests. Five months later, she presented with right upper quadrant pain, anorexia, fatigue, and diffuse myalgias. The physical examination was unchanged. Laboratory studies included: aspartate aminotransferase, 299 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 1,388 U/L; total bilirubin, 43 mumol/L; and direct bilirubin, 29 mumol/L. Two weeks later, she was admitted to the hospital. Her liver span was 15 cm. Laboratory studies showed the following values: aspartate aminotransferase, 618 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 2,319 U/L; total bilirubin, 311 mumol/L; direct bilirubin, 233 mumol/L; and alanine aminotransferase, 462 U/L. Intensive investigation of contributing causes was not revealing. A subsequent liver biopsy demonstrated extensive portal and intralobular hairy cell infiltration with loss of normal architecture. Liver function deteriorated as shown by the following values: aspartate aminotransferase, 1,100 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 3,645 U/L; bilirubin, 477 mumol/L; and ammonia, 47 mumol N/dL. The patient died 9 days after admission. CONCLUSIONS: Although liver infiltration is often present and mild elevations of liver function tests have been noted, evidence of such extensive hepatic injury caused by hairy cell leukemia has not been reported previously. Hairy cell infiltration of the liver can cause typical cutaneous changes of liver disease and even fulminant hepatitis.","['Evans, M A', 'Gastineau, D A', 'Ludwig, J']","['Evans MA', 'Gastineau DA', 'Ludwig J']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hepatitis/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Liver/*pathology', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Recurrence']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(92)90114-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(92)90114-q [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1992 Feb;92(2):209-12. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(92)90114-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission was obtained in 45 patients (94%). Overall survival was 83% and 68% at five and ten years, respectively. Five and ten-year relapse-free survival of complete responders was 71% and 57%, respectively. Univariate analysis of potential prognosticators showed the following to significantly increase the survival rate: one or two sites of disease (p less than 0.01), stage I (p less than 0.02), age less than 65 years (p less than 0.02), complete excision of tumor mass (p less than 0.03), and the use of radiotherapy (p less than 0.02). The extent of radiotherapy field did not affect survival. Multivariate analysis by the stepwise proportional hazards model of Cox showed that the use of radiotherapy was the factor which significantly produced better survival figures (p less than 0.03).

Outcome was favourable in 69% (group 1; N = 18) and in 13 comprehensive expenditure data were available. In the remainder (group 2; N = 8) treatment failed and they were considered to be the equivalent of a no-treatment population. Here hospital charges were analysed both with and without inclusion of ALG and HDMP. Over the 1-year study period, no significant difference in the median expenditure was found between group 1 at R19 281 (range R35 657-13 379) and group 2 at R18 522 (range R22 449-16 951). The median number of admissions for group 1 was one and for group 2 three, requiring a median of 19 and 20 days of hospitalisation respectively. At the end of the 1-year study period 19 of 26 patients were alive (73%), 69% having responded. At this time, 16 of the 18 patients in group 1 had returned to their previous occupations, but this had not been possible for any of the 8 in group 2.

We purified the smaller HML-1 subunit (105 kDa under nonreducing conditions) from hairy-cell leukemia cells and determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this chain. The 17 residues determined were identical to the deduced amino acid sequence encoded by an integrin beta 7 cDNA clone [Yuan, Q., Jiang, W.-M., Krissansen, G.W. & Watson, J.D. (1990) Int. Immunol. 2, 1097-1108]. Biochemical analysis of the larger HML-1 subunit (175 kDa under nonreducing conditions) suggested that it was a distinct member of the cleaved group of integrin alpha chains, which we designated alpha E. The beta 7 chain also was associated with the integrin alpha 4 subunit, suggesting that the HML-1 antigen (alpha E beta 7) and alpha 4 beta 7 constitute a beta 7 integrin family on mucosal lymphocytes. Interestingly, regulation of the expression of the HML-1 antigen was reciprocal to that of lymphocyte function-associated molecule 1 in the presence of transforming growth factor beta 1. We suggest that these beta 7 integrins may play a specific role in mucosal localization or adhesion and that the expression of the HML-1 antigen might be regulated by transforming growth factor beta 1 produced at or near epithelial tissues.","['Parker, C M', 'Cepek, K L', 'Russell, G J', 'Shaw, S K', 'Posnett, D N', 'Schwarting, R', 'Brenner, M B']","['Parker CM', 'Cepek KL', 'Russell GJ', 'Shaw SK', 'Posnett DN', 'Schwarting R', 'Brenner MB']","['Laboratory of Immunochemistry, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (integrin alphaEbeta7)', '0 (integrin beta7)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Integrin beta Chains', 'Integrins/*chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*cytology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry/cytology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/metabolism']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.5.1924 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 1;89(5):1924-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.5.1924.,,,,,PMC48566,,,,,,,,,,,

NF-kappa B is composed of distinct subunits, and at least four independent genes (p105, p100, p65, and c-rel) have been isolated that encode related proteins that bind kappa B sites. Because it is possible that specific interactions of different subunits can allow selective gene activation, we have characterized the specificity of transcriptional activation by various combinations of these subunits. When tested alone, an approximately 49-kDa form (p49) of the p100 protein bound weakly to kappa B, but p49 associated with p65 to bind efficiently to this site. Furthermore, p49 acted in combination with either p65 or a Rel/VP16 fusion protein to activate kappa B-dependent transcription in Jurkat T leukemia cells. The p49/p65 or p49/Rel combination stimulated transcription mediated by the canonical kappa B site but did not stimulate reporter genes containing interleukin 2 receptor alpha or major histocompatibility complex kappa B elements, despite its ability to bind to these sites. Transactivation mediated by the p49/p100 and p65 NF-kappa B proteins is therefore sensitive to minor changes in the sequence of the kappa B site. Specificity determined by the association of NF-kappa B subunits provides a mechanism to selectively regulate variant kappa B sites associated with different cellular and viral genes.","['Perkins, N D', 'Schmid, R M', 'Duckett, C S', 'Leung, K', 'Rice, N R', 'Nabel, G J']","['Perkins ND', 'Schmid RM', 'Duckett CS', 'Leung K', 'Rice NR', 'Nabel GJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0650.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.5.1529 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Mar 1;89(5):1529-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.5.1529.,"['AI26865/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29179/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['c-rel'],PMC48485,,,,,,,,,,,

ADF is constitutively produced and released by human lymphoid cell lines transformed by lymphocyte-tropic viruses, such as human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We found that the viability and growth of these ADF high-producer cell lines (ATL-2, HUT102, MT-2, 3B6 and RPM18866) were highly dependent on L-cystine in the culture. In contrast to the relative cystine independency of ADF low-producer cells (Jurkat, Jijoye, U937 and K562), the growth of ADF high-producer cells was almost completely suppressed in L-cystine-free condition. Their viability and growth in L-cystine-free medium were markedly improved by 5 x 10(-5) M L-cysteine, 5 x 10(-5) M 2-ME or 10(-3) M GSH and partially by 10(-3) M DTT. The results demonstrate the requirement of reducing condition involving thiol compounds for the optimal growth of the virally transformed lymphoid cells. Furthermore, recombinant ADF (rADF) and suboptimal dose of 2-ME additively enhanced the growth of ATL-2 cells in L-cystine-free medium, implying the possible involvement of endogenous reducing agents such as ADF/thioredoxin homologue in the process of lymphocyte transformation/activation.","['Yamauchi, A', 'Masutani, H', 'Tagaya, Y', 'Wakasugi, N', 'Mitsui, A', 'Nakamura, H', 'Inamoto, T', 'Ozawa, K', 'Yodoi, J']","['Yamauchi A', 'Masutani H', 'Tagaya Y', 'Wakasugi N', 'Mitsui A', 'Nakamura H', 'Inamoto T', 'Ozawa K', 'Yodoi J']","['Second Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (leukemia growth-promoting factor)', '48TCX9A1VT (Cystine)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)']",IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Cystine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/cytology', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/metabolism']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(92)90108-a [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1992 Feb;29(2):263-70. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(92)90108-a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was determined that MeSpd is a poor substrate for spermine synthase and is not a substrate for spermidine N1-acetyltransferase, suggesting that alpha-methylated polyamines might be metabolically stable and therefore useful tools for studying polyamine effects in intact cells. On the basis of initial cellular results with 2, 1-methylspermine (MeSpm, 3) and 1,12-dimethylspermine (Me2Spm, 4) were also synthesized. When added to cells (L1210, SV-3T3, or HT29) depleted of both putrescine and spermidine by prior treatment with alpha-(difluoromethyl)ornithine (DFMO), these alpha-methylated polyamines were able to restore cell growth to that observed in the absence of DFMO. In accord with the enzyme data noted above, metabolic studies indicated a slow conversion of 2 to 3, but no metabolism of 4 in these cells. It was concluded from these results that the alpha-methylated polyamines are able to substitute for the natural polyamines spermidine and spermine in critical biochemical processes which involve polyamines for continued cell growth. In accord with the hypothesis, preliminary data indicate that MeSpd and Me2Spm are as effective as spermidine and spermine, respectively, in promoting the conversion of B-DNA to Z-DNA.","['Lakanen, J R', 'Coward, J K', 'Pegg, A E']","['Lakanen JR', 'Coward JK', 'Pegg AE']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109-1055.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['137946-02-2 (1-methylspermidine)', '137946-03-3 (1,12-dimethylspermine)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 2.5.1.22 (Spermine Synthase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Colonic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermine Synthase/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/02/21 00:00,1992/02/21 00:01,['1992/02/21 00:00'],"['1992/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00082a013 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1992 Feb 21;35(4):724-34. doi: 10.1021/jm00082a013.,['CA37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retroviral transmembrane envelope proteins (TM proteins) play an important role in this phenomenon. CKS-17, a synthetic heptadecapeptide, represents the immunosuppressive site of these retroviral TM proteins. Here we support on the further delineation of this immunosuppressive site using CKS-17-derived hexapeptides. The N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine-induced monocyte polarization assay was used throughout this study because this monocyte function has been shown to be highly sensitive to TM protein p15E-related immunosuppression. We found that in addition to CKS-17 one CKS-17-derived hexapeptide, LDLLFL, reversibly inhibited monocyte polarization, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 20 and 2 microM respectively. LDLLFL-mediated inhibition was sequence specific because the reverse peptide LFLLDL and scrambled peptides were not inhibitory. Hexapeptides corresponding to LDLLFL, but derived from various retroviruses other than murine leukemia virus, also inhibited monocyte polarization. Peptides most homologous to LDLLFL-LDILFL (feline leukemia virus) and LDLLFW (human T lymphotropic virus types I and II)--were the most potent inhibitors. Peptides homologous to primate and human endogenous proviruses were not suppressive. LDLLFL and some of its homologous also inhibited polarization of neutrophilic granulocytes. These findings lend further support to the view that conserved retroviral TM protein-related peptides can play an important role in suppression of inflammatory cell function as encountered in retrovirus-associated immunosuppression.","['Oostendorp, R A', 'Schaaper, W M', 'Post, J', 'Meloen, R H', 'Scheper, R J']","['Oostendorp RA', 'Schaaper WM', 'Post J', 'Meloen RH', 'Scheper RJ']","['Department of Pathology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Granulocytes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Oligopeptides/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*chemistry', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.51.3.282 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1992 Mar;51(3):282-8. doi: 10.1002/jlb.51.3.282.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Each case was reclassified according to the Working Formulation and an attempt made to allocate an immunophenotype using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Results were correlated with clinical data on site and survival. RESULTS: Of the 43 cases, 30 were males and 13 females. There were 17 cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma, 15 cases of small non-cleaved cell lymphoma (SNCC), and four cases of large cell lymphoma. The SNCC group was subdivided into 10 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma and five cases of non-Burkitt's lymphoma. An immunophenotype was allocated in 65.1% of cases (23 B, 5 T). The SNCC cases were spread throughout the 0-16 year age range while the lymphoblastic lymphoma cases tended to occur in older children. Most mediastinal tumours were lymphoblastic lymphoma and most abdominal tumours were SNCC. Statistical analysis failed to show a significant difference in survival among histological subgroups or immunophenotypes. CONCLUSION: No histological variables of prognostic importance were identified partly due to the great variation in treatment regimens, standard of supportive care, and prognosis over the period of the study (1972 to 1988).","['Davison, A M', 'McKinney, P A', 'Bailey, C C', 'Lewis, I', 'Cartwright, R A', ""O'Brien, C""]","['Davison AM', 'McKinney PA', 'Bailey CC', 'Lewis I', 'Cartwright RA', ""O'Brien C""]","['University Department of Pathology, Leeds General Infirmary.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'England', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.45.2.130 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1992 Feb;45(2):130-4. doi: 10.1136/jcp.45.2.130.,,,,,PMC495651,,,,,,,,,,,

The present results demonstrate that treatment of asynchronous human U-937 leukemia cells with 10 nM TPA is also associated with oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage. This pattern of DNA fragmentation, which is observed in programmed cell death, was detectable in populations of TPA-treated cells that had entered a nonproliferative G0/G1 phase. Similar findings were obtained after TPA treatment of a synchronous population of G1 cells. These cells progressed through S and G2/M phases before undergoing internucleosomal DNA cleavage during G0/G1 arrest. These G0/G1 cells displayed characteristics of monocytic differentiation, including down-regulation of c-myc expression and induction of c-fms transcripts. DNA fragmentation was also studied in cells treated with 5 nM TPA for 48 h and then monitored in drug-free long-term culture. Endonucleolytic cleavage was similarly observed in the differentiated G0/G1 population. However, longer periods of culture were associated with a decrease in DNA fragmentation to undetectable levels. This effect was followed by retrodifferentiation and reentry of cells into cycle. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that internucleosomal DNA fragmentation occurs during induction of monocytic differentiation, and that both of these events are detectable in G0/G1 cells.","['Gunji, H', 'Hass, R', 'Kufe, D']","['Gunji H', 'Hass R', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Nucleosomes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism', '*Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115677 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Mar;89(3):954-60. doi: 10.1172/JCI115677.,"['CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC442943,,,,,,,,,,,

At concentrations between 5 microM and 0.5 mM, FST triggers endonucleolytic DNA degradation in human promyelocytic leukemia cells, resulting in apoptotic cell death; this effect is not selective for any particular phase of the cell cycle. Little or no apoptotic cell death is observed in lymphocytic leukemic cells at any FST concentration. Because FST, unlike other inhibitors of topoisomerase II, such as teniposide (TN) or amsacrine (m-AMSA), does not stabilize cleavable DNA-topoisomerase complexes, the observed differences between the effects of FST versus TN or m-AMSA on the cell cycle may provide clues regarding the role of such complexes in the kinetic effects of these inhibitors. The present results, therefore, are compared with our earlier data on the effects of TN and m-AMSA on the same cells. The only observed difference is the loss of cell cycle phase-specific triggering of DNA degradation by FST in human promyelocytic leukemia cells, compared to the S phase-specific effects of TN and m-AMSA. Therefore, stabilization of the DNA-topoisomerase cleavable complexes may be essential in the selectivity of cell kill during S phase. However, it appears that the presence of stabilized complexes is not essential to the suppression of cell progression through S or G2 or the induction of apoptotis or necrosis, in general, by topoisomerase II inhibitors.","['Hotz, M A', 'Del Bino, G', 'Lassota, P', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Hotz MA', 'Del Bino G', 'Lassota P', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkenes)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Pyrones)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'ZO1648L551 (fostriecin)']",IM,,"['Alkenes/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Polyenes', 'Pyrones', 'Teniposide/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Mar 15;52(6):1530-5.,"['CA28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the mechanism of DNA damage by this compound in murine L1210 leukemia cells using the method of alkaline elution. Although DHE was about 100-fold more cytotoxic than ellipticine, this increased cytotoxicity was not accompanied by greater amounts of DNA strand breakage or protein-DNA cross-linking. The single strand breaks caused by both compounds were protein associated and could be accounted for by the presence of double strand breaks. DNA damage by the compounds therefore was consistent with topoisomerase II inhibition. Unlike DHE, 80% of the DNA damage elicited by ellipticine was repaired within 1 h after removal of drug. For DHE, 20-h incubations in drug-free media were required to obtain 70% repair of single strand DNA breaks. These data indicated that although both ellipticine and DHE may inhibit topoisomerase II, the type of DNA damage which resulted in topoisomerase II inhibition by DHE was much more persistent than the DNA damage elicited by ellipticine.","['Djuric, Z', 'Everett, C K', 'Valeriote, F A']","['Djuric Z', 'Everett CK', 'Valeriote FA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '81531-57-9 (detalliptinium)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ellipticines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*genetics']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Mar 15;52(6):1515-9.,"['1PO1 CA46560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under such exposure, vital hematopoietic progenitors [granulocyte/monocyte colony-forming units in agar (CFU-GM)] acquire increased radioresistance along with renewed proliferative capacity at an early phase of evolving myeloid leukemia. To further characterize the expression of acquired radioresistance by CFU-GM, we evaluated the effects of various exposure rates, cumulative radiation doses, and times of exposure and postexposure in several groups of long-lived dogs under two conditions of irradiation: (a) continuous, duration-of-life exposures at dose rates of 0.3-7.5 cGy/day; and (b) discontinuous, fraction-of-life exposures at dose rates of 3.8-26.3 cGy/day, with cumulative doses of 450-3458 cGy and postexposure times of 14-4702 days. Results indicated that (a) under protracted continuous irradiation, the degree of radioresistance expressed by CFU-GM in vitro increased markedly in a biphasic pattern with rising daily rates of exposure; (b) under discontinuous, fraction-of-life exposure regimens, elevated levels of radioresistance were expressed and stably maintained by CFU-GM only following large radiation doses accumulated at high dose rates; and (c) with extended postexposure times, the magnitude of expressed radioresistance appeared to wane. These results continue to support the hypothesis that the acquisition of radioresistance and associated repair functions by vital lineage-committed progenitors, under the strong selective and mutagenic pressure of chronic irradiation, is tied temporally and causally to leukemogenic transformation elicited by radiation exposure.","['Seed, T M', 'Kaspar, L V']","['Seed TM', 'Kaspar LV']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439-4833.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Granulocytes/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*blood', 'Monocytes/*radiation effects', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/etiology', 'Phenotype', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Tolerance', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1992/03/15 00:00,1992/03/15 00:01,['1992/03/15 00:00'],"['1992/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Mar 15;52(6):1469-76.,['Y01-CP-50503/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When combined with other clinical and morphometric data, a definitive diagnosis can be made in the most difficult cases. By using a combination of specific antibodies that are each labeled with a different fluorochrome, panels can be designed to follow residual disease with greater precision than any other method. The detection of intracellular proteins is less well developed. Because antibodies can bind nonspecifically to dead cell components, there may be considerable biological noise. This noise reduces the sensitivity for detecting the desired protein within the cell. Until this problem is solved, it is likely that other methods may provide more reliable data. The major advantages of flow cytometry are rapid cell processing, cell by cell analysis, and the simultaneous evaluation of multiple markers. The latter is especially important because more tests can be performed using less clinical material. When flow cytometric results are combined with histologic results, the confidence in professional interpretation is far greater than either can provide alone.

Hepatosplenomegaly and weight loss frequently are present. Nodal T-zone expansion by mononuclear cells with ultrastructural and immunohistochemical features typical of PTC is diagnostic. All of the five previously reported cases of PTC lymphoma coincided with or heralded the onset of a clinically aggressive myeloid leukemia. This strong association and recent immunohistochemical findings in reactive or neoplastic PTC favored a monocyte/macrophage derivation of these cells, and it has been suggested that they be renamed plasmacytoid monocytes (PM). Two additional cases of PTC lymphoma were studied at the institutions of the authors, and the findings supported the concept that PTC belong to the monocytic lineage. The disease presentation was generalized lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms. One patient also had hepatosplenomegaly and bilateral renal enlargement concomitantly with myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia that progressed within months to acute myelogenous leukemia. Similar rapid evolution of acute monoblastic leukemia occurred in the other patient. Tumor cells within subtotally effaced lymph nodes had positive findings for CD45, CD4, CD7, and LN2 and negative findings for CD3, CD8, and beta F1. Occasional cells had positive findings for CD2. One case demonstrated CD5, HLA-DR, CD71, and CD43 (Leu-22)-positive cells. The myeloid/monocyte-associated antigens CD14 and CD68 were identified in both.

It is a critical conceptual point whether or not IL-6 remains involved in the final phases of disease progression in malignant plasma cell dyscrasias. To answer this question, the authors evaluated the in vitro IL-6 dependence of the proliferation of myeloma cells from the bone marrow of 13 patients with advanced multiple myeloma (MM) and from the peripheral blood of 13 patients with plasma cell leukemia (seven primary and six secondary cases). Their results show that myeloma cell growth was totally dependent on IL-6 in 25 of 26 patients. Myeloma cells of only one patient did not respond to IL-6 in vitro. Actually, the cells from this patient were not proliferating in vivo.

Lungs were obtained from autopsied patients and prepared in a manner that allowed for direct pathologic-radiologic correlation. Eighty-eight pulmonary lesions with one of five radiographic patterns were identified in these 35 lungs. The gross, histologic, and radiographic changes were examined and the radiologic and pathologic diagnoses for each lesion were compared. A diffuse alveolar pattern on HRCT was primarily the result of pneumonia or intraalveolar hemorrhage, while irregular focal densities were produced by foci of hemorrhage, infarcts, lymphoma, and fungal infections. HRCT of the lung from a patient with pulmonary histiocytosis X showed a wedge-shaped subpleural density in association with a ""crab-like"" interstitial pattern, which was histologically shown to be an infarct with interstitial enlargement by infiltration of histiocytosis X. Air bronchograms were seen in two settings. In patients with necrotizing pneumonia, air bronchograms were associated with bronchiectasis. In contrast, air bronchograms seen in a patient with a bronchocentric lymphoproliferative disorder showed a pattern of bronchial constriction.

In the present study, 3H-cyclosporine diazirine analogue was used to photolabel viable human cells of lymphoid and fibroblast origin in order to identify the intracellular targets for the drug. While cyclophilin was strongly labeled in situ, additional minor cyclosporine-protein complexes of 25, 40, 46 and 60 kDa were identified in the T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat. These proteins bound specifically, since only active CSA but not inactive CSH or FK506 competed for binding. Photolabeling of MRC5 cells, a CSA resistant human fibroblast cell line, revealed a 25 kDa complex as the major product, while the 46 and 60 kDa bands were not detectable and cyclophilin labeling was only faint, even though both MRC5 and Jurkat cells contain similar cyclophilin concentrations.

Phenotypic heterogeneity at diagnosis.,70-80,"The frequency and distribution of aberrant antigen expression are analyzed on bone marrow aspirates from 80 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by multidimensional flow cytometry. Parameters examined are the light scatter profile of the leukemic cells and the correlative expression of different combinations of the CD2, 4, 5, 7, 11b, 11c, 13, 14, 15, 16, 33, 34, 38, and HLA-DR antigens. Antigen expression on leukemic cells in bone marrow is described by characteristic antigen expression patterns describing: (i) the percentage of cells expressing the antigen; (ii) the antigen density; and (iii) the distribution of the antigen on the leukemic cells. Typically the non-myeloid antigens are homogeneously expressed by the leukemic cells, whereas the myeloid associated antigen CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and CD15 are heterogeneously expressed. Comparison of the antigenic profiles of 80 bone marrow aspirates revealed an extreme interclonal heterogeneity. Comparison of the antigen expression patterns found in AML patients with the antigen expression in normal bone marrow revealed four patterns of aberrant antigen expression in AML: (i) expression of nonmyeloid antigens (i.e. CD2, CD5, and CD7 were present in 57, 60, and 37% of the patients, respectively); (ii) asynchronous expression of myeloid associated antigens (i.e. co-expression of CD34 and CD15 in 25% of the patients and expression of CD16 on immature myeloid cells in 15% of the cases); (iii) over-expression of myeloid associated antigens (e.g. CD34 in 16% of the cases and CD14 on neutrophilic cells in 19% of all patients); and (iv) absence of expression of myeloid associated antigens (e.g. lack of CD33 in 21% of the cases and lack of both CD11b and CD15 in 6% of all patients. Multidimensional flow cytometric analysis of bone marrow aspirates of AML patients disclosed that the leukemic cells of each AML patient had a unique antigenic profile and could be discriminated from their normal counterparts based on aberrant antigen expression and typical light scatter profiles. The ability to distinguish leukemic cells from normal cells allows the detection of residual leukemic cells during and after chemotherapy.","['Terstappen, L W', 'Safford, M', 'Konemann, S', 'Loken, M R', 'Zurlutter, K', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B']","['Terstappen LW', 'Safford M', 'Konemann S', 'Loken MR', 'Zurlutter K', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B']","['Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA 95131.']",['eng'],"['Corrected and Republished Article', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Phenotype']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Jan;6(1):70-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia 1991 Sep;5(9):757-67'],,,

AD 32, nevertheless, inhibited the activation of PKC by TPA or PDBu. The IC50 values for AD 32 inhibition of PKC activation were 0.85 microM for TPA and 1.25 microM for PDBu. Under the same assay conditions, ADR demonstrated much higher IC50 values: 550 microM for TPA and greater than 350 microM for PDBu. The inhibition of PKC by AD 32 was further shown to be competitive in nature; AD 32 inhibited the binding of [3H]PDBu to PKC. Therefore, AD 32 competes with the tumor promoter for the PKC binding site and prevents the latter from both interacting with the phospholipid and binding to PKC. These effects of AD 32 were reproduced in situ; incubation of human leukemia ML-1 cells with TPA showed an increased phosphorylation of cellular proteins, and the TPA-induced protein phosphorylation was inhibited by the addition of AD 32 to the cultured cells.","['Chuang, L F', 'Kung, H F', 'Israel, M', 'Chuang, R Y']","['Chuang LF', 'Kung HF', 'Israel M', 'Chuang RY']","['Department of Medical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['2C6NUM6878 (valrubicin)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/enzymology', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1992/02/18 00:00,1992/02/18 00:01,['1992/02/18 00:00'],"['1992/02/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/18 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90254-G [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90254-g [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Feb 18;43(4):865-72. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90254-g.,"['CA 37082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DA 05901/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As cells progressed through the cell cycle, the amount of RB protein per cell increased with homeostasis maintained, so that the amount of RB protein relative to the total cell mass remained almost constant. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used to induce these promyelocytic leukemia cells to undergo terminal differentiation into mature myeloid cells. There was an early reduction in the RB protein expressed per cell. The reduction in expression was similar for cells in all cell cycle phases. There was also progressively reduced expression at later times as cells terminally differentiated. This was compared to the case in which sodium butyrate was used to induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into mature monocytic cells. An early reduction in RB protein expression per cell also occurred. It occurred for cells in all cell cycle phases as well. Thus, the induced differentiation of HL-60 cells along either the myeloid or the monocytic differentiation lineage involves an early reduction in RB expression, which is common to both pathways. The reduction anteceded proliferative arrest or differentiation. In both cases, the final, resulting G0-differentiated cells had less RB protein per cell than the proliferating, immature, leukemic precursor cells.","['Yen, A', 'Chandler, S']","['Yen A', 'Chandler S']","['Department of Pathology, Veterinary College, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Pharmacol. 38:797-804 (1990)]. The recent discovery by our group of a novel metabolite of AZT. 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine (AMT), which exhibits a high degree of toxicity toward human hemopoietic cells [Mol. Pharmacol. 39:258-266 (1991); Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 35:801-807 (1991)], has led us to explore potential effects of this AZT metabolite on Hb production, globin mRNA expression, and heme synthesis in butyric acid-induced K-562 human erythroleukemia cells. AMT inhibited Hb synthesis by approximately 21%, as measured by benzidine staining, at concentrations as low as 25 microM, with slightly increased inhibition at higher AMT concentrations. The inhibition of Hb production by AMT was substantially lower, compared with that of AZT. AMT inhibited globin mRNA steady state levels in a dose-dependent manner to a similar extent as did the parent drug, with approximately 50% inhibition by each compound at a concentration of 100 microM. Nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrated that inhibition by AMT of globin mRNA synthesis was associated with a decreased rate of globin-specific gene transcription. Globin mRNA stability was not affected by either 100 microM AZT or AMT, as measured after blockage of transcription with actinomycin D. To gain insight into potential mechanism(s) responsible for the different quantitative effects of AZT and AMT on Hb synthesis, the effect of each compound on induction of heme synthesis in K-562 cells was determined. Although heme induction was not affected by AMT, a significant inhibition approximating 20% was observed in the presence of 100 microM AZT. In addition, AZT down-regulated mRNA steady state levels under conditions where heme synthesis was inhibited by succinylacetone. These data suggest that inhibition by AZT of globin gene expression is a direct effect and is not secondary to inhibition of heme synthesis. This study emphasizes the role of AMT in the pharmacodynamic properties of AZT, in relation to its toxicity, and suggest that both AMT and AZT may be involved in the inhibition of erythroid differentiation observed in vivo, through changes in gene expression.","['Weidner, D A', 'Bridges, E G', 'Cretton, E M', 'Sommadossi, J P']","['Weidner DA', 'Bridges EG', 'Cretton EM', 'Sommadossi JP']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', ""52450-18-7 (3'-aminothymidine)"", '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,,"['Butyrates', 'Butyric Acid', 'Dideoxynucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Globins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heme/metabolism', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1992 Feb;41(2):252-8.,"['AI-25784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-42125/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sobuzoxane (MST-16), another derivative of bis(2,6-dioxopiperazine), has shown activity against a broad spectrum of murine tumors and human tumor xenografts in nude mice and a lack of cross-resistance to vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, etoposide, and mitomycin C. These findings suggest that MST-16 has a mode of cytocidal activity different from that of other antitumor agents. PURPOSE: The present late phase II study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy and toxicity of MST-16 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). METHODS: As part of a multi-institutional cooperative study, we conducted a study of MST-16 in 27 patients with NHL who were assessable for drug efficacy and toxicity. MST-16, a bis(2,6-dioxopiperazine) analogue and an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, was administered orally at a dose of 1600 mg/m2 a day for 5-7 days at intervals of 2-3 weeks. RESULTS: Response consisted of one complete remission and seven partial remissions in 27 assessable patients. Response was achieved at a median of 13 days (range, 9-62 days) after initiation of therapy and lasted a median of 46 days (range, 29-155 days). Major toxic effects were leukopenia in 70% of the patients, thrombocytopenia in 44%, and gastrointestinal disorders in 37%. CONCLUSIONS: MST-16 was shown to be effective in NHL and deserves further clinical trial, since the drug shows little cross-resistance to available antitumor drugs. IMPLICATIONS: Phase II clinical studies of MST-16 in treatment of breast cancer, gastric cancer, and adult T-cell leukemia and lymphoma are also being conducted in Japan. Future trials of combination chemotherapy using MST-16 with other antitumor drugs are warranted in view of the additive effects observed in studies of MOLT-3 cells and studies of L1210 leukemia in mice.","['Ohno, R', 'Yamada, K', 'Hirano, M', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Tanaka, M', 'Oguri, T', 'Kodera, Y', 'Mitomo, Y', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Yokomaku, S']","['Ohno R', 'Yamada K', 'Hirano M', 'Shirakawa S', 'Tanaka M', 'Oguri T', 'Kodera Y', 'Mitomo Y', 'Ikeda Y', 'Yokomaku S', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Branch Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', 'R1308VH37P (sobuzoxane)']",IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1992/03/18 00:00,1992/03/18 00:01,['1992/03/18 00:00'],"['1992/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/84.6.435 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Mar 18;84(6):435-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.6.435.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B cells, isolated from tonsils or from the peripheral blood of patients with B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia using mAb and immune rosettes, were cultured with or without Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I. GM-CSF and IL-3 were measured in the culture supernatants using a bioassay based on the selective proliferative response of the MO7e megakaryoblastic cell line to IL-3 or GM-CSF. S. aureus Cowan I-stimulated normal B cells released measurable amounts of GM-CSF but not of IL-3 as determined in neutralization assays with specific mAb in the MO7e cell line test. Some of the unstimulated normal B suspensions also produced GM-CSF, albeit in lower quantities. When normal B cells were fractionated into small (resting) and large (activated) B cells by Percoll density gradients, spontaneous GM-CSF production was detected only in the large cell fractions, but small cells were induced to produce GM-CSF upon S. aureus Cowan I stimulation. On a per cell basis, tonsillar B cells were found capable of releasing more GM-CSF than activated peripheral blood monocytes. The amount of GM-CSF produced by B cells was always inferior to that released by stimulated peripheral blood T cells or NK cells. The purified B cell suspensions from all 14 B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients studied released GM-CSF but not IL-3 in the culture supernatants, sometimes even in the absence of stimuli. Northern blot analysis on total or poly(A)+ RNA confirmed the presence of GM-CSF, but not of IL-3, mRNA transcripts in both normal and malignant B cells. The results of these studies support the notion that activated human B lymphocytes release sufficient GM-CSF to play a role in the control of both hematopoiesis and the inflammatory process.","['Zupo, S', 'Perussia, B', 'Baldi, L', 'Corcione, A', 'Dono, M', 'Ferrarini, M', 'Pistoia, V']","['Zupo S', 'Perussia B', 'Baldi L', 'Corcione A', 'Dono M', 'Ferrarini M', 'Pistoia V']","['Laboratory of Clinical Immunology, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Mar 1;148(5):1423-30.,"['CA 37155/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 45286/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, pre-treatment of Molt 4 cells with L-asp did not significantly alter the accumulation of [3H]-etoposide. Cell-cycle analyses showed an increase in G1-phase cells, a significant decrease in both S-phase cells and G2/M-phase cells pre-treated with L-asp in Molt 4 cells, but L-asp exposure did not result in any significant changes in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, L-asp pre-treatment did not affect topoisomerase-I (Topo-I) inhibitor, camptothecin (CPT)-induced DNA strand breaks or toxicity in Molt 4 cells.

We used both CPT-11 and SN-38 (active substance of CPT-11 in vivo), for our study. Cells were incubated for 3 days in the presence of 2 drugs (CPT-11 or SN-38 and another drug) and cytotoxic effects were determined by MTT assay. The effects of drug combinations on ID50 were analyzed by an improved isobologram method. Supra-additive and marginal supra-additive effects (synergism) were observed for CPT-11 in combination with cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside and mitomycin C. Additive effects were observed for its combination with amsacrine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone and vincristine. Alternate sub-additive and protective effects (antagonism) were observed for CPT-11 in combination with methotrexate. Similar tendencies were observed for SN-38 in combination with other agents. These results suggest that CPT-11 in simultaneous administration with a majority of anti-cancer agents has an advantage for cytokilling.

Using deletion mutants and cis-cloned synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides in transient expression assays, nucleotide sequences responsible for this effect have now been further delimited to 44 bp located from -294 to -251 bp. Gel electrophoresis mobility shift assays and DNaseI footprinting assays demonstrate that these negative regulatory sequences are recognized differently by proteins present in nuclear extracts obtained from HeLa and K562 cells. Two binding proteins are detected in K562 nuclear extracts, while only one is found in extracts from HeLa cells. Possible mechanisms by which these proteins may regulate transcription of the epsilon-globin-encoding gene in erythroid and non-erythroid cells are discussed.","['Gutman, P D', 'Cao, S X', 'Dave, H P', 'Mittelman, M', 'Schechter, A N']","['Gutman PD', 'Cao SX', 'Dave HP', 'Mittelman M', 'Schechter AN']","['National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis', 'Erythrocytes/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/15 00:00,1992/01/15 00:01,['1992/01/15 00:00'],"['1992/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1119(92)90648-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(92)90648-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1992 Jan 15;110(2):197-203. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(92)90648-9.,,,,['cat'],,,,,,,,,,,,

At the population level, we found that BCNU-resistant cells (L1210/BCNU) that appeared to be cross-resistant to killing by a dimethyltriazene and expressed high levels of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity (mer+ phenotype) failed to generate highly immunogenic variant sublines on repeated exposure to the methylating agents. In contrast, all cells (L1210) that were susceptible to DNA alkylation damage and deficient in O6-methylguanine repair (mer-) developed immunogenic variant sublines. A noticeable exception was represented by streptozotocin treatment, which was equally effective in mer+ and mer- cells. At the clonal level, a single exposure to streptozotocin or a triazene derivative resulted in a high incidence (33% and 50%, respectively) of immunogenic cell generation in mer- cells only. In mer+ cells, streptozotocin treatment led to a 33% incidence of immunogenic clones only when the cells were concurrently exposed to O6-methylguanine as a free base. The activity of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in mer+ cells was greatly reduced by treatment with O6-methylguanine or streptozotocin, and the combination of the two drugs led to enzyme levels similar to those observed in mer- cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the mechanism of O6-alkylation may be operative in the induction of novel tumor-cell antigenicity by methylating agents.","['Bianchi, R', 'Citti, L', 'Beghetti, R', 'Romani, L', ""D'Incalci, M"", 'Puccetti, P', 'Fioretti, M C']","['Bianchi R', 'Citti L', 'Beghetti R', 'Romani L', ""D'Incalci M"", 'Puccetti P', 'Fioretti MC']","['Dip.

Of ten derivatives tested, four were active against the P388 murine leukemia i.p.-i.p. system, although K-252a was inactive. Among these derivatives, KT6124 was selected for further biological evaluation studies because its efficacy was the highest. KT6124 was also active against sarcoma 180 and B16 melanoma. It exerted a relatively broad spectrum of antiproliferative activity against 20 human tumor cell lines in vitro. To determine the mechanism(s) of action underlying the antitumor activity of KT6124, we tested the drug for inhibition of protein kinases, including Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC), in intact A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells in comparison with the PKC-inhibitory activity of K-252a. KT6124 did not antagonize the action of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in A431 cells, whereas K-252a did, suggesting that KT6124 may not act on protein kinases in the cells. The interaction of KT6124 with DNA in living cells was examined by the alkaline elution method. KT6124 apparently exhibited DNA scission both dose- and time-dependently in the target cells. The DNA breakage was dependent on proteinase K treatment, suggesting its possible interaction with DNA-related enzyme(s). These results indicate that KT6124 exerts antitumor activity by acting on DNA or on DNA-related enzyme(s) in tumor cells rather than via the inhibition of protein kinases.","['Akinaga, S', 'Ashizawa, T', 'Gomi, K', 'Ohno, H', 'Morimoto, M', 'Murakata, C', 'Okabe, M']","['Akinaga S', 'Ashizawa T', 'Gomi K', 'Ohno H', 'Morimoto M', 'Murakata C', 'Okabe M']","['Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Indoles)', '118777-50-7 (KT-6124)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'ErbB Receptors/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Indoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685943 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;29(4):266-72. doi: 10.1007/BF00685943.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that the gene responsible for neurofibromatosis, type 1 (NF-1), belongs to this class of heritable cancer genes. Children with NF-1 show an increased incidence of myeloid leukemia, including juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) and, perhaps, the myeloproliferative syndrome (MPS) associated with bone marrow monosomy 7 (Mo 7). We have investigated five children with Mo 7: three with NF-1 and two others with suggestive evidence of NF-1. Southern blotting experiments performed in four patients showed no loss of heterozygosity in bone marrow specimens using probes linked to the NF-1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 17. Both of our patients with familial NF-1 inherited the disease from their mothers, as did 14 of 19 other cases of myeloid leukemia in children with familial NF-1. Seventeen of these 21 children were boys. Myeloid leukemia developed in 12 boys and four girls who inherited NF-1 from their mothers, and in five boys who inherited the disease from their fathers. Father-to-daughter transmission was not observed. Taken together, the presence of chromosome 7 deletions in the leukemias of children with NF-1, a pattern of inheritance favoring maternal transmission of NF-1, and the marked predilection for boys to develop JCML and Mo 7 suggest a multistep mechanism of oncogenesis in which epigenetic factors might play a role. Further investigation is required to determine if the NF-1 genes in the leukemic bone marrows of these patients have acquired point mutations or small deletions.","['Shannon, K M', 'Watterson, J', 'Johnson, P', ""O'Connell, P"", 'Lange, B', 'Shah, N', 'Steinherz, P', 'Kan, Y W', 'Priest, J R']","['Shannon KM', 'Watterson J', 'Johnson P', ""O'Connell P"", 'Lange B', 'Shah N', 'Steinherz P', 'Kan YW', 'Priest JR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Naval Hospital, Oakland, CA 94627.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Monosomy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/*genetics']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73756-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 1;79(5):1311-8.,,,,,,54,,,,,,,,,,

DIC was diagnosed in the presence of (1) low fibrinogen (less than or equal to 160 mg/dL), (2) prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and falling fibrinogen, or (3) prolonged PT and positive fibrin split products (FSP). L-Asparaginase was not used during remission induction. Among adequately screened patients with ALL, DIC was detected in 7 of 58 (12%) before initiation of chemotherapy and in 35 of 45 (78%) during remission induction. DIC was not simply the result of infection because clinical and laboratory signs of infection were absent in 16 patients, whereas only 2 of the 22 febrile patients with DIC had positive cultures. Among the 38 patients with DIC at presentation or during remission induction, serious complications were seen in 13 in temporal association with DIC (pulmonary embolus in one, sagittal sinus thrombosis in three, and serious hemorrhage in nine) and were major factors in the deaths of three patients. Among the 10 patients with thorough screening but no evidence of DIC there was only one hemorrhage during the same time interval. In patients with PCALL, DIC was detected in 9% at presentation and in 80% during remission induction. We conclude that DIC is rare at presentation but common during remission induction of adult ALL and PCALL and may be associated with significant thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications. We suggest daily screening for DIC during the first 14 days of remission induction. The treatment of DIC in ALL and PCALL should be a subject of future clinical studies.","['Sarris, A H', 'Kempin, S', 'Berman, E', 'Michaeli, J', 'Little, C', 'Andreeff, M', 'Gee, T', 'Straus, D', 'Gansbacher, B', 'Filippa, D']","['Sarris AH', 'Kempin S', 'Berman E', 'Michaeli J', 'Little C', 'Andreeff M', 'Gee T', 'Straus D', 'Gansbacher B', 'Filippa D', 'et al.']","['Lymphoma-Leukemia Service, Memorial Hospital, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Fibrin Fibrinogen Degradation Products)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",IM,"['Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1366-8.

While mapping cosmids relative to breakpoints in chromosome 16 in leukemic cells with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we have identified three areas of extensive cross-homology between 16p and 16q. Three cosmids among 99 tested showed two large signals on the short arm and one signal on the long arm of chromosome 16. A fourth cosmid showed mainly two signals on the short arm. With the 16p-specific cosmid we can demonstrate that the breakpoints of a pericentric inversion and a reciprocal (16;16) translocation, both of which are characteristic for acute leukemia, map to the most distal of two blocks on the short arm. We suggest that there may be at least two distinct repetitive elements specific for chromosome 16 interdigitated on 16p. The presence of a similar repeat in the short, as well as the long arm of the chromosome, may play a role in the origin of chromosome 16 rearrangements in acute leukemia.","['Dauwerse, J G', 'Jumelet, E A', 'Wessels, J W', 'Saris, J J', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Beverstock, G C', 'van Ommen, G J', 'Breuning, M H']","['Dauwerse JG', 'Jumelet EA', 'Wessels JW', 'Saris JJ', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Beverstock GC', 'van Ommen GJ', 'Breuning MH']","['Department of Human Genetics, State University Leiden, Sylvius Laboratories, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*ultrastructure', 'Cosmids', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73754-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 1;79(5):1299-304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a recently developed monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to the bcl-2 molecule, staining of normal bone marrow myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes, but neither monocytes nor most polymorphonuclear cells, was demonstrated. By two-color flow cytometric analysis, bcl-2 was evidenced in CD33+ and CD33+/CD34+ myeloid cells as well as in the more primitive CD33-/CD34+ population. The leukemic cell lines HL-60, KG1, GM-1, and K562 were bcl-2 positive together with 11 of 14 acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and three of three chronic myeloid leukemias (CML) in blast crises; six of seven CML were negative. Among myelodysplastic cases, augmentation of the bcl-2 positive myeloblastic compartment was found in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and in transformation (RAEB-t). Western blots of myeloid leukemias and control lymphocytes extracts evidenced an anti-bcl-2 immunoreactive band of the expected size (26 Kd). Moreover, the HL-60 and KG1 cell lines, both positive for the bcl-2 protein, exhibited the appropriate size bcl-2 mRNA (7.5 Kb). These findings clearly indicate that the bcl-2 gene is operative in myeloid cells and that the anti-bcl-2 MoAb identifies its product and not a cross-reactive epitope. Induction of HL-60 differentiation toward the monocytic and granulocytic pathways was accompanied by a marked decrease in bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels; bivariate flow cytometric analysis showed that the fraction becoming bcl-2 negative was in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These data establish that the bcl-2 proto-oncogene is expressed on myeloid cells and their progenitors and is regulated in a differentiation-linked manner.","['Delia, D', 'Aiello, A', 'Soligo, D', 'Fontanella, E', 'Melani, C', 'Pezzella, F', 'Pierotti, M A', 'Della Porta, G']","['Delia D', 'Aiello A', 'Soligo D', 'Fontanella E', 'Melani C', 'Pezzella F', 'Pierotti MA', 'Della Porta G']","['Istituto Nazionale per Lo Studio e La Cura Dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73753-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 1;79(5):1291-8.,,,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Engraftment of mice with bone marrow cells infected with a bcr-abl retrovirus has been shown to elicit multiple hematopoietic disorders, including a clonal but nontransplantable hyperproliferation of erythroid and/or mast cells. Culture of spleen and bone marrow cells from such mice usually yielded mast cell lines, even when erythroid disease dominated the primary animal. The mast cells, which carried the same proviral insert as the primary disease, generally grew slowly and were neither transplantable nor clonogenic in agar until they had been cultured for several months. Unexpectedly, several bcr-abl-induced lines switched in vitro from mast cell to megakaryocytic and/or erythroid character, and one became myeloid. The dramatic phenotypic shifts seem likely to involve changes occurring within progenitor cells maintaining the clone, rather than mutation of mature mast cells. The variant lines exhibited substantial spontaneous differentiation, despite being readily transplantable and therefore fully transformed. The production of hematopoietic growth factors by the mast cell lines and their phenotypic variants may implicate an autocrine loop in their evolution. These novel bcr-abl cell lines should aid in the study of genetic events in the progression from chronic to acute leukemia and facilitate analysis of hematopoietic lineage commitment.","['Elefanty, A G', 'Cory, S']","['Elefanty AG', 'Cory S']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Post Office Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/*pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, p53', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Transfection']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73751-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 1;79(5):1271-81.,['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,['bcr-abl'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In two of these patients this event was associated with rapid deterioration and transformation to acute leukemia. However, the third patient showed a protracted course during a period of 5 years after acquisition of the mutation.

The in vitro proliferation of myeloid cell lines in serum-containing medium or proliferation of these cells induced by IL-1 in serum-free medium (measured by 3H-TdR) were inhibited by the M20 IL-1 inhibitor. In addition, growth of normal progenitors and fresh leukemic cells stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (as measured by colony and liquid systems) was also inhibited by this factor. After the removal of the IL-1 inhibitor at the peak of growth inhibition, leukemic and normal progenitor cells retain their ability to grow and develop into GM-CSF colonies. These results show that the growth inhibition phenomena were reversible and did not result from a cytotoxic effect.

This differentiation-inhibiting protein (DIP) specifically blocked the differentiation of human burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), but not colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) cells. DIP also blocked the maturation of murine BFU-E cells, but not CFU-E or CFU-granulocyte-macrophage cells, and it inhibited the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation of Friend murine erythroleukemia cells (FLC) at levels between 10(-10) and 10(-12) mol/L. DIP activity was not detectable in the plasma of normal, healthy subjects. Unlike other known inhibitors of hematopoiesis, DIP appears to directly inhibit erythropoietic differentiation, because it did not affect the proliferation of untreated FLC and it effectively blocked FLC hemoglobinization without affecting the ability of the blocked cells to proliferate. DIP blocked FLC differentiation only when added to the culture medium within 1 hour of inducing the cells with DMSO, suggesting that the protein inhibited an early, but critical, DMSO-induced cellular process. DIP appears to be at least partially responsible for the patient's anemia, and its unique activity suggests a role in the early development of some erythroleukemias.","['Durkin, J P', 'Biquard, J M', 'Whitfield, J F', 'Morardet, N', 'Royer, J', 'Macdonald, P', 'Tremblay, R', 'Legal, J D', 'Doyonnas, R', 'Blanchet, J P']","['Durkin JP', 'Biquard JM', 'Whitfield JF', 'Morardet N', 'Royer J', 'Macdonald P', 'Tremblay R', 'Legal JD', 'Doyonnas R', 'Blanchet JP', 'et al.']","['Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*blood', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73736-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Mar 1;79(5):1161-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that patients relapsing into chronic phase after BMT with T-lymphocyte depleted donor marrow may be offered the option of second BMT with unmanipulated marrow from the original donor. Conditioning with high-dose busulphan alone may be safer than use of more intensive schedules.","['Cullis, J O', 'Schwarer, A P', 'Hughes, T P', 'Hows, J M', 'Franklin, I', 'Morgenstern, G', 'Goldman, J M']","['Cullis JO', 'Schwarer AP', 'Hughes TP', 'Hows JM', 'Franklin I', 'Morgenstern G', 'Goldman JM']","['Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', '*Busulfan', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Reoperation', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Treatment Outcome']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06397.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jan;80(1):33-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06397.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combining our results with data from 25 tumours in the published literature, we have performed the first cytogenetic analysis of a large series of childhood NHL. Our results show that the cytogenetic changes encountered in NHL of children are distinct and may be different from those seen in NHL of adults reflecting the previously recognized differences in histological presentation and clinical behaviour of the two entities. Thus, the most frequently occurring translocation in B-cell lesions in children was t(8;14)(q24;1q32). Other translocations frequently seen in adults such as t(14;18)(q32;q21),t(11;14)(q13;q32) and t(3;22)(q27;q11) were either rare or so far not seen in children, although reciprocal translocations appeared to be generally prevalent in childhood NHL. Combining our data with those in the published literature, we have identified two new recurring translocations [t(1;17)(p36;q21) and t(1;14)(p36;q22)], and a recurring duplication [dup(11)(q13;q23)] in this group of lymphomas. In addition, our literature survey identified a third recurring translocation [t(5;14)(q23;q32)] which was previously reported in two cases of childhood NHL. Our analysis also showed differences in the types of nonrandom translocations between childhood NHL and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in children suggesting that biologically these entities are different from one another. This study thus uncovers patterns of chromosome change associated with childhood lymphoma thus providing new opportunities for investigation of their clinical significance by correlation analysis and biological significance by molecular analysis.","['Mikraki, V', 'Jhanwar, S C', 'Filippa, D A', 'Wollner, N', 'Chaganti, R S']","['Mikraki V', 'Jhanwar SC', 'Filippa DA', 'Wollner N', 'Chaganti RS']","['Laboratory of Cancer Genetics, Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York, N.Y. 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Male', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06394.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 Jan;80(1):15-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb06394.x.,"['CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34775/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The composition of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell population and malignant cell phenotype were also analysed. During this period he received treatment with interferon and his grossly enlarged spleen was removed. Four further patients were also studied, two were splenectomized and all had received treatment with interferon. In four of the five patients studied there was an apparent link between low NK activity and presence of a tumour-infiltrated spleen, and in the fifth patient, who was aleukemic and had no splenomegaly, NK function was related to disease activity. There was no correlation between NK activity and the number of target binding (TB) cells in these five patients. IFN had little direct effect on overall NK activity, but the proportion of killing cells among TB cells was increased. Three patients showed binding of several cells to a single target. Further analysis revealed that in the patients most of the TB cells were not CD56-positive NK cells, in contrast to TB cells from normal subjects. In patient A a large proportion (84%) of TB cells were identified as malignant cells and in patient E 15% of TB cells were malignant cells. The phenotype of the malignant cells was: CD19+, HLA-DR+ and CD25(Tac)+, except for patient A. In this patient the hairy cells were positive for the NK marker CD56 as well as the monocyte marker CD14. Furthermore, a change occurred in phenotype as only later samples carried CD25. It is concluded that the level of NK function correlates closely with disease activity in HCL and that competitive target cell binding by malignant cells may be one cause of depressed NK-cell function in hairy cell leukaemia.","['Ogmundsdottir, H M', 'Thorsteinsson, L', 'Sigfusson, A', 'Sveinsdottir, S', 'Bjornsson, S', 'Eyjolfsson, G', 'Johannesson, G M', 'Jensson, O']","['Ogmundsdottir HM', 'Thorsteinsson L', 'Sigfusson A', 'Sveinsdottir S', 'Bjornsson S', 'Eyjolfsson G', 'Johannesson GM', 'Jensson O']","['Molecular and Cell Biology Research Laboratory, Icelandic Cancer Society, Reykjavik.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/blood', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Male']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1699-0463.1992.tb00834.x [doi]'],ppublish,APMIS. 1992 Jan;100(1):10-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1699-0463.1992.tb00834.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of such pretransplant assignment was studied in a Scandinavian population of 114 consecutive transplantations for acute and chronic leukaemias in 1st remission (n = 74) or chronic phase (n = 40) performed between 1975 and 1989. The selected cut-off value for discriminating between donors of high and low responding capacity (DRC) was based on distribution plots of results from the pretransplant mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) and chosen as the median value (80% normalized response). Then 57 donors were assigned with high DRC and 57 donors assigned with low DRC. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of patients to develop Grade II or higher aGvHD in receipt of high or low responder donor transplants were compared by univariant analysis. The patients in first remission or chronic phase transplanted with bone marrow from donors assigned as high or low responders had a 36.1% and 10.6% risk for aGvHD, respectively, a difference found to be significant by log rank test (chi-squared = 10.1, d.f. = 1, P = 0.0015). Subsequent studies of the cellular and humoral requirements for this predictive response of donor cells, by blocking with cytokine specific antibodies, addition of excess of recombinant human cytokines and scanning of lymphocyte subsets during the response, showed that the response against pool cells mostly depended upon IL-2 responding cells with the phenotype CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, CD25+, CD16-. It is concluded that prospective studies of alloreactivity as a risk factor should be performed to confirm the above findings.","['Johnsen, H E', 'Bostrom, L', 'Moller, J', 'Jorgensen, J A', 'Jensen, L', 'Ringden, O']","['Johnsen HE', 'Bostrom L', 'Moller J', 'Jorgensen JA', 'Jensen L', 'Ringden O']","['Department of Medicine and Haematology C, Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Hellerup, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Time Factors', '*Tissue Donors']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1992.tb02868.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1992 Mar;35(3):353-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1992.tb02868.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have studied the effect of long-term exposure of mouse cells to nicotinamide and various cell cycle blockers on the ability of the cells to increase their levels of poly(ADP-ribose) in response to DNA methylation damage with dimethylsulfate (DMS). Of the cell cycle blockers used, hydroxyurea (HU) and cytosine arabinofuranoside (ara-C) inhibit DNA elongation at the replication fork and cause the appearance of small DNA molecules, whereas butyrate and colcemid block cells without interfering with DNA synthesis. In addition, cells were treated with nicotinamide, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase but also a precursor in NAD+ biosynthesis. Long-term exposure of cultured cells to these agents was followed with a short-term damage with DMS. The size-class distribution and concentration of poly(ADP-ribose) molecules were determined using high resolution polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were found to contain 1 to more than 30 ADP-ribosyl groups. On the contrary, histones from blocked cell nuclei were found to be mono- and oligo(ADP-ribosyl)ated. Thus, the large molecules of poly(ADP-ribose) were associated with nonhistone proteins and most likely with the enzyme pADP-R polymerase. DMS damage caused an increase in the levels of poly(ADP-ribose) that was synthesized in lysates from cells treated with any one drug alone. On the other hand, a dramatic decrease in total protein poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation resulted from DMS damage of cells treated with nicotinamide + HU or nicotinamide + ara-C. This decrease was not observed in combinations of nicotinamide with cell-cycle blockers that do not directly interfere with DNA synthesis (butyrate and colcemid). We suggest that nicotinamide + ara-C or nicotinamide + HU might be used as effective antineoplastic treatments by virtue of their ability simultaneously to damage DNA and reduce poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and presumably DNA repair. A model for the facilitation of DNA repair by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of histones and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase is presented.","['Boulikas, T']",['Boulikas T'],"['Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine, Palo Alto, California 94306.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '0 (Sulfuric Acid Esters)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'JW5CW40Z50 (dimethyl sulfate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Histones/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Niacinamide/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Sulfuric Acid Esters/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1992 May-Jun;12(3):885-98.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relative cellular uptake of eight fractions (uptake/amount of component initially present in the incubation solution) was determined. After 4 h of incubation, protoporphyrin and a small fraction (denoted 4) were incorporated to a greater relative extent than the other fractions. Weakly incorporated components (hematoporphyrin and aggregate-like components) were better retained by cells than the hydrophobic monomeric porphyrins (protoporphyrin and hydroxyethylvinyldeuteroporphyrin). Thus, any benefit gained from a higher uptake was mostly cancelled by a fast release--a situation observed for all fractions except for fraction 4, which displayed both high uptake and good cellular retention. This pattern was not modified when Photofrin concentration or serum percentage was changed. Fraction 4 was further resolved using a gradient system on normal silica. A single component appeared to be mostly responsible for the favorable properties presented by fraction 4, i.e. high uptake and retention within cells. This component was found to correspond to a late eluted peak in the typical reverse-phase HPLC profile of Photofrin. These results emphasize the possible role of minor Photofrin components.","['Dellinger, M', 'Brault, D']","['Dellinger M', 'Brault D']","[""Laboratoire de Biophysique, INSERM U. 201, Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '68335-15-9 (Hematoporphyrin Derivative)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Hematoporphyrin Derivative', 'Hematoporphyrins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1992.tb04281.x [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1992 Apr;55(4):587-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1992.tb04281.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine-phosphorylated 33-kDa beta subunit and 9- to 11-kDa gamma subunit of the Fc epsilon R1 are additionally phosphorylated on serine and theonine residues, respectively, and are found as complexes with other phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in antigen-stimulated cells.

We asked (a) if this increase might, at least in part, be due to changes in a transmembranous protein-tyrosine phosphatase, CD45; and (b) if CD45 changes similarly in other differentiating leukemias. Differentiation of HL60, several chronic myelogenous leukemias, a monocytic leukemia (THP-1), and a monoblastoid leukemia (U-937) could be induced by phorbol ester, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, dimethyl sulfoxide, or cyclic AMP analogues. This differentiation was associated with a marked increase in (a) total cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity (2-4-fold as measured by the ability to dephosphorylate a tyrosine-phosphorylated peptide); (b) CD45-specific tyrosine phosphatase activity (2-4-fold); (c) CD45 cell surface expression by flow cytometry (2-5-fold); (d) synthesis of both exon B-dependent M(r) 205,000 and exon ABC- M(r) 185,000 CD45 proteins, as revealed by immunoprecipitation with antisera specific for CD45 isoforms. Both isoforms have enhanced electrophoretic mobility when isolated from the differentiated cells. This enhanced mobility did not appear to be due to decreased stoichiometry of CD45 phosphorylation on serine/threonine residues. Interestingly, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate transiently reduced CD45 protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell RWLeu4 without altering the CD45 amount (as measured by cell surface immunofluorescence).

The mechanism for signal transduction of the hybrid receptor required dimerization because monoclonal antibodies to the hGH receptor were agonists whereas their monovalent fragments were not. Receptor dimerization occurs sequentially--a receptor binds to site 1 on hGH, and then a second receptor molecule binds to site 2 on hGH.

Previous studies have shown that the rate of dissociation of bivalent and multivalent DNP ligands from RBL cells sensitized with anti-DNP IgE decreases with increasing ligand incubation times. One mechanism proposed for this effect is that when IgE molecules are aggregated, a conformational change occurs that results in an increase in the intrinsic affinity of IgE for antigen. This possibility was tested by measuring the equilibrium constant for the binding of monovalent DNP-lysine to anti-DNP IgE under two conditions, where the cell-bound IgE is dispersed and where it has been aggregated into visible patches on the cell surface using anti-IgE and a secondary antibody. No difference in the equilibrium constant in these two cases was observed. We also measured the rate of dissociation of a monovalent ligand from cell surface IgE under these two conditions. Whereas the affinity for monovalent ligand is not altered by IgE aggregation, we observe that the rate of ligand dissociation from IgE in clusters is slower than the rate of ligand dissociation from unaggregated IgE. These results are discussed in terms of recent theoretical developments concerning effects of receptor density on ligand binding to cell surfaces.","['Posner, R G', 'Lee, B', 'Conrad, D H', 'Holowka, D', 'Baird, B', 'Goldstein, B']","['Posner RG', 'Lee B', 'Conrad DH', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B', 'Goldstein B']","['Department of Chemistry, Baker Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/06/16 00:00,1992/06/16 00:01,['1992/06/16 00:00'],"['1992/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00138a015 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 Jun 16;31(23):5350-6. doi: 10.1021/bi00138a015.,"['AI22449/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07273/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM35556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 21-bp core element has been shown to bind to a cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-like molecule at the site of an imperfect palindrome containing the TGAC motif. Experiments with oligonucleotides with mutations in the imperfect palindrome demonstrated that one TGAC motif is necessary and sufficient for both the binding of the CREB-related factor and transcriptional activity in response to forskolin in a human T-cell line, Jurkat. We also found that binding of the CREB-like factor to the 21-bp core element was enhanced by treatment with TPA, with little effect on transcriptional activity; in contrast, forskolin and p40tax did not facilitate binding, though they enhanced transcription. The combination of forskolin and TPA synergistically induced the transcription activity of the element, showing a hierarchical mechanism of regulation of the HTLV-I core enhancer element to levels sufficient for formation of the factor-enhancer complex and for activation of the complex.

We have recently demonstrated that a short course of high dose IL-2 administered at the time of BMT has a powerful protective effect against GVHD mortality in mice. This short course of IL-2 is able to protect mice from both acute and chronic GVHD without sacrificing alloengraftment or graft-vs-leukemia effects of allogeneic T cells. Because the early administration of IL-2 seems to be crucial for this effect, we have studied the early lymphoid repopulation events after lethal irradiation and allogeneic BMT. These studies show that there are consistent delays in splenic repopulation by allogeneic cells after BMT in IL-2-treated animals compared with their untreated cohorts. Even greater percent reductions were seen in donor splenic T cell populations in the first few days after BMT in IL-2-treated animals. Splenic cells with the CD3+CD4-CD8- phenotype were increased in IL-2 treated animals at days 3 and 4 after BMT. This phenotype resembles that of bone marrow-derived cells which have been previously shown to inhibit GVHD, suggesting a possible mechanism for the protective effect of IL-2.","['Abraham, V S', 'Sachs, D H', 'Sykes, M']","['Abraham VS', 'Sachs DH', 'Sykes M']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown 02129.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Radiation Chimera/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",1992/06/15 00:00,1992/06/15 00:01,['1992/06/15 00:00'],"['1992/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Jun 15;148(12):3746-52.,['AI 31158-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find no significant difference in lateral diffusion rates in these regions. Cells swollen by hypoosmotic stress exhibit faster diffusion overall, with the uncrowded regions having a significantly greater increase in diffusion coefficient than the crowded regions. These results are consistent with the partial or total release of cytoskeletal constraints to membrane protein diffusion induced by osmotic stress.","['Thomas, J L', 'Feder, T J', 'Webb, W W']","['Thomas JL', 'Feder TJ', 'Webb WW']","['Department of Physics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biophys J,Biophysical journal,0370626,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Diffusion', 'Electrochemistry', 'Fluorescence', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Lasers', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-3495(92)81946-X [pii]', '10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81946-X [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys J. 1992 May;61(5):1402-12. doi: 10.1016/S0006-3495(92)81946-X.,['8-P1RR04224/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC1260401,,,,,,,,,,,

The spectrum of clinical manifestations was similar to that in infection caused by Scedosporium apiospermum. The patients were classified into three groups. Four immunocompetent patients who presented with localized infections of a joint, nail bed, eye, or sphenoidal sinus made up the first group. Our first case, in a boy with posttraumatic septic arthritis, responded to surgical drainage with amphotericin B followed by treatment with itraconazole. The other three cases were cured by surgery alone. The second group consisted of five immunocompromised patients who presented with disseminated infections in a variety of sites. Four of these patients did not respond to antifungal therapy and died. The fifth apparently responded to antifungal drugs after correction of his neutropenia. The third group included eight patients with asymptomatic colonization in the external ear (five cases) or respiratory secretions (three cases). The nine isolates of S. inflatum tested by both disk and agar dilution methods were resistant to antifungal drugs. In our first case, which responded clinically to itraconazole, the MIC of this drug for the fungal isolate was 25 micrograms/mL. Thus S. inflatum can cause a broad spectrum of human infections whose severity and prognosis depend largely on the host's immune status.","['Wood, G M', 'McCormack, J G', 'Muir, D B', 'Ellis, D H', 'Ridley, M F', 'Pritchard, R', 'Harrison, M']","['Wood GM', 'McCormack JG', 'Muir DB', 'Ellis DH', 'Ridley MF', 'Pritchard R', 'Harrison M']","['University of Queensland Department of Medicine, Mater Misericordiae Hospital, South Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,,IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Arthritis, Infectious/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endophthalmitis/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompetence', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosporic Fungi/*isolation & purification', 'Mycoses/etiology/*immunology', 'Myocardial Infarction/complications', 'Onychomycosis/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sphenoid Sinus/microbiology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/clinids/14.5.1027 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 1992 May;14(5):1027-33. doi: 10.1093/clinids/14.5.1027.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) demonstrated an unusual large proportion of CD3+ T-lymphocytes expressing a gamma delta T-cell receptor (TcR-gamma delta). Immunofluorescence (IF) stainings with subset-specific monoclonal antibodies showed a fluctuating expansion of TcR-gamma delta+ T-cells expressing V gamma 9 and V delta 2 variable (V) gene segments. Biochemical characterization of PBMC showed the presence of a disulphide-linked TcR-gamma delta. TcR gene rearrangement studies on sorted TcR-gamma delta+ T-cells showed rearrangements of V gamma 9-J gamma 1.2 and V delta 2-J delta 1 V and joining (J) gene segments, thereby confirming the IF staining results. These data alone did not allow us to determine whether the TcR-gamma delta+ LGL expansion represented a polyclonal or monoclonal proliferation, because the combinatorial repertoire of TcR-gamma delta receptors is limited due to the availability of only a few V and J segments within the TcR-gamma and TcR-delta genes and because of the preferential usage of V gamma 9-J gamma 1.2 and V delta 2-J delta 1 rearrangements by TcR-gamma delta+ T-cells in blood of healthy individuals. We therefore used polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated amplification of the TcR-gamma delta rearrangements, using specific V gamma 9, J gamma 1.2, V delta 2, and J delta 1 oligonucleotides to determine the junctional diversity of the TcR-gamma delta+ T-cell population. Sequence analysis of the PCR products obtained revealed a mixture of different junctional region sequences compatible with a polyclonal expansion. This is in contrast to the few reported TcR-gamma delta+ LGL and the majority of TcR-alpha beta+ LGL expansions, which appeared to consist of monoclonal proliferations.","['van Oostveen, J W', 'Breit, T M', 'de Wolf, J T', 'Brandt, R M', 'Smit, J W', 'van Dongen, J J', 'Borst, J', 'Melief, C J']","['van Oostveen JW', 'Breit TM', 'de Wolf JT', 'Brandt RM', 'Smit JW', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Borst J', 'Melief CJ']","['Division of Immunology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis/genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD3 Complex', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*analysis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications/*immunology']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 May;6(5):410-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L1 to L2 shifts in French-American-British morphologic subtype were more common than the reverse (81/178 versus 15/61, p less than 0.001). A small but marginally significant number of cases acquired cytoplasmic granules at relapse, and 50 cases underwent a shift in periodic acid-Schiff reactivity that slightly favoured positive to negative. Shifts in immunophenotype were relatively rare, although shifts in cases with a pre-B phenotype to early pre-B ALL or vice versa occurred in about a third of pre-B cases. Loss of HLA-DR or the common ALL antigen occurred in 20 and 11% of cases, respectively. Of the 116 cases with analyzable karyotypes at diagnosis and relapse, 36 (31%) showed a change in karyotypes at relapse, usually from normal to pseudodiploid or hyperdiploid.

Electrophysiological measurements showed that both these inhibitors produce, at micromolar concentrations, a 20-30 mV hyperpolarization of resting potential (delta psi p) of MELC, which is abolished when the electrochemical equilibrium potential of K+ (EK) is brought close to zero. DCCD and vanadate turned out to have distinct targets on the plasma membrane of MELC (an H+ pump and the Na+,K(+)-ATPase, respectively). Measurements of ARexp showed that: (i) patch-clamp measurements of delta psi p were equivalent to those based on ARexp of antimycin-pretreated cells (ARANT); (ii) DCCD produced a strong increase in ARANT, that was antagonized by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) and diethylstilbestrol (DES); (iii) vanadate determined a marked increase in ARANT that was insensitive to FCCP, but antagonized by ouabain; (iv) incubation in high K+ medium (HK) brought ARANT to 1.0 in the controls, but did not lower this ratio below 3.0 in the presence of DCCD or vanadate; (v) the total amount of TPP+ taken up by the cells was in any case water extractable by a freezing and thawing procedure. On the whole, our data indicate that DCCD and vanadate hyperpolarize the MELC by increasing the K+ conductance and, at the same time, enhance the TPP+ binding, probably by changing the electrostatic potential profile of the plasma membrane. These effects seem to involve functional modifications of the target pumps, apparently related to the ion-occluding state of these enzymes.","['Arcangeli, A', 'Del Bene, M R', 'Becchetti, A', 'Wanke, E', 'Olivotto, M']","['Arcangeli A', 'Del Bene MR', 'Becchetti A', 'Wanke E', 'Olivotto M']","['Institute of General Pathology, University of Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Membr Biol,The Journal of membrane biology,0211301,"['0 (Oligomycins)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '538-75-0 (Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '731DCA35BT (Diethylstilbestrol)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'U9IF5Y5IND (tetraphenylphosphonium)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology/*physiology', 'Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/*pharmacology', 'Diethylstilbestrol/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Onium Compounds/metabolism', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/metabolism', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Potassium/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00231911 [doi]'],ppublish,J Membr Biol. 1992 Mar;126(2):123-36. doi: 10.1007/BF00231911.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cytoskeleton proteins are involved in functions that require cellular movement and may also have a role in modulating signal transduction during cellular proliferation and differentiation. To measure changes in F-actin and actin-binding proteins during HL-60 differentiation, cells were induced to mature along the granulocytic pathway by exposure to 1 microM retinoic acid (RA) for 5 days and were analyzed for F-actin and actin-binding proteins by flow cytometry. The amounts of F-actin and spectrin in untreated HL-60 cells and in those undergoing differentiation by treatment with the retinoid did not differ. N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-phallacidin was used to measure F-actin content and a monoclonal antibody followed by fluorescence isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody was used to measure the content of spectrin; cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.

An RA-supersensitive clone of HL-60, designated HL-60/S4, exhibited lower constitutive levels of alpha-actinin, vinculin, and talin but a higher constitutive level of lipocortin II than parental cells. Treatment of HL-60/S4 with RA led to increases in vinculin, talin, lipocortin I, and lipocortin II. An RA-resistant clone, designated HL-60/R3, constitutively expressed larger amounts of alpha-actinin, vinculin, lipocortin I, and lipocortin II than parental HL-60 cells. Treatment of HL-60/R3 with RA resulted in decreases in the amounts of these actin-binding proteins.

The percentage expression of CD13 antigen by blast cells was significantly related to their percentage positivity for G-CSF receptors (rs = 0.50, P less than 0.05). These findings indicate that the distribution of flow cytometrically detectable G-CSF receptors on leukemic cells possessing myeloid characteristics may be related to the maturation process.","['Shimoda, K', 'Okamura, S', 'Harada, N', 'Ikematsu, W', 'Kondo, S', 'Kawasaki, C', 'Tanaka, T', 'Etou, T', 'Akashi, K', 'Okamura, T']","['Shimoda K', 'Okamura S', 'Harada N', 'Ikematsu W', 'Kondo S', 'Kawasaki C', 'Tanaka T', 'Etou T', 'Akashi K', 'Okamura T', 'et al.']","['Cancer Center, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology/metabolism', 'Neprilysin', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Jun 1;52(11):3052-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a marked enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation on several proteins has been observed as a result of antigen-induced Fc epsilon RI aggregation on these cells. We report here that the phosphatidyl inositide specific phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) is one of the prime proteins that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation as a result of this stimulus. This was determined by immunoprecipitation of phosphotyrosine containing proteins from detergent lysates of rat mucosal mast cells (rat basophilic leukemia cells, subline 2H3; RBL-2H3) and Western blotting analysis of the separated components. A fast appearance of phosphorylated tyrosine residues on PLC gamma 1 was observed, reaching its maximal intensity at approximately 1-3 min after stimulation and declined afterwards to basal levels. Moreover, the phosphorylation depended on maintaining the aggregated Fc epsilon RI as did other cellular responses (e.g. phosphatidyl inositides hydrolysis and secretion). The time course of both Fc epsilon RI induced phospholipase C gamma 1 activation, as monitored by the formation of inositol phosphates, and of the secretory response of the cells followed that of the PLC gamma 1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the tyrphostin AG490, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, caused similar inhibition of the Fc epsilon RI-induced PLC gamma 1 phosphorylation, inositol phosphates formation, and mediator secretion. Significantly, no tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 was induced by the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin, even at doses that cause optimal secretory response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Schneider, H', 'Cohen-Dayag, A', 'Pecht, I']","['Schneider H', 'Cohen-Dayag A', 'Pecht I']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Fc/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/4.4.447 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1992 Apr;4(4):447-53. doi: 10.1093/intimm/4.4.447.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While lymphocytes from DS patients were found to consistently show increased chromosomal aberrations after exposure to ionizing radiation, conflicting reports have been published on the radiosensitivity of fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) derived from these patients. In the present study, cultured skin fibroblast lines developed from a DS patient with ocular telangiectasia and five normal subjects were compared for both cell killing and chromosomal aberrations (breaks, translocations, inversions, dicentrics, and rings) after low dose-rate gamma-irradiation. The LCLs developed from the patient and two normal persons were also compared for chromosomal radiosensitivity using the same irradiation protocol. A comparison of the D10 (radiation dose resulting in 10% survival) values estimated from the survival curves and the frequencies of induced chromosome aberrations in different cell lines showed that the DS cells were more radiosensitive than the respective controls. The increased cellular radiosensitivity of the DS patient reported here could be due to a combination of genetic factors (DS plus a gene for hypersensitivity to radiation) and, thus, may not be representative of all DS patients. Alternatively, the use of low dose-rate irradiation could be a factor in revealing the radiosensitivity of DS fibroblasts in general.","['Hannan, M A', 'Waghray, M', 'Sigut, D', 'Ozand, P T']","['Hannan MA', 'Waghray M', 'Sigut D', 'Ozand PT']","['Department of Biological and Medical Research, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Child Neurol,Journal of child neurology,8606714,,IM,,"['Cell Division/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Down Syndrome/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Eye Diseases/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Fibroblasts/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Telangiectasis/diagnosis/*genetics']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/08830738920070011311 [doi]'],ppublish,J Child Neurol. 1992 Apr;7 Suppl:S83-7. doi: 10.1177/08830738920070011311.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The observation that IL-9 induction peaks as late as 28 h after stimulation suggested the involvement of secondary signals in this process. The finding reported here that IL-9 expression is blocked by cycloheximide strongly supports this hypothesis. Moreover, we identify IL-2 as the critical element controlling IL-9 expression in T cells. We show (i) that anti-IL-2R antibodies block IL-9 expression in T cells stimulated with PMA and anti-CD3 and (ii) that IL-2, of a panel of cytokines, is the only molecule that synergizes with PMA for IL-9 induction. The latter finding is confirmed in a T cell leukemia line. Finally, we demonstrate that IL-2 plays a regulatory role in the induction of other cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, in fresh peripheral T cells.","['Houssiau, F A', 'Renauld, J C', 'Fibbe, W E', 'Van Snick, J']","['Houssiau FA', 'Renauld JC', 'Fibbe WE', 'Van Snick J']","['Experimental Medicine Unit, University of Louvain, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-9)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/physiology', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Interleukin-9/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1992/05/15 00:00,1992/05/15 00:01,['1992/05/15 00:00'],"['1992/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 May 15;148(10):3147-51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three IFN gamma receptor-immunoglobulin hybrid molecules.",9354-60,"Three efficient mouse interferon gamma (MoIFN gamma) inhibitors were constructed, which consist of the MoIFN gamma receptor (MoIFN gamma R) extracellular portion and constant domains of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules. These are: 1) the constant domain of the mouse kappa chain, 2) the hinge region and the constant domains 2 and 3 of the mouse gamma 2a chain, and 3) the hinge region and the constant domains 2 and 3 of the human gamma 3 chain. The hybrid molecules were expressed in the mouse myeloma cell line J558L and recovered from the supernatants of cell cultures in one purification step. The proteins MoIFN gamma R-M gamma 2a and MoIFN gamma R-H gamma 3 form homodimers, whereas MoIFN gamma R-M kappa is a monomer. All three constructs inhibit the binding of radiolabeled MoIFN gamma to its receptor on L1210 cells. They are biologically active in vitro, neutralizing the action of MoIFN gamma in an antiviral activity assay. The fusions of Ig regions to the soluble MoIFN gamma R do not decrease the affinity of the binding site for the ligand. MoIFN gamma R-M kappa has about the same affinity as the soluble MoIFN gamma R and the cell surface receptor of L1210 cells in situ, which are also monomers, whereas the dimers MoIFN gamma R-M gamma 2a and MoIFN gamma R-H gamma 3 display a 5-10-fold higher affinity for MoIFN gamma than the monomeric molecules. This is best documented in the efficacy of the inhibitors to antagonize the antiviral activity of MoIFN gamma, as the dimeric constructs are about 10 times more active than MoIFN gamma R-M kappa and the soluble MoIFN gamma R. The hybrid constructs can be used as high efficiency MoIFN gamma inhibitors in mouse models of several pathological states in humans, where IFN gamma is thought to play a disease-promoting role.","['Kurschner, C', 'Garotta, G', 'Dembic, Z']","['Kurschner C', 'Garotta G', 'Dembic Z']","['Department of Biology, Pharmaceutical Research New Technologies, F.

Biochemical purification of conditioned medium from irradiated D2XRII cells yielded a 75,000-dalton glycoprotein termed leukemogenic stromal factor (LSF) that was neutralized by a polyclonal antiserum to murine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). A monoclonal antibody to the murine M-CSF receptor (c-fms) neutralized the biological activity of this molecule in a manner comparable to its effect on recombinant human or murine M-CSF. FDC-P1JL26 parent cells were positive for Ly5, MEL-14, mGR, VLA-4, PGP-1 (CD44), and Thy1.2. After culture in LSF, Thy1.2, MEL-14, and mGR became undetectable; however, significant cell surface MAC-1 antigen and c-fms (M-CSF receptor) were expressed. Neither line was positive for Ly6, Ly22, I-CAM-1, or B220 antigen. LSF-precultured FDC-P1JL26 cells transferred as single cells to microwell culture with 5000-cGy-irradiated D2XRII cells revealed a 60-fold increase in frequency of cobblestone island formation and evolution of factor-independent subclones compared to the parent line. Both parent and LSF-precultured cells became factor independent at a 100-fold lower frequency if kept in suspension in LSF in the absence of stromal cells. Antiserum to M-CSF or monoclonal antibody to the murine M-CSF receptor (c-fms) did not inhibit or displace cobblestone island formation by either clone of FDC-P1 on irradiated stromal cells indicating a mechanism of binding not involving the M-CSF receptor. However, anti-serum to the M-CSF receptor inhibited growth of one factor-independent subclone. In separate studies, a subclone of IL-3-dependent 32Dc13 cells, expressing the transfected murine c-fms protooncogene but not the parent 32Dc13 cell line or another subclone expressing the transfected gene for the human M-CSF receptor, showed adherence and became factor independent when cocultivated with irradiated D2XRII stromal cells. Thus, irradiated stromal cells bind M-CSF receptor-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells and induce c-fms-dependent factor-independent tumorigenic subclones.

Various simultaneous changes were characterized in MTX/R16 cells which co-participated in the development of resistance: a decreased affinity of the carrier for methotrexate uptake via the reduced-folate system of entry, the increase of dihydrofolate reductase activity and levels and a two-fold increased expression of a membrane-associated high-affinity folate-binding protein (mFBP). The increase of the mFBP expression, besides ensuring the growth of resistant cells by its contribution to the reduced folate intake, also participates in the methotrexate resistance by the internalization of folate cofactor which would compete with methotrexate hindering the effective inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase by the antifolate.","['Cavalcanti, F', 'Calvo, N', 'Grau-Oliete, M R', 'Rivera-Fillat, M P']","['Cavalcanti F', 'Calvo N', 'Grau-Oliete MR', 'Rivera-Fillat MP']","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Pathology, CID, CSIC, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biochem Funct,Cell biochemistry and function,8305874,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Trimetrexate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cbf.290100102 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biochem Funct. 1992 Mar;10(1):1-7. doi: 10.1002/cbf.290100102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blotting and sequence analysis revealed that the melF cDNA encodes a membrane protein of 395 amino acids that is the couterpart to human CD43 (leukosialin) surface antigen of lymphocytes in mice. The melF/mouse CD43 (mCD43) gene was found to be amplified eight- to 10-fold not only in F5-5 cells, but also in their sib cell lines, including the earliest clone established. This indicates that the amplification of melF/mCD43 gene occurred at an early stage of malignant transformation of the F5-5 family. Furthermore, the same gene was rearranged in another Friend erythroleukemia cell line TSA8. In both cell lines, F5-5 and TSA8, the levels of melF/mCD43 mRNA were 30- to 50-fold higher than that in uninfected spleen cells. Among normal tissues examined, the expression of melF/mCD43 gene was restricted to hematopoietic tissues. These results suggest that melF/mCD43 gene has an important role in progression of leukemic cells in the erythroid lineage and also has a physiological function in normal hematopoiesis.","['Misawa, Y', 'Shibuya, M']","['Misawa Y', 'Shibuya M']","['Department of Genetics, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (Spn protein, mouse)', '0 (v-Spi-1 protein, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukosialin', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Multigene Family', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*genetics', 'Spleen/metabolism']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1992 May;7(5):919-26.,,,,['melF'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that constitutive expression of c-myb blocks differentiation. To delineate more accurately the point at which Myb blocks differentiation, MEL cells were transfected with a human c-myb construct under the control of the beta-globin promoter and enhancers. In concert with endogenous DMSO-induced globin transcription during MEL cell differentiation, the beta-globin c-myb transcription unit of the transfected plasmid is activated after 3-5 days of culture in media containing DMSO. Here we describe c-myb-transformed MEL clones which undergo delayed expression of the exogenous c-myb following 3-5 days of culture in DMSO. In contrast to wild-type MEL cells, both clones failed to display phenotypic markers of differentiation and continued to proliferate for up to 10 days of culture. These data suggest that the late fall in c-myb levels may be required in order for differentiation to occur. Additionally, we suggest that constitutive expression of c-myb does not block early commitment events such as activation of histone Hl', subsequent chromatin condensation, and alteration of proliferation-related gene expression.

In the present study, we investigate the induction of these events by receptor activation. Cross-linking of high-affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilon RI) by antigen in RBL-2H3 cells leads to leukotriene C4 production and membrane translocation of 5-lipoxygenase. As in the ionomycin-stimulated cells, leukotriene C4 production in antigen-stimulated cells is calcium-dependent since the amount of leukotriene C4 produced correlates quantitatively with the increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). However, the increase in [Ca2+]i required for equivalent leukotriene C4 production by antigen is not as high as it is using ionomycin. In addition, no threshold [Ca2+]i level is required for leukotriene production by antigen, which is in contrast to the ionomycin stimulation that a [Ca2+]i level of 300-400 nM is required. Furthermore, antigen causes an additive increase in leukotriene C4 production in cells stimulated by the ionomycin. These results suggest that another as yet unidentified intracellular pathway acts in conjunction with Ca2+ for leukotriene synthesis in antigen-stimulated cells. Antigen stimulation causes 20-30% of the total cell 5-lipoxygenase to associate with membranes (compared with 10% in unstimulated cells) as demonstrated by enzyme activity assay and by Western Blot using antibodies to 5-lipoxygenase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Wong, A', 'Cook, M N', 'Hwang, S M', 'Sarau, H M', 'Foley, J J', 'Crooke, S T']","['Wong A', 'Cook MN', 'Hwang SM', 'Sarau HM', 'Foley JJ', 'Crooke ST']","['Department of Cellular Biochemistry and Immunology, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (SRS-A)', '080626SQ8C (MK-886)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', '*Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgE', 'SRS-A/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/28 00:00,1992/04/28 00:01,['1992/04/28 00:00'],"['1992/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/28 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00131a021 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 Apr 28;31(16):4046-53. doi: 10.1021/bi00131a021.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the same findings have been previously demonstrated on HL-60 cells after interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) treatment, the major difference between the two pathways of cellular differentiation is the functional state of the induced receptors: when IFN-gamma is used as differentiation agent, the cells are driven to express a high number of CSF-1 receptors and are able to respond to a CSF-1 stimulus. Such mitogenic response is not obtained when TNF-alpha is applied as inducer indicating that the newly expressed receptors are not functional.

Here we compare the use of F(ab'gamma)2 bispecific antibodies, specifically targetting individual Fc gamma R, and chimeric IgG mouse/human antibodies which are capable of targetting all Fc gamma R, for their ability to mediate target cell destruction. The derivatives are prepared by linking hinge sulphydryl residues via tandem thioether bonds, using a bismaleimide crosslinker: Fab' from an anti-Fc gamma R mAb linked to Fab' from a common anti-target mAb (BsAb), or Fab' from the common anti-target mouse antibody linked to human Fc gamma (FabFc or bisFabFc). All the derivatives targetting chick red blood cells gave efficient lysis, although different effector cell donors yielded differences in both the lytic levels achieved and the comparative efficiencies of derivatives. In contrast, significant lysis of the guinea pig lymphoblastic leukaemia, L2C, regularly resulted only via the anti-Fc gamma RIII BsAb and the chimeric derivatives. These results suggest that the chimeric, Fc-containing derivatives mediate tumour cell lysis principally through Fc gamma RIII on NK cells. This is in contrast to the situation with the chick red blood cells where the chimeric derivatives appear capable of lysing erythrocytes by utilizing either monocytes or NK cells, because significant (approximately 50%) lysis occurred with effector cell populations magnetically depleted through either Fc gamma RII or Fc gamma RIII.

Its identity to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) (E.C.3.24.11) was corroborated by our finding that cALLa positive glioma cells had NEP activity. To study cALLa/NEP distribution on glial tumours in vivo, we examined 76 brain tumour biopsies by immunostaining techniques on frozen tissue sections using anti-cALLa (FAH99) and anti-NEP (135 A 3) monoclonal antibodies. We found that 96% of grade 4 gliomas (25/26) expressed NEP. Whereas only 45% (4/9) of grade 3 or anaplastic astrocytomas did. In low grade gliomas, we found 2 positive tumours out of 21 tested (10%). Double immunostaining procedures revealed that NEP was co-expressed with GFAP. However no NEP could be detected on non-glial brain tumours nor on reactive astrocytes.

THP-1 cells constitutively express FcRI and FcRII, and PMA down-regulated the expression of both FcRI and FcRII. The FcRIII expression was not detected on either untreated or PMA-treated cells. Addition of PMA to THP-1 cells also resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of CD4 expression, as well as in an increased expression of activation-associated antigens. PMA treatment was followed by a progressive decrease in the steady state level of FcRI mRNA, while FcRII mRNA levels did not change, pointing to different regulatory mechanisms at the pre- and post-transcriptional level respectively. The FcRIII mRNA was undetectable. In order to further delineate the mechanism by which PMA induces alterations in FcR expression, we treated cells with stimulators of protein kinase C, of Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent kinase, and of protein kinase A. Since stimulation of none of these second messenger systems induced similar alterations in FcR expression as PMA we next tested the effects of PMA on differentiation and arrest of proliferation. The changes in FcR only occurred at PMA concentrations capable of inducing cell adherence and an arrest of proliferation, and showed a relatively slow time pattern. This suggested that the alterations in FcR expression may be linked to partial differentiation into a more macrophage-like cell. The changes in FcR expression could furthermore be reproduced by 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, another agent capable of differenting monocytes. In conclusion, PMA treatment of THP-1 cells decreases FcRI gene transcription and membrane expression and reduces membrane expression of FcRII. Both changes might be linked with an arrest of cell growth and induction of differentiation.","['Auwerx, J', 'Staels, B', 'Van Vaeck, F', 'Ceuppens, J L']","['Auwerx J', 'Staels B', 'Van Vaeck F', 'Ceuppens JL']","['Department of Developmental Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation/classification/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Fc/classification/*genetics', 'Receptors, IgG', 'Second Messenger Systems/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(92)90070-n [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1992;16(3):317-27. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(92)90070-n.,,,,"['fos', 'jun']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a case of T-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which the leukemic cells showed a proliferative response to human recombinant IL-7 in vitro.

Both T-cell receptor beta-chain and gamma-chain genes were found to be rearranged by immunogenotypic analysis. The leukemic cells proliferated in response to IL-7 dose dependently. The DNA synthesis of CLL cells was stimulated by not only IL-7 but also IL-2 and IL-4. The IL-7-induced proliferation was not inhibited by antibodies to IL-2 receptors or the anti-IL-4 antibody.

Because we previously reported that IL-4 shows a poor capacity for CD23 expression on B-CLLs, we first examined the possible mechanisms underlying CD23 overexpression on B-CLLs and found that mitogen-activated CLL T cells release soluble factors that are capable, in synergy with IL-4, of strongly inducing CD23. Using neutralizing Abs, we noticed that the T-cell-derived enhancing activity is entirely ascribed to the combined effects of IFN gamma (potent inhibitor of CD23 on normal B cells), TNF alpha (which has no effect on normal B cells), and IL-2 (which has a slight enhancing effect on both CLL and normal B cells). Furthermore, recombinant IFN gamma as well as IFN alpha, TNF alpha, and IL-2 (but not IL-3, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, and lymphotoxin) significantly enhance CD23 protein and mRNA expression on B-CLLs, in the presence or absence of IL-4. Inasmuch as optimal CD23 expression absolutely requires the combination of IFN gamma, IL-2, TNF alpha (the production of which is increased in CLL disease), and IL-4, it was relevant to show that IL-4 mRNA is indeed expressed in fresh T-CLL cells. We next examined the possible role of CD23 in the regulation of B-CLL proliferation. Signaling through CD23 via ligation of the antigen by F(ab')2 anti-CD23 MAb but not Fab fragments inhibits the cytokine-induced B-CLL DNA synthesis. It is concluded that the CD23 gene is abnormally regulated in B-CLL disease and that cross-linking of CD23 molecule delivers a negative growth signal to the leukemic B cells.","['Fournier, S', 'Delespesse, G', 'Rubio, M', 'Biron, G', 'Sarfati, M']","['Fournier S', 'Delespesse G', 'Rubio M', 'Biron G', 'Sarfati M']","['Notre-Dame Hospital, University of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*analysis/genetics', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/*analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115717 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Apr;89(4):1312-21. doi: 10.1172/JCI115717.,,,,,PMC442993,,,,,,,,,,,

All three Tax-responsive elements (TREs) contain a TGACG motif, reminiscent of the CREB/ATF-binding site TGACGTCA. DNA-affinity chromatography with the 5'-TRE resulted in a previous study in proteins of about 32, 36 to 42, 50 and 110 kDa. Here we demonstrate that the 42 kDa protein is the cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein. This is shown by phosphorylation of the proteins eluted from the DNA-affinity column with protein kinase A (PKA) in vitro and subsequent indirect immunoprecipitation with a CREB-specific antiserum raised against an internal CREB-specific peptide. This method allows detection of phosphorylated proteins by autoradiography with high sensitivity and is superior to metabolic labeling. One of the phosphorylated proteins co-migrates with immuno-affinity-purified CREB protein--also phosphorylated in vitro--and competes with the peptide antigen, which proves the specificity of the reaction. The purified CREB protein leads to specific DNA-protein complexes in DNA mobility-shift analyses with all three TREs. Comparison of these TRE-CREB complexes with those formed by nuclear extracts from the HTLV-I-transformed T-cell line C81-66-45 indicates that additional cellular factors contribute to the complexes, especially to the middle TRE. This is also shown by using CREB-depleted instead of complete nuclear extracts for DNA mobility-shift assays.

In normal T cells, CD3-mediated PLC activation is significantly augmented by co-ligation of CD3 with the CD4 co-receptor; however, unlike CD3-associated tyrosine kinases, antibody-induced activation of the CD4-associated tyrosine kinase p56lck does not require CD45 expression. To explore the role of CD45 in the CD3 and CD4 activation pathways further, we examined the effect of CD3/CD4 cross-linking on tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C in CD45- mutant cells of the T cell leukemia line HPB.ALL. In accord with previous observations, anti-CD3 stimulation of the CD45-deficient cells failed to activate tyrosine kinases, or PLC as measured by mobilization of intracellular calcium. However, we show here that ligation of CD3 with CD4 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 and elevation in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in CD45- cells that is in excess of that seen in CD45+ cells. Since CD4 stimulation alone did not activate PLC, a component of the CD3 signaling pathway must be independent of CD45. Anti-CD4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of CD4-associated lck was also enhanced in CD45- cells, suggesting that increased lck activation compensates for the defect in CD3/TcR signaling, such that interaction of the CD3 signaling pathway with the CD4-associated pathway activates PLC even in the absence of CD45. The data demonstrate that the requirement for CD45 in coupling CD3/TcR to the PI-PLC activation cascade is not absolute, but rather substantiates a role for CD45 in modifying molecular interactions that control T cell activation.","['Deans, J P', 'Kanner, S B', 'Torres, R M', 'Ledbetter, J A']","['Deans JP', 'Kanner SB', 'Torres RM', 'Ledbetter JA']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD4 Antigens/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/analysis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Type C Phospholipases/analysis']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.1830220308 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1992 Mar;22(3):661-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830220308.,['GM42508/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predominant form of the IFN-alpha receptor is a multichain structure in which IFN-alpha 2 forms complexes of 110 and 130 kDa (alpha-subunit). A high Mr complex of 210 kDa results from the association of alpha-subunit and other receptor components. In contrast, another form of the receptor has been identified in the IFN-alpha-resistant U-937 cell line and in some cases of acute leukemia. This form of the IFN-alpha receptor is characterized by the presence of the alpha- subunit, and the absence of the 110- and 210-kDa bands. Also a novel 180-kDa complex and a more prominent 75-kDa band are observed. Functional studies performed in U-937 cells showed that this cell line is not only partially resistant to the antiproliferative and antiviral effects of IFN-alpha, but also fails to down-regulate the alpha-subunit of the IFN-alpha receptor upon IFN-alpha binding.","['Colamonici, O R', 'Pfeffer, L M', ""D'Alessandro, F"", 'Platanias, L C', 'Gregory, S A', 'Rosolen, A', 'Nordan, R', 'Cruciani, R A', 'Diaz, M O']","['Colamonici OR', 'Pfeffer LM', ""D'Alessandro F"", 'Platanias LC', 'Gregory SA', 'Rosolen A', 'Nordan R', 'Cruciani RA', 'Diaz MO']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)']",IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Down-Regulation', 'Glycosylation', 'Hematopoietic System/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/chemistry', 'Receptors, Interferon']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Apr 1;148(7):2126-32.,"['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 36716/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies demonstrate that myeloid leukemia cells exit the cell cycle to G0-G1 between 24 and 36 h following TPA treatment. This G0-G1 arrest was accompanied by down-regulation of the cell cycle-regulatory genes cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B, and cdc25. Similar findings were obtained for histones H1 and H4. Cell cycle progression of synchronized U-937 cells revealed low to undetectable mRNA levels for these genes in G1 and maximal transcription in G2-M phase. Results obtained from mRNA half-life studies demonstrate that the stability of cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B, and cdc25 transcripts is similar in control and TPA-treated U-937 cells. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated down-regulation of histone gene transcription, while there was no signal detectable for the cell cycle-regulatory genes. The present findings also demonstrate that long term culture of TPA-differentiated U-937 cells is associated with a decrease in G0-G1-arrested cells and an increase of cells in S and G2-M after 25 days. This reentry into the cell cycle was accompanied by loss of adherence, down-regulation of markers for the monocytic phenotype, and induction of the cell cycle-regulatory genes.

Some substrates of protein tyrosine kinases such as phospholipase C gamma and ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) contain sequences homologous to the src protein domains SH2 and SH3 (refs 3-9). The proto-oncogene vav is expressed in haematopoietic cells and its product Vav contains sequence motifs commonly found in transcription factors, such as helix-loop-helix, leucine-zipper and zinc-finger motifs and nuclear localization signals, as well as a single SH2 and two SH3 domains.

Moreover, activation of the receptor for epidermal growth factor leads to marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav in cells transiently expressing vav, and Vav associates with the receptor through its SH2 domain. We propose that vav encodes a new class of substrates whose tyrosine phosphorylation may provide a mechanism for direct signal transduction linking receptors at the cell surface to transcriptional control.","['Margolis, B', 'Hu, P', 'Katzav, S', 'Li, W', 'Oliver, J M', 'Ullrich, A', 'Weiss, A', 'Schlessinger, J']","['Margolis B', 'Hu P', 'Katzav S', 'Li W', 'Oliver JM', 'Ullrich A', 'Weiss A', 'Schlessinger J']","['Department of Pharmacology, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-vav)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (VAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Vav1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Vav1 protein, rat)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))']",IM,['Nature. 1992 Jul 9;358(6382):113.

This indication that the GLVR1 protein acts as a virus receptor does not reveal the protein's normal physiological role. We now report that GLVR1 is homologous to pho-4+, a phosphate permease of Neurospora crassa, at a level sufficiently high to predict that GLVR1 is also a transport protein, although the substrate transported remains unknown. To characterize the gene further, we have cloned cDNA for the mouse homolog of the gene, Glvr-1. The sequence of the murine protein differs from that of the human protein in 10% of residues, and it may be presumed that some of these differences are responsible for the inability of gibbon ape leukemia virus to infect mouse fibroblasts. Glvr-1 RNA is most abundant in mouse brain and thymus, although it is present in all tissues examined. The pattern of RNA expression found in mouse tissues was also found in rat tissues, in which the RNA was expressed at high levels in all compartments of the brain except the caudate nucleus and was expressed most abundantly early in embryogenesis. Thus, high-level expression of Glvr-1 appears to be restricted to specific tissues and may have developmental consequences.","['Johann, S V', 'Gibbons, J J', ""O'Hara, B""]","['Johann SV', 'Gibbons JJ', ""O'Hara B""]","['Molecular Biology Research Section, American Cyanimid Company, Pearl River, New York 10965.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '51845-56-8 (phosphate permease)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Brain/*physiology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hylobates', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neurospora crassa/genetics', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Solubility', 'Thymus Gland/*physiology']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.3.1635-1640.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Mar;66(3):1635-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.3.1635-1640.1992.,,,,"['GLVR1', 'Glvr-1', 'PHO4']",PMC240899,,['GENBANK/M73696'],,,,,,,,,

High-affinity receptors for M-CSF are encoded by the c-fms proto-oncogene. In the present study, we show that c-fms transcripts are detectable in human THP-1 myeloid leukemia cells. Furthermore, radiolabeled 125I-M-CSF is rapidly internalized into THP-1 cells and then degraded intracellularly. The results also show that treatment of THP-1 cells with M-CSF is associated with the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene expression. TNF transcript levels were low to undetectable in uninduced THP-1 cells, reached maximal levels by 1 hour of exposure to M-CSF, and returned to those of control cells by 24 hours. Transcriptional run-on analysis showed that a low level of TNF transcription is detectable in untreated THP-1 cells, and M-CSF treatment increased the rate of TNF transcription. Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with pertussis toxin inhibited the increase in PKC activity but not the induction of TNF transcripts by M-CSF. Moreover, exposure of THP-1 cells to inhibitors of protein kinase activity blocked the increase in TNF messenger RNA. These findings suggest that at least two M-CSF-mediated signaling pathways exist in THP-1 cells and that the induction of TNF may be regulated by a protein kinase-dependent mechanism distinct from PKC.","['Datta, R', 'Imamura, K', 'Goldman, S J', 'Dianoux, A C', 'Kufe, D W', 'Sherman, M L']","['Datta R', 'Imamura K', 'Goldman SJ', 'Dianoux AC', 'Kufe DW', 'Sherman ML']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Biotin', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73780-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 15;79(4):904-12.,"['K08 CA01902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['c-fms'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A monoclonal antibody (MoAb) cocktail of BA-1, BA-2, and BA-3 plus rabbit complement (C') plus 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) was used to eliminate residual occult leukemia cells from autografts. All patients were conditioned with single-dose total body irradiation (TBI) followed by high-dose Ara-C. All 14 patients engrafted at a median of 24 days (range, 12 to 36 days). Three patients are alive and disease free at 3.5 years, 3.9 years, and 4.1 years post-BMT. The Kaplan-Meiser estimate and standard error of the probability of sustained remission was 23% +/- 12% at 3.5 years post-BMT with a mean relapse-free interval of 1.4 +/- 0.4 years. The disease-free survival (DFS) at 3.5 years was 21% +/- 11%, with a mean DFS time of 1.3 +/- 0.4 years. A novel and quantitative minimal residual disease (MRD) detection assay, which combines fluorescence-activated multiparameter flow cytometry and cell sorting with leukemic progenitor cell (LPC) colony assays, was used to analyze remission BM samples from B-lineage ALL patients for residual LPC, and to evaluate the efficacy of ex vivo BM purging. Notably, the minimal residual leukemia burden before BMT, as measured by the percentage of B-lineage LPC in the pre-BMT remission BM samples, indicated the outcome of the BMT. The median value for the minimal residual leukemia burden before BMT was 0.0035% (35 LPC/10(6) mononuclear cells). The Kaplan-Meier estimates and standard errors of the probability of remaining in remission after BMT were 43% +/- 19% for patients whose BM samples contained less than or equal to 0.0035% LPC and 0% +/- 0% for patients whose BM samples contained greater than 0.0035% B-lineage LPC (P less than .05). In contrast to the minimal residual leukemia burden measured by the described MRD assay system, the percentage of blasts or TdT+ cells in the remission BM samples did not correlate with the probability of relapse. The applied purging protocol showed variable success in destroying target B-lineage LPC populations contaminating the autografts. While in some cases purging was highly effective, eliminating up to greater than or equal to 4 logs of residual B-lineage LPC, in other cases only 0.1 to 0.2 logs of B-lineage LPC were purged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Uckun, F M', 'Kersey, J H', 'Haake, R', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Ramsay, N K']","['Uckun FM', 'Kersey JH', 'Haake R', 'Weisdorf D', 'Ramsay NK']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Minnesota Health Sciences Center, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (CD9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 29)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology/*therapy', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neprilysin', 'Rabbits', 'Remission Induction', 'Tetraspanin 29', '*Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1992/02/15 00:00,1992/02/15 00:01,['1992/02/15 00:00'],"['1992/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73807-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Feb 15;79(4):1094-104.,"['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-CA-42111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow, spleen and thymus contained high levels of human leukemic cells and infiltration into lung, kidney, liver, and brain was observed. Two of three mice grafted with only 100 cells showed high levels of infiltration at 15 weeks, suggesting that 100 G2 cells was near the limiting cell number that could produce disseminated leukemia. With the A1 line, a minimum of 10(5) cells was needed to obtain dissemination to liver, lung, brain, and kidney; a low level of spleen infiltration occurred and thymus invasion was not observed. In vitro, both lines showed a density dependent growth in clonogenic assays but the cloning efficiency of the A1 line was 10-fold higher than for G2 cells. These results indicate that G2 and A1 lines have a dissimilar aggressiveness in vivo which does not correlate with clonogenic assay in vitro.

CD3+ CD4-CD8-TCR-gamma delta + T-cell clones which possessed cytotoxicity were co-cultured with a HTLV-I-producing T-cell line. After several weeks, integration of HTLV-I proviral DNA in TCR-gamma delta + T cells was detected by Southern blot analysis. During the continuous culture of HTLV-I-infected TCR-gamma delta + T-cell clones, 2 distinct phases were observed in terms of cytotoxic activity and expression of the CD3-TCR-gamma delta complex. Early after HTLV-I infection, TCR-gamma delta + T cells lost their spontaneous cytotoxicity, but this was restored by the addition of lectin. At this time, no differences were observed in the expression of various surface molecules between HTLV-I-infected and uninfected parent cells, except for increased expression of CD25 on HTLV-I-infected cells. At about 30 weeks after HTLV-I infection, the cytotoxicity of HTLV-I-infected cells was almost completely lost, even in the presence of lectin, and expression of the CD3-TCR-gamma delta complex on the cell surface was markedly decreased. Concomitant with the decreased expression of CD3-TCR-gamma delta complexes, a decrease in the elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration induced by anti-CD3 and anti-TCR monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was also observed. Our present findings thus show that HTLV-I can infect TCR-gamma delta + T cells, and that consequently their functions are profoundly affected through 2 distinct phases.","['Yasukawa, M', 'Inatsuki, A', 'Yakushijin, Y', 'Kobayashi, Y']","['Yasukawa M', 'Inatsuki A', 'Yakushijin Y', 'Kobayashi Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Ehime University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/*microbiology', 'Time Factors']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910500318 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1992 Feb 1;50(3):431-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910500318.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DS individuals also have characteristic facies, hands, and dermatoglyphics, in addition to abnormalities of the immune system, an increased risk of leukemia, and an Alzheimer-like dementia. Although their molecular basis is unknown, recent work on patients with DS and partial duplications of chromosome 21 has suggested small chromosomal regions located in band q22 that are likely to contain the genes for some of these features. We now extend these analyses to define molecular markers for the congenital heart disease, the duodenal stenosis, and an ""overlap"" region for the facial and some of the skeletal features. We report the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular analysis of two patients. The first is DUP21JS, who carries both a partial duplication of chromosome 21, including the region 21q21.1-q22.13, or proximal q22.2, and DS features including duodenal stenosis. Using quantitative Southern blot dosage analysis and 15 DNA sequences unique to chromosome 21, we have defined the molecular extent of the duplication. This includes the region defined by DNA sequences for APP (amyloid precursor protein), SOD1 (CuZn superoxide dismutase), D21S47, SF57, D21S17, D21S55, D21S3, and D21S15 and excludes the regions defined by DNA sequences for D21S16, D21S46, D21S1, D21S19, BCE I (breast cancer estrogen-inducible gene), D21S39, and D21S44. Using similar techniques, we have also defined the region duplicated in the second case occurring in a family carrying a translocation associated with DS and congenital heart disease.

Using N-glycosylation inhibitors and site-directed mutagenesis of the potential glycosylation sites, we have studied the HTLV-I envelope intracellular maturation requirements for syncytium formation. We show here that experimental conditions resulting in the absence of precursor cleavage (tunicamycin, monensin treatments, and use of inhibitors of the reticulum steps of the N glycosylations) also result in no cell surface expression of envelope protein. The lack of syncytium formation observed in these cases is thus explained by incorrect intracellular transport. When the precursor is cleaved in the Golgi stack (no treatment or treatment with inhibitors of the Golgi steps of the N glycosylations), it is transported to the cell surface in all the cases examined. Syncytium formation is markedly reduced, however, when Golgi glycosylations are incorrect, which shows that the sugar moieties are involved in the envelope functions. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that each of the five potential glycosylation sites is actually glycosylated. Glycosylation of sites 1 and 5 is required for normal maturation, whereas that of sites 2, 3, and 4 is dispensable. Glycosylation of each site, however, is required for normal syncytium formation. Altogether, the restraints exerted by the cell for the HTLV-I envelope to be transported and functional are very high, which might play a role in the observed conservation of the envelope amino acid sequence between various strains.","['Pique, C', 'Pham, D', 'Tursz, T', 'Dokhelar, M C']","['Pique C', 'Pham D', 'Tursz T', 'Dokhelar MC']","['CNRS UA 1156, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)', '19130-96-2 (1-Deoxynojirimycin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)', 'RSY4RK37KQ (Swainsonine)']",IM,,"['1-Deoxynojirimycin', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Giant Cells/physiology', 'Glucosamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glycosylation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Swainsonine/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tunicamycin/pharmacology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.2.906-913.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Feb;66(2):906-13. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.2.906-913.1992.,,,,,PMC240791,,,,,,,,,,,

We genetically engineered variants of the tetrameric high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) to identify a site on its alpha, beta, or gamma chains that mediates such putative interactions. Using flow cytofluorometry, we studied rat basophilic leukemia cells, transiently transfected COS cells, and stably transfected P815 cells bearing wild-type and mutated receptors. We observed that (i) solubilization was markedly dependent on the degree of aggregation, the extent varying somewhat with the cell type and, particularly at lower levels of aggregation, with the time after addition of detergent; (ii) truncation of no single cytoplasmic domain of the alpha, beta, or gamma chains ablated the insolubilization effect; and (iii) incomplete receptors were also efficiently insolubilized by aggregation. Thus receptors consisting only of alpha and gamma chains, a ""receptor"" consisting of only the ectodomain of the alpha chain attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol anchor, and ""receptors"" consisting only of minimally modified gamma chains were resistant to solubilization after aggregation. We conclude that no unique subunit or domain of Fc epsilon RI mediates the insolubilization phenomenon. Our results support a model in which the bridging of membrane proteins leads to their becoming nonspecifically enmeshed in a network of membrane skeletal proteins on either the outside and/or the inside of the membrane so that dissolution of the lipid bilayer becomes irrelevant.","['Mao, S Y', 'Alber, G', 'Rivera, J', 'Kochan, J', 'Metzger, H']","['Mao SY', 'Alber G', 'Rivera J', 'Kochan J', 'Metzger H']","['National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Detergents)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Basophils/metabolism', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Detergents/chemistry', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, Fc/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.1.222 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Jan 1;89(1):222-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.1.222.,,,,,PMC48208,,,,,,,,,,,

By selecting for growth in the presence of TPA, we have isolated two TPA-resistant variants of these cells, P13-50 and P13-5/A8. Studies of protein kinase C (PKC) enzyme activity, immunoblot analyses, and assays for PKC mRNAs indicate that both of these variants express lower levels of PKC than do the parental P13 cells. We suggest that this protects them from the toxic effects of TPA. The P13-5/A8 cells are of particular interest because not only are they resistant to TPA toxicity but they actually require TPA for optimal growth. These cells have a more profound decrease in PKC expression that do P13-50 cells. In addition, P13-5/A8 cells display very little, if any, surface expression of CD45, a receptor-linked tyrosine protein phosphatase, and lck, a lymphocyte-specific tyrosine kinase. On the other hand, they express a very high level of interleukin-2 receptor. A model is proposed that suggests that these cells are dependent on TPA because they have defects in both the PKC and tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways, and that TPA compensates for these defects by providing a strong stimulus to the residual level of PKC. This variant may be useful for studying the interactions between tyrosine kinase and PKC pathways in controlling the various functions of T lymphocytes.","['Tchou-Wong, K M', 'Weinstein, I B']","['Tchou-Wong KM', 'Weinstein IB']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Protein Kinase C/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.1.394-401.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Jan;12(1):394-401. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.1.394-401.1992.,['CA 02656/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC364134,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate potentially useful radiolabeled antibodies against human acute myeloid leukemia, we have developed a nude mouse xenograft model using the human acute leukemia cell line, HEL. Mice with s.c. xenografts of HEL cells received infusions of radioiodinated anti-CD33 antibody. Examination of the biodistribution of the antibody showed that uptake in the s.c. tumor was maximal [16.9% injected dose (ID)/g at 1 h after infusion] following infusion of 1-10 micrograms of antibody and decreased following infusion of 100 micrograms (6.5% ID/g at 1 h) presumably as a result of saturation of antigen sites. The radiolabel was poorly retained in tumor (4.5-8.2% ID/g at 24 h after infusion). These results were consistent with in vitro studies demonstrating rapid internalization and catabolism of the anti-CD33 antibody. Uptake in tumor could be improved by using either a radiolabel that is retained intracellularly, 111In-DTPA (18.5% ID/g at 24 h), or by targeting a surface antigen that does not internalize upon antibody binding, CD45 (20.5% ID/g at 24 h).

N6-Methyladenosine (N6mAdo) inhibited initiation of commitment to terminal maturation and prevented accumulation of hemoglobin in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with N6mAdo slowed cell growth without causing substantial inhibition in the rate of DNA synthesis and a marked decrease in viability and clonogenic potential of MEL cells. Furthermore, N6mAdo decreased the cytoplasmic accumulation of beta(major) globin mRNA and affected its structural integrity in MEL cells. Cells pre-exposed to N6mAdo failed to initiate commitment as early as control cells upon challenge with the inducer dimethyl sulfoxide. N6mAdo-induced inhibition of commitment was not reversed but rather was potentiated by the presence of adenine, L-homocysteine and/or L-methionine, agents involved in the active methylation cycle. To this respect, N6mAdo-induced inhibition of commitment was found to be different from that caused by cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of RNA methylation and mRNA polyadenylation). The latter inhibition was fully reversed by the addition of L-methionine. These findings indicate that N6-methyladenosine: (a) blocks a central process that is required for initiation of commitment; and (b) decreases accumulation of beta (major) globin mRNA, causes mRNA degradation and prevents hemoglobin synthesis. Due to the differential sensitivity of N6mAdo- and cordycepin-induced blockade of commitment to L-methionine, these agents inhibit commitment by acting via two different mechanisms impinging on the final pathway of MEL erythroid cell maturation.","['Vizirianakis, I S', 'Wong, W', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S']","['Vizirianakis IS', 'Wong W', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'CLE6G00625 (N-methyladenosine)', 'GZ8VF4M2J8 (cordycepin)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Adenine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Homocysteine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Methionine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(92)90125-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(92)90125-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1992 Sep 1;44(5):927-36. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(92)90125-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extensive clinical heterogeneity observed in FA is reflected in genetic heterogeneity; the existence of 4 complementation groups has been inferred from complementation analysis. FA is putatively characterized as a DNA repair disorder since cells derived from patients are hypersensitive to DNA cross-linking agents. Although the primary defects in FA are not known, biochemical evidence supports either a direct defect in the removal of DNA cross-links or a defect in the ability of cells to respond to oxidative stress resulting from the interaction with cross-linking agents. Confirmation of either hypothesis awaits the cloning of genes defective in FA; some of the strategies to this end are discussed.","['Strathdee, C A', 'Buchwald, M']","['Strathdee CA', 'Buchwald M']","['Department of Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Repair', 'Fanconi Anemia/classification/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Female', 'Free Radicals', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Male', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Preleukemia/genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Transfection']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199205000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1992 May;14(2):177-85. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199205000-00015.,,,,,,85,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of Fanconi's anemia depends on increased chromosomal breakage in lymphocytes following treatment with a DNA cross-linking agent; patients have been identified who are clinically well and whose physical appearance is normal. Although bone marrow or cord blood transplants can be curative, treatment for the aplastic anemia usually depends on androgens. Close to 20 patients with Fanconi's anemia have delivered normal babies, and the mothers' hematologic status was not significantly adversely affected by the pregnancy. A few patients have clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in their bone marrow that do not necessarily indicate leukemic transformation, but further follow-up is important. Studies of in vitro erythropoiesis indicate a correlation between the clinical hematologic status and the presence of erythroid progenitors in the blood or bone marrow. Certain hematopoietic growth factors do increase growth in vitro, suggesting that new types of therapy may become available. Not every patient has a poor prognosis.

An update of the Ontario experience.,136-9,"The primary purpose of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of a protocol of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children. A prospective approach was adopted with an inception cohort of patients. Outcome measures were assessed on December 31, 1990. The study was conducted at two tertiary care centres (pediatric oncology programs) in Ontario, Canada. All children with ALL were eligible for study and consecutive recruitment took place between May 1984 and July 1987. They were classified at diagnosis into one of three categories for risk of relapse according to standardized criteria. Thirty-nine children were designated as having standard risk (SR), 31 as having high risk (HR), and 12 as having very high risk (VHR) disease. All patients are included in the analysis. Treatment was administered according to risk category-specific chemotherapy protocols, the details of which have been published. A distinguishing feature of these strategies is the intensive use of intramuscular L-asparaginase. Patients remained on these regimens for 2 years or until relapse or toxic death (events) ensued. Total and event-free survival data were determined by life-table analysis (Kaplan-Meier plots). With a minimum interval from diagnosis of 186 weeks and a median interval exceeding 5 years, the cumulative proportion of the entire cohort (C) surviving is 85% [95% confidence interval (CI), 77-93%]. For the respective risk groups, the corresponding proportions are SR 94% (95% CI, 87-100%), HR 74% (95% CI, 59-89%), and VHR 81% (95% CI, 59-100%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Barr, R D', 'DeVeber, L L', 'Pai, K M', 'Andrew, M', 'Halton, J', 'Cairney, A E', 'Whitton, A C']","['Barr RD', 'DeVeber LL', 'Pai KM', 'Andrew M', 'Halton J', 'Cairney AE', 'Whitton AC']","['Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DFCI 85-01 protocol', 'GAP-POMP regimen']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199205000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1992 May;14(2):136-9. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199205000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distribution and expression of DHFR both in human HeLa BU-25 cell line and in methotrexate-resistant (MTX-R) variant, deriving from the human VA2-B cell line (having the DHFR gene amplified) was studied by tetrazolium salt method and by flow cytometric analysis. The immunohistochemical labelling of DHFR was achieved by using the streptavidinbiotinilated complex technique. DHFR activity was low in the human HeLa BU-25 cell line, while it was very high in the MTX-R cell line; the activity level increased with the increasing concentration of the MTX.

The activity of cellular phospholipases leads to lipid metabolites such as eicosanoids, platelet activating factor, diacylglycerol, and inositolphosphates that are capable of mediating such pathological symptoms. The results presented here demonstrate that organic heavy metal compounds induce arachidonic acid liberation or its rearrangement within the lipid classes of HL-60 cells before a loss in viability can be detected. Four of the compounds tested, triethyllead (Et3Pb+), diethyllead (Et2Pb2+), trimethyllead (Me3Pb+), and trimethyltin (Me3Sn+), show a threshold concentration at which the viability of the cells is drastically decreased after 60 to 180 min incubation, whereas dibutyltin (But2Sn2+) induces a constant increase of cell death during the whole incubation time. In the case of threshold concentrations, the compounds stimulate a loss of arachidonic acid within the phospholipids and an increase of free fatty acid and eicosanoids before cell death could be detected. An important fact is the rearrangement of arachidonic acid within the lipid classes of these cells induced by metal concentrations that were not able to kill the cells within the given time. Primarily affected is phosphatidylethanolamine which loses arachidonic acid and, to a minor extent, phosphatidylcholine. Portions of the liberated fatty acid were then metabolized and/or shifted into neutral lipids and other phospholipids. All compounds tested show comparable effects, although at different concentrations. The toxicities of the compounds can be ordered as follows: Et3Pb+ greater than or equal to Et2Pb2+ greater than But2Sn2+ greater than or equal to Me3Pb+ much greater than Me3Sn+ greater than or equal to Pb2+. The cellular shape change following incubation with metal compounds is a further strong indication of a change in the membrane lipids. The cells lose their characteristic microvilli and/or blebs and become round without a loss in viability.","['Kafer, A', 'Zoltzer, H', 'Krug, H F']","['Kafer A', 'Zoltzer H', 'Krug HF']","['Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institute of Genetics and Toxicology, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Lipids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2P299V784P (Lead)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '7440-31-5 (Tin)']",IM,,"['Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Calcimycin/toxicity', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Lead/*toxicity', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lipids/analysis', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Tin/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0041-008x(92)90153-j [doi]'],ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1992 Sep;116(1):125-32. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(92)90153-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three resistant lines had reduced platinum accumulation compared with the sensitive line following exposure to each of the three drugs. There was no difference in the efflux of platinum between the sensitive and resistant lines indicating that reduced platinum accumulation was due to impaired uptake mechanisms. However, in cell survival experiments it was apparent that the resistant lines could tolerate higher intracellular platinum levels than the sensitive line. Intracellular GSH measurements revealed comparable levels in all but the L1210/carboplatin line which had a 2-fold elevation during the first 24 hours of culture. However, depletion of intracellular GSH with buthionin sulphoximine over a 72 hour period did not sensitize the resistant lines to the drugs. These studies have demonstrated that impaired platinum uptake is one of the mechanisms contributing to platinum drug resistance, while perturbations in GSH levels do not appear to play a role in these cell lines.","['Nicolson, M C', 'Orr, R M', ""O'Neill, C F"", 'Harrap, K R']","['Nicolson MC', 'Orr RM', ""O'Neill CF"", 'Harrap KR']","['Biochemical Pharmacology, Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carboplatin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Platinum/*pharmacokinetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1992;39(3):189-95.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In more than 60% of the mice, different leukemic clones populated tumors developed in different organs of the same animal.

Exposure of B1 cells to low concentrations of IL-6 abolished the leukemic cells ability to form colonies in semi-solid medium and slowed down their proliferation rate in suspension.

The induction of differentiation was specific to IL-6 since none of the other cytokines which inhibited B1 cell growth (IL-7, gamma IFN and TNF alpha) were able to induce myeloid or lymphoid differentiation in these cells. The IL-6-induced differentiation was completed over a two week period and was essentially irreversible.

In previously studied promonocytic leukemic cells induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus (called MML), the provirus has been invariably integrated upstream of exons 3 or 4 and the leukemic cells expressed aberrant RNAs with fused virus-myb sequences. Furthermore, Myb expressed by these cells has been shown to be truncated by 47 or 71 amino acids. The present report examines the mechanisms of myb activation in leukemias induced by two other retroviruses, amphotropic virus 4070A and Friend strain FB29 (the leukemias are called AMPH-ML and FB-ML, respectively). This study revealed two additional c-myb proviral insertion sites in these promonocytic leukemias. One FB-ML had a proviral integration in exon 9, and expressed a C-terminally truncated Myb protein of 47 kDa similar to that previously demonstrated to be expressed in the myelomonocytic cell lines NFS60 and VFL-2. However, a sequence of reverse-transcribed and amplified RNA from this leukemia demonstrated that the truncation involved a loss of 248 amino acids compared with a loss of 240 amino acids in the myelomonocytic cell lines. Another leukemia had a provirus integrated in the 5' end of c-myb upstream of exon 2 (in the first intron) and produced a Myb protein that was indistinguishable on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from normal Myb. This latter leukemia (FB-ML R1-4-10) expressed Myb with the smallest N-terminal truncation observed so far in promonocytic leukemias; translation begins at an ATG within c-myb exon 2, leading to loss of only 20 amino acids from the N terminus. Unlike the proteins produced in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced promonocytic leukemias (MML) that have larger truncations, this protein has an intact DNA binding region and does not contain N-terminal amino acids encoded by gag. However, this protein is similar to all N-terminally truncated Mybs so far studied, in that the truncation resulted in deletion of a casein kinase II phosphorylation site which has been proposed to be involved in regulation of DNA binding.","['Mukhopadhyaya, R', 'Wolff, L']","['Mukhopadhyaya R', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA', 'Female', 'Genes, gag', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proviruses/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Virus Integration']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.66.10.6035-6044.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1992 Oct;66(10):6035-44. doi: 10.1128/JVI.66.10.6035-6044.1992.,,,['J Virol 1993 May;67(5):2960'],"['c-myb', 'gag']",PMC241481,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined the effects of two potent platelet agonists, thrombin and the thromboxane A2 mimetic U46619 [(15S)-hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5Z, 13E-dienoic acid], on the developmental regulation of cultured CHRF-288-11 megakaryoblast cells. Both thrombin and U46619 increased intracellular free calcium in fura-2 loaded, serum-deprived CHRF-288-11 cells with EC50 values of 0.07 +/- 0.01 U/ml and 194 +/- 27 nM, respectively (n = 4 each). Thrombin, but not U46619, increased intracellular pH from 7.44 +/- 0.03 to 7.55 +/- 0.06 (n = 4, P = .012) in 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-loaded cells. Because increases in cytosolic free calcium and/or cytosolic pH are associated with mitogenic responses in many cell systems, we determined if thrombin or U46619 stimulated CHRF-288-11 proliferation or differentiation. U46619 (1 microM) inhibited cell growth but had no effect on cell size or morphology. In contrast, thrombin (0.2 U/ml) inhibited cell division and increased overall cell size to 116 +/- 2% of control (P less than .05). Microscopically, thrombin-treated cells had increased cytoplasmic content, nuclear lobulation and nucleolar content--hallmarks of megakaryocytic differentiation. Thrombin, but not U46619, increased levels of CHRF-288-11 c-fos and c-myc mRNA transcripts (protooncogene expression). We conclude that thrombin, but not thromboxane A2, induces terminal megakaryocytic differentiation of CHRF-288-11 cells. This suggests that thrombin may act as a physiologic regulator of platelet formation in vivo.","['Dorn, G W 2nd', 'Davis, M G']","['Dorn GW 2nd', 'Davis MG']","['Department of Medicine/Cardiology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic)', '0 (Vasoconstrictor Agents)', '57576-52-0 (Thromboxane A2)', '76898-47-0 (15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,,"['15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic/*pharmacology', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Thromboxane A2/*pharmacology', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/*pharmacology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1992 Sep;262(3):1242-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have conducted binding experiments with 125I-LIF on cultures of DRG to determine the receptor distribution for LIF on these cells and found that at least 60% of the sensory neurons in the cultures bound 125I-LIF, all of which could be eliminated by the addition of unlabeled LIF. The other cells in the culture, which morphologically appeared to be Schwann cells, did not bind appreciable quantities of 125I-LIF. In order to investigate whether LIF is retrogradely transported to sensory neurons in vivo, 125I-LIF was injected into the footpads and gastrocnemius muscles of newborn and adult mice, following sciatic nerve ligation. Radioactivity accumulated in the distal portion of the sciatic nerve, indicating retrograde transport of LIF. Subsequent experiments on mice with unligated sciatic nerves showed that 125I-LIF is specifically transported into the sensory neurons of the DRG. There was no apparent transport of 125I-LIF into motor neurons in the spinal cord. These experiments demonstrate that LIF can specifically bind to and be transported by sensory neurons and further support the idea that LIF acts as a target-derived neurotrophic factor, analogous to NGF.","['Hendry, I A', 'Murphy, M', 'Hilton, D J', 'Nicola, N A', 'Bartlett, P F']","['Hendry IA', 'Murphy M', 'Hilton DJ', 'Nicola NA', 'Bartlett PF']","['John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra A.C.T.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Biological Transport', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/*metabolism', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Neurons, Afferent/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sciatic Nerve/metabolism']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Neurosci. 1992 Sep;12(9):3427-34.,,,,,PMC6575741,,,,,,,,,,,

The National Institute of Health, U.S., has generated radio epidemiological tables giving probability of causation for various radiogenic cancers for the population of the U.S. In this paper, the probability of causation has been calculated for the Indian population using two models: (1) the original National Institute of Health model, and (2) direct use of Japanese constant relative risk coefficients for solid tumors. In both cases, new risk coefficients based on DS86 dosimetry and extended follow-up for 35 y have been used. Calculations with new coefficients, based on the National Institute of Health model have been extended to the American population and compared with the results for the Indian population. These values are generally higher for the Indian population than for Americans because of the lower baseline incidence rates in India.

In contrast to the reduced activity against L929 and MCF7 cells, neither binding to nor cytostatic activity against the human myeloid leukaemia cell lines HL60 and U937 are affected. This target cell type-dependent behaviour is probably due to the fact that L929 and MCF7 cells express different types of TNF receptor compared with myeloid leukaemia cells. While a mutation in position 127 decreases the overall activity of TNF-alpha, a deletion of four N-terminal amino acids does not reduce biological activity.

Searching DNA and protein databases revealed significant homology to a segment of the pol gene (reverse transcriptase) from various retroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis at both the DNA and the protein levels showed clustering of the fish sequences and the closest viral sequence was the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MoMuLV). Southern analysis indicated that there are several copies of the gene dispersed throughout the salmonid genome. 3.

The absolute amount of Prednisone was 5-10 mg, i. e. 0.5 mg/kg/day. In one of the two patients the cataract of one eye had to be operated. The patients should have dispensary examinations after one year and subsequently after six-month intervals in case of continuing corticosteroid treatment. An interesting finding was the observation of the incipient stage of PSC--a double dissociation in the area of the posterior ""Y"" seam.","['Krasny, J', 'Kozakova, V', 'Odehnal, M']","['Krasny J', 'Kozakova V', 'Odehnal M']","['Detska ocni klinika FN Motol a 2.

From a structural point of view, in the absence of heat treatment, the matrix lacked identifiable nucleolar remnants and the internal fibrogranular meshwork whereas a peripheral lamina was seen. On the contrary, the matrix obtained from heat exposed nuclei displayed very electrondense nucleolar remnants and an abundant inner network. These results were obtained irrespective of the type of extracting agent (2M NaCl or 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4) used to remove histones and other soluble proteins. The heat stabilization of the matrix could not be prevented by sulfhydryl blocking chemicals such as iodoacetamide and n-ethylmaleimide, thus suggesting that heat does not stabilize the matrix by inducing the formation of disulfide bonds. Only limited differences in the polypeptide pattern of matrix isolated under different conditions were seen using one-dimensional pore gradient polyacrylamide gels stained with both Coomassie Brilliant Blue and silver despite the fact that the matrix fraction from heat treated nuclei retained about three fold more protein in comparison with controls. The same results were obtained also by means of two-dimensional non-equilibrium gel electrophoresis.","['Martelli, A M', 'Falcieri, E', 'Gobbi, P', 'Manzoli, L', 'Cataldi, A', 'Rana, R A', 'Cocco, L']","['Martelli AM', 'Falcieri E', 'Gobbi P', 'Manzoli L', 'Cataldi A', 'Rana RA', 'Cocco L']","['Istituto di Anatomia Umana Normale, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int Rep,Cell biology international reports,7708050,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Reagents)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '8V1L8R19JH (Tetrathionic Acid)', 'SU46BAM238 (Ammonium Sulfate)']",IM,,"['Ammonium Sulfate', 'Animals', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Nucleolus/ultrastructure', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Nuclear Matrix/chemistry/*ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Sulfhydryl Reagents/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tetrathionic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0309-1651(06)80136-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Int Rep. 1992 Apr;16(4):307-17. doi: 10.1016/s0309-1651(06)80136-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The study group included 16 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 4 patients with malignant lymphoma. All were given intravenous and intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX) for central nervous system prophylaxis. Serial NMR studies were performed before and/or during induction-consolidation cycles. RESULTS: NMR imaging disclosed leukoencephalopathy in 8 of the 20 patients (40%) in the early stages of treatment. In six of the eight, the leukoencephalopathy was resolved after temporary or permanent interruption of IT MTX, and chemotherapy was completed successfully. The other two patients are being treated. Transient neurologic abnormalities developed in two of the eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: The possible causal relationship between leukoencephalopathy and the antimetabolic effects of MTX is discussed. This study clearly shows that NMR imaging is valuable in the early diagnosis and management of treatment-induced leukoencephalopathy.","['Asato, R', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Ito, M', 'Kubota, M', 'Okumura, R', 'Miki, Y', 'Konishi, J', 'Mikawa, H']","['Asato R', 'Akiyama Y', 'Ito M', 'Kubota M', 'Okumura R', 'Miki Y', 'Konishi J', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain Diseases/*chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Cerebral Cortex/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Prospective Studies']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19921001)70:7<1997::aid-cncr2820700732>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Oct 1;70(7):1997-2004. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19921001)70:7<1997::aid-cncr2820700732>3.0.co;2-g.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before BMT, the recipient was immune to HBV, with serum antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) and normal liver function. Examination of the recipient serum drawn 2 months after BMT revealed reverse seroconversion from anti-HBs/anti-HBe to HBsAg/HBeAg, which remained positive thereafter. Upon reducing cyclosporin 6 months after BMT, acute hepatitis occurred with HBV DNA in serum as evidence of active HBV replication; the patient then developed chronic hepatitis which progressed to cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation within 8 months. Transfusion of HBV DNA/HBeAg-positive bone marrow is thus harmful even when the recipient has anti-HBs prior to BMT.","['Fan, F S', 'Tzeng, C H', 'Yeh, H M', 'Chen, P M']","['Fan FS', 'Tzeng CH', 'Yeh HM', 'Chen PM']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Carrier State', 'Hepatitis B/*etiology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Serologic Tests', 'Tissue Donors']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Aug;10(2):189-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These CTL lines, which exhibited lysis of host normal lymphocytes and neoplastic cells, were analysed at the clonal level. Three functionally different types of clones were characterized: clones directed at host specific minor Histocompatibility (mH) antigens which are shared by patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and leukemic cells; clones recognizing only host PBL but not host leukemic cells; and putative GVL clones directed at patient's neoplastic cells only. These data could explain the long controversies on dissection of GVH and GVL activities.

Prophylaxis by T cell depletion is associated with increased rates of engraftment failure and leukemic relapse. Treatment with high-dose IL-2 can markedly protect lethally irradiated mice from GVHD-related mortality, especially when T cell-depleted (TCD) syngeneic bone marrow cells (BMC) are co-administered. In these IL-2-protected animals, allogeneic reconstitution is observed, and a graft-versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic T cells is preserved. To determine whether IL-2 might increase alloresistance under conditions in which alloengraftment is more difficult to achieve, we have now evaluated the possible effect of IL-2 on: (1) competitive repopulation of lethally irradiated mice by mixtures of TCD allogeneic and TCD syngeneic BMC; (2) radiation protection by TCD allogeneic BMC; (3) timing of hematologic recovery; and (4) allogeneic engraftment in sublethally irradiated recipients. The results show that IL-2 has only a limited and strain-restricted effect on alloengraftment. This effect may reflect activation of alloresistant host natural killer cells, a cell population which is not essential for the protective effect of IL-2 against GVHD.","['Sykes, M', 'Pearson, D A']","['Sykes M', 'Pearson DA']","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown 02129.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Platelet Count', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Aug;10(2):157-63.,['R01AI31158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phase I clinical trials with the agent are ongoing. In order to better define types of tumors with clinical sensitivity to Gemcitabine (to help target phase II trials), we have studied the antitumor effects of this agent against a variety of freshly explanted human tumor specimens using an in vitro capillary soft agar cloning system. Final concentrations of 2.0-200 micrograms/ml were used for short-term (1 h) and continuous incubations experiments. Using a short-term incubation, 94/215 (44%) tumor specimens were evaluable for the determination of antitumor activity. The most common tumor types studied included colorectal, breast, non-small cell lung, ovarian cancer, kidney and melanoma. A concentration-dependent increase in the frequency of inhibited tumor specimens was noted (2 micrograms/ml: 6/94 specimens, 20 micrograms/ml: 13/94 specimens, 200 micrograms/ml:33/94 specimens; p less than 0.0001).

We conclude that Gemcitabine is an active antitumor agent against tumor colony forming units from a variety of human malignancies if sufficiently high concentrations can be achieved. The agent should be evaluated for Phase II clinical activity against those tumor types.","['Hanauske, A R', 'Degen, D', 'Marshall, M H', 'Hilsenbeck, S G', 'Grindey, G B', 'Von Hoff, D D']","['Hanauske AR', 'Degen D', 'Marshall MH', 'Hilsenbeck SG', 'Grindey GB', 'Von Hoff DD']","['Technische Universitat Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '18771-50-1 (Tetrahydrouridine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Deamination', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tetrahydrouridine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001813-199204000-00012 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1992 Apr;3(2):143-6. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199204000-00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The modes of action of helenalin in L1210 cells are the inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses. This study confirms that thiol bearing enzymes of nucleic acid metabolism were significantly inhibited, e.g. DNA polymerase alpha, IMP hydrogenase, and ribonucleoside reductase. The addition of GSH to the reaction medium demonstrated total recovery of L1210 ribonucleoside reductase activity. Helenalin reduced cellular GSH levels in L1210 cells. Helenalin also reduced all four pool levels of d(NTP)s which would account for part of the observed inhibition of DNA synthesis. Reductions in the ribonucleotide pool levels were also generally evident after drug treatment. Thus, the sesquiterpene lactones appear to have more than one mode of action in L1210 cells.

Their expression was compared in NIH-3T3 cells, three human leukemia cell lines, and mouse bone marrow. The variant DHFR is readily expressed from these various promoters in retroviral vectors at a selectable level. In 3T3 cells, the DHFR constructs containing the SV40 promoter conferred the highest levels of resistance to MTX. In K562 and Raji cells, the construct with the TK promoter produced the highest level of resistance. However granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) colonies from mouse marrow were more resistant to MTX when infected with vectors containing the SV40 promoter and ADA promoter as compared to the other promoter constructs. These studies show that mouse fibroblast cell lines such as NIH-3T3 do not predict the effectiveness of retroviral-mediated gene transfer for marrow progenitor cells, and that the activity of retroviral vector-encoded promoters vary in an unpredictable manner from cell type to cell type.

The signaling events responsible for this response, however, remain unclear. The present studies have examined the effects of ionizing radiation on c-jun expression in a variant of HL-60 cells, designated HL-525, which is deficient in protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated signal transduction. The results demonstrate that these cells express low levels of PKC alpha and PKC beta transcripts and exhibit an attenuated induction of c-jun expression following treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In contrast, HL-525 cells respond to ionizing radiation with an increase in c-jun mRNA which is more pronounced than that in wild-type HL-60 cells. These cells similarly respond to ionizing radiation with increased expression of the jun-B, jun-D, c-fos, and fos-B genes. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that X-ray-induced c-jun expression in HL-525 cells is regulated by increases in the rate of c-jun gene transcription. Moreover, mRNA stability studies in irradiated HL-525 cells demonstrate that the half-life of c-jun transcripts is prolonged compared to that in wild-type cells. Studies with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an antioxidant, suggest that X-ray-induced transcriptional activation of the c-jun gene is mediated at least in part through the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs). In this context, H2O2 also induced c-jun expression in HL-525 cells, and this effect was inhibited by NAC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Datta, R', 'Hallahan, D E', 'Kharbanda, S M', 'Rubin, E', 'Sherman, M L', 'Huberman, E', 'Weichselbaum, R R', 'Kufe, D W']","['Datta R', 'Hallahan DE', 'Kharbanda SM', 'Rubin E', 'Sherman ML', 'Huberman E', 'Weichselbaum RR', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cesium Radioisotopes', 'Clone Cells', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gamma Rays', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Genes, fos/radiation effects', 'Genes, jun/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*radiation effects']",1992/09/08 00:00,1992/09/08 00:01,['1992/09/08 00:00'],"['1992/09/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/08 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00150a025 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 Sep 8;31(35):8300-6. doi: 10.1021/bi00150a025.,"['CA41068/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Biochemistry 1992 Oct 6;31(39):9512'],"['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'fosB', 'jn-D', 'jun-B']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) has been identified, isolated and cloned, which is most likely responsible for the calcium disturbances in HHM, PTHrP is a previously unrecognized hormone which has limited amino-terminal sequence homology with PTH and is the product of a separate gene. Tissue localization studies have identified PTHrP in squamous cell carcinomata, renal cortical carcinomata, in a proportion of breast cancers and in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In normal tissues, PTHrP has been immunohistochemically localized in keratinocytes, placenta and fetal parathyroid glands. In addition to its role in mediating hypercalcemia in cancer, PTHrP is likely to have an important endocrine role in the fetus, and perhaps a paracrine function in several organs.","['Martin, T J', 'Grill, V']","['Martin TJ', 'Grill V']","[""Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, St Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Vic., Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms/secondary', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*etiology/genetics', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*complications/genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone/genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/genetics']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0960-0760(92)90196-P [pii]', '10.1016/0960-0760(92)90196-p [doi]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 1992 Sep;43(1-3):123-9. doi: 10.1016/0960-0760(92)90196-p.,,,,['PTHrP'],,43,,,,,,,,,,

White blood cell counts (WBC) and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) are easily ascertainable parameters which might be expected to reflect plasma levels of chemotherapy. To determine whether WBC and ANC predict outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we did a multivariate analysis of means of these values during maintenance therapy in patients with ALL treated on a single protocol. Of the 52 patients, 15 (29%) relapsed. For those still disease-free, minimum time of follow-up is 7-8/12 years. During the first year of maintenance therapy, mean WBC (x 10(3)/mm3) in the relapsed and nonrelapsed groups were 4.5 +/- 0.9 and 3.9 +/- 0.7, respectively (p = 0.03); mean ANC (x 10(3)/mm3) were 3.0 +/- 0.9 and 2.5 +/- 0.6 (p = 0.05). However, the range of values was large with considerable overlap between the two groups. There was no obvious difference in distribution of values when confounding prognostic features were adjusted for in the analysis.

We retrospectively investigated the different role of home and hospital CVC management in development of CVC-related infections (CI) during different hematological conditions (presence or absence of neutropenia). Forty-nine percent of the children presented at least one CI, for a total of 109 episodes, during the 20,558 days a CVC remained in situ. CVC hospital management was safer and more reliable than CVC home management in both neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients. None of the CI was life threatening and only in 11% of the cases was it necessary to remove the catheter. Analysis of the microorganisms involved showed that they were mainly gram-positive with CVC home management and gram-negative with CVC hospital management. Careful evaluation of our retrospective survey study suggests that a better training of parents in the care of the CVC and more careful measures of asepsis in hospital could further decrease the incidence of CI, thus improving patients' quality of life.","['Rizzari, C', 'Palamone, G', 'Corbetta, A', 'Uderzo, C', 'Vigano, E F', 'Codecasa, G']","['Rizzari C', 'Palamone G', 'Corbetta A', 'Uderzo C', 'Vigano EF', 'Codecasa G']","['Pediatric Department, University of Milan, Ospedale Nuovo S.

During childhood, a dose of 0.3-0.6 units/kg body weight per week (or 14 units/m2 body surface area per week) is recommended, but during puberty the dose should be increased by 50-100%. The goal of therapy is the attainment of a normal final height, which in the past has often not been fulfilled. This was partly due to the inadequate supply of growth hormone. Since recombinant human growth hormone is now available in unlimited amounts, all patients can be treated continuously. The shorter the child is at time of presenting for therapy, the lower final height will be. It is mandatory to start therapy as early as possible. Concomitant hormonal deficiencies must be corrected by adequate therapy. Despite the fact that growth hormone is diabetogenic, supplementary therapy will not induce diabetes mellitus. Subtle changes in the immune system can be detected but no clinical correlates, such as increased susceptibility to infection, exist.

Neuropsychological performance of the groups treated without cranial radiotherapy was normal, but the group given cranial radiotherapy was significantly impaired. Mean reaction time and P300 latency were somewhat slower in the group given intrathecal chemotherapy relative to the group given no central nervous system treatment, but were significantly delayed in the group given cranial radiotherapy.

Leukaemic patients suffer from anaemia, coagulation disorders, and the consequences of immunosuppression. In addition, some patients show infiltrations of the oropharynx, potentially resulting in difficult intubation and/or pharyngeal haemorrhage. Mediastinal masses can induce complete airway obstruction during general anaesthesia. Patients with a white blood cell count (WBC) greater than 100,000/mm3 (hyperleukocytosis) can suffer from the leukostasis syndrome with acute respiratory failure as well as cerebral vascular occlusions and bleeding due to increased blood viscosity and disturbed microvascular perfusion. Since this syndrome may be triggered by surgery, the WBC should be reduced prior to general anaesthesia in patients with hyperleukocytosis. To avoid development of the leukostasis syndrome, transfusion of packed red cells should be restricted in these patients. Hyperleukocytosis can simulate in-vitro hypoxaemia due to the excessive oxygen consumption of the mass of leukaemic blood cells during routine blood gas analysis. Therapy of leukaemia can lead to the tumor-lysis syndrome with hyperuricaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, and hypoglycaemia, and may induce acute renal failure. Since drug interactions have only been evaluated for the combination of two or three drugs, interactions of cytotoxic agents with anaesthetics can hardly be predicted because of the large number of drugs simultaneously administered to leukaemic patients. The heart and lungs are target organs for the acute or chronic side effects of cytotoxic drugs, resulting in non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (e.g., cytosine-arabinoside), lung fibrosis (e.g., bleomycin), or arrhythmias and cardiac failure (e.g., adriamycin). The severity of these side effects depends on pre-existing organ disease and only in part on drug dosage. Only HLA- and CMV-compatible blood components should be administered to leukaemic patients. Hyperleukocytosis and the first days of cytotoxic treatment represent relative contraindications to general anaesthesia.","['Groeben, H', 'Heyll, A', 'Peters, J']","['Groeben H', 'Heyll A', 'Peters J']","['Abteilung fur Klinische Anasthesiologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Anaesthesist,Der Anaesthesist,0370525,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Airway Obstruction/etiology', '*Anesthesia, General', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/etiology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anaesthesist. 1992 Aug;41(8):438-47.,,Pathophysiologische und anasthesiologische Besonderheiten bei Patienten mit Leukamie.,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,

Results of the Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion Salvador Zubiran cooperative group].,63-9,"Up to now, the best treatment for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the induction of bone marrow hypoplasia by ablative combined chemotherapy; the prototype of these schedules is the so-called 7 + 3 (seven days of continuous infusion of cytarabine and three days of one-hour infusion of any anthracycline); these schedules require the support of both platelet transfusions and antibiotics. Other non-ablative schedules have also been tried in the treatment of such patients. Here we analyze the results of the treatment of 76 adult patients with AML; 43 were treated with the classical 7 + 3 schedule, whereas 33 were treated with a combination of chemotherapy used in non-ablative doses (TADOP: thioguanine, arabinosyl-citosine, doxorrubicin, vincristine and prednisone). The results were as follows, respectively, for 7 + 3 and TADOP: complete remission (CR) was achieved in 60 and 48% of patients (p NS); the number of cycles to achieve CR had a median of 1 and 5 months (p less than 0.001); the median duration of the CR was 21 and 10 months (p less than 0.05); fatal myelotoxicity was 30 and 42% (p NS), one-year disease free survival (DFS) was 45 and 46% (p NS) and three-year survival was 22% and 15% (p NS). Additionally, patients treated with 7 + 3 were divided into two groups according to the type of platelet transfusion support; those supported with apheresis equipment and those with centrifugation-derived platelets.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lobato-Mendizabal, E', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, G J', 'Labardini-Mendez, J', 'Gomez-Almaguer, D', 'Ganci-Cerrud, G', 'Lozano-de-la-Vega, A']","['Lobato-Mendizabal E', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Labardini-Mendez J', 'Gomez-Almaguer D', 'Ganci-Cerrud G', 'Lozano-de-la-Vega A']",['Hospital Universitario de Puebla.'],['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'POCAL protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 1992 Jan-Mar;44(1):63-9.,,Comparacion de dos esquemas de quimioterapia en la leucemia aguda mieloblastica del adulto.

It is known that HTLV-1 is associated to the adult T cell leukemia and to the spastic tropical paraparesis. AIDS is now a pandemic infection and HTLV-1 has a high endemicity in the Caribbean region and Japan, whereas the south of the United States has a low endemicity. In Mexico there is little information on HTLV-1 incidence. In the present work we looked for anti HTLV-1 antibodies in one hundred persons that belong to the high risks AIDS population in the city of Monterrey, Mexico. We found that 93 sera were positive for anti HIV antibodies in a ELISA test and seven were negative. All 93 sera were also positive in the Western Blot assay. In the confirmatory test two out of the seven negative sera were classified as indeterminate and five as negative. We also included in this study 50 sera from healthy control volunteers that did not belong to the high risk AIDS population and resulted negative in the HIV and HTLV-1 test. Anti HTLV-1 antibodies were determined by using an agglutination test with gelatin particles covered with HTLV-1 and confirmed by a Western Blot assay. We found that only three sera resulted positive in this agglutination test, but were negative by the Western Blot technique.","['Flores-Castaneda, M S', 'Salinas-Carmona, M C', 'Leal-Gonzalez, C', 'Yanez-Rodriguez, A', 'Trejo-Avila, L M']","['Flores-Castaneda MS', 'Salinas-Carmona MC', 'Leal-Gonzalez C', 'Yanez-Rodriguez A', 'Trejo-Avila LM']","['Departamento de Inmunologia, Facultad de Medicina y Hospital Universitario Dr. Jose E.

Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 22 out of 33 patients with doxorubicin (60 mg/m2; 1-3 days) and cytosine arabinoside (100 mg/m2; 1-7 days). All patients in CR entered into the authors' programme of intensification therapy consisting of two consecutive polychemotherapy cycles, using various combinations of amsacrine, doxorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, etoposide and 6-thioguanine repeated every 3-4 months. The mean survival so far is 18 months (range, 1-52 months). The projected 3-years survival rate in complete remission concerns 33% of the patients treated. Relapses occurred in 50% of the patients, within 10 months (range 1-35 mos.) after CR. Our results indicate that intensive cyclic polychemotherapy markedly prolongs the survival of AML patients. The high frequency of relapses during the first year after CR indicates the necessity to enhance the degree of aggressiveness of treatment shortly after a complete remission has been obtained.","['Hansz, J', 'Bajko, G', 'Wozny, T', 'Drozdowska, D']","['Hansz J', 'Bajko G', 'Wozny T', 'Drozdowska D']",['Klinika Hematologii Instytutu Chorob Wewnetrznych AM w Poznaniu.'],['pol'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amsacrine/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors']",1992/02/01 00:00,1992/02/01 00:01,['1992/02/01 00:00'],"['1992/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 1992 Feb;87(2):127-33.,,"Wyniki naprzemiennie powtarzanej oraz dlugotrwalej, intensywnej polichemioterapii w leczeniu podtrzymujcym remisje u chorych na ostre bialaczki szpikowe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The autonomously developing preimplantation embryo then becomes dependent on the maternal environment for its continued development. Little is known about the regulation of implantation, except that a complex interaction between peptide and steroid hormones synchronizes the preparation of the uterus for implantation with the development of the embryo. Whether the implantation event is under maternal or embryonic control is also unclear (reviewed in refs 1, 2). We have previously shown that a cytokine, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), is expressed in the uterine endometrial glands specifically on the fourth day of pregnancy. This burst of expression is under maternal control and always precedes implantation of the blastocyst. Here we report that transient expression of LIF in mice is essential for implantation. Females lacking a functional LIF gene are fertile, but their blastocysts fail to implant and do not develop. The blastocysts, however, are viable and, when transferred to wild-type pseudopregnant recipients, they can implant and develop to term.","['Stewart, C L', 'Kaspar, P', 'Brunet, L J', 'Bhatt, H', 'Gadi, I', 'Kontgen, F', 'Abbondanzo, S J']","['Stewart CL', 'Kaspar P', 'Brunet LJ', 'Bhatt H', 'Gadi I', 'Kontgen F', 'Abbondanzo SJ']","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, Nutley, New Jersey 07110.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,['Nature. 1992 Sep 3;359(6390):17.

The immunosuppressive activities were measured from high-molecular weight (greater than 5 kDa) fractions of testis extracts using the protectin bioassay. The presence of MHC antigens and leucocytes was studied using the indirect immunoperoxidase method. In the immature rats, clusters of class I MHC antigen positive cells and a few cells expressing class II MHC antigen were present in the testicular interstitium. In the sexually mature rats, all the cells were MHC I+, and MHC II+ cells were numerous in the testicular interstitium. The seminiferous epithelium was MHC-negative in both the immature and the sexually mature testis. W3/25+ leukocytes were present in the interstitium and the tubular wall in both the immature and the sexually mature rat testis, but not in the seminiferous epithelium at any age. At 20-30 days of age, the testicular extracts were neutral or slightly stimulated 3H-TdR incorporation into peripheral blood lymphocytes, but at 44-60 days of age they inhibited lymphocyte proliferation significantly. In gel filtration, a peak of immunosuppressive activity was observed at approximately 400 kDa (protectin A) in both 20- and 60-days-old rat testes. A smaller peak was present at approximately 200 kDa in both age groups. This study shows that the testicular immunoregulatory microenvironment is different in the immature and the sexually mature rats.

A randomized double-blind study in canine lymphoma.,230-4,"L-asparaginase is an enzyme that inhibits protein synthesis by the depletion of sources of L-asparagine, which is necessary for transformed lymphoid cells to proliferate. L-asparaginase is used in the treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A problem with L-asparaginase therapy is the immunogenicity of the enzyme and the development of anaphylactic reactions. Canine lymphoma is a predominantly B-cell tumor with widespread disease; without treatment, dogs with lymphoma usually survive 1-2 months. Canine lymphoma will respond to L-asparaginase therapy. A randomized double-blind study evaluated a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugate L-asparaginase combined with chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone). Thirty-five dogs were randomized to the PEG L-asparaginase group, and 34 dogs were randomized to the native L-asparaginase group. Thirty dogs (85.7%) achieved a complete remission (CR) with a median time to relapse of 217 days, and 32 (94.1%) dogs in the native L-asparaginase group achieved a CR with a median time to relapse of 214 days (P greater than 0.05). The asparaginase was well tolerated in both groups. Two dogs in the native L-asparaginase group had severe allergic reactions, and one dog in the PEG asparaginase group had a generalized urticarial reaction after repeated injections.

The second horse had enlarged peripheral lymph nodes, cool nonpainful pitting edema of the ventral thorax and cranial ventral abdomen, and a 3/5 holosystolic heart murmur. The diagnosis of CLL was based on increased blood lymphocyte counts and infiltration of marrow and other tissues by lymphocytes. In horse 1, the lymphocytosis persisted for 2 months between initial examination and death. The results of flow cytometric analysis on blood lymphocytes using anti-lymphocyte antibodies suggested that horse 1 had T-cell CLL, and horse 2 had B-cell CLL. In addition, the second horse had a monoclonal gammopathy (IgG), with light-chain proteinuria.","['Dascanio, J J', 'Zhang, C H', 'Antczak, D F', 'Blue, J T', 'Simmons, T R']","['Dascanio JJ', 'Zhang CH', 'Antczak DF', 'Blue JT', 'Simmons TR']","['Department of Clinical Sciences, New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Vet Intern Med,Journal of veterinary internal medicine,8708660,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/blood', 'Horse Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Horses', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/diagnosis/*veterinary', 'Leukocyte Count/veterinary', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1939-1676.1992.tb00343.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Intern Med. 1992 Jul-Aug;6(4):225-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-1676.1992.tb00343.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is manifested by jaundice and signs of portal hypertension and carries a mortality rate approaching 50%. There is no known treatment for the disease itself, although several recent reports suggest portacaval diversion may be effective in treating its sequelae. A 6.75-kg 8-month-old boy with VOD following bone marrow ablation and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) is presented. Over a 6-week period following bone marrow ablation he developed ascites refractory to diuretics, jaundice, and hematemasis with normal hepatocellular function. Splenectomy with a central splenorenal shunt was performed, which resulted in a significant reduction in portal pressures and complete resolution of his ascites and hematemasis without resultant encephalopathy. We propose that central end-to-side splenorenal shunting is an acceptable treatment for portal hypertension due to VOD and can be successfully performed in infants.","['Jacobson, B K', 'Kalayoglu, M']","['Jacobson BK', 'Kalayoglu M']","['Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/complications/etiology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Hypertension, Portal/etiology/*surgery', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Portal System/diagnostic imaging', 'Radiography', '*Splenorenal Shunt, Surgical']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-3468(92)90358-E [pii]', '10.1016/0022-3468(92)90358-e [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1992 Apr;27(4):531-3. doi: 10.1016/0022-3468(92)90358-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen had leukemia (ALL 10, AML 4). One each had rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. Active malignancy at diagnosis was noted in 10, 4 of whom had severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3). Of all the leukemics (2,794/6,099), abdominal pain during induction was a frequent complaint. The incidence of appendicitis, however, was low (0.5%). Nine of the 16 patients presented classically, facilitating prompt diagnosis and treatment. Six diagnoses were delayed. Three of these patients presented atypically with vague, nonlocalized pain, abdominal distention, lack of abdominal guarding, fever, dehydration, diarrhea, and unusual symptoms such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In each of these 6 patients the appendix was ruptured. Delays led to complications and deaths. Three patients required perioperative transfusions to treat excessive bleeding and two patients with ruptured appendicitis developed wound abscesses. Two patients died; in one, ruptured appendix was diagnosed only at autopsy. The other patient died of uncontrolled sepsis. Typhlitis occurring during induction chemotherapy may present similarly and is the main differential diagnosis. Typhlitis will usually improve with medical treatment alone. Nausea and vomiting (13/16), right lower quadrant pain (13/16), guarding (14/16), tachycardia (12/16), fever (10/16), and rebound tenderness (10/16) were the most frequent signs and symptoms of appendicitis. Persistent localized abdominal pain and guarding, lack of improvement with medical treatment, clinical deterioration, and the development of a mass were our indications for laparotomy.

Biologically active LIF is present in synovial fluids from patients with osteoarthritis and at higher titers in samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Cultured human synoviocytes and articular chondrocytes produced biologically active LIF and synthesized and secreted LIF proteins that migrated in SDS PAGE at approximately 43 kD. This was increased after stimulation with IL-1 beta. Chondrocytes in serum-containing cultures expressed the 4.2-kb LIF mRNA. IL-1 beta, LPS, and to a lesser extent tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced LIF gene expression. LIF autoinduced its mRNA and this provides evidence for an effect of this cytokine on function of joint tissue cells. Among a series of growth factors tested, transforming growth factor (TGF beta), including the isoforms TGF-beta1, TGF-beta 2, and TGF-beta 3, platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor induced this cytokine gene but differed with respect to the duration of their effects. Cultured synoviocytes expressed the LIF gene in response to the same set of peptide regulatory factors. Analysis of signal transduction pathways showed that PMA increased LIF mRNA, whereas calcium ionophore and cAMP had no detectable effects. Cycloheximide was a potent LIF mRNA inducer and dexamethasone inhibited LIF induced by PMA or IL-1 beta. Cartilage organ cultures and synovial tissues stimulated with IL-1 expressed high levels of LIF mRNA as demonstrated by in situ hybridization. These results identify LIF as a new cytokine that is produced by joint tissue cells and is overexpressed in arthritis. The induction of this cytokine by factors that are present during joint inflammation and the effects of LIF on connective tissue cells suggest that LIF is a mediator that can contribute to the pathogenesis of arthritis.","['Lotz, M', 'Moats, T', 'Villiger, P M']","['Lotz M', 'Moats T', 'Villiger PM']","['Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research in Aging, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,,"['Arthritis/*etiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cartilage/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Synovial Membrane/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115964 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Sep;90(3):888-96. doi: 10.1172/JCI115964.,"['AG07996/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR39799/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC329943,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of plasma membrane potential, inositol phosphates, cytosolic free [Ca2+], and filling state of intracellular Ca2+ stores.",830-9,"To study the mediation of Ca2+ influx by second messengers in myeloid cells, we have combined the whole-cell patch clamp technique with microfluorimetric measurements of [Ca2+]i. Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Indo-1, allowed to adhere to glass slides, and patch-clamped. Receptor agonists and Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitors were applied by superfusion and inositol phosphates by microperfusion through the patch pipette. In voltage-clamped cells, [Ca2+]i elevations with a sustained phase could be induced by (a) the chemoattractant receptor agonist FMLP, (b) the Ca(2+)-releasing second messenger myo-inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P3], as well as its nonmetabolizable analogues, and (c) the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid, which depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, responses to all stimuli were short-lasting, monophasic transients; however, subsequent addition of Ca2+ to the extracellular medium led to an immediate [Ca2+]i increase. In all cases, the sustained phase of the [Ca2+]i elevations could be inhibited by millimolar concentrations of extracellular Ni2+, and its amplitude could be decreased by depolarization of the plasma membrane. Thus, the sustained phase of the Ca2+ elevations was due to Ca2+ influx through a pathway sensitive to the electrical driving force and to Ni2+. No Ca2+ influx could be observed after (a) plasma membrane depolarization in resting cells, (b) an imposed [Ca2+]i transient independent of receptor activation, or (c) microperfusion of myo-inositol(1,3,4,5)tetrahisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4). Also, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 did not have additive effects when co-perfused with a submaximal concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Our results suggest that, in myeloid cells, activation of chemoattractant receptors induces an electrogenic, Ni(2+)-sensitive Ca2+ influx via generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3. Ins(1,4,5)P3 might activate Ca2+ influx directly, or by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, but not via [Ca2+]i increase or Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 generation.","['Demaurex, N', 'Schlegel, W', 'Varnai, P', 'Mayr, G', 'Lew, D P', 'Krause, K H']","['Demaurex N', 'Schlegel W', 'Varnai P', 'Mayr G', 'Lew DP', 'Krause KH']","['Infectious Diseases Division, University Hospital Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X9TLY4580Z (cyclopiazonic acid)']",IM,,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115958 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1992 Sep;90(3):830-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI115958.,,,,,PMC329937,,,,,,,,,,,

PMA-induced differentiation is characterized by (1) almost complete cessation of cellular proliferation, (2) expression of the megakaryocytic cell surface marker glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (gpIIIa), (3) increased secretion of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and (4) increased secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6). PMA-induced differentiation is dose-dependent with maximal activity seen at 10 nM PMA. In contrast, bryostatin (bryo), a structurally distinct protein kinase C (PKC) activator, fails to induce megakaryocytic differentiation or growth arrest at the concentrations tested (0.01-100 nM). Rather, bryo inhibits PMA-induced growth arrest and megakaryocytic differentiation in a dose-dependent fashion (full inhibition at 100 nM). The divergent biological effects of PMA and bryo correspond to the differential activation and translocation of PKC isotypes in K562 cells. PKC isotype analysis demonstrates that undifferentiated cells express both alpha and beta II PKC but no detectable beta I, gamma or epsilon PKC. Treatment of cells with either PMA or bryo leads to rapid translocation of both alpha and beta II PKC from the cytosol to the non-nuclear particulate fraction.

We have used antibodies specific to the unique carboxy-terminal domain of lamin A, i.e. distinct from the shared domains of lamins A and C, to study the individual behaviour of lamin A during establishment of a macrophage phenotype in human HL-60 cells. Lamin A was present as a nuclear cap in the majority of undifferentiated cells and it was redistributed to a full peripheral nuclear location very early after induction of differentiation by phorbol esters, even in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. Induction of the cells into a reversible precommitment state by bromodeoxyuridine was accompanied by a similar redistribution of lamin A that however reverted to a cap after removal of inducer. No changes were observed in the uniform peripheral nuclear location of lamin C under all of these conditions. These results strongly suggest that lamin A plays a role in the early events of cell differentiation. Taken together with previous results on the interaction of A-type lamins with chromatin, these findings offer experimental evidence consistent with the proposed role of A-type lamins, and particularly lamin A, in the process of chromatin reorganization that accompanies the expression of a differentiated phenotype.","['Collard, J F', 'Senecal, J L', 'Raymond, Y']","['Collard JF', 'Senecal JL', 'Raymond Y']","['Institut du Cancer de Montreal, Hopital Notre-Dame, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Vimentin)', '0 (lamin C)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Lamin Type A', 'Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1992 Mar;101 ( Pt 3):657-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, TGF-beta 1 enhances production of several extracellular matrix proteins both in vitro and in vivo, is chemotactic for monocytes, and alters the functioning of lymphocytes. We have examined the ability of TGF-beta 1 to affect the behavior of human THP-1 promonocytic leukemia cells, a cell line with the capacity to differentiate into macrophage-like cells. TGF-beta 1 reduces the growth rate of these cells, induces morphologic changes, and promotes adherence to culture surfaces. In addition, the adherent cell population expresses high levels of esterase activity, acquires the ability to ingest latex beads, and releases elevated levels of interleukin 1. TGF-beta 1-treated cells also express elevated levels of the beta 2 family of integrins. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-beta 1 is capable of promoting the maturation of promonocytic cells into macrophages. This outcome has implications at wound sites where TGF-beta 1 and a myriad of other factors interact with many cell types to facilitate healing.","['Bombara, C', 'Ignotz, R A']","['Bombara C', 'Ignotz RA']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,,"['Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages/cytology/*drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041530106 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 Oct;153(1):30-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041530106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During progression through the cell cycle, the amount of c-myb protein increased. The increase was commensurate with total cell size, thus preserving the relative abundance of c-myb protein present at the onset of the cell cycle. In HL-60 cells, the induced metabolic cascade leading to terminal myeloid or monocytic differentiation segregates into two steps occurring over two division cycles. Expression of c-myb did not diverge from the control until late in this metabolic cascade when it declined prior to onset of terminal differentiation. This course of expression was similar for both the retinoic acid induced myeloid or the 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D2 induced monocytic terminal differentiation of the cells. Bromodeoxyuridine, which induces proliferative arrest but not phenotypic differentiation of these cells, induced the same course of c-myb expression as the inducers of terminal differentiation. The same course of c-myb expression with growth arrest induced by these three different means is consistent with a potential proliferation regulatory role for c-myb in late but not early events leading to terminal differentiation. The dynamics of c-myb expression during this process were qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to the course of c-fos expression. Thus, taken with previous results, then amongst the nuclear oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, c-myc, RB, c-fos, and c-myb, only c-myc and RB expression exhibit early regulation during induced HL-60 cell differentiation.","['Yen, A', 'Samuel, V', 'Forbes, M']","['Yen A', 'Samuel V', 'Forbes M']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,,"['Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041530119 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1992 Oct;153(1):147-56. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041530119.,,,,['c-myb'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The samples were analyzed to determine their thorium content by x-ray fluorescence and by image analysis. In addition, Thorotrast was visualized in the different bones examined by light microscopy and by backscattered electron imaging with a scanning electron microscope. The results showed Thorotrast to be largely restricted to areas of cellular bone marrow. In such regions, Thorotrast was present throughout the marrow tissue and was also concentrated within cells that were commonly aggregated within focalized areas of the marrow. Overall the results suggest a rather uniform pattern of Thorotrast uptake by the red bone marrow at different skeletal sites. Significant deposits of Thorotrast were not found in fatty yellow marrow.

A number of the individuals exposed to radium also had alterations of the retinoblastoma gene while no such alterations were observed in any tissue DNA samples from this Thorotrast case.

Hydrolysis by cell enzymes and its effect on association have been analysed using protease inhibitors and non-hydrolysable enkephalin analogues. Results obtained confirm that hydrolysis of the pentapeptide is a prerequisite for association of the radiolabel to cells. The same results provide evidence of marked differences between enkephalin hydrolysis by whole cells and hydrolysis measured in the presence of resealed membranes, suggesting the existence in intact cells of proteolytic enzymes other than those bound to the membranes. The lack of reversibility of association and the intracellular localization of the radioactive label suggest that the association measured is prevailingly caused by internalization of a hydrolysis fragment, and not by binding to receptors. In order to determine the nature of the active fragment, association was measured in the presence of all four labelled N-terminal hydrolysis fragments of leu-enkephalin under conditions of nearly-total inhibition of proteolytic enzymes. Under these conditions, the label carried by Tyr, but not that carried by the other N-terminal fragments, was associated with cells. Free Tyr, furthermore, inhibits the association to cells of both labelled Tyr and leu-enkephalin. Data summarized above are consistent with the hypothesis that the radioactive label is taken up by the cells as Tyr, freed from the parent peptide by cell-related enzymes. The same data tend to exclude that a relevant fraction of the intact pentapeptide is bound to membrane receptors or that the radioactive label is carried into the cell by a N-terminal fragment other than Tyr.","['bongiorno, L', 'Urbani, A', 'Marini, M', 'Gilardi, E', 'Roda, L G']","['bongiorno L', 'Urbani A', 'Marini M', 'Gilardi E', 'Roda LG']","['Istituto per lo Studio delle Malattie Ereditarie e Carenziali, Cosenza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Enkephalins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '58822-25-6 (Enkephalin, Leucine)']",IM,,"['Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Enkephalin, Leucine/*metabolism', 'Enkephalins/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0192-0561(92)90126-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0192-0561(92)90126-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1992 May;14(4):643-53. doi: 10.1016/0192-0561(92)90126-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some 18,000 Americans die of leukemia each year, with acute leukemia account for half of these deaths. The etiology of acute leukemia is unknown, but current theories propose that the disease is caused by environmental factors acting on a genetically susceptible host. Acute leukemia occurs when a single hematopoietic precursor cell undergoes neoplastic transformation; autonomous proliferation of the leukemia clone continues until the patient dies of infection or bleeding. Acute leukemias are broadly classified as myelogenous and lymphocytic on the basis of cell lineage. Signs and symptoms are related to infiltration of the bone marrow by leukemic cells and the resultant failure of normal hematopoiesis. Therapy for acute myelogenous leukemia includes remission induction and consolidation with an array of antineoplastic agents. Allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation is the therapy of choice for eligible patients in the first complete remission. Neither low-dose maintenance therapy nor prophylaxis for CNS involvement is indicated. Therapy for acute lymphocytic leukemia includes induction, consolidation, maintenance, and CNS prophylaxis. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation should be reserved for standard-risk patients in second or subsequent complete remission and for high-risk patients in first remission.

Four of these patients showed trisomy 8 at the diagnosis of MDS, and the remaining one had trisomy 8 when the leukemia phase developed. The proportion of bone marrow (BM) cells with trisomy 8 in the four patients who showed trisomy 8 at MDS diagnosis fluctuated, and this fluctuation was not related to the percentage of blasts in the BM or to progression of the disease. However, in two patients, metaphase cells with trisomy 8 disappeared when their anemic state improved, although leuko-thrombocytopenia was still present, suggesting that the decrease in the number of BM cells with trisomy 8 reflects hematologic features in some MDS patients. These findings indicate that trisomy 8 in our MDS patients was possibly not the primary event in the genesis of the disease, and that there may have been competition between a normal karyotype clone and a trisomy-8-positive clone.

Firstly, failure of sustained engraftment; secondly, recurrence of the underlying malignancy. In patients with failure of sustained engraftment a trial of recombinant human GM-CSF is indicated first with a chance of improving blood counts in a significant proportion of patients. If this is unsuccessful a second transplant utilizing a preparative regime aimed primarily at further minimizing host immune competence such as a combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cyclophosphamide or ATG alone followed by a T-replete marrow infusion should be employed. A second marrow transplant can also be utilized for recurrence of the underlying haematological malignancy after first transplant. However, several large multi-institutional studies have now shown a striking difference in the long-term leukemia-free survival rate between those relapsing early (for example, less than six months) after the first transplant compared to those relapsing later after the first transplant. Leukemia-free survival post second transplant for those relapsing within six months of first transplant is less than 10%, whereas for those relapsing greater than six months from first transplant it is approximately 30%.

Giving radiation as a single dose rather than fractionating it increases both its immunosuppressive as well as its toxic effects. The relative anti-leukemic effects of single vs. fractionated irradiation are less clear, but available data support the view that fractionation does not substantially reduce the effects of TBI on myeloid tissue. Increasing the dose rate increases toxicities and, although data are not yet complete, likely increases both immunosuppressive and anti-tumor effects. The impact of total dose, dose fractionation and dose rate are highly interdependent and how best to manipulate these 3 factors to lead to an optimal combination is as yet unknown. Directing radiotherapy to sites of leukemia using monoclonal antibodies or other carriers such as growth factors is feasible and, although there are many aspects of this approach which have yet to be worked out, targeted radiotherapy may prove to be the best way to achieve the therapeutic goals of increased tumor ablation and immunosuppression without increased toxicities.","['Appelbaum, F R', 'Badger, C C', 'Bernstein, I D', 'Buckner, C D', 'Deeg, H J', 'Eary, J F', 'Matthews, D C', 'Press, O W', 'Storb, R', 'Thomas, E D']","['Appelbaum FR', 'Badger CC', 'Bernstein ID', 'Buckner CD', 'Deeg HJ', 'Eary JF', 'Matthews DC', 'Press OW', 'Storb R', 'Thomas ED']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992;10 Suppl 1:77-81.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,

Which of these therapies is best is controversial. Analyzing and comparing results of these therapies is complex and controversial. Comparisons of published data are flawed by biased reporting and subject selection. Randomized trials are also reported but are limited by small numbers of subjects and the question of whether their conclusions apply to most persons with AML. Hypotheses being tested in randomized trials are often misunderstood or relevant to only a subset of persons with AML. Furthermore, in many trials a substantial proportion of subjects do not receive the intended treatment. Observational data bases are also used to compare results of different AML therapies. Although this is probably the most effective analytic approach, substantial differences in outcome-related variable between treatment groups make complex statistical adjustment necessary. Validity of these adjustments is controversial. Limitations of these diverse approaches to comparing results of different therapies of AML suggests that a precise answer to the question of how best to treat AML is unlikely to be forthcoming. This uncertainty is further confounded by the considerable subjectivity that influences how physicians choose between alternative therapies. The net result of these considerations is a consensus approach to treating AML is unlikely to develop, probably because results of diverse treatments are not very different.","['Gale, R P', 'Butturini, A']","['Gale RP', 'Butturini A']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992;10 Suppl 1:25-9.,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,

IBMTR and EBMT/EULEP Study Group on Late Effects.,135-8,"Cancer may be serious late effect of marrow transplantation. Radiation, chemotherapy, immunosuppression and the original disease for which transplantation was performed may predispose to the development of cancer. 116 of 9732 patients reported to the IBMTR (International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry) have developed a new malignancy. Late effects were evaluated by the EBMT-EULEP (European Bone Marrow Transplant-European Late Effect Project) Late Effect Study Group in 147 patients surviving 6 years and 79 patients surviving more than 10 years. New malignancies developed in 11 of these patients. Lymphomas and leukemia comprised 73 cases reported to the IBMTR and one case reported to the EBMT-EULEP study. Tumors of the skin, oropharynx, vulva vagina and cervix prevailed in 41 patients with solid tumors. The distribution of malignancies is similar to that observed in organ transplant patients not given radiation or chemotherapy and suggests immunosuppression as a major contributory factor. In dogs the incidence of malignancies was studied after either chemotherapy or total body radiation in various regimens and marrow transplantation. Both chemotherapy and radiation shortened tumor-free survival in comparison to untreated dogs. Higher doses, larger fractions and shorter treatment schedules enhanced earlier tumor development. Soft tissue sarcomas and thyroid carcinoma were most frequent in treated, mammary carcinoma in untreated dogs. In treated dogs deaths from cancer were observed starting at the age of 5 years as compared to untreated dogs at the age of 9 years. The data from animal experiments indicate that the incidence of solid tumors in marrow transplant patients may still rise in the coming decades.","['Kolb, H J', 'Guenther, W', 'Duell, T', 'Socie, G', 'Schaeffer, E', 'Holler, E', 'Schumm, M', 'Horowitz, M M', 'Gale, R P', 'Fliedner, T M']","['Kolb HJ', 'Guenther W', 'Duell T', 'Socie G', 'Schaeffer E', 'Holler E', 'Schumm M', 'Horowitz MM', 'Gale RP', 'Fliedner TM']","['GSF-Forschungszentrum fuer Umwelt und Gesundheit, Universitaet Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/surgery', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Time Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992;10 Suppl 1:135-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, thromboxane has been shown to be related to host defence mechanisms. We studied the effects of nicotine and its major metabolites on thromboxane formation using cultured macrophage-like cells (HL-60), microsomal assays and purified thromboxane synthase. In intact cells, nicotine, cotinine and methylnicotine at submicromolar concentrations inhibited the rate of conversion of both arachidonic acid and the unstable endoperoxide prostaglandin H2 into thromboxane but not into other eicosanoids. This indicates that nicotine selectively inhibits thromboxane synthase at concentrations that are readily observed in the circulation of smokers. Microsomal assays revealed that nicotine decreased the maximal velocity of thromboxane synthase without affecting the apparent affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. In contrast, no effect of nicotine on kinetic parameters of prostaglandin H synthase or prostacyclin synthase could be observed. Difference spectra, using purified thromboxane synthase, revealed that nicotine directly interacts with the enzyme, presumably by binding the nitrogen of the nicotine ring structure to the iron of the cytochrome P-450 component of thromboxane synthase.","['Goerig, M', 'Ullrich, V', 'Schettler, G', 'Foltis, C', 'Habenicht, A']","['Goerig M', 'Ullrich V', 'Schettler G', 'Foltis C', 'Habenicht A']","['IV.

We now report that this factor, which we have named K562 inhibitory factor (K562-IF), has potent anti-inflammatory activity in mice, associated with an inhibition of PMN functions. Its in vitro actions were less marked with mouse PMN than with human PMN. They included (1) an inhibition of both nonstimulated locomotion and locomotion induced by FMLP or serum; (2) an inhibition of the chemiluminescence induced by opsonized zymosan, but not that induced by phorbol myristate acetate or FMLP; (3) an inhibition of the degranulation stimulated by opsonized zymosan, as reflected by lactoferrin and lysozyme release; and (4) a decrease in arachidonic acid release and leukotriene B4 production by A23187-stimulated PMN. The in vivo actions of K562-IF after intraperitoneal injection included (1) an inhibition of subcutaneous PMN accumulation at the site of injection of opsonized zymosan (PMN accumulated neither outside the vessels nor intravascularly, as shown by means of histochemistry); (2) an inhibition of neutrophil accumulation in the peritoneum of mice having received sodium caseinate or opsonized zymosan intraperitoneally; and (3) lysozyme concentration in neutrophils having reached the peritoneum after opsonized zymosan treatment equal to that in blood, suggesting diminished release. PMN influx and degranulation in the peritoneum were reduced by 50% after 3 hours of treatment with 1 microgram of K562-IF (equivalent to the effect of 120 micrograms of prednisolone).

The virus is suspect because a small percentage of patients with MF have antibodies to it, the cells of others harbor deleted HTLV-I proviral sequences, and particles resembling HTLV-I emerge in cultured blood lymphocytes obtained from most patients. An alternative possibility is that disparate lymphotropic retroviruses may infect or affect a population of epidermotropic lymphocytes, leading to the same outcome, ie, MF. In studies designed to identify the particles detected in lymphocyte cultures of nine patients with a diagnosis of skin involvement characteristic of MF, this concept has gained support. While the cells of four patients provided evidence of HTLV-I infection, molecular hybridization with HTLV-II-specific pol probes showed HTLV-II in the cells of another patient.

Six patients (33%) have had a complete disappearance of the Ph and two have had a partial response (less than 35% Ph+ metaphases). One patient has a decrease in Ph+ metaphases after 9 months of IFN. Five patients had no significant cytogenetic response after 9 to 12 months, and four developed clinical accelerated phase or blast crisis after 3 to 6 months on therapy. Of four patients with a sex marker, the Ph- population was of donor origin in three and of host origin in one. Clonal cytogenetic abnormalities other than Ph were present in 13 patients and did not predict for lack of response to IFN.

Thus, they would be likely candidates for purging remission marrows before autologous bone marrow transplant. One of the more promising agents is edelfosine, which could be safely used for purging without prolonging marrow recovery. Assays for marrow progenitor cells were performed before and after purging and cryopreservation in 64 patients. There was no significant reduction in colony formation after purging when compared with unpurged cryopreserved marrow, but there was a significant reduction after cryopreservation. Twenty-four patients with acute leukemia in second (16 patients) or third remission (3 patients), early relapse (3 patients), or in first remission with successfully treated extramedullary relapse (2 patients) received marrow-ablative chemotherapy and total body irradiation followed by infusion of marrow purged for 4 hours with 50 to 100 micrograms/mL of edelfosine.

Twenty-nine percent of the patients remain disease free from 131 to 1,291 days, with a median of 356 days.

It involves the rearrangement of two genes, PBX1 and E2A, resulting in the production of transforming chimeric DNA-binding proteins. In all previous reports in which the presence of a chimeric transcript was described, the fusion point between the coding sequences of E2A and PBX1 was found to be constant at the RNA level. We have used RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of E2A/PBX1 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in children with ALL at the time of diagnosis. Of 21 patients exhibiting this rearrangement, 3 (14%) expressed a variant E2A/PBX1 transcript in addition to the expected one. The relative amounts of the two chimeric mRNAs varied between the patients, but remained constant in the same patient during different stages of the disease. Sequence analysis showed an identical insertion of 27 bp at the E2A/PBX1 junction of the variant RNA species, the translation of which would result in the replacement of Val478 by 10 amino acids. The inserted sequence has not been detected in any other human transcript besides the variant E2A/PBX1 RNA species and probably represents a splicing variant of the chimeric RNA. We conclude that a subset of pediatric patients with ALL that carry the E2A/PBX1 rearrangement express two types of the chimeric mRNA. The biologic significance of this additional E2A/PBX1 transcript is discussed.","['Izraeli, S', 'Kovar, H', 'Gadner, H', 'Lion, T']","['Izraeli S', 'Kovar H', 'Gadner H', 'Lion T']","[""Children's Cancer Research Insitute, St Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67562-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 15;80(6):1413-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define further the prevalence of this abnormality in multiple myeloma, we studied a series of 17 patients with this disease with concomitant chromosome analysis and Southern blotting, using a probe specific for the major translocation cluster of the BCL-1 oncogene which is located at chromosome 11q13. Karyotype analysis of 14 evaluable patients revealed three cases with abnormalities of chromosome 11q13, two of them with t(11;14)(q13;q32) and one with del (11)(q13). Southern blot analysis showed no rearrangements in BclI and HindIII digests of DNA from 17 patients including the three patients with anomaly of chromosome 11q13, using a BCL-1 specific probe. A possible restriction length polymorphism was detected in EcoRI cut DNA of five out of 11 patients studied. Therefore the chromosomal break point in our cases with abnormality of chromosome 11q13 must lie outside the major translocation cluster of the BCL-1 gene. However, in centrocytic lymphoma rearrangement of the BCL-1 oncogene has been detected in up to 50% of cases.

Vacuoles were positively associated with a low WBC, age range 1-6 years and blast cell positivity for CD10, but their benign influence was apparent even when these variables were taken into account. 'Hand-mirror' (HM) cells were only studied in UKALL X, and were noted in 316/1402 (23%) children. There appeared to be an inverse correlation between HM cells and cytoplasmic vacuoles and a weak association with T-cell immunophenotype, but no prognostic significance was evident. FAB classification appears to be of less prognostic importance than has previously been supposed, though L2 disease is more resistant to current remission induction regimens. Hand-mirror cells may be more common in T-ALL, but are seen in all types and are not related to prognosis. Cytoplasmic vacuoles are predictive of a good response to current therapeutic schedules even allowing for other prognostic variables, and are the single most important morphological feature relating to prognosis in childhood ALL.","['Lilleyman, J S', 'Hann, I M', 'Stevens, R F', 'Richards, S M', 'Eden, O B', 'Chessells, J M', 'Bailey, C C']","['Lilleyman JS', 'Hann IM', 'Stevens RF', 'Richards SM', 'Eden OB', 'Chessells JM', 'Bailey CC']","[""Department of Haematology, Children's Hospital, Sheffield.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Vacuoles/ultrastructure']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08170.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 May;81(1):52-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08170.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, dyserythropoietic changes had a similar incidence in both groups. When compared with the clinical features at initial diagnosis in AML cases, the dysmegakaryocytic changes in remission marrow were found to be significantly more frequent in patients with monocytic involvement (mainly M4) or trilineage myelodysplasia (T-MDS AML). Disease-free survival was significantly shorter in patients with micromegakaryocytes (P less than 0.05) or neutrophils with hypogsegmented nuclei (P less than 0.05) than in those without these features. Overall survival was also significantly shorter in patients with micromegakaryocytes (P less than 0.05). These findings may help in developing new strategies for the post-remission therapy of AML, and also suggest that myelodysplastic changes in the remission marrow of de novo AML patients may be related to haematopoietic recovery by a preleukaemic clone which eventually leads to early leukaemic relapse. Dysplastic marrow, however, was not necessarily associated with peripheral pancytopenia in the present series, warranting basic research on such putative clonal remissions.","['Nagai, K', 'Matsuo, T', 'Atogami, S', 'Moriuchi, Y', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Nagai K', 'Matsuo T', 'Atogami S', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Yoshida Y', 'Kuriyama K', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Haematology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1992/05/01 00:00,1992/05/01 00:01,['1992/05/01 00:00'],"['1992/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08167.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1992 May;81(1):33-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1992.tb08167.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geometric mean (SD) serum immunoreactive erythropoietin (SiEp) concentrations (17.7 (1.3) U/l) for the whole group of infants were similar to those of normal adults (17.4 (4.7) U/l) despite considerably reduced haemoglobin values.

However, until recently, studies about response to treatment and toxicities in the elderly patients have been quite limited. Many of clinical trials have excluded elderly patients with advanced cancer. In leukemia and Hodgkin's lymphoma, definite trends of decreased levels of response and survival in relationship to increased age have been reported. This reduced rates of response in elderly leukemia patients do not appear to be due to chemotherapy resistance but rather to high rates of death among elderly patients during remission induction therapy or to inadequate salvage therapy. On the other hand, older patients with solid cancers can be treated with chemotherapy as successfully as younger patients. General expectations of response, remission, and survival are similar for the older and younger patients. With the exception of small increase in the incidence of hematologic toxicity in the older group, both younger and older patients experience the same frequency of toxic reactions. Aging is a highly individualized process that cannot be defined by chronological landmarks. Therefore, it can be said that there is no reason to exclude from adequate chemotherapy, simply on the basis of age alone.

Presuming that this might reflect its physiologic role during embryogenesis, we have examined LIF expression in the embryonic environment by RNase protection assays and have determined its in vitro effect on differentiating embryonic stem cell embryoid bodies. Of all adult tissues analyzed, LIF transcripts appear only in the uterus, where their level fluctuates with the estrous cycle, peaking after ovulation. LIF expression continues in the uteri of pregnant and pseudopregnant females, with a relative peak when blastocysts are normally present. As for its effects on in vitro differentiation, we have found that LIF blocks embryoid body differentiation only partially, yet in a precise manner. Using molecular markers to follow the differentiation of defined cell types, we demonstrate that LIF selectively inhibits the formation of primitive ectoderm, while permitting the differentiation of primitive endoderm. These results suggest a specific role for LIF in preimplantation mouse development.","['Shen, M M', 'Leder, P']","['Shen MM', 'Leder P']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Ectogenesis', '*Embryonic Development', 'Endoderm/cytology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro Techniques', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice/embryology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.17.8240 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Sep 1;89(17):8240-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.17.8240.,,,,"['Fgf-5', 'H19', 'LIF', 'Oct-3', 'REX-1']",PMC49893,,,,,,,,,,,

They belonged to 80 unrelated families, and in 11 of them C1-INH was functionally deficient but antigenically normal (type II HAE). Genetic analysis of type 1 families demonstrated restriction fragment length polymorphisms in 11% and abnormal mRNAs in 25%. In type II families, the site of the mutation appeared to determine the rate of catabolism of the dysfunctional C1-INH and its antigenic plasma levels. Clinical symptoms (subcutaneous and mucous swellings) generally first appeared within the second decade of life. The frequency of symptoms was highly variable from patient to patient, but a few patients remained asymptomatic throughout their lives. Prophylactic treatment with attenuated androgens was administered to 59 patients and was totally effective in 57, without significant side effects. Sixty-seven laryngeal and 15 abdominal attacks were treated with C1-INH plasma concentrate, yielding initial regression of symptoms in 30 to 90 minutes. The acquired deficiency of C1-INH, also known as acquired angioedema, was diagnosed in 9 patients.

Initial growth of the cells was dependent on the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. Following initial outgrowth the cells were maintained by transfer onto non-autocthonous bone marrow stromal cultures. Following approximately one year of continuous growth, a subline was derived which could be grown independently of feeder cells. These stromal-cell-independent myeloma cells nevertheless retained dependence for a growth factor present in stromal-cell-conditioned media. The relevant factor in the conditioned media was determined to be interleukin-6 (IL-6). The cells also ultimately became independent of the conditioned media. These latter cells were shown to contain mRNA for IL-6 and eventually began to secrete IL-6. This cell line has thus progressed from complete dependence on stromal cells to IL-6-dependent growth in the absence of stromal cells to complete self sufficient growth.

Our results show that c-jun mRNA is not detected at any time in untreated and DMSO-treated F-MELC. In contrast, DMSO-induced differentiation of F-MELC is associated with an early and transient induction of c-fos and junB mRNAs by 2 to 8 h treatment while in presence of dexamethasone, an inhibitor of F-MELC commitment, c-fos mRNA is not detected and junB mRNA remains at basal levels. junD mRNA is detected at low levels in untreated F-MELC and remains unchanged during DMSO treatment. Furthermore, DMSO treatment in a F-MELC cell line resistant to DMSO-differentiation does not result in an early induction of c-fos and junB mRNAs. Taken together, these results indicate that the DMSO-induced F-MELC differentiation is accompanied by an early co-induction of c-fos and junB during the latent period preceding the commitment to erythroid maturation.","['Francastel, C', 'Mazouzi, Z', 'Robert-Lezenes, J']","['Francastel C', 'Mazouzi Z', 'Robert-Lezenes J']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, ICIG, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, fos', '*Genes, jun', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/physiology', 'Reaction Time', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1992 Sep;6(9):935-9.,,,,"['c-fos', 'junB', 'junD']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The first is induction therapy to effectively reduce the patient's leukemia burden and allow for recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Once this is achieved and the patient enters a complete remission, further potentially curative post-remission therapy can be administered. Induction therapy has not changed significantly over the past two decades, relying primarily on conventional-dose cytarabine and an anthracycline combination. Post-remission therapy, on the other hand, has changed with the introduction of more intensive and aggressive cytoreductive treatment as well as utilization of myeloablative regimens followed by either allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The scope of this review is to evaluate the different curative post-remission treatment approaches for adult patients with AML. Discussions will focus on younger patients (less than 65 years) with responsive disease who enter a complete remission and then have post-remission therapy options available to them. Often, decisions concerning post-remission therapies are based solely on age and the availability of compatible donors; however, since understanding of the biology of leukemia has expanded and treatment strategies have improved, our ability to recommend particular treatment approaches has also evolved.

Long-term cultures of CML cells with or without irradiated normal marrow feeder layers were initiated from peripheral blood cells of CML patients with high white blood cell counts. Three weeks later the effect of exogenously added transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) on progenitor cycling status was examined. A single addition of 5 ng/ml TGF-beta 1 was able to reversibly arrest the otherwise uninterrupted turnover of primitive leukemic erythroid and granulopoietic progenitors for a period of up to 7 days both in the presence and absence of a normal adherent cell population. When TGF-beta 1 was incorporated into methylcellulose cultures, its ability to inhibit colony formation by CML progenitors showed the same differential activity on primitive cell types exhibited by normal progenitors. Dose-response curves for analogous populations of normal and leukemic cells were indistinguishable. Increasing the concentration of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in methylcellulose colony assays decreased the sensitivity displayed by normal clonogenic cells to TGF-beta 1 and no differences were detectable when CML cells were used in such regulator competition experiments. These findings support a general model of primitive hematopoietic cell regulation in which entry into S-phase is determined at the intracellular level by multiple convergent pathways that may deliver either positive or negative signals from activated cell surface receptors for distinct extracellular factors. The present study shows for the first time that primitive CML progenitors exposed to TGF-beta 1 in vitro can be transiently blocked in a noncycling state for several days without loss of viability and that the mechanisms responsible for the emergence and maintenance of a clonal population of CML cells in vivo do not appear to involve changes in their sensitivity to TGF-beta 1. It is thus unlikely that the heightened proliferative activity exhibited by primitive CML progenitors both in vivo and in long-term culture can be explained by an abnormality in the intracellular mechanisms normally activated by TGF-beta 1 receptor-ligand binding. We suggest that primitive CML cells are either defective in their ability to see (or activate) endogenously produced TGF-beta 1, or are defective in their responsiveness to another, undefined, regulator.","['Cashman, J D', 'Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J']","['Cashman JD', 'Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, B.C.

Treatment according to the ALL/NHL-BFM 90 protocol I (induction phase) caused multiple and severe coagulation changes in all 14 patients of our study. Glucocorticoids alone made Fibrinogen drop to 148 mg/dl, AT III and Protein C rise to 136% or even 179% respectively. After day 12, immediately following the start of therapy with Coli-Asparaginase (ASP), fibrinogen continued to drop to reach its lowest average value of 46 mg/dl on day 24. Anticoagulant factors like plasminogen (lowest average value: 36%), AT III (47%) and Protein C (93%) dropped abruptly. These alterations were reversed after discontinuation of Glucocorticoids and ASP. During consolidation (protocol II) similar alterations are observed as in protocol I when Glucocorticoids are applied alone. However, after Erwinia-ASP there is no fall in AT III, plasminogen, and Protein C as is observed in protocol I with Coli-ASP. 2. Severe hemorrhages or thromboses are uncommon as compared to the degree of coagulation changes which can be regularly observed. Complications occur more often in girls. Most of them are seen during the 2nd or 3rd week of simultaneous ASP-Glucocorticoid therapy. 3. To avoid twofold alteration of hemostasis it should be considered to apply Glucocorticoids and ASP separately and to replace Coli-ASP by Erwinia-ASP. The efficacy of prophylactic replacement of decreased coagulation factors has not yet been confirmed. Immunologic and infectious side effects have to be taken into consideration. 4. More definite recommendations can be given when each suspected bleeding and/or thrombosis is confirmed by imaging procedures, when it is documented and registered, and when coagulation studies are performed during the critical phase.","['Sutor, A H', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Sauter, S', 'Witt, I', 'Kaufmehl, K', 'Rombach, A', 'Brandis, M', 'Riehm, H']","['Sutor AH', 'Niemeyer C', 'Sauter S', 'Witt I', 'Kaufmehl K', 'Rombach A', 'Brandis M', 'Riehm H']",['Universitats-Kinderklinik Freiburg.'],['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Protein C)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antithrombin III/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Hemorrhage/blood/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Plasminogen/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Protein C/metabolism', 'Thrombosis/blood/*chemically induced', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1025358 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1992 Jul-Aug;204(4):264-73. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1025358.,,Gerinnungsveranderungen bei Behandlung mit den Protokollen ALL-BFM-90 und NHL-BFM-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probabilities for event-free survival (EFS) and event-free interval (EFI) of 5 years were: .45 (SD .04) and .57 (SD .05). In the first 2.5 years of the study irradiation was randomized (n = 31), selected or refused (n = 24). However, during this period irradiation was mandatory in patients with leukocyte count greater than 70,000/mm3, and also in children with initial CNS involvement. Since July 1989 prophylactic cranial irradiation was abandoned. Patients of the group with mandatory irradiation (n = 39) presented with more unfavourable risk parameters than the group of non-irradiated children, who were enrolled in the study after randomisation had been stopped. Nevertheless, results showed in randomized and selected patient groups as well as in the total cohort a longer relapse-free interval (RFI) in irradiated (n = 66) compared to non-irradiated (n = 94) patients (RFI of 5 years: .70, SD .04 vs. .51, SD .07, p less than .05). Relapses in non-irradiated children occurred mainly in the bone marrow and less often in the CNS. The increase in relapse rate was seen especially in non-irradiated patients of the low risk group as defined in study AML-BFM-83 (RFI: .40, SD .14 vs. .79, SD .09 with irradiation, p less than .01). In the high risk group, however, the differences were not significant. Our results suggest that cranial irradiation is an important part of therapy in childhood AML, and that the good prognosis of the low risk group in study AML-BFM-83 was probably based on the combination of intensive chemotherapy and cranial irradiation.","['Creutzig, U', 'Ritter, J', 'Heyen, P', 'Berthold, F', 'Henze, G', 'Kabisch, H', 'Lampert, F', 'Niethammer, D', 'Riehm, H', 'Schellong, G']","['Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Heyen P', 'Berthold F', 'Henze G', 'Kabisch H', 'Lampert F', 'Niethammer D', 'Riehm H', 'Schellong G']","['Universitats-Kinderkliniken, Munster.']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1025354 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1992 Jul-Aug;204(4):236-45. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1025354.,,Einfluss der Schadelbestrahlung auf die Rezidivrate bei Kindern mit akuter myeloischer Leukamie.

Results in 213 patients of the COALL-85 study].,230-5,"Dose intensity (DI) plays an important role in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. The individual DI within a protocol may vary considerably and thus may be an important prognostic factor. In 213/305 patients treated in the cooperative study COALL-85 for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia the following parameters of individual therapy intensity were analyzed: Total time for intensive treatment, cumulative doses of single drugs, mean relative dose (= relation between received and prescribed doses of all drugs), mean relative dose intensity ( = mean relative dose/time) as well as frequency and duration of leukocytopenia. Therapy for LR (low-risk) and HR (high-risk) patients were separately analyzed by both life-table method and multivariate regression analysis. Neither length of time, mean relative dose intensity nor the other parameters had any significant influence on prognosis within the HR protocol. The only significant prognostic factor was the remission status on day 28 (p less than 0.001 in multivariate analysis). In contrast patients treated with the LR protocol had significantly fewer relapses if treatment resulted in leukocytopenic episodes (probability for event free survival (EFS) = 0.76 in patients with one or two leukocytopenic episodes compared to 0.52 in patients with none). Patients with a mean relative dose greater than 0.9 showed a higher EFS of borderline significance than patients with mean relative dose less than = 0.9 (0.72 vs 0.49, p = 0.09).

Patients with B-ALL were excluded. From 1981 to 1987 524 patients were entered into the randomized multicenter study ALL VII/81 (modified ALL-BFM 81 protocol). Patients were divided into three risk groups standard (SR), medium (MR), high risk (HR) using the BFM risk factor. In a connecting study from 1988 to 1991 294 patients were registered on the stratified and randomized multicentric trial ALL VIII/87 (modified ALL-BFM 86 study). The main modification in study ALL VII/81 concerned the duration of treatment. Patients were randomized into two groups. The first group received as a late reinduction protocol III and then therapy was stopped. The second group received 6-MP and MTX for another six months. The other whole treatment strategy of ALL-BFM 81 was adopted. In protocol ALL VIII/87 the only modification was the reduction of the MTX dosage from 5 g/m2 to 1 g/m2 with an infusion time of 24 hours (leucovorin rescue 15 mg/m2 after 48 and 54 hours). The probability of the event-free-survival (EFS) for study ALL VII/81 was 59%.

The DCF Study Group.,164-71,"YK-176 is a newly isolated 2'-deoxycoformycin (DCF), a potent inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, produced by Aspergillus nidulans. In a cooperative phase I study, YK-176 was administered to 22 patients, comprising 18 with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), two with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), one with lymphoblastic lymphoma of T-cell type and one with carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Doses of YK-176 ranged from 3.0 to 9.0 mg/m2 and were given intravenously for three consecutive days. General malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting and low grade fever were frequently encountered, but were transient and not dose-related. At all dose levels hematological toxicities were mild. Two of seven patients receiving 7.0 mg/m2 for three consecutive days developed hepatocellular enzyme elevations (grade 2) and one patient, proteinuria (grade 2). One of two patients given 9.0 mg/m2 for three consecutive days manifested a life-threatening (grade 4) disturbance of consciousness and dyspnea, presumably ascribable to the drug-related toxicity of YK-176. The results suggest that 7.0 mg/m2 i.v. for three consecutive days is the maximum acceptable dose of YK-176. Central nervous system, pulmonary and possibly renal toxicities appeared to be dose-limiting. Out of the 20 patients evaluable for therapeutic response, partial remissions were observed in four, three with ATL and one with CTCL, who received less than 7.0 mg/m2 for three consecutive days. We conclude that YK-176 is an active agent against ATL at doses that may not be associated with prohibitive toxicity. A starting dose of 5.0 mg/m2 for three consecutive days is recommended for further phase II studies on ATL.","['Tobinai, K', 'Shimoyama, M', 'Inoue, S', 'Takayasu, S', 'Mikuni, C', 'Kozuru, M', 'Oda, S', 'Nakajima, H']","['Tobinai K', 'Shimoyama M', 'Inoue S', 'Takayasu S', 'Mikuni C', 'Kozuru M', 'Oda S', 'Nakajima H']","['Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Appetite/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Pentostatin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1992 Jun;22(3):164-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, overexpression of PRAD1 gene has been reported to be correlated closely with the rearrangement of bcl-1 locus, particularly in centrocytic lymphoma. In our study, overexpression of PRAD1 gene was shown in five B cell lines with t(11;14)(q13;q32) including one centrocytic lymphoma line and 4 myeloma lines, when compared with other hematopoietic cell lines without translocation. One of the cell lines, SP-49, demonstrated a truncated mRNA of 3.4 kb, in addition to 1.7 kb of normal size. Southern blot analysis demonstrated a rearrangement with PRAD1 cDNA probe, suggesting that the gene is altered in this particular cell line. By cloning analysis, we confirmed that 1.8 kb deletion in 3' region of PRAD1 gene eliminating the destabilizing signal of PRAD1 mRNA, gave rise to the aberrant mRNA of 3.4 kb. These findings suggest that PRAD1 gene is most likely the candidate oncogene for bcl-1 activated by t(11; 14)(q13;q32) translocation.

The diversity in the variable region of T-cell receptors results from germ line diversity of V, (D), and J sequences, combinatorial joining of the segments, junctional diversity leading to codon changes at the end of gene segments, N-region diversity arising from addition of template independent nucleotides at junction. Each T-cell clone has its own unique structure of the variable region, and in T-cell malignancies, this variable region is retained after malignant transformation. This enables the nucleotide sequences of the variable region genes to be used as a molecular marker for the malignant clone. By amplification of these sequences of variable genes, it is now possible to study the pathological features of the leukemic clones in vivo, as well as to follow the patients for minimal residual disease.","['Mizutani, S']",['Mizutani S'],,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

Compounds of remarkably similar structure, but with differing patterns of sulfonic acid group substitutions, had a wide range of potency in inhibiting HIV-1. Chicago sky blue (CSB) was highly effective in the inhibition of HIV-1 with less toxicity to CEM-SS cells than most of the other sulfonated dyes tested. Synthesis of CSB was undertaken to produce a product greater than 98% pure and this compound was used to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which this class of structurally related compounds inhibits HIV-1. Addition of CSB to cells infected at high multiplicity at any time up to 24 h after infection, unlike dideoxycytidine (ddC) or oxathiin carboxanilide (OC), inhibited HIV-1-induced cell killing. Other postinfection time course studies revealed that CSB had to be present for 24 h or longer immediately after infection to be protective. Virus binding to cells occurred in the presence of CSB, but the requirement for virion envelope-cell membrane fusion was delayed. CSB was a potent inhibitor of the reverse transcriptase (RT) of both HIV-1 and HIV-2, although it was less active against HIV-2 in a cell killing-based assay. CSB also inhibited Rauscher and LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses. CSB appears to disrupt the interaction between viral proteins and cell membranes, both in the fusion step early in the infection cycle and in the development of syncytia in the late stages of virus infection.","['Clanton, D J', 'Moran, R A', 'McMahon, J B', 'Weislow, O S', 'Buckheit, R W Jr', 'Hollingshead, M G', 'Ciminale, V', 'Felber, B K', 'Pavlakis, G N', 'Bader, J P']","['Clanton DJ', 'Moran RA', 'McMahon JB', 'Weislow OS', 'Buckheit RW Jr', 'Hollingshead MG', 'Ciminale V', 'Felber BK', 'Pavlakis GN', 'Bader JP']","['Antiviral Evaluation Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988),Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,8812597,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Sulfonic Acids)']",IM,,"['Antiviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Azo Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Coloring Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Giant Cells/microbiology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Sulfonic Acids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1992/01/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/01/11 19:15'],"['1992/01/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/01/11 19:15 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr (1988). 1992;5(8):771-81.,['N01 CM-87274/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to either 4-epi-doxorubicin plus cisplatin or 4-epi-doxorubicin alone. An additional 203 patients were treated prospectively with 4-epi-doxorubicin alone. All were observed closely for leukemic complications. RESULTS: Three patients from the randomized study developed leukemia; all were in the subgroup of 74 patients who received 4-epi-doxorubicin plus cisplatin, whereas no leukemia was observed among the remaining 83 patients in the randomized study or among the additional 203 patients who were treated prospectively with 4-epi-doxorubicin alone (P = .023, log-rank test). In the subgroup of 74 patients who were treated with 4-epi-doxorubicin plus cisplatin, the cumulative risk of leukemia was 16.0% +/- 9.9% (mean +/- SE) 33 months after the start of therapy; the relative risk was 668 (95% confidence interval [Cl], 138 to 1,953). Two other cases of acute monocytic and myelomonocytic leukemia were observed after 4-epi-doxorubicin plus alkylating agents were administered for breast cancer. Three of five cases of leukemia presented balanced translocations to chromosome band 11q23 and two, loss of a whole chromosome no. 7 or its long arm. CONCLUSIONS: 4-epi-doxorubicin is leukemogenic, and the leukemias are often acute monocytic or myelomonocytic with balanced chromosome translocations to band 11q23, such as in the leukemias after therapy with the epipodophyllotoxins. Furthermore, our results suggest a synergistic effect in leukemogenesis between 4-epi-doxorubicin targeting DNA-topoisomerase II and directly genotoxic drugs such as cisplatin or alkylating agents.","['Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Sigsgaard, T C', 'Nielsen, D', 'Gjedde, S B', 'Philip, P', 'Hansen, M', 'Larsen, S O', 'Rorth, M', 'Mouridsen, H', 'Dombernowsky, P']","['Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Sigsgaard TC', 'Nielsen D', 'Gjedde SB', 'Philip P', 'Hansen M', 'Larsen SO', 'Rorth M', 'Mouridsen H', 'Dombernowsky P']","['Department of Hematology L, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['J Clin Oncol. 1994 Nov;12(11):2514-5.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with tAPL who were gathered during a 10-year period (1982 to 1991) in seven hematologic centers were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 13 women and three men. The median age was 46 years (range, 12 to 82). Prior tumor was breast carcinoma in 10 cases, another solid tumor in three cases, and lymphoma in three cases. Two patients had received RT alone, and 14 had received chemotherapy (with RT in 11 cases). Prior chemotherapeutic agents generally included a combination of cyclophosphamide (used for limited periods), fluorouracil (5-FU), vinca alkaloids, and doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, or etoposide (VP16). By contrast, alkylating agents other than cyclophosphamide had been used in only two patients. Median interval between onset of treatment for the prior tumor and diagnosis of APL was 25 months. No patient had a known preleukemic phase. Hematologic and cytogenetic characteristics of the cases of tAPL were identical to those of the usual de novo APL, which included the presence of t(15; 17) in nine of the 10 patients tested. Two patients had early death. Seven patients were treated with intensive chemotherapy, and six achieved complete remission (CR). Three of them subsequently relapsed. Seven patients were treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), and four achieved CR through the differentiation of blasts into mature granulocytes. None has relapsed so far. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that tAPL is not exceptional, and usually has several features in common with other types of therapy-related AML with specific karyotype (ie, t(8;21),t(9;11), inv(16)): solid tumor rather than hematologic malignancy as primary tumor, short interval of development, absence of known preleukemic phase, prior chemotherapy with a combination of several drugs that often included an agent that targets topoisomerase II (doxorubicin or mitoxantrone, but less often VP16).

We sought to define an antibody panel for optimal diagnostic antigenic analysis and to test associations among antigen expression and a number of clinical features at presentation and prognosis in pediatric AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the extensive immunophenotypic analysis performed at the time of diagnosis on 132 assessable patients registered on a single Pediatric Oncology Group AML protocol between 1984 and 1988. RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent of patients were identified by testing for expression of CD33 and CD13. Overall, 61% of patients expressed at least one lymphoid-associated antigen, most commonly CD4, CD7, or CD19. Expression of CD5, CD10, CD20, or CD22, commonly detected in T- or B-lineage pediatric acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), was uncommon; coexpression of multiple lymphoid-associated antigens was also uncommon. Expression of the monocyte-associated antigen CD14 correlated with French-American-British (FAB) M4 or M5 morphology. Otherwise, no correlation between antigen expression and FAB classification was noted. None of the myeloid, lymphoid, natural-killer (NK), or progenitor-associated antigens were associated with significant differences in the likelihood of remission induction or event-free survival when expressor versus nonexpressor groups were compared. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of cell-surface antigen expression in pediatric acute leukemia usually permitted the discrimination of AML from ALL by using a limited panel of antibodies. Although the expression of lymphoid-associated antigens was common, such expression did not seem to be associated with an adverse prognosis in pediatric AML.","['Kuerbitz, S J', 'Civin, C I', 'Krischer, J P', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Steuber, C P', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Winick, N', 'Ragab, A H', 'Gresik, M V', 'Crist, W M']","['Kuerbitz SJ', 'Civin CI', 'Krischer JP', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Steuber CP', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Winick N', 'Ragab AH', 'Gresik MV', 'Crist WM']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Child', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Life Tables', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.9.1419 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Sep;10(9):1419-29. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.9.1419.,"['CA-28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the clinical and biologic features of childhood M3v cases in our AnLL series. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1970 to January 1991, 11 children with M3v were admitted and treated at our center. A diagnosis was made according to French-American-British (FAB) criteria. Morphologic examination, cytochemical analysis, and immunophenotyping were performed by a single pathologist. From January 1984, the diagnosis was confirmed by cytogenetic and, subsequently, by molecular analysis on frozen material. RESULTS: In our series, the overall incidence of children with APL was unusually high, 31.2% of the AnLL and M3v constituted one case in every four cases of APL. Even restriction of the analysis to the time when either cytogenetic and DNA studies confirmed the diagnosis, the incidence did not change. The immunophenotype of M3v cases was identical to that described for the hypergranular type, but an unexpected association of CD2 with M3v was shown. The onset was characterized by marked hyperleukocytosis (median WBC count, 87 x 10(9)/L) unlike classic APL. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was always present and severe. Hyperleukocytosis and DIC were responsible for the high incidence of deaths for hemorrhagic events in the first days after onset (eight of 11 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, for unknown reasons, M3v may occur in childhood more than generally was considered. The clinical course and prognosis seem worse in M3v than in typical APL cases.","['Rovelli, A', 'Biondi, A', 'Cantu Rajnoldi, A', 'Conter, V', 'Giudici, G', 'Jankovic, M', 'Locasciulli, A', 'Rizzari, C', 'Romitti, L', 'Rossi, M R']","['Rovelli A', 'Biondi A', 'Cantu Rajnoldi A', 'Conter V', 'Giudici G', 'Jankovic M', 'Locasciulli A', 'Rizzari C', 'Romitti L', 'Rossi MR', 'et al.']","[""Clinica Pediatrica dell'Universita di Milano, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1992.10.9.1413 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1992 Sep;10(9):1413-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1992.10.9.1413.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this analysis was to estimate better the impact of dose and age at time of irradiation on IQ decline. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 48 children were studied. We combined two previously reported studies that included 15 patients with pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 18 pediatric patients with medulloblastoma/posterior fossa primitive neural ectodermal tumors (PNETs) in whom serial IQ tests were administered. Another 15 patients (nine ALL and six PNET) were studied subsequent to these reports. This experience included ALL patients who were treated with whole-brain irradiation at doses of 18 Gy (n = 9) and 24 Gy (n = 15), and PNET patients who were treated with 18 Gy (n = 5), 22 to 24 Gy (n = 2), and 32 to 40 Gy (n = 17). Multiple regression models were constructed to estimate expected IQ score after treatment based on initial IQ score, age at treatment, and dose of whole-brain irradiation. RESULTS: Using a multiple linear regression model to correct for initial IQ and age at treatment, patients who received a dose of 36 Gy to the whole brain were estimated to score 8.2 points less on IQ testing than those with 24 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 14.6) and 12.3 points less than those who received 18 Gy (95% CI, 2.7 to 21.7). Older age at the time of irradiation resulted in less decline in subsequent IQ score. The predicted IQ decline is 11.9 points less in a 10-year-old patient than in a 3-year-old patient (95% CI, 4.2 to 19.6) for equivalent doses of irradiation. The model to predict IQ accounts for half the total variation in IQ score. There was no significant difference between the coefficients that reflected IQ decrease from radiation dose between subgroups who had ALL versus those with PNET. CONCLUSIONS: One can forecast final IQ score based on the initial IQ score, dose of irradiation, and age at time of irradiation. Our findings should aid in the selection of appropriate therapy when whole-brain irradiation is needed.","['Silber, J H', 'Radcliffe, J', 'Peckham, V', 'Perilongo, G', 'Kishnani, P', 'Fridman, M', 'Goldwein, J W', 'Meadows, A T']","['Silber JH', 'Radcliffe J', 'Peckham V', 'Perilongo G', 'Kishnani P', 'Fridman M', 'Goldwein JW', 'Meadows AT']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,['J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jan;11(1):195-6.

It was determined that for IL-2, but not Lipid A, to effectively trigger activation of IFN-gamma-primed macrophages, the tumor targets must be also present for interaction with effector macrophages to mediate the production of TNF and NO. IFN-gamma- and IL-2-activated macrophages from syngeneic DBA/2 and allogeneic C3H mice had identical MHC-unrestricted requirements for interaction with DBA/2 mouse-derived P815 and L1210 targets to mediate production of TNF and NO for tumor cytotoxicity. To further define the mechanistic requirements for macrophage-tumor target interaction, IFN-gamma- and IL-2-activated macrophages were separated from P815 targets in culture by a semipermeable membrane. Under these conditions, both TNF and NO were produced by the macrophage, which indicated that the requirement for tumor target-macrophage interaction may be due to a soluble factor produced by the target rather than to direct physical contact. This was confirmed by experiments in which 24-h cell-free culture fluids, derived from either P815 or L1210 tumor targets, substituted for the intact tumor cells in the stimulation of TNF mRNA synthesis and secretion with NO generation of TNF mRNA synthesis and secretion with NO generation by IFN-gamma- and IL-2-activated C3H or DBA/2 macrophages. The activity in 24-h culture fluids derived from P815 and L1210 tumor targets was tentatively designated as tumor-derived recognition factor(s) (TDRF) since it was produced constitutively by the tumor targets and synergized with IFN-gamma and IL-2 to induce macrophage production of TNF and NO for death of the same targets. A variety of nontransformed human and mouse fibroblasts, mouse spleen lymphocytes, and two adherent mouse fibrosarcomas did not produce detectable TDRF activity, whereas two mouse T lymphomas, EL4 and EL4.IL-2, produced TDRF activity similar to L1210 mouse leukemia and P815 mastocytoma. The C3H/MCA, a TDRF-nonproducing mouse fibrosarcoma, was susceptible to cytotoxicity mediated by macrophages activated by IFN-gamma and Lipid A, but not by IL-2 triggering. Exogenous TDRF derived from L1210 targets reconstituted the cytotoxic activity for C3H/MCA MCA targets mediated by IFN-gamma- and IL-2-activated macrophages accompanied by the production of TNF and cytotoxic NO.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jiang, H', 'Stewart, C A', 'Fast, D J', 'Leu, R W']","['Jiang H', 'Stewart CA', 'Fast DJ', 'Leu RW']","['Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc., Biomedical Division, Ardmore, OK 73402.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lipid A)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cytokines/*physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Synergism', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Lipid A/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Sep 15;149(6):2137-46.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 7071-7075). In the present study, we examined changes in the expressions of proteasomes during growth of peripheral T-lymphocytes from healthy adults and differentiation of human leukemic cell lines. Up-regulation of mRNAs encoding multiple proteasome subunits was observed during proliferation of resting T-cells induced by mitogens such as phytohemagglutinin and interleukin-2. In contrast, in vitro terminal differentiation into monocytic, granulocytic, and erythroid cells of various immature leukemic cell lines, such as HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and K562 erythroleukemia cells, by various inducing agents caused rapid and marked down-regulation of proteasomes expression, independently of the cell type, direction of differentiation, or type of signal. The syntheses of proteasome subunits of 21-31 kDa and their associated components of 35-110 kDa, measured by [35S]methionine incorporation, were much higher in mitogen-activated T-cells and unstimulated HL-60 cells, which grow rapidly, than in resting and differentiated cells, indicating apparent correlations of the mRNA levels of proteasomes with their translational activities. However, immunochemically, no detectable difference in the cellular contents of proteasomes was found in these cells in induced and uninduced states for proliferation and differentiation, suggesting accelerated turnover of proteasomes in rapidly proliferating cells. Inhibition of proteasome expression by an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide for the largest proteasome subunit, C2, caused partial arrest of cell cycle progression of T-lymphocytes, suggesting that up-regulation of proteasomes is indispensable for proliferation of the cells. We also observed that the nuclear fraction of proteasomes increased in proliferating T-cells and that proteasomes moved rapidly between the nucleus and cytoplasm during differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Shimbara, N', 'Orino, E', 'Sone, S', 'Ogura, T', 'Takashina, M', 'Shono, M', 'Tamura, T', 'Yasuda, H', 'Tanaka, K', 'Ichihara, A']","['Shimbara N', 'Orino E', 'Sone S', 'Ogura T', 'Takashina M', 'Shono M', 'Tamura T', 'Yasuda H', 'Tanaka K', 'Ichihara A']","['Biomaterial Research Institute, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blood Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology']",1992/09/05 00:00,2000/06/01 00:00,['1992/09/05 00:00'],"['1992/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 00:00 [medline]', '1992/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)37158-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Sep 5;267(25):18100-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These data show that ETS1 proteins can exist in at least two different states, -SH-available and -SH-protected. Renatured human ETS1 has DNA sequence-specific binding to the PEA3 (CAGGAAGT) motif. The ETS1.PEA3 complex can be observed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Purified ETS1 retards a band which is exactly the same size as a complex that is retarded from nuclear extracts prepared from CEM cells. Reduced ETS1 is required to form the ETS1.PEA3 complex, however; modification of the ETS1 -SH groups by either NEM or by TLCk does not inhibit formation of the complex. The ETS1.PEA3 complex formed with TLCK-modified ETS1 has a slower mobility than the complex formed with unmodified ETS1.

The specific activity of LTC4 synthase in differentiated cells (399.0 +/- 84.1 pmol of LTC4 formed.min-1.mg-1) was markedly higher (10-fold; p less than 0.001) than in undifferentiated U937 cells (39.9 +/- 16.7 pmol of LTC4 formed.min-1.mg-1) or freshly isolated blood monocytes (21.5 +/- 4.8 pmol of LTC4 formed.min-1.mg-1). The increase in LTC4 synthase activity following dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation was substantially higher than the increase observed for other proteins involved in leukotriene biosynthesis. LTC4 synthase activity was unaffected in U937 cells differentiated by growth in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The HL-60 myeloblast leukemia cell line expressed higher LTC4 synthase levels when differentiated into either neutrophil-like or macrophage-like cells by growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (respectively), but reached a specific activity comparable only to undifferentiated U937 cells. Human LTC4 synthase was found to be a unique membrane-bound enzymatic activity completely distinct from alpha, mu, pi, theta, and microsomal glutathione S-transferases, as determined by differential detergent solubilization, chromatographic separation, substrate specificity, and Western blot analysis. An 18-kDa polypeptide was specifically labeled in membranes from dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated U937 cells using azido 125I-LTC4, a photoaffinity probe based on the product of the LTC4 synthase-catalyzed reaction. Photolabeling of the 18-kDa polypeptide was specifically competed for by LTC4 (greater than 50% at 0.1 microM) but not by 100,000-fold higher concentrations of reduced glutathione (10 mM). Elevation of both the level of the specifically photolabeled 18-kDa polypeptide and of LTC4 synthase specific activity occurred concomitantly with dimethyl sulfoxide differentiation of U937 cells. We conclude that differentiation of U937 cells into monocyte/macrophage-like cells by growth in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide results in high levels of expression of LTC4 synthase activity. Human LTC4 synthase is a unique enzyme with a high degree of specificity for LTA4 and may therefore be dedicated exclusively to the formation of LTC4 in vivo. An 18-kDa membrane polypeptide, specifically labeled by a photoaffinity derivative of LTC4, is a candidate for being either LTC4 synthase or a subunit thereof.","['Nicholson, D W', 'Ali, A', 'Klemba, M W', 'Munday, N A', 'Zamboni, R J', 'Ford-Hutchinson, A W']","['Nicholson DW', 'Ali A', 'Klemba MW', 'Munday NA', 'Zamboni RJ', 'Ford-Hutchinson AW']","['Department of Pharmacology, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Pointe Claire-Dorval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (SRS-A)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 4.4.1.20 (leukotriene-C4 synthase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'SRS-A/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/05 00:00,1992/09/05 00:01,['1992/09/05 00:00'],"['1992/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)37121-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Sep 5;267(25):17849-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hlf, which is not normally transcribed in lymphoid cells, belongs to the recently described PAR subfamily of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins, which also includes Dbp and Tef/Vbp. Wild-type Hlf is able to bind DNA specifically as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other PAR factors. Structural alterations of the E2a-Hlf fusion protein markedly impair its ability to bind DNA as a homodimer compared with wild-type Hlf. However, E2a-Hlf can bind DNA as a heterodimer with other PAR proteins, suggesting a novel mechanism for leukemogenic conversion of a bZIP transcription factor.","['Hunger, S P', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Toyama, K', 'Cleary, M L']","['Hunger SP', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Toyama K', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.6.9.1608 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1992 Sep;6(9):1608-20. doi: 10.1101/gad.6.9.1608.,"['CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['E2A'],,,"['GENBANK/M79310', 'GENBANK/M81118', 'GENBANK/M97013', 'GENBANK/S43901', 'GENBANK/S49473', 'GENBANK/S49475', 'GENBANK/X65112', 'GENBANK/X65113', 'GENBANK/X66097', 'GENBANK/X66098']",,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of kinase activity by diacylglycerol and calcium often leads to translocation of PKC from the cytosol to a particulate fraction (Kraft and Anderson: Nature 301:621-623, 1983). The beta isoform of PKC is translocated and degraded much more rapidly than the alpha isoform in phorbolester-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells (Huang et al.: J. Biol. Chem. 264:4238-4243, 1989). We report here immunofluorescence evidence that the distributions of PKC alpha and beta are strikingly different in antigen-activated RBL cells. PKC beta associates with perinuclear filaments and filaments that extend from the perinuclear area to the cell periphery whereas PKC alpha concentrates in regions of the cell periphery. This distribution of PKC beta is distinctly different from that of actin filaments and microtubules as determined by phalloidin staining and by anti-tubulin antibody labeling. In contrast, the staining patterns obtained with antibodies to PKC beta and to the intermediate filament protein vimentin are almost identical, indicating that PKC beta associates with vimentin filaments. These bundles of 100 A filaments may provide docking sites for interactions of PKC beta with its substrates and thus confer specificity to the actions of this isoform.","['Spudich, A', 'Meyer, T', 'Stryer, L']","['Spudich A', 'Meyer T', 'Stryer L']","['Department of Cell Biology, Sherman Fairchild Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton,Cell motility and the cytoskeleton,8605339,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Vimentin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Detergents', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intermediate Filaments/*chemistry', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Octoxynol', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Protein Kinase C/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/*chemistry']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cm.970220405 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1992;22(4):250-6. doi: 10.1002/cm.970220405.,['MH45324/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results confirm previous observations that use of a sterically hindered planar ligand greatly enhances cytotoxicity, in comparison to trans-[PtCl2(NH3)2], such that in some cases cytotoxicity equivalent to that of the clinically used agent cisplatin [cis-[PtCl2(NH3)2]] is obtained. Results from both the panel of human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and the National Cancer Institute screening panel confirm a different pattern of cytotoxicity, with respect to cisplatin. The new trans-platinum complexes are also non-cross-resistant with cisplatin in both murine and human (human ovarian carcinoma panel) tumor cell lines. Preliminary mechanistic studies using both cis- and trans-[PtCl2(pyridine)2] in L1210 cells have been carried out, to delineate the reasons for both the dramatically enhanced cytotoxicity and the lack of cross-resistance with the clinically used agents. Intracellular uptake is enhanced for pyridine relative to ammine (NH3) complexes. The pyridine complexes also inhibit DNA synthesis, implying a role for DNA binding in their mechanism of action. Binding of the pyridine complexes to calf thymus DNA is, however, significantly less than for the analogous ammine complexes. The presence of trans-pyridine ligands results in steric hindrance, which retards the rate of reaction of trans-[PtCl2(pyridine)2], relative to trans[PtCl2(NH3)2], with other important biomolecules such as glutathione. The results point to a potential new class of platinum antitumor complexes acting by a new mechanism and with activity complementary to agents such as cisplatin.","['Farrell, N', 'Kelland, L R', 'Roberts, J D', 'Van Beusichem, M']","['Farrell N', 'Kelland LR', 'Roberts JD', 'Van Beusichem M']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont, Burlington 05405.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'DNA/biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Female', 'Glutathione/chemistry', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Sep 15;52(18):5065-72.,['P30 CA22435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Carzelesin (U-80244) is a cyclopropylpyrroloindole prodrug containing a relatively nonreactive chloromethyl precursor to the cyclopropyl function. Activation of carzelesin requires two steps, (a) hydrolysis of a phenylurethane substituent to form U-76073, followed by (b) ring closure to form the cyclopropyl-containing DNA-reactive U-76074. The formation of the DNA-reactive U-76074, via U-76073, from carzelesin was shown to proceed very slowly in phosphate-buffered saline (t1/2 greater than 24 h) but to occur rapidly in plasma from mouse, rat, dog, and human (initial t1/2 values ranging from 18 min for mouse to 52 min for rat) and in cell culture medium (t1/2 approximately 40 min). Although carzelesin was less potent in terms of in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo optimal dosage and showed low affinity for binding to DNA, it was therapeutically more efficacious against mouse L1210 leukemia than was U-76074 or adozelesin (U-73975), another cyclopropylpyrroloindole analogue which is currently in phase I clinical trials. Carzelesin also proved to be more efficacious than U-76074 or adozelesin against mouse pancreatic ductal 02 adenocarcinoma, a system reported to be resistant to every agent tested. Carzelesin was highly effective against this tumor and produced 97% tumor growth inhibition. In addition, i.v. administered carzelesin showed significant activity (National Cancer Institute criteria) against i.v. or s.c. implanted Lewis lung carcinoma, i.p. or s.c. implanted B16 melanoma, s.c. implanted colon 38 carcinoma, and five s.c. implanted human tumor xenografts, including clear cell Caki-1 carcinoma, colon CX-1 adenocarcinoma, lung LX-1 tumor, ovarian 2780 carcinoma, and prostatic DU-145 carcinoma. Carzelesin treatment produced 100% complete remissions (no palpable tumor mass at the termination of the experiment) in mice bearing early-stage human ovarian 2780. Pharmacologically, carzelesin proved to be relatively schedule and route independent and was highly active against i.p. implanted L1210 leukemia, regardless of whether the analogue was given i.v., i.p., s.c., or p.o.

Both carzelesin and adozelesin caused marked tumor shrinkage in mice bearing human lung LX-1 or advanced-stage human ovarian 2780 carcinoma; however, tumor regrowth occurred shortly after the treatment with adozelesin was stopped.

At 6 h, adenine nucleotide synthesis is preferentially inhibited over guanine nucleotide synthesis. A similar effect was observed with another glycineamide ribonucleotide transformylase inhibitor, 5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate. GTP was depleted to 40% of control and ATP to 10% of control by 5 microM 5-DACTHF. After a transitory increase, UTP and CTP were depleted to 30% of control. Deoxynucleotides were also depleted by the drug; dCTP was depleted to the greatest extent, followed by dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, respectively. MOLT-4 cell growth was inhibited by 5-DACTHF with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.066 microM. Complete reversal was effected by hypoxanthine, and there was no reversal by thymidine. The drug was cytotoxic to MOLT-4 cells in the range 0.25 to 5.0 microM, but a minimum of 48 h was required for trypan blue-staining dead cells to appear. The rate and extent of kill with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor 2-methyl-10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolate was greater than with 5-DACTHF, which indicates that kill by inhibition of thymidylate synthase is more effective than that by inhibition of purine synthesis. Electron microscopy of MOLT-4 cells exposed to 5-DACTHF showed electron-dense mitochondria and nuclear changes reminiscent of apoptosis. These morphological changes were accompanied by the appearance of DNA strand breaks at approximately 180-base pair intervals (internucleosomal breaks). Concomitant proteolysis of nuclear proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin B was observed.","['Smith, G K', 'Duch, D S', 'Dev, I K', 'Kaufmann, S H']","['Smith GK', 'Duch DS', 'Dev IK', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Burroughs-Wellcome Co., Wellcome Research Labs, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '118252-44-1', '(N-(4-((3-(2,4-diamino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxo-5-pyrimidinyl)propyl)amino)benzoyl)gluta', 'mic acid)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)']",IM,,"['Acyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Sep 15;52(18):4895-903.,['CA 50325/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) concentrations close to the level found in normal cells (in the range of 1 and 3 microM) can specifically induce changes in the expression of c-myc and gamma-globin mRNA in K562 cells, without inducing any toxic effects or affecting cell viability. Since we have determined that K562 cells have undetectable levels of endogenous lipid peroxidation, all these effects can be assigned to the exogenous HNE treatment. After a 1-h treatment with 1 microM HNE, c-myc mRNA levels decrease transiently during the first 4 h, rebounding later to higher levels, and normalizing to basal expression after 4 days. Run-on experiments show a transient transcriptional block 20 min after HNE treatment and subsequent posttranscriptional regulation. According to S1 mapping, mRNA changes are exerted on c-myc transcripts initiated from both the principal constitutive start sites (P1 and P2). gamma-Globin mRNA levels concomitantly increase 3- to 4-fold, but no significant changes of housekeeping gene expression are observed. On the basis of these results it appears that the restoration in human erythroleukemic K562 cells of HNE concentrations closer to the level in normal cells can modulate the expression of specific genes.","['Fazio, V M', 'Barrera, G', 'Martinotti, S', 'Farace, M G', 'Giglioni, B', 'Frati, L', 'Manzari, V', 'Dianzani, M U']","['Fazio VM', 'Barrera G', 'Martinotti S', 'Farace MG', 'Giglioni B', 'Frati L', 'Manzari V', 'Dianzani MU']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome La Sapienza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'K1CVM13F96 (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal)']",IM,,"['Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Lipid Peroxides/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Sep 15;52(18):4866-71.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas primary abnormalities contribute to the establishment of the leukemia and often are seen as solitary changes, secondary aberrations accrue during clonal evolution. Both abnormalities are nonrandom in distribution. The pattern differs between acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and from subtype to subtype. Some abnormalities are so characteristic as to be virtually pathognomonic for particular types of leukemia. The importance of cytogenetic characterization of leukemias is thus two-fold. First, the recurrent aberrations provide insight into the pathogenetic mechanisms that are operative. They pinpoint areas of the human genome that carry genes or regulatory sequences whose function is disrupted in neoplastic cells. Second, even before the long-term goal of a more fundamental understanding of the neoplastic process is reached, the cytogenetic aberrations have direct clinical importance. The finding of an acquired clonal chromosomal abnormality in hematopoietic cells identifies the presence of a neoplastic disease. The aberration profile may reveal whether the patient has ALL or ANLL and which subtype it is. Remission and relapse can be monitored by cytogenetic analyses. Finally, the karyotypic pattern is an independent prognostic parameter that should be considered when the choice of therapy is made.","['Heim, S', 'Mitelman, F']","['Heim S', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['*Chromosome Aberrations/*diagnosis', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19920915)70:4+<1701::aid-cncr2820701609>3.0.co;2-s [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Sep 15;70(6 Suppl):1701-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920915)70:4+<1701::aid-cncr2820701609>3.0.co;2-s.,,,,,,31,,,,,,,,,,

Lessons from the Philadelphia chromosome.,1695-700,"The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) was the first genetic change to be associated consistently with leukemia, and it is one of the best understood on the molecular level. Because of this, it is an excellent model to investigate the application of molecular techniques to the clinical setting. These techniques are reviewed as are their clinical use in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and transplantation. The Ph1 is caused by the fusion of two genes on chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This new gene is believed to be the cause of these Ph1-positive leukemias. The ability to detect the BCR-ABL fusion gene evolved from cytogenetic detection to Southern blot analysis, and now includes sophisticated techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods and pulsed-field gels. Diagnosis of the BCR-ABL fusion gene by Southern blot detection of bcr genetic rearrangements is the prototype of molecular cancer diagnosis. The sensitivity and clinical uses of this test are reviewed, especially its application to monitoring the response to treatment. PCR methods enable the researcher to detect 1 CML cell in a population of 10(5) cells. Clinical experience with PCR, especially in transplantation medicine, is providing a better understanding of the meaning of the terms ""remission"" and ""cure."" Newer techniques using fluorescent in situ hybridization have considerable potential for BCR-ABL detection, but no clinical experience has been gained with these techniques currently. The diagnosis of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in ALL has important clinical implications because it is the most common molecular genetic change in adult ALL and is associated with short remissions and poor outcome in all age groups. Diagnosis of the BCR-ABL fusion in ALL is difficult because the molecular findings are more heterogeneous than they are in CML. The methods available and their accuracy and sensitivity are compared. A review of their clinical impact is included.","['Westbrook, C A']",['Westbrook CA'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy']",1992/09/15 00:00,1992/09/15 00:01,['1992/09/15 00:00'],"['1992/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19920915)70:4+<1695::aid-cncr2820701608>3.0.co;2-d [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Sep 15;70(6 Suppl):1695-700. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920915)70:4+<1695::aid-cncr2820701608>3.0.co;2-d.,"['CA37037/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44700/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,

For 62 patients in chronic phase, 26 in accelerated phase, and 27 in blast transformation, the actuarial survival at 3 years was 58%, 41%, and 25%, respectively. Actuarial probability of relapse was 3%, 12%, and 27%, respectively. Only two patients in chronic phase showed a transient cytogenetic relapse and one of these died from subsequent transplant-related complications, whereas the other remains cytogenetically normal 697 days posttransplant. Patients who were transplanted within 1 year of diagnosis in chronic phase had a survival of 70% compared with 40% when transplanted beyond 1 year from diagnosis. This significant difference in survival was due to transplant-related complications and was correlated with previous exposure to high doses of busulphan. This study indicates that BuCy2 is a useful conditioning regimen for marrow transplantation in patients with CML and results in similar survival statistics and transplant-related mortality as would be expected with conditioning regimens containing total body irradiation. It is possible that relapse after BuCy2 may be lower than expected with regimens containing total body irradiation, but larger analyses are required.","['Biggs, J C', 'Szer, J', 'Crilley, P', 'Atkinson, K', 'Downs, K', 'Dodds, A', 'Concannon, A J', 'Avalos, B', 'Tutschka, P', 'Kapoor, N']","['Biggs JC', 'Szer J', 'Crilley P', 'Atkinson K', 'Downs K', 'Dodds A', 'Concannon AJ', 'Avalos B', 'Tutschka P', 'Kapoor N', 'et al.']","[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67633-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1352-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive leukemias such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), both of which express bcr-abl fused gene products (P210bcr-abl or P190bcr-abl protein kinase) with augmented tyrosine kinase activities, herbimycin A markedly inhibited the in vitro growth of the Ph1-positive ALL cells and the leukemic cells derived from CML blast crisis. However, the same dose of herbimycin A did not inhibit in vitro growth of a broad spectrum of Ph1-negative human leukemia cells, and several other protein kinase antagonists also displayed no preferential inhibition. Furthermore, we demonstrated that herbimycin A has an antagonizing effect on the growth of transformed cells by a transfection of retroviral amphotrophic vector expressing P210bcr/abl into a murine interleukin (IL)-3-dependent myeloid FDC-P2 cell line. This inhibition was abrogated by the addition of sulfhydryl compounds, similar to the reaction previously described for Rous sarcoma virus transformation. The inhibitory effect of herbimycin A on the growth of Ph1-positive cells was associated with decreased bcr/abl tyrosine kinase activity, but no decrease of bcr-abl mRNA and protein, suggesting that the inactivation of bcr-abl tyrosine kinase activity by herbimycin A may be induced by its binding to the bcr-abl protein portion that is rich with sulfhydryl groups. The present study indicates that herbimycin A is a beneficial agent for the investigation of the role of the bcr-abl gene in Ph1-positive leukemias and further suggests that the development of agents inhibiting the bcr-abl gene product may offer a new therapeutic potential for Ph1-positive leukemias.","['Okabe, M', 'Uehara, Y', 'Miyagishima, T', 'Itaya, T', 'Tanaka, M', 'Kuni-Eda, Y', 'Kurosawa, M', 'Miyazaki, T']","['Okabe M', 'Uehara Y', 'Miyagishima T', 'Itaya T', 'Tanaka M', 'Kuni-Eda Y', 'Kurosawa M', 'Miyazaki T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Benzoquinones', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/pharmacology', '*Transfection']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67630-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1330-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary (PE1) colony inhibition assays allowed us to characterize two distinct groups of AML: group I (patients 1 through 6), which displayed sensitivity to VP-16 similar to that of normal CFU-GM (IC90 of 20.52 +/- 2.44 micrograms/mL v 20.48 +/- 2.23 micrograms/mL after 1 hour drug exposure, respectively); and group II (patients 7 through 11), which was more sensitive to VP-16 (IC90 of 7.26 +/- 2.93 micrograms/mL, P = .004). Subsequently, groups I and II were termed normosensitive and hypersensitive, respectively. This objective VP-16 sensitivity classification, as determined by PE1, remained unaltered when assessed by secondary (PE2) colony inhibition assay (evaluating the self-renewal fraction of AML progenitors), or by cytofluorometric viability assay (evaluating the ultimately differentiated blast cell population). These findings would suggest that individual sensitivity to VP-16 of a particular cell population is maintained throughout CFU-AML differentiation. Finally, we report that sensitivity of AML cells to VP-16 did not correlate either with cell growth characteristics or with SSB generation. Indeed, AML cell sensitivity to VP-16 appeared more closely related to DNA repair kinetics after drug removal, ie, hypersensitivity being essentially characterized by a prolonged retention of SSB during the posttreatment period. Interestingly, the established HL-60 cell line, which presented greater sensitivity to VP-16 cytotoxicity than KG1, HEL, and K562, was also found to exhibit delayed DNA SSB repair kinetics, as compared with the other AML cell lines. These results suggest that hypersensitivity to VP-16 of some AML cells may be related to a deficient DNA-repair mechanism.","['Chiron, M', 'Demur, C', 'Pierson, V', 'Jaffrezou, J P', 'Muller, C', 'Saivin, S', 'Bordier, C', 'Bousquet, C', 'Dastugue, N', 'Laurent, G']","['Chiron M', 'Demur C', 'Pierson V', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Muller C', 'Saivin S', 'Bordier C', 'Bousquet C', 'Dastugue N', 'Laurent G']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie Fondamentales, CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67627-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Sep 1;80(5):1307-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The five year survival rates of several cancers have been improved in the last decades. Thus, progresses in the diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and promotion of cancer screening may have also contributed to the decrease of cancer deaths.

PARTICIPANTS: Eleven children aged 11 months to 12 years diagnosed as having lymphoma or T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with superior vena cava syndrome during an 11-year period. INTERVENTIONS: Lymph node biopsy (two patients), thoracenthesis (five patients), bone marrow aspiration (two patients), and thoracenthesis in addition to bone marrow aspiration (two patients). All aspirates were evaluated with immunohistochemical studies. Chemotherapy was the only management intervention. RESULTS: T-cell lymphoma or leukemia accounted for nine cases and Hodgkin's disease for two cases. Respiratory symptoms occurred in 10 patients, including tracheal compression in six patients (compression was life-threatening in one patient). Diagnosis of superior vena cava syndrome was achieved in eight patients using surface-marker analysis of aspirates. The syndrome disappeared within 2 to 10 days. Seven of nine children whose conditions were diagnosed more than 1 year before this writing were alive and free of disease after mean follow-up of 37 months. CONCLUSIONS: (1) A specific diagnosis can be achieved in most children with superior vena cava syndrome and lymphoma; (2) Thoracic computed tomographic scans are essential, identifying minute pleural effusions that can aid diagnosis; (3) Anesthetic hazard is related only to severe tracheal compression; (4) Chemotherapy achieves excellent symptomatic relief; and (5) Long-term survival, without disease, is achievable.","['Yellin, A', 'Mandel, M', 'Rechavi, G', 'Neuman, Y', 'Ramot, B', 'Lieberman, Y']","['Yellin A', 'Mandel M', 'Rechavi G', 'Neuman Y', 'Ramot B', 'Lieberman Y']","['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Dis Child,American journal of diseases of children (1960),0370471,,IM,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1001/archpedi.1992.02160210062022 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dis Child. 1992 Sep;146(9):1060-3. doi: 10.1001/archpedi.1992.02160210062022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Poor response to chemotherapy, a history of smoking, and lobar atelectasis suggested a different diagnosis. Bronchoscopy established the presence of a bronchogenic adenocarcinoma of the right lung as the etiology of the obstruction. Based on our experience and a review of the literature, we recommend that if a patient with CLL or a diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma presents with or develops SVC obstruction, additional invasive diagnostic tests must be initiated to exclude the possibility of a coexistent second malignancy or a transformation to a higher grade lymphoma. Other features warranting a search for another diagnosis are lack of the expected response to glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.","['de Mayolo, J A', 'Sridhar, K S', 'Kunhardt, B', 'Rao, R K']","['de Mayolo JA', 'Sridhar KS', 'Kunhardt B', 'Rao RK']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Miami Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,,IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Lung Neoplasms/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Superior Vena Cava Syndrome/*etiology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-199208000-00017 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1992 Aug;15(4):352-5. doi: 10.1097/00000421-199208000-00017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among sources of data for the study were nurses' prospective close observations in the natural care setting of each child. Chemotherapy-related side effects are multifaceted and intrusive, including changes in hematopoietic function, body function and body appearance. The most common side effects with regard to body function were elevation of body temperature, ulceration of oral mucous membrane, poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, ulceration of anus, diarrhea, impaired mobility. Side effects were greatest during the first through third weeks of the chemotherapy regimen. Twenty percent of the children developed infection. The findings stressed that nurses should be aware of such patterns of side effects so that they can provide optimal care to patients receiving chemotherapy.","['Chen, Y C', 'Lin, K H']","['Chen YC', 'Lin KH']","['School of Nursing, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Min Guo Xiao Er Ke Yi Xue Hui Za Zhi,Zhonghua Minguo xiao er ke yi xue hui za zhi [Journal].

We studied perisinusoidal laminin expression immunohistochemically using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in 110 human liver specimens obtained at autopsy. In normal adult liver the perisinusoidal spaces contained only minimal amounts of immunoreactive laminin. In 86% of patients dying from cancer with liver metastasis, however, a distinct increase in the amount of perisinusoidal laminin could be demonstrated. The perisinusoidal space also contained laminin in cancer patients without liver metastasis. In 3 cases of leukaemia sinusoids were laminin negative. In cirrhosis and chronic passive congestion there was, as expected, laminin immunoreactivity in the perisinusoidal space. The results obtained using polyclonal antibodies against laminin were confirmed using chain-specific monoclonal antibodies against B2 laminin. In an ex vivo assay, viable tumour cells (Panc-1 and clone A) were found to bind with remarkable specificity to frozen sections of liver tissue containing perisinusoidal laminin as opposed to liver tissues without laminin.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Out of a total number of 107 patients diagnosed of multiple myeloma (MM) between 1983 and 1991, 6 were found to meet the criteria for PCL (prevalence: 5.6%). This was primary in 2 cases and secondary in the remaining 4. The M/F ratio was 2/1 and the median age was 63 years (range: 57-69 years). RESULTS: Two patients had bone pain and two others weight loss at the onset of PCL. The outstanding haematological findings were increased ESR, normocytic-normochromic anaemia and thrombocytopenia, which were present in all cases. The percentage of peripheral blood plasma cells was between 29 and 70, and the bone marrow aspirate showed plasma cell infiltration over 40% in all cases. Serum M component was found in 5 patients, with decreased values of the polyclonal immunoglobulins; the remaining patient had non-secretory MM. Renal insufficiency was present in 3 patients at diagnosis. Three of the 4 patients with secondary PCL had been previously given combination chemotherapy and the remainder had received melphalan and prednisone. The period between the diagnosis of MM and the development of PCL ranged between 1 and 21 months (median 15 months). Three patients were treated with the M-2 protocol and the others received only supportive therapy. Transient partial response could be achieved in only one case with chemotherapy. All the patients have died, the actuarial survival median being 1 month (range, 1-7 months). Three patients died of infection, 2 of renal insufficiency and one of heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.

In the basophil and lobularity cytogram, their blast cells were clustered mainly in the blast box. However, a small cluster appeared in the basophil area and was expressed as pseudo-basophilia of 4.4%, 9.6%, and 21%, respectively. We speculated that not only normal basophils but also some type of leukemic blasts could be resistant to rupture of the cell membrane induced by a surfuctant at a low pH. Characteristics of H1 cytogram and histogram pattern have hardly been reported in patients with MDS. From the analysis of H1 pattern of 19 cases, we found that the (1) the values of RDW and HDW were high in comparison to those for aplastic anemia and normal controls and (2) the MPXI (mean peroxidase activity index) was significantly low at the time of diagnosis.

PURPOSE: Our purpose was to estimate the risk of second primary cancers following CLL, utilizing population-based tumor registries, and to determine whether site-specific excesses might be associated with type of initial treatment for CLL. METHODS: We analyzed data for 9456 patients diagnosed with CLL as a first primary cancer between 1973 and 1988, who were reported to one of nine tumor registries participating in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and who survived 2 or more months. SEER files were searched for invasive primary malignancies that developed at least 2 months after the initial CLL diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, CLL patients demonstrated a significantly increased risk of developing all second cancers (840 observed; observed-to-expected ratio [O/E] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-1.37). Significant excesses were noted for cancers of the lung (O/E = 1.90), brain (O/E = 1.98), and eye (intraocular melanoma) (O/E = 3.97) as well as malignant melanoma (O/E = 2.79) and Hodgkin's disease (O/E = 7.69). Cancer risk, which did not vary according to initial treatment category, was also constant across all time intervals after CLL diagnosis. CONCLUSION: CLL patients are at a significantly increased risk of developing a second malignant neoplasm. The pattern of cancer excesses suggests a susceptibility state permitting the development of selected second malignancies in patients with CLL, perhaps because of shared etiologic factors, immunologic impairment, and/or other influences. Although our results do not suggest a strong treatment effect, more detailed studies of second tumors in CLL are needed to investigate the role of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.","['Travis, L B', 'Curtis, R E', 'Hankey, B F', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Travis LB', 'Curtis RE', 'Hankey BF', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'United States']",1992/09/26 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/09/26 19:15'],"['1992/09/26 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/09/26 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/84.18.1422 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Sep 16;84(18):1422-7. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.18.1422.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth inhibition by TGF-beta was not due to either a toxic effect or to induction of differentiation. TGF-beta induced a cell cycle arrest at late G1 phase and was not found to be inhibitory to JOSK-I cells in S phase or G2/M. This G1 cell cycle arrest was associated with an accumulation of the unphosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb) in good correlation with inhibition of DNA synthesis. In contrast to the effects of TGF-beta, two other agents which induced a G1 arrest of JOSK-I cells had a different effect on Rb. Aphidicolin blocked cells at G1/S but could not reduce Rb phosphorylation as great as that seen with TGF-beta. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an inducer of differentiation, did reduce Rb phosphorylation, but not until 72 h, when differentiation had already occurred. The identities of the Rb kinases are unknown, but recent evidence suggests that the cdc2 gene product could participate in Rb phosphorylation. Although cdc2 mRNA and total protein levels were not affected, TGF-beta inhibited the rate of translation and kinase activity of cdc2 in JOSK-I cells.

The es and ei processes are equilibrative, but may be distinguished by the high sensitivity of the former to 6-[(4-nitrobenzyl)thio]-9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine (NBMPR); the cif process is mediated by a Na+/nucleoside cotransporter of low sensitivity to NBMPR. Cells of an ei-deficient clonal line, L1210/MC5-1, were mutagenized, and clones were selected in soft agar medium that contained (i) NBMPR (an inhibitor of es processes), (ii) erythro-9-(2-hydorxy-3-nonyl)adenine (an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase), and (iii) arabinofuranosyladenine (a cytotoxic substrate for the three nucleotide transporters). The selection medium did not allow es activity and selected against cells that expressed the Na(+)-linked cif process. Cells of the L1210/B23.1 clonal isolate were deficient in cif transport activity, and inward fluxes of formycin B, a poorly metabolized analog of inosine, were virtually abolished by NBMPR in these cells. In the mutant cells, nonisotopic formycin B behaved as a countertransport substrate during influx of [3H]formycin B, and inward fluxes of the latter were competitively inhibited by purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. The transport behavior of L1210/B23.1 cells indicates that (i) the mutation/selection procedure impaired or deleted the Na(+)-linked cif process and (ii) es nucleoside transport activity is expressed in the mutant cells.","['Vijayalakshmi, D', 'Dagnino, L', 'Belt, J A', 'Gati, W P', 'Cass, C E', 'Paterson, A R']","['Vijayalakshmi D', 'Dagnino L', 'Belt JA', 'Gati WP', 'Cass CE', 'Paterson AR']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Formycins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '13877-76-4 (formycin B)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', '59262-86-1 (9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'GV1L2DZM2Z (4-nitrobenzylthioinosine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Adenosine/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Formycins/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thioinosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/metabolism']",1992/08/25 00:00,1992/08/25 00:01,['1992/08/25 00:00'],"['1992/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)41877-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1992 Aug 25;267(24):16951-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It induces a disruption of the cytoskeleton, particularly the microfilament system, leading to inhibition of cell proliferation.

Cells exposed to the toxin did not divide, as cell numbers remained constant for 3 days in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml of the toxin. However, these cells were found to become multinucleated, a phenomenon which was time- and dose-dependent. After treatment for 72 h with 0.5 micrograms/ml toxin A, 95% of the cells were multinucleated and had a considerably increased cell diameter. These effects in JURKAT cells were partially reversible upon removal of the toxin within 12 h after the beginning of toxin exposure, but irreversible after 24 h of toxin treatment. These results suggest a continuing nuclear division in the absence of cytoplasmic division, i.e., an effect of toxin A on contractile ring formation.

HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were induced to undergo myeloid or monocytic terminal cell differentiation by these agents. To investigate the potential coupling between down-regulation of RB and c-myc oncogene expression with cell differentiation, dose response relationships for the induced down-regulation of RB and c-myc expression were compared with each other and with induced cell differentiation. The total amount of RB protein per cell increased as cells advanced through the cell cycle, but the amount of RB protein relative to the total cell mass remained approximately constant. Treated with RA or VD, an early progressive decrease in cellular content of the RB protein occurred in all cell cycle phases well before any cell cycle modulation or phenotypic differentiation. For a differentiation-defective variant HL-60 cell line, failure to differentiate was preceded by a failure to down-regulate cellular levels of the RB protein. In dose response experiments, progressively increasing RA or VD concentrations caused progressively greater reductions in RB as well as c-myc expression with an increasing fraction of cells terminally differentiating. For both RA and VD, the dose response relationships for reductions in RB and c-myc expression were similar suggesting that their down-regulation may be coupled. These observations are consistent with a model whereby RB expression acts as a cellular brake to sustain a developmentally ordained state of differentiation (i.e., preserve the ""status quo""); and the down-regulation of heterogeneously distributed RB protein per cell below a threshold is part of the metabolic cascade culminating in terminal cell differentiation. Thus, RB may have a role in this developmental context.","['Yen, A', 'Chandler, S', 'Forbes, M E', 'Fung, Y K', ""T'Ang, A"", 'Pearson, R']","['Yen A', 'Chandler S', 'Forbes ME', 'Fung YK', ""T'Ang A"", 'Pearson R']","['Department of Pathology, Veterinary College, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-6401.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Calcitriol/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/*physiology', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1992 Apr;57(2):210-21.,,,,"['RB', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The antitumor mechanism is believed to include complement-mediated neutrophil activation. Employing a flow-cytometric analysis of actin polymerization as an indicator of cell activation as well as a tumor proliferation assay, we have found that monocyte-derived neutrophil-activating factors were involved in OK432-induced neutrophil activation as well as antitumor activity. OK432-stimulated (0.1 KE/ml; 0.01 mg/ml) monocyte supernatants (OKMS) induced neutrophil actin polymerization and chemotaxis. OKMS were responsible for neutrophil-mediated inhibition of human leukemic (CEM) cell proliferation and stimulated neutrophils to produce superoxide in the presence of CEM leukemic cells at an effector/target ratio higher than 20/1. In contrast, OK432 alone, OK432-stimulated lymphocyte supernatants, or OK432-stimulated neutrophil supernatants had no effect on neutrophil activation or suppression of tumor cell proliferation. OK432 in combination with mononuclear cells also had no effect on the inhibition of CEM cell proliferation. Pretreatment of OKMS at 56 degrees C for 30 min did not affect its ability to activate neutrophils, implying that complement activation is not responsible for the neutrophil activation. Supernatants from OK432-stimulated mononuclear cells, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and radioimmunoassays, contained high levels of interleukin-8 (IL-8; 1567 +/- 145 pg/ml) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha; 2105 +/- 152 pg/ml), low levels of leukotriene B4 (800 +/- 45 pg/ml) and IL-1 beta (180 +/- 22 pg/ml), but interferon gamma was not detectable. IL-1 beta, IL-8, and TNF alpha transcripts, undetectable in untreated monocytes, increased significantly after 30-60 min exposure to OK432.

The mean absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as the mean absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets (T cells, T cell subsets, B cells, and natural killer cells) from leukemic children before consolidation chemotherapy were all significantly lower than in control subjects; however, the percentages of lymphocyte subsets were similar in both groups. After consolidation chemotherapy, the percentages of CD4+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells were significantly decreased and the percentages of monocytes and CD8+ T lymphocytes were significantly increased. Phytohemagglutinin- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and NK-cell-mediated cytotoxic activity by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were also substantially decreased in the post-therapy groups. NK activity correlated with the percentage of NK cells in PBMC. In contrast, OK432-induced production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and killer activity against NK-resistant target cells were significantly increased after therapy as compared with the pre-therapy and control groups. TNF alpha production correlated with the percentage of monocytes in PBMC. These results demonstrate that substantial quantitative and qualitative chemotherapy-induced abnormalities of the cellular immune system are present in the majority of patients treated with ALL. It is also suggested that the increased TNF alpha production by monocytes and the appearance of potent killing activity against NK-resistant targets might compensate for the defects of IL-2 production and NK activity during intensive consolidation chemotherapy.","['Komada, Y', 'Zhang, S L', 'Zhou, Y W', 'Hanada, M', 'Shibata, T', 'Azuma, E', 'Sakurai, M']","['Komada Y', 'Zhang SL', 'Zhou YW', 'Hanada M', 'Shibata T', 'Azuma E', 'Sakurai M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '39325-01-4 (Picibanil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/drug effects/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Picibanil/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01789334 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1992;35(4):271-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01789334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three cytokines tested inhibited the growth of the cell lines. However, a high degree of variability in susceptibility to cytotoxic/cytostatic effect of the cytokines was found among individual cell lines. Some cell lines were sensitive to the antiproliferative action of only one of the cytokines tested, but were resistant to the others. Combinations of two cytokines had additive or synergistic effects and inhibited cell growth to a greater extent than did the individual cytokines alone. In addition to the growth-inhibitory effect, the cytokines induced an apparent cell differentiation. The differentiation of the two most sensitive cell lines, EoL-1 and PL-21, was confirmed using the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test, by changes in cell morphology, immunophenotype marker profiles and by changes in c-myb expression. Furthermore, we showed that even in the cell lines relatively resistant to the antiproliferative effect of cytokines, such as cell line KCL-22, the inhibition of cell growth could be markedly increased with the DNA-topoisomerase-II-targeted drug, doxorubicin. Our data thus suggest that TNF alpha, IFN alpha and IFN gamma together have a potential role in the immunotherapy of non-lymphoid leukemia in terms of their antiproliferative action, and their ability to induce differentiation and to modulate drug sensitivity.","['Kikuchi, A', 'Holan, V', 'Minowada, J']","['Kikuchi A', 'Holan V', 'Minowada J']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories Inc., Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01789332 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1992;35(4):257-63. doi: 10.1007/BF01789332.,,,,['c-myb'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A series of four SAMDC inhibitors with structural features similar to MGBG have been found to have improved potency and specificity toward the target enzyme, SAMDC. Relative to MGBG, the new derivatives were much more effective in inhibiting partially purified preparations of SAMDC (50% inhibitory concentration, 10 to 100 nM), much less effective at inhibiting diamine oxidase, and inactive toward ornithine decarboxylase. The inhibitors varied relative to MGBG in their ability to compete with spermidine for uptake, with two being similar and two being less effective. Against L1210 leukemic cells and T24 bladder carcinoma cells, the compounds were slightly less effective than MGBG at inhibiting cell growth, with 50% inhibitory concentration values of 1 to 10 microM as compared with 0.5 and 1.1 microM, respectively, for MGBG. Under 50% growth-inhibitory conditions, the inhibitors decreased SAMDC activity, increased ornithine decarboxylase activity and putrescine pools, and markedly depleted spermidine and spermine pools of L1210 cells. At the same time, mitochondrial integrity as assessed by whole-cell pyruvate oxidation and mitochondrial DNA content was not affected as it was with MGBG. At doses less than one tenth that of the maximally tolerated dose, all of the new inhibitors strongly suppressed the growth of B16 melanoma in vivo with minimal weight loss or toxicity. At doses less than one sixth the maximally tolerated dose, they effectively inhibited the growth of T24 human bladder carcinoma xenografts. In these same systems, MGBG showed only marginal antitumor activity. These studies identify two potent and efficacious inhibitors of SAMDC as potential antitumor agents and reaffirm the importance of SAMDC as a target in anticancer drug discovery.","['Regenass, U', 'Caravatti, G', 'Mett, H', 'Stanek, J', 'Schneider, P', 'Muller, M', 'Matter, A', 'Vertino, P', 'Porter, C W']","['Regenass U', 'Caravatti G', 'Mett H', 'Stanek J', 'Schneider P', 'Muller M', 'Matter A', 'Vertino P', 'Porter CW']","['Research Department, CIBA-GEIGY, Limited, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Polyamines)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Sep 1;52(17):4712-8.,['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationships between chelator concentration and inhibition of growth, DNA synthesis and ribonucleotide reductase, and phase of cell cycle arrest have also been explored. HPOs and DFO arrest the cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner causing a blockade at the G1-S border after 24 h at concentrations above 30 microM iron-binding equivalents. This is associated with reduced ribonucleotide reductase activity and concomitant cessation of DNA synthesis and growth. When the chelator is subsequently removed, HPO-treated cells synchronously cascade into S phase, unlike DFO-treated cells which resume cycling in a nonsynchronous manner. Chelator concentrations of approximately 25 microM and 3 microM iron-binding equivalents inhibited growth, DNA synthesis, and ribonucleotide reductase activity by 50% in K562 and Daudi cells, respectively. Concentrations less than 10 microM iron-binding equivalents inhibited K562 cell growth without an effect on DNA synthesis but with accumulation of cells in G2 and M phases. These results suggest that HPOs have advantages over DFO as cell cycle synchronization agents and may be useful adjuncts in cell cycle-specific treatment regimens.","['Hoyes, K P', 'Hider, R C', 'Porter, J B']","['Hoyes KP', 'Hider RC', 'Porter JB']","['Department of Haematology, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '115900-75-9 (1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Pyridones/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1992 Sep 1;52(17):4591-9.,['R01-HL-42800-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Class I or class II MHC antigens were not expressed in untreated K562 cells and rIFN-gamma (600 units/ml) weakly induced class I antigens on the cells. Among the compounds tested, verapamil but not the calcium ionophore A23187 enhanced the rIFN-gamma-induced class I antigen expression at both the surface molecule and mRNA levels and enhancement by verapamil occurred in a dose-dependent manner at non-toxic concentrations examined (approximately 50 microM). Verapamil alone had no inducible effect on MHC antigen expression. Deprivation of Ca2+ in culture medium by ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) could not cause an enhancement of class I antigen induction by rIFN-gamma. Simultaneous exposure of K562 cells to rIFN-gamma (600 units/ml) and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rTNF; 1000 units/ml) in combination with verapamil (50 microM) resulted in a further increase of class I antigens in the cells. The expressions of c-myc oncogene in K562 cells were not changed when the cells were treated with rIFN-gamma (600 units/ml) or verapamil (50 microM), either alone or in combination. These results indicate that verapamil synergistically interacts with rIFN-gamma on the class I antigen induction in K562 cells irrespective of c-myc gene expression and that class I antigen induction in this cell line may not be relevant to calcium influx triggered by IFN-gamma.","['Takemura, Y', 'Koide, Y', 'Miyachi, H', 'Shibata, T', 'Sekiguchi, S']","['Takemura Y', 'Koide Y', 'Miyachi H', 'Shibata T', 'Sekiguchi S']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Defense Medical College, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '65595-90-6 (W 7)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1992/08/14 00:00,1992/08/14 00:01,['1992/08/14 00:00'],"['1992/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3835(92)90152-L [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(92)90152-l [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1992 Aug 14;65(2):99-106. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(92)90152-l.,,,['Cancer Lett 1993 Jun 15;70(1-2):141.

An understanding of the impact of colorectal cancer and radiation treatment on these aspects of health quality of life can be reached by comparing this diagnostic group to others undergoing similar treatment. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with colorectal cancers, 41 with uterocervical cancers, 43 with genitourinary tumors, 13 with leukemia or bone metastasis, and 129 with head and neck cancers undergoing radiation therapy provided complete health quality of life index (QLI-RT) data during weeks 1 and 3 of treatment and at the first follow-up visit after treatment completion. The QLI-RT was found to be reliable and valid. RESULTS: Those with colorectal cancer had similar QLI-RT summary scores as the other groups at the beginning of treatment and during the follow-up period. QLI-RT scores tended to range from 62 to 84 for the summary score and individual-item scores; this was a narrow span considering the QLI-RT uses a 0-100-mm linear analog-response scale. The exceptions were strength, which elicited scores in the 46-68 range and a couple of responses to worrying about radiation therapy. The largest change in QLI-RT score in relation to the treatment trajectory was 11 mm. CONCLUSIONS: These findings tend to support the notion that patients with cancer try to maintain health quality of life at an acceptable level despite the occurrence of stressful negative events. Future research should explore the stable versus dynamic attributes of health quality of life to learn more about the factors that contribute to the adaptive process that maintains such quality of life at an acceptable level.","['Padilla, G V', 'Grant, M M', 'Lipsett, J', 'Anderson, P R', 'Rhiner, M', 'Bogen, C']","['Padilla GV', 'Grant MM', 'Lipsett J', 'Anderson PR', 'Rhiner M', 'Bogen C']","['School of Nursing, University of California, Los Angeles 90024-1702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Colorectal Neoplasms/*psychology/radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19920901)70:3+<1450::aid-cncr2820701537>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1992 Sep 1;70(5 Suppl):1450-6. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19920901)70:3+<1450::aid-cncr2820701537>3.0.co;2-e.,"['3NR011030451/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'NR01042/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States', 'NU00849/NU/BHP HRSA HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients had either acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 4), acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 7) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 12). The median age was 29 years and the median interval between first and second BMT was 22.6 months. The second preparative therapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (1200 cGy) in nine patients and busulfan (16 mg/kg) and cyclophosphamide (120-200 mg/kg) with or without etoposide (30-60 mg/kg) in 14 patients. The same sibling donor (three syngeneic, 20 allogeneic) was used for both transplants. All patients demonstrated prompt neutrophil recovery (median 21 days) with donor-derived hematopoiesis documented in 16 of 16 evaluable patients. With a median follow-up of 24 months after second BMT, the survival, event-free survival and probability of remaining in remission at 26 months are 47%, 38% and 76% respectively. Outcome was best in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (7/12 survivors) and worst in patients with acute leukemia (2/11 survivors).

Marrow donors were HLA identical siblings (n = 14), phenotypically HLA identical parents (n = 2) and a one antigen mismatched parent (n = 1). Patients with no evidence of leukemic transformation (n = 12) were conditioned with 140-200 mg/kg cyclophosphamide (CY). Of five patients with leukemic transformation, four received CY (120 mg/kg) plus 12 Gy fractionated total body irradiation and one patient received busulfan (14 mg/kg) and CY (100 mg/kg). All patients engrafted; however, one patient whose sibling donor's cells showed variable results when assayed for chromosome instability required two additional marrow infusions. Toxicity associated with the conditioning regimen included severe oral mucositis (n = 14), hemorrhagic cystitis (n = 11) and diffuse erythroderma (n = 3). Seven of the 12 patients without leukemic transformation are surviving 1-17 years (median = 5 years) after transplant, with an estimated survival probability at 5 years of 65% (95% CI 0.31; 0.85). Two patients developed squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue greater than 10 years post-transplant. One of these patients died at 10.3 years as a result of the malignant process, and the other is disease free more than 12 years post-transplant. Of the five patients with leukemic transformation, one is alive at 8 years. These data demonstrate that marrow transplantation can offer long-term survival for patients with FA, engraftment can be achieved with reduced doses of CY in FA patients, and less toxic preparative regimens are needed for FA patients who have developed leukemic transformation.","['Flowers, M E', 'Doney, K C', 'Storb, R', 'Deeg, H J', 'Sanders, J E', 'Sullivan, K M', 'Bryant, E', 'Witherspoon, R P', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Buckner, C D']","['Flowers ME', 'Doney KC', 'Storb R', 'Deeg HJ', 'Sanders JE', 'Sullivan KM', 'Bryant E', 'Witherspoon RP', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Buckner CD', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology', 'Busulfan/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cystitis/etiology', 'Fanconi Anemia/complications/immunology/*surgery', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Mucous Membrane/drug effects']",1992/03/01 00:00,1992/03/01 00:01,['1992/03/01 00:00'],"['1992/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Mar;9(3):167-73.,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examined the mechanisms underlying the elevation of serum beta 2M levels in ATL. First, the production of beta 2M by ATL cells was investigated in vitro. High levels of beta 2M were detected in the conditioned culture medium (CM) of ATL cells from seven out of nine patients. Second, we assessed the effects of the CM on the release of beta 2M by three human cell lines unrelated to ATL (NCTC 2544, Chang liver, and L 132; originating from the skin, the liver, and the fetal lung, respectively). Most of the CM definitely promoted beta 2M production by these cell lines. beta 2M production by the cell lines was markedly promoted by exogenous interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a well-known potent inducer of class I HLA antigen expression. We then investigated whether an antibody directed against IFN-gamma could attenuate the activity of three ATL CM. The anti-IFN-gamma antibody reduced the stimulatory activity of the CM to 28-65% of the original level, but did not affect basal beta 2M production by these cell lines. These data suggest that there are at least two mechanisms causing the elevation of serum beta 2M levels in ATL; direct production by tumor cells, and production by non-malignant cells that is mediated via humoral factors secreted by the ATL cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Tsuda, H', 'Sawada, T', 'Sakata, K M', 'Takatsuki, K']","['Tsuda H', 'Sawada T', 'Sakata KM', 'Takatsuki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Organ Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*analysis/biosynthesis']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Apr;55(2):179-87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three M-CSF peaks were observed during therapy: the first peak was during or just after chemotherapy, the second peak was around the leukocyte nadir, and the third peak coincided with a rapid increase in the monocyte count. We could find no significant correlation between the height of the second peak and the time from the initiation of therapy to hematological recovery. On the other hand, there was a significant positive correlation between the height of the second peak and the interval from the last day of chemotherapy to the peak (r = 0.62, p = 0.001), and there was a significant negative correlation between the peak height and the time from the peak until hematological recovery (defined as a neutrophil count of over 500/microliters (r = -0.63, p = 0.001) and a leukocyte count of over 1,000/microliters (r = 0.55, p = 0.008)).

The space group and unit cell are isomorphous with the previously reported structure of chicken liver DHFR complexed with NADPH and phenyltriazine [Volz, K. W., Matthews, D. A., Alden, R. A., Freer, S. T., Hansch, C., Kaufman, B. T., & Kraut, J. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 2528-2536]. The structure contains an ordered water molecule hydrogen-bonded to both hydroxyls of the biopterin dihydroxypropyl group as well as to O4 and N5 of the biopterin pteridine ring. This water molecule, not observed in previously determined DHFR structures, is positioned to complete a proposed route for proton transfer from the side-chain carboxylate of E30 to N5 of the pteridine ring. Protonation of N5 is believed to occur during the reduction of dihydropteridine substrates. The positions of the NADP+ nicotinamide and biopterin pteridine rings are quite similar to the nicotinamide and pteridine ring positions in the Escherichia coli DHFR.NADP+.folate complex [Bystroff, C., Oatley, S. J., & Kraut, J. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 3263-3277], suggesting that the reduction of biopterin and the reduction of folate occur via similar mechanisms, that the binding geometry of the nicotinamide and pteridine rings is conserved between DHFR species, and that the p-aminobenzoylglutamate moiety of folate is not required for correct positioning of the pteridine ring in ground-state ternary complexes. Instead, binding of the p-aminobenzoylglutamate moiety of folate may induce the side chain of residue 31 (tyrosine or phenylalanine) in vertebrate DHFRs to adopt a conformation in which the opening to the pteridine binding site is too narrow to allow the substrate to diffuse away rapidly. A reverse conformational change of residue 31 is proposed to be required for tetrahydrofolate release.","['McTigue, M A', 'Davies, J F 2nd', 'Kaufman, B T', 'Kraut, J']","['McTigue MA', 'Davies JF 2nd', 'Kaufman BT', 'Kraut J']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0317.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biopterin/*metabolism', 'Chickens', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Liver/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NADP/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'X-Ray Diffraction/methods']",1992/08/18 00:00,1992/08/18 00:01,['1992/08/18 00:00'],"['1992/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00147a009 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1992 Aug 18;31(32):7264-73. doi: 10.1021/bi00147a009.,"['CA 17374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07313/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five patients appeared to have a decline in height SDS before their CNS relapse. There were no apparent changes in the weight of patients with or without CNS relapse. In endocrine studies, all eight patients with CNS relapse failed to show the normal growth hormone (GH) response to arginine, GH-releasing factor, and glucagon-propranolol tests, while spontaneous GH secretion during sleep was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed small pituitary glands in seven patients with CNS relapse. These findings suggest that in leukemia and lymphoma patients with CNS relapse, GH secretion is impaired at the hypothalamic level, resulting in a secondary atrophy of the pituitary gland. The MRI together with selected endocrinologic tests may help to clarify the mechanism of growth impairment in such patients. A decline in height SDS in each patient may be a useful marker for predicting a CNS relapse in a child with leukemia or lymphoma.","['Yamada, S', 'Ishii, E', 'Okabe, Y', 'Kai, T', 'Kuroiwa, T', 'Hasuo, K', 'Akazawa, K', 'Tasaka, H', 'Ueda, K']","['Yamada S', 'Ishii E', 'Okabe Y', 'Kai T', 'Kuroiwa T', 'Hasuo K', 'Akazawa K', 'Tasaka H', 'Ueda K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Hormones)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height/physiology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/blood/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Growth Disorders/blood/*etiology/pathology', 'Growth Hormone/blood', 'Hormones/blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*complications/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/*complications/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Pituitary Gland, Anterior/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications/pathology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199208000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1992 Aug;14(3):236-40. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199208000-00010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bone marrow showed prominent fibrosis in five cases and reticulin fibrosis in one patient at presentation. Crush artifact often made the histologic sections difficult to interpret, but typical megakaryoblasts could be identified in the smears. Biopsy specimens of the liver and lymph node were suggestive of a nonhematopoietic malignant condition because of the cohesiveness of the tumor cells, stromal fibrosis, and the prominent sinusoidal and vascular pattern of infiltration. Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was helpful in identifying the blasts as belonging to the megakaryoblastic lineage. Using a panel of mononclonal antibodies, it was also possible to confirm the nature of the infiltration in paraffin sections and to differentiate it from other childhood small round cell tumors, especially neuroblastoma in paraffin sections (typical staining pattern: CD45-, CD43+, vW Factor, Ulex europeus I+, CD20-, CD45RO-, synaptophysin-, chromogranin-, cytokeratin-, desmin-).

One mechanism proposes that resonant-size bubbles are trapped in planar arrays by standing waves in the sample and that exposure vessel rotation sweeps cells through the bubble arrays. The other mechanism, for which there is now considerable support, proposes that exposure vessel rotation simply allows bubbles to recycle after having been driven through the medium by the ultrasound. We report here the results of efforts to further discriminate between, and quantify, the relative contributions of these two mechanisms. Murine P388 cells were exposed to 1.07 MHz continuous-wave (CW) ultrasound for 5 min at 5 W/cm2 (ISP) using various exposure vessel compositions and exposure configurations. Experimental treatments were designed either to minimize or maximize standing waves in the sample tube, or to minimize the potential for bubble recycling while maximizing standing wave formation. The results of these experiments indicate that bubble cycling is responsible for the majority of cell lysis occurring in the rotating exposure vessels, but that a significant contribution to total lysis is provided by trapped bubbles under some conditions.","['Brayman, A A', 'Miller, M W']","['Brayman AA', 'Miller MW']","['Department of Biophysics, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, NY 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Ultrasound Med Biol,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,0410553,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultrasonics']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0301-5629(92)90049-g [doi]'],ppublish,Ultrasound Med Biol. 1992;18(4):411-20. doi: 10.1016/0301-5629(92)90049-g.,['CA 39230-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, numerous studies in humans have been carried out and the data obtained suggest that Cw3 and Cw4 may be markers for leukemia susceptibility genes. Given the relatively weak relevance of HLA-C locus antigens in immune response, unrecognized properties of Cw3 and Cw4 should be considered to explain this association. Family studies have consistently revealed limited heterogeneity of HLA antigens in those families, increased parental HLA antigen sharing resulting in increased homozygosity among offspring and high frequency of recombinations within the MHC. Furthermore, the HLA genotype of leukemic patients was found more frequently among their siblings than the anticipated 25 percent. Another significant deviation from the Mendelian expectation was increased HLA-DR identity of offspring to that of their mother in those families. These and other observations imply that in leukemia families unknown MHC-linked recessive factors linked to Cw3 and Cw4 alleles may be susceptibility genes which also cause segregation distortion of HLA genes and probably developmental errors.","['Dorak, M T', 'Chalmers, E A']","['Dorak MT', 'Chalmers EA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine, Antalya.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Turkey,Turk J Pediatr,The Turkish journal of pediatrics,0417505,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C*03 antigen)', '0 (HLA-C*04 antigen)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Genotype', 'HLA-C Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Pedigree']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Turk J Pediatr. 1992 Jan-Mar;34(1):55-9.,,,,,,37,,,,,,,,,,

An earlier study of the hemolysis reaction indicated that the two peptides bind to and compete for the same site on human erythrocytes. A recent study examined the hemolysis induced by both peptides as the phosphate and Ca2+ content of the reaction mixture was varied. The results of the recent study (VERNON, L. P. and ROGERS, A., Toxicon 30, 701-709) agree with this companion study on the binding of 125I-labeled pyrularia thionin and cardiotoxin to erythrocytes under the same conditions. Added phosphate ion at 5 mM and removal of membrane-bound Ca2+ by treatment with 10 mM EGTA make more binding sites of the same affinity available to both peptides, which are shown to bind in a competitive fashion to the same site. Addition of 10 mM Ca2+ to the medium decreases peptide binding due to competitive binding of Ca2+ to the same site on the membrane.

Before further advances can take place several problems must be overcome, including the rapid clearance of immunotoxin by the liver, the generation of anti-immunotoxin antibodies, and poor penetration by the immunotoxin in solid tumors. Other obstacles to the wide use of immunotoxins are the heterogeneity of tumor cells, the shedding of tumor antigens into the circulation, and the inability to identify neoplastic renewal cell specific antigens that are not cross-reactive with normal tissues.

Phase I and II trials of GM-CSF in patients with AIDS, cancer, marrow failure states, and following bone marrow transplantation have been published, and limited phase III randomized trial experiences have been reported as well. Overall, GM-CSF represents a fascinating molecule with which to modulate human hematopoiesis in vivo. The multilineage stimulatory effects of GM-CSF that are evident in vitro have not been striking or consistent in clinical trials. However, the effects of GM-CSF on the production and function of mature neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils have been noted in the vast majority of clinical scenarios in which this cytokine has been tested. The clinical benefits of GM-CSF have, to date, only been proven in large-scale randomized studies of recovery from ABMT for lymphoid neoplasms. However, further data regarding the use of GM-CSF in other clinical settings have been generated, and the final results are eagerly anticipated by the oncology community. The beneficial effects of GM-CSF following ABMT consisted not only of a shorter period of absolute neutropenia, but also fewer significant infections, a diminished requirement for intravenous antibiotic administration, and a shorter overall duration of inpatient hospitalization. The use of GM-CSF in clonal disorders of hematopoiesis, such as myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemias, requires caution before such applications can be routinely recommended, and the demonstration of safety in this setting from large randomized trials will be needed. Preliminary data from small randomized trials suggests that the incidence of evolution to leukemia in patients with myelodysplasia and the number of patients with regrowth of leukemia after induction treatment in relapsed patients with AML may not be significantly different than in patients who do not receive GM-CSF. Various neutropenic conditions (eg, idiopathic or congenital) may respond clinically to hematopoietic growth factors such as GM-CSF. Patients treated for 3 to 15 months continue to respond with significantly increased granulocytes and resolution of prior infection. The subcutaneous route of administration is convenient and patients seem to accept it readily. It is difficult to determine the extent to which adjunctive therapy with GM-CSF will be cost effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Demetri, G D', 'Antman, K H']","['Demetri GD', 'Antman KH']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/therapy', 'Animals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(92)90142-N [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1992 Aug;19(4):362-85.,['P01CA-38493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,212,,,,,,,,,,

Isolation and biochemical characterization.,97-107,"RNA synthesis in cell and cell-free systems is inhibited by a family of acidic, low molecular weight chromatin peptides (CPs). These peptides were extracted from deproteinized DNA of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, but the low yield of purified material by this procedure hinders efforts aimed at understanding their action mechanism in gene regulation. In this report we describe two purification methods of CPs from an easily available source, wheat germ. A comparison is made between the method starting from deproteinized DNA and the method from purified chromatin. The biological effects (inhibition of L1210 cell growth and DNA in vitro transcription) of CPs from wheat germ together with their chemical characteristics (molecular weight, amino acid composition and presence of phosphoserine) show strong homology with those of CPs from other sources. These results suggest a possible role of these chromatin peptides in controlling gene expression.","['Mancinelli, L', 'Castigli, E', 'Qualadrucci, P', 'Gianfranceschi, G L', 'Bramucci, M', 'Miano, A', 'Amici, D']","['Mancinelli L', 'Castigli E', 'Qualadrucci P', 'Gianfranceschi GL', 'Bramucci M', 'Miano A', 'Amici D']","['Institute of Cell Biology, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Physiol Chem Phys Med NMR,Physiological chemistry and physics and medical NMR,8502230,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",IM,,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Chromatin/chemistry/*physiology', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Seeds', 'Thymus Gland', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Triticum/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Physiol Chem Phys Med NMR. 1992;24(2):97-107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Red cells of copper-deficient animals have less hemoglobin than their copper-adequate counterparts. The objective of this work was to determine what role copper plays in maintaining hemoglobin levels. It was hypothesized that the primary defect lies in intracellular iron metabolism. The influence of copper supplementation on iron uptake and storage was examined in a cell line capable of hemoglobin synthesis. The results demonstrated that copper supplementation of human K562 cells was associated with higher cytosolic iron levels and ferritin levels. Copper supplementation of the cell culture altered the initial rate of iron uptake from transferrin and enhanced iron uptake in noninduced cells; however, in hemin-induced K562 cells, which express fewer transferrin receptors on the cell surface, copper appeared to reduce iron uptake. Subsequent studies showed that the cells were able to take up the same amount of iron from transferrin when incubated over a longer period of time (24 hr). In the noninduced (non-hemoglobin synthesizing) cells, proportionally more iron was associated with the ferritin. We concluded from these studies that copper affects both uptake and storage of iron and that copper supplementation reduces cellular iron turnover.","['Percival, S S']",['Percival SS'],"['Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

We report here that hemin activates the DNA-binding activity of HSF2, whereas heat shock induces predominantly the DNA-binding activity of a distinct factor, HSF1. This constitutes the first example of HSF2 activation in vivo. Both hemin and heat shock treatments resulted in equivalent levels of HSF-HSE complexes as analyzed in vitro by gel mobility shift assay, yet transcription of the hsp70 gene was stimulated much less by hemin-induced HSF than by heat shock-induced HSF. Genomic footprinting experiments revealed that hemin-induced HSF and heat shock-induced HSF, HSF2, and HSF1, respectively, occupy the HSE of the human hsp70 promoter in a similar yet not identical manner.

Transcription of the lyn gene in T lymphocytes was shown to be induced by the p40tax protein encoded by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. For determination of the mechanism of p40tax-mediated trans activation, the transcriptional promoter region of the lyn gene was characterized. By endonuclease S1 mapping, the transcriptional initiation sites were identified within the 770-bp EcoRI-SacI fragment of the 5'-terminal portion of the human lyn gene. This fragment showed promoter activity when placed upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and transfected into various cell lines. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the lyn promoter region contained four GC box-like sequences but not a TATA or CCAAT box. In addition, it contained sequences characteristic of a cyclic AMP-responsive element, octamer-binding motif, PEA3-like motifs, and NF kappa B-binding motif-like sequence. Mutational analysis suggested that the octamer-binding motif sequence is of primary importance for the lyn promoter activity but that the other elements are not. Cotransfection of various chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs containing different length of the lyn promoter together with p40tax expression plasmids into Jurkat T cells showed that the sequence responsible for p40tax-induced transcription is present around the transcription initiation sites.","['Uchiumi, F', 'Semba, K', 'Yamanashi, Y', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Yoshida, M', 'Inoue, K', 'Toyoshima, K', 'Yamamoto, T']","['Uchiumi F', 'Semba K', 'Yamanashi Y', 'Fujisawa J', 'Yoshida M', 'Inoue K', 'Toyoshima K', 'Yamamoto T']","['Department of Oncology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oncogene Protein pp60(v-src)/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*src-Family Kinases']",1992/09/01 00:00,2000/06/01 00:00,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 00:00 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.12.9.3784-3795.1992 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1992 Sep;12(9):3784-95. doi: 10.1128/mcb.12.9.3784-3795.1992.,,,,"['lyn', 'src']",PMC360245,,,,,,,,,,,

RBTN1 and RBTN3-derived proteins have 98% identity in the LIM domains but are located on separate chromosomes in man and in mouse while RBTN1 and RBTN2, both located on human chromosome 11p but are on separate chromosomes in mouse, are only 48% identical in this part of the protein. The exon organization of RBTN1 and RBTN3 genes are similar, both having an intron, absent from the RBTN2 gene, in the LIM2-encoding region. The remarkable similarity between rbtn-1 and rbtn-3 proteins is parallelled in their expression patterns in mouse development, since both genes show high expression in restricted areas of the brain, but little lymphoid expression. rbtn-2 expression, however, is more ubiquitous. This gene shows a low level of thymus expression but high expression in fetal liver, adult spleen and B-cell lines, consistent with a role in B-cell development.

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of dual-wavelength fluorometry using a pH-dependent indicator (5,6-carboxyfluorescein: 5,6-CF) for the detection of tumour areas in vivo. 5,6-CF has two main characteristics: it has two wavelengths of maximum absorbance (465 and 490 nm) and its fluorescence emission (maximum, 515 nm) increases as a function of pH in the physiological pH range of 6-7.4. The experimental study was performed on 28 CDF mice bearing lymphoid leukaemia P388 grafted subcutaneously. The tissue pH values were evaluated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities (I490/I465) on the basis of a calibration curve linking pH measurements performed within the tissue using a microelectrode and values of the fluorescence intensity ratio. The fluorescence intensity reached its maximum value 60 min after 5,6-CF and glucose administration, followed by a plateau (90 min) when the ratios remained constant at 1.79 +/- 0.05 for normal tissue and 1.35 +/- 0.04 for tumour tissue (p less than 0.005).

Work toward purification of this factor has been hampered by variability in activity of PMN-derived NDS. Using a human-derived intestinal epithelial cell line (T84) that serves as a model for studies of the regulation of electrogenic Cl- secretion, we find that the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 secrets a factor with NDS-like activity. Buffer conditioned by HL-60 cells (10(7) cells/ml for 1 h), when applied to T84 monolayers grown on permeable supports and analyzed by routine electrophysiological techniques, elicited a short-circuit current (Isc) of 11.7 +/- 1.02 microA/cm2. This short-circuit current was sensitive to bumetanide, an inhibitor of the basolateral Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, and was dependent on the presence of chloride in the assay buffers. Such data indicate that buffer conditioned by HL-60 cells stimulates electrogenic Cl- secretion. Like NDS, the active factor in HL-60-conditioned buffer has a nominal molecular weight of less than 500 and was increased by activation of cells with phorbol ester. 125I and 86Rb efflux assays confirmed that the secretagogue released by stimulated HL-60 cells, similar to PMN-derived NDS, preferentially stimulates opening of Cl- rather than K+ channels in T84 cells. Lastly, release of NDS-like bioactivity increases when HL-60 cells are differentiated toward granulocytes compared to cells differentiated toward monocytes.","['Colgan, S P', 'Matthews, J B', 'Parkos, C A', 'Delp, C', 'Awtrey, C S', 'Madara, J L']","['Colgan SP', 'Matthews JB', 'Parkos CA', 'Delp C', 'Awtrey CS', 'Madara JL']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Chlorides)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorides/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.52.2.183 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1992 Aug;52(2):183-7. doi: 10.1002/jlb.52.2.183.,"['DK33506/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK35932/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07066/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a 45-week period of culture, HL60 cells developed a progressive increase in rate of replication. Concomitantly, undifferentiated cells developed an impairment in ATP-induced calcium mobilization. The percentage of cells that could be differentiated with dimethyl sulfoxide progressively diminished. Differentiated cells developed an impairment in both the respiratory burst and secretion of beta-glucuronidase. In addition, regulation of the respiratory burst by cAMP agonists including isoproterenol, adenosine, and prostaglandin E2 was reduced in rapidly proliferating cells. Thus, multiple changes in stimulus-response coupling occur during cell culture in association with an increase in rate of cell replication. It may be important to recognize progressive impairments in cell function in studies using repetitive samples of HL60 cells from a continuously maintained cell population.

Inasmuch as previous genetic studies indicated a major role in susceptibility for the H-2D locus within the MHC, the effect of CD8+ T cells in A/J resistance to MAIDS was analyzed by depletion of this subset using mAb. A/J mice treated with anti-CD8 mAb beginning soon after inoculation with LP-BM5 MuLV developed disease within 5 wk after virus inoculation. Histopathologic and flow cytometry alteration of tissues and cells from the mAb-treated mice were identical to those seen in virus-infected MAIDS-sensitive strains, and assays for MuLV demonstrated high-level expression of ecotropic MuLV and integration of BM5def. Parallel studies of A/J mice treated with anti-CD4 mAb after infection revealed enhanced expression of ecotropic MuLV but no integration of BM5def, and no signs of MAIDS were detected. These observations indicate that CD8+ T cells are critical in the resistance of A/J mice to LP-BM5 MuLV replication and development of disease and suggest that CD4+ T cells play a role in regulation of ecotropic virus replication.","['Makino, M', 'Chattopadhyay, S K', 'Hartley, J W', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Makino M', 'Chattopadhyay SK', 'Hartley JW', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'CD8 Antigens/*physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1992 Sep 1;149(5):1702-6.,['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite these established benefits, few PEG proteins are in use. Current coupling methods are either traumatic for the protein or involve lengthy and difficult procedures to activate monomethoxyPEG (MPEG). We have applied a new coupling method that allows coupling of MPEG directly to proteins under physiological conditions. Using this method with recombinant human (rh)granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) we were able to construct biologically active PEG-GM-CSF. Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and phase-partitioning confirmed the presence of PEG modification, and the former was used to fractionate modified and unmodified material. Bioactivity was measured in colony assays of normal human bone marrow cells and by tritiated thymidine uptake (of chronic myeloid leukemia cells and TF-1 cells). With both uptake and colony assays, using unfractionated material, we observed only a modest reduction in biological activity. Assays of FPLC-fractionated material confirmed that much of the bioactivity of the PEG-GM-CSF preparations was due to the modified species and any residual unmodified GM-CSF. Species uncontaminated by tresylmonomethoxyPEG (TMPEG; which was somewhat inhibitory in the thymidine uptake assay and eluted over a broad region of the FPLC profile) had no significant reduction in activity, but we cannot rule out the possibility that PEG-GM-CSF species eluting elsewhere in the profile had modest reduction of activity. Subcutaneous injection into mice confirmed the anticipated improved half-life in vivo and demonstrated a longer uptake from the injection site. This is, as far as we are aware, the first successful construction of PEG-GM-CSF with conserved biological activity.","['Malik, F', 'Delgado, C', 'Knusli, C', 'Irvine, A E', 'Fisher, D', 'Francis, G E']","['Malik F', 'Delgado C', 'Knusli C', 'Irvine AE', 'Fisher D', 'Francis GE']","['Molecular Cell Pathology Laboratory, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Lysine/analysis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Sep;20(8):1028-35.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of terminal differentiation in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 by dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO) is accompanied by a block of RNA elongation within the first exon of the c-myc gene. We have studied the 3'-structure of incompletely elongated transcripts in (i) nuclear RNA of induced and uninduced HL60 cells, (ii) nuclear run-on RNA, and (iii) RNA of in vitro transcribed c-myc constructs. Elongation of c-myc RNA stopped in all three transcriptional systems at similar sites distributed 150-350 bases downstream of the P2 promoter. When HL60 cells were induced to terminal differentiation the short c-myc exon 1 specific RNAs disappeared in nuclear RNA. This implied that RNA polymerase II (pol II) does not continue to transcribe c-myc exon 1 in induced HL60 cells as suggested by earlier nuclear run-on experiments. Therefore, kinetic experiments with small oligonucleotides as probes were performed to determine the start position of pol II on c-myc exon 1 in nuclear run-ons. The results demonstrate that all RNA polymerases are localized at the c-myc P2 promoter in DMSO-treated HL60 cells. Preparation of nuclei for run-on experiments induces a release of pol II from the c-myc P2 promoter leading to the strong nuclear run-on signal on c-myc exon 1. Thus, down-regulation of c-myc in differentiating HL60 cells occurs by retention of pol II at the transcription start site.","['Strobl, L J', 'Eick, D']","['Strobl LJ', 'Eick D']","['Institut fur Klinische Molekularbiologie und Tumorgenetik, Forschungszentrum fur Umwelt und Gesundheit, GSF, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell-Free System', 'Down-Regulation', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, myc', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1992 Sep;11(9):3307-14.,,,,,PMC556865,,,,,,,,,,,

Since its rapid elimination from the bloodstream seems to have descouraged the clinical evaluation of this drug, we explored the potential use of masked derivatives of CF3dUrd as ""depot"" forms of the parent compound. First, we observed that the toxicity of CF3dUrd against HeLA cells in culture was 10(4) times greater for a 24-h treatment as compared with a 1-h treatment at identical concentrations of the drug, which suggests the importance of using a prolonged treatment period. In fact, the divided dosing of CF3dUrd to L1210-bearing mice was markedly more effective than its single administration. 5'-O-Hexanoyl-, N3-p-butylbenzoyl-, 5'-O-benzyloxy-methyl-, and 3'-O-benzyl-CF3dUrd were found to be effective in maintaining the CF3dUrd concentration in plasma. The oral doses of these agents required to achieve 50% growth inhibition (ED50) in mice bearing sarcoma 180 tumors were 19, 34, 10, and 13 mg kg-1 day-1, respectively, whereas that of CF3dUrd was 63 mg kg-1 day-1. The ED50 values for these compounds were inversely correlated with the residence time of CF3dUrd in plasma. The therapeutic indices of these compounds, calculated as the dose producing a 50% inhibition of body-weight gain (IB50) divided by the ED50 value (1.89, 1.21, 1.40, and 2.15, respectively), were significantly higher than that of CF3dUrd (0.78).

In this model system, sensitive and resistant P388 murine leukemia cells are inoculated i.v. into mice, and each antitumor agent is injected via the i.v. route. Vincristine (VCR) had no effect on the survival of mice bearing VCR-resistant P388, a relatively poorly resistant subline, when given either as a single agent or in combination with AHC-52. In contrast, adriamycin (ADR) alone had no effect on these mice, but its combination with AHC-52 resulted in significant survival, the maximal value achieved being 196% (treated mice/control animals, T/C). Etoposide (VP-16) strongly enhanced survival, even when used alone, and this effect was markedly potentiated by AHC-52.

On the basis of these results, the feasibility of this type of combination therapy is discussed.","['Shinoda, H', 'Ebisu, H', 'Mitsuhashi, J', 'Inaba, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Shinoda H', 'Ebisu H', 'Mitsuhashi J', 'Inaba M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Central Research Laboratories, Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Dihydropyridines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '119666-09-0 (AHC 52)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dihydropyridines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00689959 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1992;30(5):335-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00689959.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic cells of the bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood were examined on a FACS 440 apparatus for establishment of the diagnosis before treatment was initiated. Individual immunological subtypes were differentiated by means of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. 80.5% of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias originated from different developmental stages of B cells, 12.5% were formed by leukaemias from T cells and 7% were non-differentiated leukaemias. The mean follow-up period in the group was 33 months. According to the therapeutic results children with leukaemia ensuing from precursors of B cells had a more favourable prognosis than children with T leukaemia and children with non-differentiated leukaemia. Quantitative examination of nuclear DNA of leukaemic cells revealed in 55% of the patients of the group aneuploidy with clear predominance of hyperdiploidy, 45% of the patients suffered from diploidy. The least number of relapses was recorded in the investigation period in children with hyperploid acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The proliferating activity of leukaemic blasts was expressed by the number of cells in the S + G2M stage of the cellular cycle and was higher in the bone marrow than in peripheral blood but did not differ in individual immunological subtypes or in diploid leukaemias. The authors were not able to prove its prognostic importance. Flow cytometry is a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method which makes it possible to characterize more satisfactorily the heterogeneous group of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias.","['Stary, J', 'Sokol, L', 'Hausner, P', 'Hrodek, O', 'Sedmihorska, J', 'Volejnikova, J', 'Vlachynsky, M']","['Stary J', 'Sokol L', 'Hausner P', 'Hrodek O', 'Sedmihorska J', 'Volejnikova J', 'Vlachynsky M']","['II. detska klinika fakultni nemocnice Motol, Praha.']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,,IM,,"['Cell Separation', 'Child', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",1992/06/19 00:00,1992/06/19 00:01,['1992/06/19 00:00'],"['1992/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1992 Jun 19;131(12):364-7.,,Vyuziti prutokove cytometrie v diagnostice akutnich leukemii detskeho veku.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lethally irradiated mice or mice with inherited severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) were grafted with 14 days gestation allogeneic fetal liver cells, then subjected to a follow-up for the immune tolerance to the donor and the normal or subnormal immune reconstitution allowing prevention of diabetes in NOD mice or cure of leukemia in AKR mice and of immunodeficiency in SCID mice. Briefly, when normal CBA mice were lethally irradiated and then grafted with allogeneic fetal liver cells from Balb/c mice, a specific immune tolerance was induced to donor skin grafts. Unrelated skin grafts were rejected and a response to antigens was observed in these chimeras. However, despite the capacity to develop hyperacute rejection of skin allografts, following hyperimmunization, these chimeric mice did not produce anti-H2 cytotoxic antibodies. In SCID mice (CB17), the immune reconstitution occurred when mice were grafted with allogeneic (C57/B16) as well as with syngeneic fetal liver cells. Human cells were found in SCID mice following implantation of human fetal liver and thymus cells. When NOD mice were irradiated, then grafted with allogeneic fetal liver cells, a large part of donor cells were found in NOD recipients, correlating with a low incidence of diabetes. Leukemic AKR mice grafted with allogeneic fetal liver cells had virtually no leukemia relapse, suggesting a strong graft-versus-leukemia effect following such a transplant.","['Sanhadji, K', 'Touraine, J L', 'Aitouche, A', 'Vicari, A', 'Chargui, J', 'Goillot, E']","['Sanhadji K', 'Touraine JL', 'Aitouche A', 'Vicari A', 'Chargui J', 'Goillot E']","['Transplantation and Clinical Immunology Unit, Pav P, Hopital Ed.

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Articles were identified via an English-language literature search of MEDLINE (1966-91) and an extensive search of bibliographies from identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Human clinical trials and case reports were selected for evaluation. DATA EXTRACTION: The literature was assessed for quality, methodology, and outcome information. DATA SYNTHESIS: At dosages of 4 mg/m2 administered every other week for 6-9 months, pentostatin has been shown to successfully induce a complete response in 58-90 percent of patients and to produce a partial response in up to 30 percent of patients with HCL. The median time to achieve a response is 4.7 months. Long-term remissions of at least 14 months' duration have occurred in some patients. Compared with interferon alfa alone, total response rates are not significantly different when pentostatin and interferon alfa are used in combination. When dosed appropriately, pentostatin is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, fever, and infection. CONCLUSIONS: Pentostatin is a purine analog that inhibits adenosine deaminase, a key enzyme necessary for purine salvage. Pentostatin has received labeling approval for the treatment of HCL refractory to a minimum of three to six months of treatment with interferon alfa. Based on current data, pentostatin will be a useful addition to the therapeutic agents presently available to patients with HCL. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness of pentostatin as first-line therapy for patients with HCL.","['Kane, B J', 'Kuhn, J G', 'Roush, M K']","['Kane BJ', 'Kuhn JG', 'Roush MK']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacy, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",IM,,"['*Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Age Factors', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Pentostatin/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/106002809202600718 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1992 Jul-Aug;26(7-8):939-47. doi: 10.1177/106002809202600718.,,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,

HdUrd had no effect in preventing the inhibitory effects of 5-fluorouracil. These data suggested that HdUrd was an inhibitor of nucleoside transport in L1210 cells (Cory, J. G.; Halley, M. C.; Janey, A.; Lapis, K. Cancer Res. 50:4552-4556; 1990). Studies have now been carried out which show that HdUrd inhibits nucleoside transport as measured by [3H]uridine or [3H]formycin B transport into L1210 cells in culture. The IC50 for HdUrd inhibition of total [3H]uridine uptake was approximately 20 microM in wild-type L1210 cells. Since wild-type L1210 cells have three distinct nucleoside transporters, the effect of HdUrd on each transporter was examined using the non-metabolized nucleoside analog, formycin B. The nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (NBMPR)-sensitive transporter, es, was most sensitive to HdUrd with an IC50 of 1.0 +/- 0.1 microM; the NBMPR-insensitive transporter, ei, was much less sensitive to HdUrd with an IC50 of 32 +/- 2 microM; the sodium ion-dependent transporter, cif, was the least sensitive transporter to HdUrd with an IC50 of 130 +/- 5 microM. These data support the concept that HdUrd, a relatively non-cytotoxic agent, could be useful in increasing the potency of antitumor inhibitors directed at the de novo pathways for nucleotide synthesis through the blockage of the salvage pathways for nucleosides.","['Cory, J G', 'Downes, D L', 'Ng, C Y', 'Belt, J A']","['Cory JG', 'Downes DL', 'Ng CY', 'Belt JA']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University, School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Formycins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '13877-76-4 (formycin B)', ""57741-93-2 (5-hexyl-2'-deoxyuridine)"", 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Formycins/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/*metabolism']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1992;4(4-5):175-9.,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major focus of attention is the two-hit mutational model. A simple mathematical representation is used to explore mechanisms which might lead to onset of leukaemia at an unusually early age. Two such mechanisms are considered. The first of these, a germinal or very early embryonic first mutation is shown to imply that multiple independent leukaemic clones are likely to arise sequentially in very young patients. Clonal multiplicity could underlie the poor prognosis which has been associated with early onset childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It implies that curative therapy might require intensive treatment followed by bone marrow rescue to ensure eradication of all single-hit predisposed target cells. The prediction of multiple leukaemic clones might be tested in female patients by means of X-linked restriction fragment length polymorphisms and in patients with B-lineage neoplasms by determination of immunoglobin gene rearrangements. A second mechanism for early onset leukaemogenesis is the occurrence of a high cellular mutation rate in some patients. This is shown to result in leukaemia at significantly earlier age if the mutation rate is sufficiently high to influence target cell loss rate. This mechanism would enable more rapid clonal evolution of leukaemic cells and the early emergence of drug resistant variants. The prediction might be tested experimentally by sequential observation of genetic markers (e.g. Karyotypes, DNA fingerprint patterns) and the rate of emergence of drug resistant phenotypes.

Cells were incubated for 3 days in the presence of two drugs (ICRF-154 and one other), and cell growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay. Effects of drug combinations at the ID50 level were analysed using the isobologram method (Steel). In the lymphoblastic leukaemia cell lines, MOLT-3, HSB, and B-ALL, supra-additive effects were observed for ICRF-154 in combination with amsacrine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide. Additive effects were observed for its combinations with cisplatin, CPT-11, cytosine arabinoside, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and vincristine. Sub-additive to protective effects were observed in combination with methotrexate. In an erythroleukaemia cell line, K-562, no drug showed supra-additive effects with ICRF-154, while sub-additive to protective effects were observed for ICRF-154 in combination with cisplatin and methotrexate. The other drugs showed additive effects with ICRF-154. These results indicate that the combined effects of ICRF-154 with other agents vary, depending on the cell line. Against lymphoid malignancies, ICRF-154 would be advantageous when administered simultaneously with many anticancer agents. Of such agents, amsacrine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, and etoposide are the most suitable, while methotrexate is least suitable for such combined treatment.","['Kano, Y', 'Narita, T', 'Suzuki, K', 'Akutsu, M', 'Suda, K', 'Sakamoto, S', 'Miura, Y']","['Kano Y', 'Narita T', 'Suzuki K', 'Akutsu M', 'Suda K', 'Sakamoto S', 'Miura Y']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Tochigi Cancer Center, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', 'QML51S42CD (1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazin-1-yl)ethane)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Razoxane/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1992.257 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1992 Aug;66(2):281-6. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1992.257.,,,,,PMC1977796,,,,,,,,,,,

(b) Does reducing serum cholesterol increase the occurrence of cancer? Some elevated risk of cancer for males with low serum cholesterol levels has been noted: the median of the studies examined is consistent with a 30% increased risk. The answer for females is less clear. The median of the studies examined suggests no more than a 5-10% increased risk associated with having low serum cholesterol. However, the risk seems to depend strongly on whether females have a central or peripheral body fat pattern (54). The cancers most consistently associated with low serum cholesterol levels are those of the colon and lung in males, the cervix and breast (but only for females under 50 years of age) in females, and leukemia in both sexes. In contrast, high cholesterol levels have been linked with an increase in brain cancer. While immunologic, genetic, and dietary explanations have been offered to explain the association, it is difficult to support the idea that low serum cholesterol causes cancer in any direct manner. First, the findings themselves tend to be generally weak and somewhat inconsistent. Second, the strong influence of fat distribution in women suggests that a metabolic/hormonal basis underlies the association. One would not expect the results to differ by body fat pattern if the relationship were a causal one. Finally, if there were a direct causal role, one would expect populations with low serum cholesterol levels to have higher cancer rates. In China, counties with the lowest average plasma cholesterol levels have the lowest cancer rates (78). While this observation is open to a number of interpretations, it does not support the idea that low serum cholesterol is a tumor initiator. In aggregate, the trials of lipid-lowering interventions reviewed here show an increase in cancer occurrence (primarily mortality) of approximately 24% in the cholesterol-lowered groups. However, the post-trial experience has shown a comparative deficit of cancer occurrence in the experimental groups. Recent evidence indicates that products in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway affect DNA replication and cell proliferation. These findings suggests a mechanism by which cholesterol lowering might accelerate the development of tumors already initiated. The data that have been reviewed in no way suggest that treatment of hypercholesterolemia should not be pursued. They do suggest the presence of a relatively small subpopulation in whom reduction of plasma cholesterol may lead to increased occurrence of cancer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kritchevsky, S B', 'Kritchevsky, D']","['Kritchevsky SB', 'Kritchevsky D']","['Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Nutr,Annual review of nutrition,8209988,['97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)'],IM,,"['Cholesterol/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev.nu.12.070192.002135 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Nutr. 1992;12:391-416. doi: 10.1146/annurev.nu.12.070192.002135.,,,,,,120,,,,,,,,,,

LIF did not block differentiation in a parent F9 cell line. For OTF9 cells, LIF acts early in differentiation, inhibiting the appearance of parietal endoderm-type product cells. However, it acts subsequent to retinoic acid, and at least one early retinoic acid-induced event is unaltered in the presence of LIF.

The panel is organized into 7 subpanels; 6 leukemia/lymphoma lines comprise one subpanel, and 54 other lines are organized into subpanels representing solid tumors of the central nervous system (CNS), colon, lung, ovaries, kidneys and melanomas. In the present study, the leukemia and lymphoma cell lines were analyzed by flow cytometry for appropriate CD antigens; all but 1 line showed patterns of expression consistent with their reported derivations. The solid tumor lines were characterized individually using morphological and immunocytochemical techniques to determine their relative degrees of representativity for the subpanels within which they are currently grouped. Histological, histochemical and ultrastructural examinations were performed on cell lines grown under identical conventional culture conditions and as xenografts in nude mice. Immunocytochemistry using panels of antibodies raised against 6 types of intermediate filaments, 7 adenocarcinoma-associated antigens, 7 melanoma/neuro-ectodermal-associated antigens, 3 neuroendocrine-associated antigens, 9 urinary tract associated antigens, and 4 markers of muscle differentiation was done on cells grown in monolayer culture. Central nervous system (CNS) cell lines lacked expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, but all had other features consistent with derivation from glioblastoma. Lines derived from adenocarcinomas of the colon, lung and ovary, for the most part, expressed adenocarcinoma-associated antigens and showed histological and/or ultrastructural evidence of gland formation and other adenomatous features. Most of these lines were poorly differentiated. Lines derived from large-cell and squamous-cell cancers also showed some characteristics consistent with their reported origins, except for one line which showed immunocytochemical and morphologic characteristics consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma. The 2 lines derived from small cell lung cancer (SCLC) lacked neurosecretory granules and 3 other SCLC markers but showed morphologic features consistent with SCLC. Most melanoma cell lines strongly expressed melanoma-associated antigens and were morphologically similar to human melanoma. Five lines produced premelanosomes, melanosomes or melanin. Most of the renal cancer cell lines showed morphologic or immunocytochemical features consistent with renal clear cell carcinoma. Collectively, these morphological and immunocytochemical analyses provide information concerning tissue of origin, tumor type, degree of differentiation and other biologic features essential to the use of these lines in a disease-oriented in vitro antitumor drug screen and to the interpretation of data derived therefrom.","['Stinson, S F', 'Alley, M C', 'Kopp, W C', 'Fiebig, H H', 'Mullendore, L A', 'Pittman, A F', 'Kenney, S', 'Keller, J', 'Boyd, M R']","['Stinson SF', 'Alley MC', 'Kopp WC', 'Fiebig HH', 'Mullendore LA', 'Pittman AF', 'Kenney S', 'Keller J', 'Boyd MR']","['Laboratory of Drug Discovery Research and Development, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702-1201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lung Neoplasms/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Melanoma/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/ultrastructure']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1992 Jul-Aug;12(4):1035-53.,['N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen episodes of PRCA occurred in four patients with CLL. Eleven episodes were treated with conventional therapies which included an alkylating agent and prednisone. Four episodes that failed to respond to conventional therapies and an additional three episodes were treated with CYA and prednisone. Six of the seven episodes, including three of four which had failed conventional therapies, responded to CYA plus prednisone compared with six of eleven episodes treated with conventional therapies. Response to CYA and prednisone occurred without a reduction in leukemic mass. In contrast, PRCA remission did not occur until after leukemic mass reduction in three of four patients treated successfully with conventional therapies. Time to response was shorter (14 +/- 3 days) with CYA plus prednisone than with conventional therapies (154 +/- 97 days) in three of four patients. These results indicate that CYA plus prednisone is an effective therapy for the induction of remission from PRCA in patients with CLL.","['Chikkappa, G', 'Pasquale, D', 'Zarrabi, M H', 'Weiler, R J', 'Divakara, M', 'Tsan, M F']","['Chikkappa G', 'Pasquale D', 'Zarrabi MH', 'Weiler RJ', 'Divakara M', 'Tsan MF']","['Medical Service, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, Albany, N.Y. 12208.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,['Am J Hematol. 1994 Feb;45(2):192.

The two groups were fully comparable in terms of clinical characteristics and level of response obtained by chemotherapy. IFN alpha was given at a dose of 3 megaunits three times a week intramuscularly for 1 year. The IFN-treated patient group showed a significantly longer duration of response and a less frequent incidence of infections as compared to the no treatment group. A minority of patients who had had partial response to chemotherapy obtained complete remission while on therapy with IFN alpha. Toxicity was mild and patient compliance was excellent.

Treatment of erythroblasts with an iron chelator, desferrioxamine, induced an increase in surface Tf.R number associated with an elevation of biosynthetic rate and the mRNA level of Tf.R. Reduced cellular iron pool increased the Tf.R number by altering the level of mRNA, as in nonhemoglobin-producing cells. Although treatment of erythroblasts with hemin induced a decrease in the biosynthetic rate and in the level of mRNA, the number of surface Tf.R did not decrease. This phenomenon may explain the fact that a high level of serum iron has no influence on the surface Tf.R number in vivo, as we reported previously. We suggest the existence of a regulatory mechanism specific for hemoglobin-producing cells that keeps surface Tf.R expression constant despite iron loading.","['Abe, Y', 'Muta, K', 'Nishimura, J', 'Nawata, H']","['Abe Y', 'Muta K', 'Nishimura J', 'Nawata H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis', 'Erythroblasts/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/blood/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830400406 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1992 Aug;40(4):270-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830400406.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML cells from 8 of 15 patients incorporated high levels of 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) in the absence of exogenous growth factors. The spontaneous DNA synthesis could be abrogated with monospecific antibodies directed toward IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, or TNF-alpha, as well as with antigranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Human recombinant GM-CSF reversed the inhibitory action of each of these antibodies and reinduced DNA synthesis in AML cells. Thus, in these cases, constitutively produced IL-1 or TNF-alpha had stimulated the synthesis of GM-CSF, which resulted in GM-CSF-dependent proliferation of AML blasts. Exogenous IL-1 up-regulated the endogenous production of GM-CSF, suggesting a positive regulation of autocrine growth factor production. We also present evidence that TNF-alpha may exert both stimulative as well as inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis in AML cells. The enhancing effect of TNF-alpha was mediated through the induction of GM-CSF production, as stimulation of DNA synthesis in AML blasts could be abrogated with anti-GM-CSF antibody. A concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha on 3H-TdR incorporation into AML blasts was observed only when these cells were grown in the absence of GM-CSF. Finally, we show that human recombinant IFN-alpha is a potent inhibitor of AML cell proliferation in vitro.","['Carter, A', 'Silvian-Draxler, I', 'Tatarsky, I']","['Carter A', 'Silvian-Draxler I', 'Tatarsky I']","['Department of Hematology, Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tritium', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830400402 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1992 Aug;40(4):245-51. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830400402.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coordinate regulation of ferritin and transferrin receptor expression is produced by binding of a cytosolic protein, the iron-responsive element binding protein (IRE-BP) to specific stem-loop structures present in target RNAs. The affinity of this protein for its cognate RNA is regulated by the cell in response to changes in iron availability. The IRE-BP demonstrates a striking level of amino acid sequence identity to the iron-sulfur (Fe-S) protein mitochondrial aconitase. Moreover, the recombinant IRE-BP has aconitase function. The lability of the Fe-S cluster in mitochondrial aconitase has led us to propose that the mechanism by which iron levels are sensed by the IRE-BP involves changes in an Fe-S cluster in the IRE-BP. In this study, we demonstrate that procedures aimed at altering the IRE-BP Fe-S cluster in vitro reciprocally alter the RNA binding and aconitase activity of the IRE-BP. The changes in the RNA binding of the protein produced in vitro appear to match the previously described alterations of the protein in response to iron availability in the cell. Furthermore, iron manipulation of cells correlates with the activation or inactivation of the IRE-BP aconitase activity. The results are consistent with a model for the posttranslational regulation of the IRE-BP in which the Fe-S cluster is altered in response to the availability of intracellular iron and this, in turn, regulates the RNA-binding activity.","['Haile, D J', 'Rouault, T A', 'Tang, C K', 'Chin, J', 'Harford, J B', 'Klausner, R D']","['Haile DJ', 'Rouault TA', 'Tang CK', 'Chin J', 'Harford JB', 'Klausner RD']","['Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Iron-Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Iron-Sulfur Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 4.2.1.3 (Aconitate Hydratase)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,,"['Aconitate Hydratase/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Iron-Regulatory Proteins', 'Iron-Sulfur Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.89.16.7536 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1992 Aug 15;89(16):7536-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.89.16.7536.,,,,,PMC49745,,,,,,,,,,,

Transition between these phases is characterized by unregulated growth and loss of differentiation of myeloid cells and their progenitors. We recently reported that loss of normal p53 expression correlates with transition from the chronic to acute phase in at least 25% of cases of CML. However, the precise relationship between this loss and biologic features of acute-phase CML is uncertain. To study this question, we artificially expressed normal p53 in K562, an erythroid acute-phase CML cell line lacking normal p53 expression. Biological effects were assessed by determining several growth parameters and by measuring synthesis of hemoglobin, a feature of mature erythroid cells. K562 cells expressing normal p53 had an increased proportion of cells in G1 versus S + G2, a longer doubling time and a lower growth saturation density than control K562 cells or K562 cells with antisense p53. Cells with normal p53 also expressed up to 50-fold more hemoglobin than controls. These data are consistent with the notion that loss of p53 expression may be responsible for many of the features of acute-phase CML cells. The data also demonstrate direct involvement of p53 in differentiation processes.","['Feinstein, E', 'Gale, R P', 'Reed, J', 'Canaani, E']","['Feinstein E', 'Gale RP', 'Reed J', 'Canaani E']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,['743LRP9S7N (Hemin)'],IM,,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, p53', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1992 Sep;7(9):1853-7.,,,,['p53'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of a Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (LTR) c-myc construct into J774 cells resulted in constitutive expression of the exogenous myc gene and a concomitant increase in the degree of transformation and tumorigenicity of the cells. In addition, constitutive expression of exogenous myc inhibited induced differentiation of these cells by a variety of treatments including addition to the medium of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) as well as complete withdrawal of serum from the medium. The degree of increased transformation, tumorigenicity and inhibition of terminal differentiation was dependent upon the level of exogenous myc expression.

We established retroviral interference in mice by infecting them with Friend murine leukemia virus and them measured susceptibility to superinfection by challenging the mice with the erythroproliferative spleen focus-forming virus. Infection of approximately 10% of nucleated splenocytes rendered mice 1% as susceptible to superinfection as untreated controls. The magnitude of this effect was the same in mice incapable of producing neutralizing antibodies or genetically deficient for T cells.

Previously, by direct sequencing of MuSVts110 RNA transcribed in 6m2 cells, we established that the thermosensitive RNA splicing phenotype uniquely characteristic of MuSVts110 results from a deletion of 1,487 nucleotides of progenitor MuSV-124 sequences. As anticipated, the sequence obtained in this study contained precisely this same deletion. In addition, several other unexpected sequence differences were found between MuSVts110 and MuSV-124. For example, in the noncoding region upstream of the gag gene, MuSVts110 DNA contained a 52-nucleotide tract typical of murine leukemia virus rather than MuSV-124, suggesting that MuSVts110 originated as a MuSV-helper murine leukemia virus recombinant during reverse transcription rather than from a straightforward deletion within MuSV-124. In addition, both MuSVts110 long terminal repeats contained head-to-tail duplications of eight nucleotides in the U3 region. Finally, seven single-nucleotide substitutions were found scattered throughout MuSVts110 DNA. Three of the nucleotide substitutions were in the gag gene, resulting in one coding change in p15 and one in p30.

The key step in the synthetic route to 12a was Wittig condensation of the tributylphosphorane derived from 6-(bromomethyl)-2,4-diamino-5-methylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine (7a) with methyl 4-propionylbenzoate. Reaction conditions for the Wittig condensation were developed using the tributylphosphorane prepared from 6-(bromomethyl)-2,4-pteridinediamine (7b) as a model. Each of the respective Wittig products 8a and 8b was obtained in 75-80% yield. Hydrogenation of 8a and 8b at their 9,10-double bond afforded 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-ethyl-5-methyl-5,10-dideazapteroic acid methyl ester (9a) and 4-amino-4-deoxy-10-ethyl-10-deazapteroic acid methyl ester (9b).

Thus the Wittig approach affords an alternative synthetic route to 10-EDAM. Remaining steps were ester hydrolysis of 9a,b to give carboxylic acids 10a,b followed by standard peptide coupling with diethyl L-glutamate to produce diethyl esters 11a,b, which on hydrolysis gave 12a and 10-EDAM (12b), respectively. The relative influx of 12a was enhanced about 3.2-fold over MTX, but as an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from L1210 cells and in the inhibition of L1210 cell growth in vitro, this compound was approximately 20-fold less effective than MTX (DHFR inhibition, Ki = 4.82 +/- 0.60 pM for MTX, 100 pM for 12a; cell growth, IC50 = 3.4 +/- 1.0 nM for MTX, 65 +/- 18 nM for 12a).","['Piper, J R', 'Johnson, C A', 'Otter, G M', 'Sirotnak, F M']","['Piper JR', 'Johnson CA', 'Otter GM', 'Sirotnak FM']","['Kettering-Meyer Laboratory, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, Alabama 35255.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '139504-90-8 (10-ethyl-5-methyl-5,10-dideazaaminopterin)', 'JT4X6Z1HRR (edatrexate)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)']",IM,,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/08/07 00:00,1992/08/07 00:01,['1992/08/07 00:00'],"['1992/08/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/07 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00094a011 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1992 Aug 7;35(16):3002-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00094a011.,"['CA18856/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All SCID-BL lymphomas originate in the cells of the thymic graft (C57BL type) and lack murine leukemia virus expression. Both SCID and SCID-BL lymphomas are phenotypically CD4-8+ and/or CD4+8+, but only the SCID-BL tumors express CD3. Injection of C57BL or BALB/c bone marrow into irradiated SCID-BL mice prevents lymphoma development, but SCID marrow is completely ineffective.

Its effect on the susceptibility of K562 human erythroleukemic cells to lysis by antibody and complement was examined. As reported here, treatment of K562 cells with LR for 60 min at 37 degrees C confers on them resistance to complement damage. The LR-induced state of complement resistance is transient and the cells recover within 4-6 h unless a second dose of LR is added. The protective action of LR was observed using both conventional 51Cr-release and trypan blue inclusion assays. The protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin and cycloheximide and the protein kinase inhibitors tamoxifen, polymyxin B and W-7, could each block this action of LR. Fewer membrane attack complexes were found, following complement activation, on LR-treated than control cells.

After an oral load of retinoids we found that leukocytes from these patients took up at least as much retinoid as leukocytes in normal individuals, suggesting that uptake of chylomicron remnant retinyl esters may proceed independent of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. The expression of mRNA for the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, which is a putative chylomicron remnant receptor, was similar in leukocytes from a patient homozygous for familial hypercholesterolaemia and normal individuals. Six hours after vitamin A administration, recovery of unesterified retinol was 71% in normal leukocytes, however, only 9% unesterified retinol was recovered in leukocytes from the two patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Thus, the apparent rate of retinyl ester hydrolysis was markedly reduced in leukocytes from these patients, indicating different intracellular traffic of chylomicron remnants in normal individuals and patients homozygous for familial hypercholesterolaemia.","['Skrede, B', 'Blomhoff, R', 'Maelandsmo, G M', 'Ose, L', 'Myklebost, O', 'Norum, K R']","['Skrede B', 'Blomhoff R', 'Maelandsmo GM', 'Ose L', 'Myklebost O', 'Norum KR']","['Institute for Nutrition Research, School of Medicine, University of Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Clin Invest,European journal of clinical investigation,0245331,"['0 (Chylomicrons)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Retinoids)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)']",IM,,"['Biological Transport, Active', 'Chylomicrons/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Receptors, LDL/metabolism', 'Retinoids/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Vitamin A/blood/pharmacokinetics']",1992/04/01 00:00,1992/04/01 00:01,['1992/04/01 00:00'],"['1992/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2362.1992.tb01456.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Invest. 1992 Apr;22(4):229-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2362.1992.tb01456.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was confirmed, the original blood and bone-marrow smear was re-examined and classified, 584 cases in all (3.2%). During the same period acute myeloid leukaemia had been diagnosed in 506 patients (2.8%). The average annual incidence of MDS in the Dusseldorf area was 3.65 per 100,000 inhabitants. Over 80% of cases occurred from the age of 60 years, while 7% were younger than 50 years. The sex ratio was the same in all subgroups of MDS, except chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (male:female ratio 1:1.57). 31 patients (5.3%) had received ionizing radiation and/or cytostatic or immunosuppressive treatment for various underlying diseases before MDS had been diagnosed (secondary MDS). Preceding occupational contact with organic solvents could not be excluded with certainty in 12 patients. These data suggest that MDS is a relatively frequent disease of hematopoiesis among the older age groups. The proportion of secondary (treatment-induced) forms is small and does not explain the recently observed increased incidence.","['Aul, C', 'Gattermann, N', 'Germing, U', 'Runde, V', 'Heyll, A']","['Aul C', 'Gattermann N', 'Germing U', 'Runde V', 'Heyll A']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Universitat Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Germany, West/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Factors']",1992/08/14 00:00,1992/08/14 00:01,['1992/08/14 00:00'],"['1992/08/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/14 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1062434 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 1992 Aug 14;117(33):1223-31. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1062434.,,Myelodysplastische Syndrome.

Selection of unrelated bone marrow donors currently relies on serological HLA identity and negative mixed lymphocyte reactions between donor/recipient pairs. As serological HLA-DP typing is not feasible, we used the HLA-DPB1 oligonucleotide typing method to investigate whether the current selection procedure can guarantee complete MHC class II identity. In 40 consecutive patients, one third (62/193) serologically HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR and -DQ identical donors were found to be MLC negative with a relative response below 5%. HLA-DPB1 oligonucleotide typing of these MLC negative donors revealed that again only one third (20/62) was also identical for DP with their presumptive recipients. In the majority of pairs a disparity in graft-versus-host direction or in host-versus-graft direction of at least one allele was seen. These data indicate that in spite of the strict MLC criteria used, the current procedure did not warrant complete MHC class II identity. This implies that oligotyping for DPB1 can improve matching and should be introduced for typing of volunteers. We speculate that DP differences may contribute to the higher incidence of graft-versus-host disease or graft rejection in unrelated transplants.","['Eiermann, T H', 'Ballas, M', 'Fakler, J', 'Muller, C', 'Wolpl, A', 'Goldmann, S F']","['Eiermann TH', 'Ballas M', 'Fakler J', 'Muller C', 'Wolpl A', 'Goldmann SF']","['Dept. of Transplantationsimmunology, University of Ulm, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed,Infusionstherapie und Transfusionsmedizin,9209406,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'DNA Probes', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'HLA-DP Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/genetics/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/genetics/immunology']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000222601 [doi]'],ppublish,Infusionsther Transfusionsmed. 1992 Jun;19(3):127-9. doi: 10.1159/000222601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In normal mice, indomethacin increased ASGM-1+ cells in the spleen and BM by 7 days of continuous drug administration relative to control, while the numbers of Lyt-2+ cells in both organs remained unaltered. The presence of a tumor in untreated mice resulted, by 14 days development, in elevated numbers of ASGM-1+ cells in the spleen and BM. Lyt-2+ cells in the spleen increased transiently (7 days) in tumor-bearing (TB) mice and returned to normal levels by 14 days TB. No difference in either early- or late-stage TB was observed in the numbers of Lyt-2+ cells in the BM. In spleen and BM of TB mice, indomethacin increased ASGM-1+ cells by 7 days TB. ASGM-1+ cells returned to untreated levels by 14 days TB in both organs in spite of continued drug treatment. The numbers of Lyt-2+ cells in both the spleen and BM of 7 days indomethacin-treated TB mice were reduced relative to those of untreated TB mice. By 14 days TB, drug treatment had no effect on Lyt-2+ cell numbers in the spleen or BM. Spontaneous cytolytic activity of the spleen and BM did not always parallel changes in the numbers of ASGM-1+ cells, indicating the presence of late, immature, prelytic NK cells among the ASGM-1+ cell numbers.

The BI-CFC bind to stroma and form colonies when overlaid with agar; the pre-CFU-GM bind to stroma and release CFU-GM into the supernatant culture medium (delta assay). These two classes of progenitor may represent similar stages of hematopoietic cell development. Their binding to stroma depends on the presence of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HS-PG) in the extracellular matrix secreted by the stromal cells. Here, we have analyzed the functional and biochemical properties of HS-PG isolated from MP+ and MP- stromal cultures. HS-PG or isolated HS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains partially blocked progenitor cell binding when they were added to the 2-hour binding phase of the BI-CFC or delta assays. Gel electrophoresis of HS-PG resolved more bands in matrix preparations from MP+ cultures than in preparations from MP- cultures. The blocking activity of the eluted MP+ HS-PG bands depended partly on the amount of GAG attached to the protein core and presumably partly on the structure of the core itself. Time course studies demonstrated that the HS-dependent phase of the binding interaction was limited to the first 30 to 60 minutes of the 2-hour binding phase. The different blocking effects of MP+ and MP- HS indicate that they have different biochemical properties. The HS-GAG in MP+ stroma has a higher degree of sulfation and a greater negative charge to mass ratio compared with MP- HS-GAG. Variations in HS may determine specific binding by hematopoietic progenitor cells and a heparan sulfate receptor is envisaged as acting in concert with further cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) on the progenitor cell surface.","['Siczkowski, M', 'Clarke, D', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Siczkowski M', 'Clarke D', 'Gordon MY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', '*Glucuronidase', 'Glycosaminoglycans/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans', 'Heparitin Sulfate/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/isolation & purification/*pharmacology']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67647-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Aug 15;80(4):912-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This extremely high frequency of clonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells indicates that some clones of HTLV-1-infected cells have a tendency to proliferate more efficiently than the other population without malignant transformation.","['Furukawa, Y', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Osame, M', 'Toita, M', 'Sonoda, S', 'Kubota, R', 'Ijichi, S', 'Yoshida, M']","['Furukawa Y', 'Fujisawa J', 'Osame M', 'Toita M', 'Sonoda S', 'Kubota R', 'Ijichi S', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,,"['Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*blood', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology/*pathology']",1992/08/15 00:00,1992/08/15 00:01,['1992/08/15 00:00'],"['1992/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)67660-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1992 Aug 15;80(4):1012-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The way in which leukemic cells of childhood acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) can function in this gold uptake was also examined. In monocytes, microendocytosis was temperature-dependent; colloidal gold uptake increased as temperatures rose from 4 degrees C to 37 degrees C. It appeared that gold particles first adhered to the cell surface membrane, were then incorporated into the cytoplasmic vesicles, and then were transported into the granules. Original HL-60 cells and retinoic acid (RA)-treated HL-60 cells, which were differentiating and maturing along the granulocyte lineage, did not ingest colloidal gold particles, but 1,25(OH)2D3-treated HL-60 cells showed colloidal gold uptake during their differentiation and maturation along the monocyte lineage: 68.6% of the cells contained gold particles. Gold uptake was demonstrated in 27.3% of original U937 cells; the percentage increased to 70.3% when they were induced to mature by RA. In 15 specimens of childhood ANLL, none of the M1, M2 or M3 cells showed colloidal gold uptake, whereas 76-97% of M4 and M5 cells showed this uptake. These findings indicate that colloidal gold uptake is a marker of monocyte differentiation and maturation and can provide additional information for ANLL cytology.","['Aonuma, K']",['Aonuma K'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Gold/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Jun;55(3):265-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 214 acute leukemias revealed considerable variation in the degree of cytotoxicity achieved. Cytolysis was substantially lower in fresh noncultured acute leukemia samples than in K562 and Daudi cell lines (mean Cr-release 21.0 +/- 16.0% versus 69.2 +/- 6.6% and 70.8 +/- 7.9%). Augmentation of susceptibility to LAK-cell lysis is desirable in connection with therapeutic application of IL-2-induced effector mechanisms. We observed a relationship between the LAK-cell susceptibility of leukemia cells and their spontaneous proliferation rate, which is significantly higher in LAK-cell-sensitive than in LAK-cell-resistant leukemias. It was therefore considered useful to examine the possibility of augmenting LAK-cell sensitivity by proliferation induction. These studies demonstrate that incubation of blast cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia in myeloid blast crisis (CML-BC) with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) significantly augments LAK-cell susceptibility and that this is associated with an increased cell proliferation.","['Teichmann, J V', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Thiel, E']","['Teichmann JV', 'Ludwig WD', 'Thiel E']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Universitaetsklinikum Steglitz, Free University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,,"['Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1992 Jun;55(3):255-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GHBP represents the extracellular binding domain of the GH receptor and modulates the action of GH. After binding to its receptor, GH induces the local production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. In uremia, the plasma GH-binding activity is low and does not get up-regulated by recombinant human GH treatment, which is in contrast to the experience in short, normal children. There is evidence that hepatic IGF-1 production is low, whereas the serum concentration of IGF-binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) and other IGFBPs is increased because of the reduced renal clearance of the low-molecular-weight fragment of IGF-BP. This result in the reduced bioavailability of free IGF-1 and reduced IGF bioactivity. There is a strong interaction between GH and corticosteroids. Corticosteroids suppress growth by reducing the food efficiency ratio (weight gain per food intake), reduce pituitary GH secretion, and decrease the local production of and cell responsiveness for IGF-1. The growth-depressing and catabolic effects of corticosteroids can be counterbalanced dose dependently by recombinant human GH in animal experiments, and growth can be improved in corticosteroid-treated renal allograft recipients with and without normal renal function. It is not clear at this time to what extent GH may induce acute or chronic rejection crises.","['Mehls, O', 'Tonshoff, B']","['Mehls O', 'Tonshoff B']","[""Division of Pediatric Nephrology, University Children's Hospital of Heidelberg, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Drug Resistance', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'Growth Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Growth Hormone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Puberty/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Uremia/complications/physiopathology/surgery']",1992/06/01 00:00,1992/06/01 00:01,['1992/06/01 00:00'],"['1992/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1681/ASN.V212s284 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 1992 Jun;2(12 Suppl):S284-9. doi: 10.1681/ASN.V212s284.,,,,,,46,,,,,,,,,,

We also observed that purified TRX/ADF protein could augment gene expression from HIV LTR as demonstrated by transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. These observations confirmed the previous notion that ADF might be an inducing factor of cellular interleukin-2 receptor alpha subunit (IL-2R alpha) through the kappa B sequence that is a common central cis-regulatory element in both IL-2R alpha and HIV gene expression. These observations indicate that reducto-oxidative regulation (or redox regulation) of a cysteine residue(s) on the NF kappa B molecule might play an important role in its specific DNA interaction and that it might provide a clue to the understanding of a pathway of cellular signal transduction to NF kappa B that is independent from the known pathways involving protein phosphorylation.","['Okamoto, T', 'Ogiwara, H', 'Hayashi, T', 'Mitsui, A', 'Kawabe, T', 'Yodoi, J']","['Okamoto T', 'Ogiwara H', 'Hayashi T', 'Mitsui A', 'Kawabe T', 'Yodoi J']","['Virology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', '*Cytokines', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HIV Enhancer/*drug effects/physiology', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/metabolism', 'Thioredoxins/*pharmacology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/4.7.811 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1992 Jul;4(7):811-9. doi: 10.1093/intimm/4.7.811.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In preclinical studies, all-trans retinoic acid (tretinoin), 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin) and the aromatic retinoids etretinate and acitretin have preventive and therapeutic effects on carcinogen-induced premalignant and malignant lesions. Clinically, chemoprevention with isotretinoin and etretinate has been tested with some degree of success in such indications as basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, superficial bladder tumors and second primary tumors in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Limited therapeutic success has also been achieved with retinoid treatment of precancerous and cancerous conditions of the skin, oral cavity, larynx, lung, bladder and vulva. Dramatic therapeutic effects have been observed in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with tretinoin, which leads to very high rate of complete remission. Excellent results were recently reported in the treatment of squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and cervix with a combination of isotretinoin and recombinant interferon alfa-2a (rIFN alfa-2a, Roferon-A). The mechanism of action of retinoids is through modulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Retinoids vary in their capacity to induce differentiation and to inhibit proliferation in a series of human transformed hematopoietic and epithelial cell lines. Some cytokines potentiate the retinoid-induced cell differentiation and act synergistically with retinoids to inhibit cell proliferation. The pattern of synergism is dependent upon the combination and tumor cell line tested. The discovery of nuclear retinoid receptors has contributed substantially to the understanding of the mechanism of action of retinoids at the molecular level. Further understanding of the molecular biology of retinoids is expected to contribute to a rational design of new retinoids in the future, which in turn may result in improvements in the prevention and therapy of cancer.","['Bollag, W', 'Holdener, E E']","['Bollag W', 'Holdener EE']","['Department of Clinical Research, F Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,['0 (Retinoids)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Precancerous Conditions/drug therapy', 'Retinoids/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058252 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)65288-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1992 Jul;3(7):513-26. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058252.,,,,,,175,,,,,,,,,,

Selective inactivation of TFIID in nuclear extract completely abolished the transcription of rpL32 in vitro. Selective inactivation was restored by the addition of cloned and purified yeast TFIID (yTFIID), indicating that this TATA-less rpL32 promoter utilizes TFIID for its transcription initiation. Furthermore, addition of an oligonucleotide-containing TATA sequence interfered with the rpL32 transcription and this was overcome by the addition of yTFIID. To further examine the stage of involvement of TFIID in rpL32 transcription, TATA oligonucleotide was added to nuclear extract before and after the formation of the transcription complex. The results reveal that TFIID associates with the pre-initiation complex and that this complex is largely resistant to added TATA oligonucleotide.

To determine the safety and toxicity of rapid infusions, we conducted a prospective, nonrandomized study in patients with clinical indications for antifungal therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five granulocytopenic adults with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes were enrolled in a phase I trial using four sequentially shorter infusion durations: a standard infusion over 4 hours (n = 3) and shortened infusion durations at 3 hours (n = 3), 2 hours (n = 4), and 1 hour (n = 15). Toxicity was assessed by daily examinations of study subjects by one of the study investigators, by documentation of all infusion-related fevers and chills, and by daily monitoring of serum levels of creatinine, potassium, magnesium, and aspartate aminotransferase. RESULTS: Temperatures greater than 38 degrees C occurred in 16 of 25 (64%) patients, but only two had temperatures exceeding 40 degrees C. Chills were observed in 13 of 25 (56%) patients, but only one had severe symptoms. Serum creatinine increased more than 0.5 mg/dL (44.20 mumol/L) above the pretreatment baseline in 17 of 25 (68%) patients, and the absolute creatinine level was greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL (176.8 mumol/L) in 10 of 25 (40%) patients. Serum potassium levels dropped below the normal limit of 3.5 mEq/L (3.5 mmol/L) in all patients, but no patient had potassium levels below 2.5 mEq/L (2.5 mmol/L). Intravenous potassium supplementation was administered to all patients and exceeded 100 mEq/d in 12 of 25 (48%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid infusions of amphotericin B are safe, are associated with similar toxicity as prolonged infusions, and facilitate inpatient care by decreasing nursing time needed for administration and minimizing scheduling conflicts with other necessary intravenous medications. Shorter infusions also facilitate outpatient and home administration of amphotericin B.","['Cruz, J M', 'Peacock, J E Jr', 'Loomer, L', 'Holder, L W', 'Evans, G W', 'Powell, B L', 'Lyerly, E S', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Cruz JM', 'Peacock JE Jr', 'Loomer L', 'Holder LW', 'Evans GW', 'Powell BL', 'Lyerly ES', 'Capizzi RL']","['Section on Oncology, Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27103.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Am J Med. 1992 Aug;93(2):119-21.

Smokers have been found to incur an increased relative risk of mortality from cancer of the lung, head and neck, urinary tract, pancreas, and bladder. Recent work has also implicated smoking in the risk of leukemia and myeloma. The magnitude of these risks has prompted research aimed at identifying the carcinogens involved in specific smoking-related neoplasms, as well as potential genetic predispositions to the effects of these toxins. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes have been identified in both small-cell and non-small-cell lung cancer, and mutations in dominant oncogenes have been noted in the latter disease. A growing understanding of the molecular genetics of smoking-related cancers may translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Detection of mutations in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in premalignant tissues might facilitate identification of individuals who have a hereditary predisposition to smoking-related carcinomas. In the future, tumor growth may be halted by replacement or substitution of mutated tumor suppressor gene functions or biochemical modulation of oncogene products. New forms of immunotherapy may also be targeted specifically toward mutant oncogenes in cancer cells.","['Carbone, D']",['Carbone D'],"['Simmons Cancer Center, University of Texas, Dallas 75235-8593.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, p53/genetics', 'Genes, ras/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/*adverse effects/epidemiology']",1992/07/15 00:00,1992/07/15 00:01,['1992/07/15 00:00'],"['1992/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(92)90621-H [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(92)90621-h [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1992 Jul 15;93(1A):13S-17S. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(92)90621-h.,,,,"['p53', 'ras', 'rb']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mRNAs for the effector-binding (EB) and non-heme iron (NHI) subunits are likewise not under coordinate control during cell cycle traverse. Inhibitors directed at the specific subunits of ribonucleotide reductase block DNA synthesis. These current studies show that drugs such as IMPY or hydroxyurea which specifically inhibit the NHI subunit cause a marked increase in the steady-state level of the mRNA for the NHI subunit while resulting in a decrease in the level of mRNA for the EB subunit. In cells treated with deoxyadenosine, the patterns of the mRNAs for the NHI and EB subunits were different from those seen in the IMPY- or hydroxyurea-treated cells. Control experiments utilizing inhibitors (aphidicolin or araC) directed at DNA polymerase showed that the pattern of changes in the mRNA levels for the NHI and EB subunits were specific for the reductase inhibitors. These changes in the mRNAs for the NHI and EB subunits may be due to drug-induced alterations in transcription rates and/or degradation rates for the specific mRNAs.","['Carter, G L', 'Cory, J G']","['Carter GL', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University School Of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Nonheme Iron Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'MX6Z942BKY (2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo(1,2-b)pyrazole)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Metalloproteins/*metabolism', 'Nonheme Iron Proteins', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(92)90019-v [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1992;32:227-40. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(92)90019-v.,"['CA27398/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because HL-60 cells express high levels of transferrin receptor we adapted a DNA delivery system based on receptor-mediated endocytosis to introduce myb oligomers complexed with a transferrin-polylysine conjugate into those cells. A DNA.RNA duplex resistant to S1 nuclease digestion was detected as early as 12 hr after culture of HL-60 cells in the presence of the myb antisense/transferrin-polylysine complex. Exposure of HL-60 cells to the myb antisense/transferrin-polylysine complex resulted in rapid and profound inhibition of proliferation and loss of cell viability much more pronounced than that occurring in cells exposed to free myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. The transferrin-polylysine/myb sense complex or the transferrin-polylysine conjugate alone had no effect on HL-60 cell proliferation and viability. These findings indicate that myb synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides enter efficiently into HL-60 by transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis and exert a profound biological effect.

We report on the kinetics of the tetanus-antitoxin in 20 patients after allogeneic or autologous BMT and demonstrate the influence of a graft-versus-host disease and its therapy on the antibody kinetics. In the group of allogeneic transplanted children without a GvHD the tetanus-antitoxin titers felt below their detection range after a time of about 8 months whereas in the group with GvHD this effect already occurred after nearly 4 months. The autologous transplanted patients have a positive antibody level til the time of 20 months after BMT.

PURPOSE: To further define the drug's pharmacokinetics, a study of intravenous all-trans-RA was performed in rhesus monkeys. METHODS: A total of nine monkeys received intravenous bolus injections of all-trans-RA. Three different doses (20, 50, and 100 mg/m2) were each tested in three monkeys. Blood samples for determination of all-trans-RA concentration were obtained prior to drug administration and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 360, and 480 minutes after drug administration. RESULTS: Plasma disappearance of all-trans-RA was characterized by three distinct phases: a brief, initial exponential decline, followed by a relative plateau in the disappearance curve (the duration of which was dose dependent), and finally a terminal exponential decay. This profile is consistent with a capacity-limited (saturable) elimination process. The first-order (terminal) half-life for all-trans-RA averaged 19 minutes, and the mean clearances were 77, 52, and 59 mL/min for the 20-, 50-, and 100-mg/m2 dose groups, respectively. The mean +/- SD Michaelis constant (Km) for the capacity-limited process was 3.2 +/- 1.9 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Peak plasma concentrations following oral administration of 45 mg/m2 all-trans-RA in humans approach the Km for the capacity-limited process; thus, the dose-dependent pharmacokinetics of all-trans-RA described here may occur within the clinically used dosage range.","['Adamson, P C', 'Balis, F M', 'Smith, M A', 'Murphy, R F', 'Godwin, K A', 'Poplack, D G']","['Adamson PC', 'Balis FM', 'Smith MA', 'Murphy RF', 'Godwin KA', 'Poplack DG']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md. 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kinetics', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",1992/09/02 00:00,1992/09/02 00:01,['1992/09/02 00:00'],"['1992/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/84.17.1332 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Sep 2;84(17):1332-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.17.1332.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PURPOSE: We re-established a formerly identified cohort of neurological patients receiving injections of Thorotrast for cerebral arteriography and assessed their incidence of cancer. METHODS: Using the national population register, the Danish Cancer Registry, and other registers, we determined the incidence of cancer among Thorotrast-injected patients. Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites. RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed. Cancer risk was increased at most other sites, although this increase was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Alpha radiation may account for the increased risk of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma, whereas confounding factors most probably contribute to the increased risks at other sites.","['Andersson, M', 'Storm, H H']","['Andersson M', 'Storm HH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['9XA7X17UQC (Thorium Dioxide)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Angiography', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gallbladder Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Registries', 'Thorium Dioxide/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",1992/09/02 00:00,1992/09/02 00:01,['1992/09/02 00:00'],"['1992/09/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/02 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/02 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/84.17.1318 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1992 Sep 2;84(17):1318-25. doi: 10.1093/jnci/84.17.1318.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general the synthetic route involved the coupling of the appropriate diethyl N-[4-(prop-2-ynylamino)benzoyl]-L-glutamate with a disubstituted 6-(bromomethyl)quinoline followed by deprotection using mild alkali. The compounds were tested as inhibitors of partially purified L1210 TS. As a measure of cytotoxicity, the compounds were tested for their inhibition of the growth of L1210 cells in culture. Good enzyme inhibition and cytotoxicity were found for compounds containing chloro, amino, or methyl substituents at the C2 position with chloro or bromo substituents at C4. The effect on enzyme inhibition of varying the N10 substituent of 2h was similar to that observed in the quinazolinone-containing antifolates, indicating that the quinoline compounds may be interacting with the enzyme in a similar way to the quinazolinones. Also, the introduction of a 2'-fluoro substituent into the benzoyl ring of several of the quinoline antifolates led to an increase in both TS inhibition and the inhibition of L1210 cell growth. These data demonstrate that the N3-H of the pyrimidine ring of the quinazolinone antifolates is not required for binding to TS if appropriate substituents are placed at the C2 and C4 positions of the bicyclic ring system.","['Warner, P', 'Barker, A J', 'Jackman, A L', 'Burrows, K D', 'Roberts, N', 'Bishop, J A', ""O'Connor, B M"", 'Hughes, L R']","['Warner P', 'Barker AJ', 'Jackman AL', 'Burrows KD', 'Roberts N', 'Bishop JA', ""O'Connor BM"", 'Hughes LR']","['Department of Chemistry, ICI Pharmaceuticals, Macclefield, Cheshire, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '76849-19-9 (CB 3717)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Folic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Quinazolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/07/24 00:00,1992/07/24 00:01,['1992/07/24 00:00'],"['1992/07/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/24 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/24 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00093a007 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1992 Jul 24;35(15):2761-8. doi: 10.1021/jm00093a007.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAIN RESULTS: There was a significant excess of case pair addresses separated by < 0.5 km. There was also a significant excess of pairs sharing the same postcode. Both findings were based upon comparison with random pairs of postcodes drawn from the Central Postcode Directory. Examination for clustering at this very short range was based upon a clear prior hypothesis derived from the results of a study of space-time interaction, reported in a companion paper. CONCLUSIONS: It is postulated that the space-time interaction and the geographical concentrations shown here result from a common epidemic process. The epidemiology of this disease is characterised by short range geographical concentrations, with temporal non-homogeneity superimposed. The findings exclude certain artefacts which remained unresolved in the space-time interaction study. The distributions almost certainly reflect biological processes, and the most probable explanation is in terms of an infective process.","['Knox, E G', 'Gilman, E']","['Knox EG', 'Gilman E']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Registries', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jech.46.6.573 [doi]'],ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1992 Dec;46(6):573-6. doi: 10.1136/jech.46.6.573.,,,,,PMC1059671,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to be effective in preventing or reversing neutropenia. Adverse effects of GM-CSF, however, are dose related. Appropriate dose, route and schedules for GM-CSF in various clinical settings have recently been defined, the usual range being 5-10 micrograms/kg/day either by 4-6 h intravenous infusion or by subcutaneous injection. At such doses, adverse effects are predominantly mild-to-moderate in nature, occur in 20-30% of patients and usually comprise fever, myalgia, malaise, rash and injection site reaction. Early trials using very high doses of GM-CSF were often associated with marked adverse effects, which in rare cases proved severe (pericarditis and thrombosis). Similarly, a so-called ""first-dose reaction"", defined as a syndrome of hypoxia and hypotension after the initial but not subsequent doses of GM-CSF, was observed in certain predisposed patients following doses above 10 micrograms/kg/day. Subsequent trials have established that intravenous bolus or short infusions of GM-CSF are more likely to promote adverse effects. Certain patient groups, for example those with myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukaemia, inflammatory disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia or malfunctional immunological responsiveness, require careful clinical monitoring in order to avoid potential complications following the administration of GM-CSF. With the current appropriate administration and doses of GM-CSF, the benefit:risk ratio has been greatly improved.","['Stern, A C', 'Jones, T C']","['Stern AC', 'Jones TC']","['Sandoz Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01705031 [doi]'],ppublish,Infection. 1992;20 Suppl 2:S124-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01705031.,,,,,,17,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-two per cent of cases had an antecedent hematological disorder (AHD), and 7 per cent had a secondary AML. Forty patients (39 per cent) were managed with palliative intent with short courses with oral hydroxyurea +/- 6-thioguanine. In contrast to 78 patients (61 per cent) selected for remission-induction treatment, these were significantly older (P < 0.0001), had a greater incidence of AHD (P < 0.039) and of hypoplastic AML (P < 0.017), and an inferior amount of blast cells in the bone marrow (P < 0.003). Patients undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy were managed with DAT-like chemotherapy, high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HD-ara-C), and mitoxantrone-based regimens. The complete response (CR) rate was 29 per cent. Response was higher with the two most intensive HD-araC and mitoxantrone-etoposide-araC programmes (P < 0.026), and correlated favourably with no AHD (P < 0.04) and lower blast cell count in the peripheral blood (P < 0.02). Overall survival of responders was longer than in palliation and nonresponder groups (P < 0.025 and P < 0.001, respectively). In the active treatment group, survival correlated with performance status (P < 0.005) and blast cell count (P < 0.05). Infection was the main cause of morbidity during active treatment, accounting for most induction failures (60 per cent), followed by haemorrhage (12 per cent) and resistant disease (12 per cent). These results from an unselected series represent an improvement over those obtained by us in previous years (1971-1980), and show that intensive treatment programmes are applicable to the elderly with AML and that prolonged disease-free survival is possible for some. Improving further CR rate and duration will depend equally on the optimization of supportive care measures and the introduction of more effective therapeutic modalities.","['Bassan, R', 'Buelli, M', 'Viero, P', 'Minotti, C', 'Barbui, T']","['Bassan R', 'Buelli M', 'Viero P', 'Minotti C', 'Barbui T']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900100503 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1992 Sep-Oct;10(5):251-60. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900100503.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among a panel of 14 monoclonal antibodies routinely used for the diagnosis of acute leukemias we studied the expression of six antibodies (CD13, CD15, VIM2, CD33, CD14, CD34) of the granulomonocytic lineage and found that some of them were useful for diagnosis and/or prognosis. For FAB subclassification of AML, the CD13 or VIM2 antigen expression was of no benefit. Monocytic leukemias (M4 + M5PD + M5WD) more frequently expressed CD34 antigen (28/31) than granulocytic (M1 + M2 + M3) subtypes (33/53) (P < 0.01). Finally, the most striking differences were found with CD14 antigen expression: CD14 antigen was more frequently expressed in M4 + M5 leukemias (21/31) than in M1 + M2 + M3 subtypes (12/33) (P < 0.01). The mean percentage of CD14 positive blast cells was accordingly higher in monocytic leukemias than in granulocytic leukemias and the difference was highly significant (P < 0.0001). The CD15 antigen was more frequently expressed in differentiated leukemias (M2 + M3 + M4 + M5WD) (35/44) than in poorly differentiated forms (M1 + M5PD) (17/37) (P < 0.001). The statistical difference was higher when the mean percentage of CD15 positive blast cells were compared (P < 0.0003).

However, we found that MEL can constitutively incorporate significant amounts of radiolabeled serotonin ([3H]5-HT). Because this process is typical of cells belonging to the megakaryocytic lineage, we investigated the significance and mechanisms of 5-HT incorporation in the MEL system. We observed that: 1) normal murine erythroid cells and erythroid progenitors do not incorporate [3H]5-HT, as well as normal murine myeloid cells and the human myeloid cell line HL-60; on the other hand, the human erythroleukemia cell lines K562 and HEL, which have been shown to constitutively express megakaryocytic features, were able to incorporate [3H]5-HT; 2) MEL incorporated 5-HT by an active and saturable mechanism, dependent on temperature and sodium concentration in the medium; and 3) 5-HT uptake was very rapid. Moreover, because about 65% of cell-associated radioactivity was no longer displaced by the cold substrate, we assumed it to represent ""true"" cytoplasmic internalization. Finally, 5-HT incorporation by MEL was inhibited by clomipramine, ouabain, and reserpine, which are known inhibitors of 5-HT uptake in platelets. The commitment of MEL to terminal erythroid differentiation by hexamethylene bisacetamide or dimethyl sulfoxide greatly reduced the capacity to incorporate [3H]5-HT. These results seem to suggest that the MEL system, although mainly erythroid as regards its differentiation capability, constitutively expresses features of the megakaryocytic lineage, possibly disclosed by the ability to incorporate 5-HT. This hypothesis was further supported by the findings that 30%-40% of uninduced MEL were labeled by a polyclonal antibody raised against murine platelets that selectively recognized megakaryocytes in murine bone marrow smears.","['Vannucchi, A M', 'Grossi, A', 'Paoletti, F', 'Rafanelli, D', 'Bacci, P', 'Ferrini, P R']","['Vannucchi AM', 'Grossi A', 'Paoletti F', 'Rafanelli D', 'Bacci P', 'Ferrini PR']","['Division of Hematology, University of Florence, USL, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Acetamides)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NUV44L116D (Clomipramine)']",IM,,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Clomipramine/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Reserpine/pharmacology', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Sodium/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1992 Dec;20(11):1296-301.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, glycosaminoglycans have been compared under different growth conditions. Under myeloid conditions (with steroid) a higher proportion of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans was incorporated into the cell layer and the extracellular matrix was increased, whereas synthesis was reduced under lymphoid conditions (with mercaptoethanol). The inclusion of steroid or mercaptoethanol did not alter the nature of the heparan sulfate synthesized as shown by DEAE anion-exchange chromatography, cleavage with specific enzymes and resolution of the digestion products by gel electrophoresis (oligomapping), and glycosaminoglycan size. The major species of sulfated proteoglycan synthesized under the different growth conditions (200 and 110 kd for the culture supernatant and 110, 71, and 38 kd for the cell layer) were shown to be very similar by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Although no qualitative difference was found biochemically between the major glycosaminoglycans/proteoglycans, scanning electron microscopy revealed major differences in the pattern of deposition of the glycosaminoglycans. Under myeloid conditions, a rich fibrous matrix covered the cell layer, whereas under lymphoid conditions glycosaminoglycan was sparsely deposited.

For comparison the same treatment was tested on three different lymphoid cell lines CEM, SK-DHL-2, and LY-16. The experimental protocol was designed to mimic ex vivo purging conditions. Therefore, tumor cells and enriched hematopoietic precursors were mixed with irradiated BM cells. Our results demonstrated that preincubation of enriched progenitor cells with TGF-beta 3 for up to 72 h followed by 4-HC treatment resulted in an increased survival of colonies derived from granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) colony-forming cells, whereas a substantially lower number of colonies was observed in the control group. Similar results were observed when BM cells were first treated with 4-HC followed by TGF-beta 3 incubation for 24 or 48 h. In contrast, TGF-beta 3 provided no protection to the 4-HC cytotoxicity toward the lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Three to four log of tumor cell killing was induced by 4-HC in the presence or absence of preincubation with TGF-beta 3. These data suggest that TGF-beta 3 is able to protect normal BM progenitors from the cytotoxic activity of an alkylating agent (4-HC) in vitro, whereas it does not offer any protection to lymphoma cell lines.

The role played by this molecule in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is not yet well understood. CML frequently shows a marked decrease of CR1 antigens on both the neutrophil population and myeloid precursors. This reduced expression appears to be related to disease activity, since patients at more advanced clinical stages, as well as those who develop blastic crisis, have been found to express the lowest levels of CR1 antigens. At the onset of the disease low CR1 expression on CML neutrophils seems to be associated with a higher risk of blastic transformation. Furthermore, CML neutrophils deficient in CR1 lack the ability to respond to PMA stimulation, suggesting a failure in CR1 granular storage. In patients lacking CR1, the number of receptors increased to normal levels following exposure of CML cells to therapeutic concentrations of recombinant alpha interferon. The role played by the CR1 molecule in sustaining neutrophil-mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity has yet to be definitively proved; studies performed by our group are relevant here, since complete suppression of tumor lysis following receptor neutralization by anti CR1 monoclonal antibodies was demonstrated in a large number of normal and CML individuals. In CML patients, the evidence of a direct relationship between lytic activity and antigen receptor levels seems to further support the involvement of CR1 molecules in tumor cell lysis, function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Lanza, F', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",IM,,"['Blast Crisis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/*analysis/physiology']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209049815 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Sep;8(1-2):35-41. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049815.,,,,,,73,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes were cultured in medium containing either 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdU) or FdU plus caffeine, and G-banded metaphases were examined for nonrandom breaks. Analyses of completely G-banded malignant cell chromosomes from 31 of the 32 patients were available for comparison.

The best known form, the classical Ph-positive subtype, accounts for about 90% of all cases of CML. The morphology of its presentation blood film is highly characteristic but is also seen in about half of the remaining 10% of cases, which are Ph-negative. This classical morphological subtype, whether Ph-positive or Ph-negative I describe as 'chronic granulocytic leukaemia' to refer to the exuberant granulocytic proliferation which is its hallmark. This term is often used indiscriminately and interchangeably with 'chronic myeloid leukaemia' and similar terms, just as 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia' was, until recently, used to cover the chronic lymphoid leukaemias in general, but is now used in a specific sense. Chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL), whether Ph-positive or Ph-negative, is almost always BCR-rearranged and associated with the production of a unique 210-kd protein with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. Most of the remaining cases of Ph-negative CML are examples of either chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), a subtype almost as homogeneous as CGL, and characterized in its presentation blood film by the presence of monocytes and neutrophils but few immature granulocytes, or atypical CML (aCML), distinct from and less homogeneous than either CGL or CMML, in which some cases also share features with CGL while others share some with CMML. CMML and aCML do not show BCR rearrangement and are not associated with the production of p210kd. CGL, CMML, and aCML, though characterized on morphological features differ in their clinical features and behaviour, response to treatment and survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Galton, D A']",['Galton DA'],"['Hammersmith Hospital, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology']",1992/08/01 00:00,1992/08/01 00:01,['1992/08/01 00:00'],"['1992/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209049789 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Aug;7(5-6):343-50. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049789.,,,,,,23,,,,,,,,,,

Within 24-48 hr, PLC induced over 40% of THP-1 cells to undergo monocytic differentiation as manifested by adherence, growth arrest, functional expression, morphological changes and expression of c-fms gene which encode for M-CSF receptors. Compared to TPA, however, the inducing activity of PLC was weaker, slower and not as effective. PLC treatment also induced a transient expression of c-fos proto-oncogene prior to c-fms expression. On the contrary, the level of c-myc RNA, which is constitutively expressed in THP-1 cells, was down-regulated 48 hr after PLC treatment. The PLC-induced monocytic differentiation in THP-1 cells was inhibited by staurosporine, a potent PK-C inhibitor, further suggesting that direct activation of the PK-C is one of the metabolic events essential for monocytic differentiation. It is postulated that in THP-1 cells the metabolic pathway transducing PK-C activation has been permanently blocked, thereby leading to uncontrolled proliferation without differentiation.","['Barendsen, N', 'Chen, B']","['Barendsen N', 'Chen B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*pharmacology']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209049785 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Jul;7(4):323-9. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049785.,['AI 23499/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These gene changes are common in myeloid and undifferentiated variants of blast crisis but are usually undetectable in lymphoid leukemic transformants. Other molecular changes also occur in the clonal evolution of CML. The retinoblastoma-susceptibility (Rb) gene is an anti-oncogene. Structural abnormalities of Rb are frequent in all types of human acute leukemia, but are particularly common in Ph1-positive leukemia of lymphoid phenotype including both Ph1-positive ALL and lymphoid blast crisis of CML. Changes in Rb occur early in the transition to blast crisis with loss of Rb protein being the common factor. Mutations in the N-RAS gene also occur, but are rare in typical blast crisis. They are sometimes seen in Ph1-negative myeloid blast crisis. Since changes in the p53 gene are generally associated with progression of disease of a myeloid phenotype and changes in the Rb gene occur more often with a lymphoid phenotype, a particular molecular alteration may influence the character of disease evolution in CML.","['Cline, M J', 'Jat, P S', 'Foti, A']","['Cline MJ', 'Jat PS', 'Foti A']",['UCLA Department of Medicine 90024.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Blast Crisis', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genes, p53', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation']",1992/07/01 00:00,1992/07/01 00:01,['1992/07/01 00:00'],"['1992/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209049779 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Jul;7(4):283-7. doi: 10.3109/10428199209049779.,['CA 50275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,"['RAS', 'Rb']",,36,,,,,,,,,,

Two types of helper T cell (Th) clones (Th1 and Th2) are defined on the basis of different patterns of cytokine (lymphokine) secretion. They determine the outcome of an antigenic response toward humoral or cell-mediated immunity. Although lymphokine genes are coordinately regulated upon antigen stimulation, they are regulated by the mechanisms common to all as well as those which are unique to each gene. For most lymphokine genes, a combination of phorbol esters (phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate, PMA) and calcium ionophores (A23187) is required for their maximal induction. Yet phorbol ester alone or calcium ionophore alone produce several lymphokines. The production of the granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is completely dependent on the two signals. We have previously found a cis-acting region spanning the GM-CSF promoter region (positions -95 to +27) that confers inducibility to reporter genes in transient transfection assays. Further analysis identified three elements required for efficient induction, referred to as GM2, GC-box and conserved lymphokine element (CLE0). GM2 defines a binding site for protein(s) whose binding is inducible by PMA. One protein, NF-GM2 is similar to the transcription factor NF-kB. GC-box is a binding site for constitutively bound proteins. CLEO defines a binding site for protein(s) whose optimum binding is stimulated by PMA and A23187. Viral trans-activators such as Tax (human T cell leukemia virus-1, HTLV-1) and E2 (bovine papilloma virus, BPV) proteins are other agents which activate lymphokine gene expression by bypassing T cell receptor (TCR) mediated signaling. The trans-activation domain of E2 and Tax is interchangeable although they have no obvious sequence homology between them. The viral trans-activators appear to target specific DNA binding protein such as NF-kB and Sp1 to cis-acting DNA site and promote lymphokine gene expression without TCR-mediated stimulation.","['Arai, N', 'Naito, Y', 'Watanabe, M', 'Masuda, E S', 'Yamaguchi-Iwai, Y', 'Tsuboi, A', 'Heike, T', 'Matsuda, I', 'Yokota, K', 'Koyano-Nakagawa, N']","['Arai N', 'Naito Y', 'Watanabe M', 'Masuda ES', 'Yamaguchi-Iwai Y', 'Tsuboi A', 'Heike T', 'Matsuda I', 'Yokota K', 'Koyano-Nakagawa N', 'et al.']","['DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Pharmacol Ther,Pharmacology & therapeutics,7905840,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/immunology/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Molecular Biology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0163-7258(92)90054-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacol Ther. 1992;55(3):303-18. doi: 10.1016/0163-7258(92)90054-4.,,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,

Labelling procedure and animal studies.,713-22,"The labelling of interleukin-2 (IL-2) with 123I and its in vivo application for imaging chronic pathological lymphocytic infiltrations are described. The lactoperoxidase/glucoseoxidase technique was the labelling method of choice leading to immunoreactive IL-2 with high specific activity. Labelled IL-2 was injected in diabetes-prone non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice with pancreatic lymphocytic infiltration. As control animals, Balb/c mice were used. As specificity control, monoclonal antibodies AMT13 and UCHT1, bovine serum albumin and alpha-lactalbumin were radioiodinated and injected in mice. Eighteen NOD mice and four control Balb/c mice were used for gamma camera imaging experiments. Fifty-four NOD and 20 Balb/c mice were used for time course single organ counting and autoradiography. Gamma camera images showed that radioactivity accumulated in the pancreatic region from the 10th minute onwards in NOD mice injected with 123I-IL-2 but not in Balb/c mice, or in NOD mice injected with control radiopharmaceuticals. These findings were confirmed by counting the radioactivity present in single organs. Autoradiography of NOD pancreas, after injection of labelled IL-2, showed that radioactivity was specifically associated with infiltrating lymphocytes. In conclusion, this technique is highly specific and easy to perform and we suggest its application in humans for in vivo detection of areas of lymphocytic infiltration.","['Signore, A', 'Chianelli, M', 'Toscano, A', 'Monetini, L', 'Ronga, G', 'Nimmon, C C', 'Britton, K E', 'Pozzilli, P', 'Negri, M']","['Signore A', 'Chianelli M', 'Toscano A', 'Monetini L', 'Ronga G', 'Nimmon CC', 'Britton KE', 'Pozzilli P', 'Negri M']","['Servizio di Medicina Nucleare, Policlinico Umberto I, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Interleukin-2/pharmacokinetics', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Isotope Labeling/methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Pancreas/diagnostic imaging/*pathology', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Tissue Distribution']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 1992 Oct;13(10):713-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The studied proto-oncogenes were found to be regulated but varied considerably within morphologically identical subtypes. This is consistent with the clinically observable diverse behavior of seemingly identical AMLs as to the course and outcome of the individual disease. Overexpression of c-sis and c-myc was found more often in AML upon relapse than at diagnosis and in two cases overexpression not found at diagnosis was present at relapse. This implies alterations of biological behavior in the course of antileukemic drug therapy.

The usefulness of some fixation and permeabilization methods of cell membrane for detection of cytoplasmic markers by flow cytometry was studied. The methods of cell fixation in suspension were found to be more sensitive than the methods of cell fixation in smears. With the very short buffered formaldehyde-acetone (BFA) fixation used in this study an optimal penetration of the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) through the plasma membrane and specific binding to the appropriate structures were achieved. CD22 antigen was detected in cytoplasm but not on membrane of DAUDI cells. In another B cell line, U-266, CD22 antigen was present both in cell membrane and cytoplasm. The marker corresponding to anti-CD19 MoAb was detected in cytoplasm but was absent on membrane of U-266 cells. Furthermore, the antigen estimated by anti-CD3 MoAb could be detected intracellularly in cells of both T cell lines tested, while it was absent on cell membrane of these cells. The phenotypic study of U-937 cells showed that the majority of cells expressed myeloid associated antigens. In our study the CD14 marker detected on cell surface membrane of U-937 cells was missing in their cytoplasm. The surface antigens remained intact after BFA fixation enabling a simultaneous detection of membrane and cytoplasmic markers in double immunofluorescence studies. Through this combination of markers minor cell populations could be detected. Human hematopoietic cell lines could serve as a reliable model system for a rapid and quantitative immunodiagnosis.","['Konikova, E', 'Babusikova, O', 'Kusenda, J', 'Glasova, M']","['Konikova E', 'Babusikova O', 'Kusenda J', 'Glasova M']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 1992;39(6):337-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the same token, the mast cell is responsible for interactions with inhaled, ingested, and injected antigens that comprise IgE-mediated allergic reactions. Abnormally high numbers of mast cells in the skin, either localized or generalized, result in urticaria pigmentosa or generalized cutaneous mastocytosis, respectively. Tissue infiltration by excessive mast cells, primarily in gut, bone, liver, and spleen, results in systemic mastocytosis; this may be accompanied by myelodysplasia or lymphoma and may eventuate in mast cell leukemia. Until the etiology of mastocytosis is understood, the treatment is symptomatic: histamine antagonism by H1 +/- H2 blockade for flushing, itching, and gastric distress; cyclooxygenase inhibition to prevent prostaglandin D2 (PGD2)-induced hypotension when indicated; and oral cromolyn to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms and bone pain.","['Marney, S R Jr']",['Marney SR Jr'],"['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Allergy Proc,Allergy proceedings : the official journal of regional and state allergy societies,8902396,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Mast Cells/immunology', '*Mastocytosis/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Skin/pathology', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/pathology']",1992/11/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1992/11/11 19:15'],"['1992/11/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1992/11/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.2500/108854192778816997 [doi]'],ppublish,Allergy Proc. 1992 Nov-Dec;13(6):303-10. doi: 10.2500/108854192778816997.,,,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,

When mafosfamide was combined with 42.5 degrees C hyperthermia for 1 h, an additive effect was observed: at a dose of 5 micrograms/ml mafosfamide, the survival of CFU-L was nearly two logs lower than that observed at 37 degrees C, while 37.7% of CFU-S survived the purging. The repopulating capacity of surviving bone marrow CFU-S was not altered: a similar 60 d survival of supralethally irradiated recipients transplanted with comparable graft sizes from purged or non-purged bone marrow was observed. When bone marrow suspensions containing WEHI 3-B cells were purged with 5 micrograms/ml mafosfamide at 42.5 degrees C and the minimal amount of bone marrow cells needed to protect supralethally irradiated mice were injected, leukaemia incidence was reduced to less than 10% as opposed to 100% of those injected with untreated bone marrow. Our results suggest that ex vivo hyperthermia may enhance the purging efficiency of mafosfamide.","['Gidali, J', 'Feher, I']","['Gidali J', 'Feher I']","['National Institute of Haematology, Blood Transfusion and Immunology, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', '*Hot Temperature', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/surgery', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1992/12/01 00:00,1992/12/01 00:01,['1992/12/01 00:00'],"['1992/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1992 Dec;10(6):479-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The past two International Workshops on Leucocyte Differentiation Antigens have shown that myeloma cells can express a range of surface molecules, and it has become clear that many of these have adhesive functions. The identification of ICAM-1 (CD54) and H-CAM (CD44) on human plasma cells was the initial observation, and other antigens such as N-CAM (CD56) and LFA-3 (CD58) have been confirmed as features of malignant plasma cells in particular. The degree of expression of LFA-1 (CD11a) remains to be characterised fully. It seems probable that the loss of some adhesion structures may be associated with increased malignancy and plasma cell leukaemia. At the present time there are few studies relating to the function of these molecules, although homotypic adhesion appears to occur, and it is likely that such studies will shed light on the pathogenesis of myeloma.","['Barker, H F', 'Ball, J', 'Drew, M', 'Hamilton, M S', 'Franklin, I M']","['Barker HF', 'Ball J', 'Drew M', 'Hamilton MS', 'Franklin IM']","['Department of Haematology and Immunology, Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre, Birmingham, England, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Multigene Family', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism']",1992/10/01 00:00,1992/10/01 00:01,['1992/10/01 00:00'],"['1992/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/10428199209054904 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1992 Oct;8(3):189-96. doi: 10.3109/10428199209054904.,,,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,

In those and phage PM2 DNA the increase in the DNA binding to the filters with a rise in NaCl concentration from 0.5 up to 4.5 M was sigmoidal being suggestive of a conformational transition. No such activity was found in the case of phage lambda or single-stranded DNA. The binding decreased dramatically after mild cleavage of DNA with DNAase I or treatment with phospholipase C or Eco RI and Hin PI restrictases. Incubation of DNA with ethidium bromide led to decrease in the amount of bound DNA. This effect was enhanced with a rise in the dye concentration. The isotherms of ethidium bromide binding to eukaryotic DNA obtained in Scatchard plots by optic titration had a component with a positive slope at low values of r. Bivalent ions (Mg2+, Zn2+) shifting the equilibrium towards the Z-form increased the proportion of macromolecules retained on the filters at NaCl concentrations of 1-3 M. Local changes in the helix conformation were studied with the help of chemical probes: diethylpyrocarbonate (guanine Z-DNA) and osmium-pyridine reagent (pyrimidines of boundary B-Z sites). These probes incorporation into samples of liver DNA, EAC, and lymphocytes resulted in chemical modification of all these samples. Modification of DNA by osmium-pyridine reagent led to inhibition of subsequent restriction by Eco RI restrictase. The data obtained are suggestive of the presence of Z-regions in the B-helix of eukaryotic DNA. A topological model of Z-site stabilization in small superhelical loops of DNA fixed by protein or lipoprotein molecules is proposed.","['Zhizhina, G P', 'Medina, A B', 'Navarrete, A S', 'Troitskaia, G P']","['Zhizhina GP', 'Medina AB', 'Navarrete AS', 'Troitskaia GP']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Biokhimiia,"Biokhimiia (Moscow, Russia)",0372667,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Liver/chemistry/cytology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1992/11/01 00:00,1992/11/01 00:01,['1992/11/01 00:00'],"['1992/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Biokhimiia. 1992 Nov;57(11):1627-41.,,Vyiavlenie levospiral'nykh uchastkov v DNK eukariot.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clearance experiments using monoclonal antibodies against murine TCR alpha- and beta-chains and against human TCR beta-chain and immunoprecipitations with monoclonal antibody to the murine T3 complex established that these components represented the alpha/beta heterodimer. An additional component around 31 kDa was detected by anti-J beta antibodies in murine thymus extracts.

We describe a simple immunoassay for dCK that can measure accurately as little as 5 ng enzyme protein in crude tissue extracts. The assay enabled us to show (i) that mutant cells deficient in dCK activity lack immunoreactive dCK protein, (ii) that dCK catalytic activity and immunoreactivity correlate closely in human tumors, and (iii) that immunoreactive dCK is particularly high in lymphocytes and lymphoid malignancies, although certain solid tumors may also contain the enzyme.

This suggests smaller genotoxicity of BFM scheme therapy.","['Rytwinski, K', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk, D', 'Konopacka, M', 'Ciechanowska, U']","['Rytwinski K', 'Sonta-Jakimczyk D', 'Konopacka M', 'Ciechanowska U']",['Pracowni Hematologii i Immuologii Klinicznej Instytutu Onkologii Gliwicach.'],['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Acta Haematol Pol,Acta haematologica Polonica,0262610,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'beta-Thalassemia/blood/*chemically induced/pathology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Haematol Pol. 1992;23(2):95-9.,,Niedokrwistosci i wznowy szpikowe w ostrej bialaczce limfoblastycznej u dzieci po zakonczeniu leczenia a czestosc wystepowania erytroblastow z mikrojadrami.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of slight variations in the percentages of cells reacting with particular MoAbs when comparing the two methods we found no discrepancies in the final classification of each case. In ANLL (n = 73) the best correlation between the two methods was found for CDw65 which is a good screening marker, and for CD15 having a prognostic significance. In ALL (n = 30) the best correlation was observed for CD19 and CD10, both of great diagnostic importance. The following antigens present both in membrane and in cytoplasm displayed higher positivity with the APAAP than in IF HLA-Dr, CD71 and CD11b in ANLL, CD22 and HLA-Dr in nonT-ALL and CD3 in T-ALL. The important advantages of the APAAP technique are: 1) its use with routinely performed bone marrow or peripheral blood films, which can be stored before staining, 2) the possibility of correlating morphology with immunological characterization and documentation of the results.","['Stella-Holowiecka, B', 'Jagoda, K', 'Koehler, M', 'Krzemien, S', 'Holowiecki, J']","['Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Jagoda K', 'Koehler M', 'Krzemien S', 'Holowiecki J']",['Kliniki Hematologii Slaskiej A.M.'],['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Acta Haematol Pol,Acta haematologica Polonica,0262610,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,,"['*Alkaline Phosphatase/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique/*standards', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques/*standards', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods/standards', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology']",1992/01/01 00:00,1992/01/01 00:01,['1992/01/01 00:00'],"['1992/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Haematol Pol. 1992;23(2):87-94.,,Porownanie klinicznej przydatnosci immunotypizacji bialaczek przy uzyciu metody immunofluorescencyjnej i immunoenzymatycznej APAAP.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty consecutive adult patients with newly achieved complete remission were randomized to receive postremission therapy either with or without PSL between September 1985 and September 1988. The patients ranged from 16 to 57 years in age. Patients treated without PSL had a significantly better 5-year survival rate than those receiving PSL according to Kaplan-Meier analysis (53.5% vs 15.3%, p < 0.05). In the group treated without PSL, eight out of 15 patients were alive at 72 months, and seven patients maintained their first complete remission at 72 months. Among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated without PSL the median duration of remission was 24 months, and the survival rate at 72 months was 50.0%. On the other hand, the median survival was only 13 months for the 5 patients with ALL treated with PSL. Thus, it is desirable that adults with acute leukemia are treated by postremission therapy without PSL.","['Kawamura, S', 'Tamai, Y', 'Akiyama, M', 'Sakamoto, J', 'Konuma, Y', 'Fukushima, K', 'Tsushima, K', 'Sawada, Y', 'Sakata, Y', 'Yoshida, Y']","['Kawamura S', 'Tamai Y', 'Akiyama M', 'Sakamoto J', 'Konuma Y', 'Fukushima K', 'Tsushima K', 'Sawada Y', 'Sakata Y', 'Yoshida Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Hirosaki University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,['9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1992/09/01 00:00,1992/09/01 00:01,['1992/09/01 00:00'],"['1992/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1992/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1992/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1620/tjem.168.21 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 1992 Sep;168(1):21-8. doi: 10.1620/tjem.168.21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
